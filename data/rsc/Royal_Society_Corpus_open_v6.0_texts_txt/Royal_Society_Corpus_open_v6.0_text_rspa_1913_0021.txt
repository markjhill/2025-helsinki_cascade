On the Spontaneous Crystallisation and the Melting- and Freezing-point Curves of two Substances which form Mixed Crystals and whose Freezing-point Curve exhibits a Transition Point.\#151 ; Mixtures of p-Bromnitrobenzene and p-Chlornitro-benzene .
By Miss Florence Isaac .
( Communicated by Sir Henry A. Miers , F.E.S. Received January 18 , \#151 ; Bead January 30 , 1913 .
) The following paper is a continuation of two previous papers in which the melting- and freezing-point curves for two pairs of substances , each of which forms mixed crystals , have already been determined .
In the first of these papers* mixtures of naphthalene and / 3-naphthol were examined and found to form a continuous series of mixed crystals and to give curves of Roozeboom 's Type I , in which the melting and freezing points of all mixtures lie between the melting points of the pure substances .
In the second paperf mixtures of azobenzene and benzylaniline were examined and found to form mixed crystals of two kinds , whose melting-and freezing-point curves exhibit a minimum or eutectic point ( Roozeboom 's Type Y ) .
The present paper deals with mixtures of a pair of substances\#151 ; p-brom-nitrobenzene and jp-chlornitrobenzene\#151 ; which form mixed crystals and give freezing-point and melting-point curves belonging to Type IV of Roozeboom , in which , though the melting and freezing points of all the mixtures lie between those of the pure substances , the curves show a break or discontinuity corresponding to the existence of two kinds of mixed crystals , as in Type V. * ' Journ.

Crystallisation , etc. , of two [ Jan. 18 , Mixtures of ^-bromnitrobenzene and ^-chlornitrobenzene have already been studied by Kremann* in a paper on isomorphous mixtures .
This author has traced the freezing-point curve for mixtures of these substances , and has shown that they form mixed crystals , and he also obtained five points lying on the melting-point curve .
Kremann obtained his freezing- and melting-point curves from observations made on the rate of cooling of various mixtures .
Liquid mixtures of known composition were allowed to cool , and a curve was obtained for each mixture by plotting temperature against time .
It was found that these cooling-curves showed two distinct kinks , one when crystallisation commenced and the second at what Kremann describes as the end of crystallisation .
From these cooling-curves Kremann obtained his freezing- and melting-point curves for the mixtures , the freezing-point curve or liquidus being given by the upper kinks , at which crystallisation started in the various mixtures , and the melting-point curve or solidus being given by the lower kinks , at which Kremann states that crystallisation ends .
In this manner he obtained curves of Roozeboom 's Type IY .
Since , however , he only obtained five points on the melting-point curve , none of which lie in the neighbourhood of the transition point , his curve is to some extent imaginary .
The following experiments were therefore undertaken with a view to verifying his results , and to determining a more complete set of melting points , and also in order to obtain the supersolubility curve or curve of spontaneous crystallisation for a series of mixtures of Roozeboom 's Type IY , in the same manner that this curve has already been obtained for mixtures of naphthalene with / 3-naphthol , and azobenzene with benzylaniline , which afford examples of Type I and Type Y respectively .
Crystalline Form of p-Bromnitrobenzene and p-Chlornitrobenzene .
Crystals of p-bromnitrobenzene have been examined by Fels , f who describes them as melting at 126 ' or 127 ' , and having a specific gravity of 1*934 at 22 ' , and states that p-bromnitrobenzene is isomorphous with p-chlornitrobenzene .
He obtained , from a solution in a mixture of acetone and ether , crystals which were colourless or slightly yellow , prismatic in the direction of the c-axis , and showing only n { 210 } and c { 001 } .
He found the crystals to be monoclinic , having a:b :c= 1*9336 : 1 : ?

] Substances which form Mixed Crystals , etc. 207 The extinction on a prism face was 22 ' .
He also states that a crystal of ^-bromnitrobenzene will continue to grow when placed in an alcoholic solution of ^-ehlornitrobenzene , and that crystals of the latter which form in the neighbourhood will arrange themselves parallel to the jp-bromnitro-benzene crystal introduced.* ^-Bromnitrobenzene has also been examined by Kekule , f who describes the crystals as needles having melting point 125 ' ; and by Fittig , * who describes the crystals as long colourless needles , line as a hair , slightly soluble in cold alcohol , and having melting point from 126 ' to 127 ' .
Fels also examined ^-chlornitrobenzeneS and obtained the melting point of this at 83 ' to 84 ' , and its specific gravity as 1*520 at 18 ' .
He found the crystals to be monoclinic , having a : b : c \#151 ; 1*9577 : 1 : 1*1203 ; = 97 ' 11 ' , the plane of the optic axes being ( 010 ) .
The crystals were colourless and prismatic in habit , showing the forms a{100 } , m{110 } , c{001 } , r{101 } .
When grown from alcohol they usually showed as end faces only { 101 } , whilst those grown from ether , acetone , or benzene showed the form { 001 } .
Since the crystals become dull quickly in the air , Fels states that the reflections are always poor .
The extinction angle on a prism face was here 16*5 ' .
^-Chlornitrobenzene has also been examined by Jungfieisch , || who obtained it in the form of large plates derived from a rhomboidal prism of 125^ ' , but without end faces .
Microscopic Examination of p-Bromnitrobenzene , ^p-Ghlornitrobenzene , and their Mixtures .
No goniometric measurements of ^-bromnitrobenzene and p-chlornitro-benzene were undertaken , but both substances were examined under the microscope while growing from solution on a microscope slide .
jp-Bromnitrobenzene , dissolved in a drop of alcohol , ether , or benzene on a slide under a cover-glass , gave fine feathery needles branching in all directions .
The needles showed no end faces , so no angles could be measured .
The extinction was inclined at 18 ' or 20 ' to the length of the needles .
In convergent light no optic axis could be seen , but only a dark brush crossing the field as the nicols revolved .

Crystallisation , etc. , of two [ Jan. 18 , acetone , gave under the same conditions crystals which grew in a feathery manner in long branching needles having straight extinction .
These needles had no end faces and therefore no measurable angles .
Examined in convergent light these needles showed an optic axis visible on the edge of the field .
The birefringence is positive , and the plane of the optic axes along the length of the needles .
This would correspond to the different habit of the two substances noted by Fels , the face a being only found on the chloro-compound .
A few experiments made with mixtures of these substances under the microscope yielded somewhat indefinite results , no angular measurements being possible since the crystal needles had no end faces , but they seemed to show that mixtures containing up to 27*5 per cent , of ^-bromnitrobenzene gave crystal needles showing the same straight extinction and the same optic axial figure as pure ^-chlornitrobenzene .
Mixtures having more than 27*5 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene , on the other hand , gave crystal needles having the oblique extinction ( about 20 ' ) of pure ^-bromnitrobenzene , and they also show no optic axis when viewed in convergent light .
These experiments would indicate therefore that a change of some sort probably occurs in the crystals growing from these mixtures at the composition 27*5 per cent , ^-bromnitrobenzene , 72*5 per cent , p-ehlornitrobenzene , and subsequent experiments to be described in this paper show that at this composition there is a break or change in direction in the freezing-point curve , which would indicate a change in the nature of the crystals .
The Freezing-point Curve .
Mixtures of ^-bromnitrobenzene and ^-chlornitrobenzene were examined .in sealed glass tubes , and the freezing point for each mixture was obtained by the method which has been already employed by the author in the papers referred to above .
Each tube was heated in an oil bath with glass windows until the contained mixture was completely melted ; it was then held outside the bath a few seconds to induce one or two small crystals to start growing .
The tube was then re-immersed in the oil bath and these small crystals watched while the temperature of the bath was varied until a temperature was attained at which equilibrium existed between the liquid and the small crystals , and this was taken as the freezing point of the mixture .
The following are the tabulated results obtained for the freezing points of the various mixtures examined :\#151 ; 1913 .

These correspond to two different sorts of mixed crystals , u and ft , two kinds being distinctly visible and having different melting points , at 87*7 ' and 84*5 ' respectively .
The crystals a , growing in the liquid mixture at the lower temperature ( 84-5 ' ) , are wide , transparent , quickly growing blades , and occur in all the mixtures having less than 30 per cent , of ^-bromnitro-benzene .
The crystals ft , which are in equilibrium with the liquid at 87*7 ' , are extremely fine small hair-like needles , growing very slowly .
In all mixtures containing over 30 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene , these very fine hair-like crystals only are to be seen .
Both sorts of crystals , a and ft , may be found also in a liquid mixture containing 27*5 per cent , of _p-bromnitro-benzene , but in this case they are both deposited at the same temperature and the existence of two sorts is therefore not so noticeable .
At this point , corresponding to 27*5 per cent , of ^-bromnitrobenzene , it will be seen that the freezing-point curve shows a break or transition point .
For mixtures containing above 27*5 per cent , of _p-bromnitrobenzene the freezing-point curve rises much more rapidly than for mixtures containing a smaller percentage , the curve for mixtures containing between 0 per cent , and 27*5 per cent , of _p-bromnitrobenzene being very flat and only rising by 2*5 ' .
210 Miss F. Isaac .
Crystallisation , etc. , of two [ Jan. 18 , It is to be expected that in the neighbourhood of this transition point the melting-point curve also will show discontinuity .
Comparing the values here obtained for points on the freezing-point curve with those observed by Kremann it will be seen that the new values are throughout somewhat higher than the old ones , although Kremann 's transition point was found to correspond to a mixture of almost the same composition as that obtained above .
Thus Kremann 's freezing points for mixtures with 100 , 70*8 , 39*6 , and 23*1 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene are 123 ' , 108 ' , 91*5 ' , and 84*5 ' respectively ; while the values here obtained for mixtures of the same composition are 124 ' , 111 ' , 93*3 ' , and 84*3 ' respectively .
This discrepancy may probably be due to slight supercooling having taken place before the first separation of crystals in Kremann 's cooling experiments .
The Melting-point Curve .
The freezing-point curve having been determined , an attempt was now made to fix the position of the melting-point curve for the same mixtures .
The method used was the same as that adopted in the case of mixtures of azobenzene and benzylaniline already referred to ( loc. cit. , p. 349 ) .
The same tubes of mixtures were , for the most part , used that had been used to determine the freezing-point curve .
The mixtures were heated until they were completely liquid , and they were then allowed to cool slowly in the bath until they had completely recrystallised , the crystals adhering to the sides of the tubes .
At least 24 hours were allowed , to enable the mixtures to solidify completely .
They were then heated again very steadily in the oil bath , and as the temperature rose the crystals were examined continually with a lens , until , when it had reached a certain point , some of the crystals in the tube began to look slightly sticky , and a further rise in the temperature of about half a degree caused a small stream of liquid to run down the sides of the tube .
The point at which melting was first observed was taken as the melting point of the mixture .
This method of obtaining the melting-point curve for mixed crystals has also been used by A. Stock.* This method may be expected to give satisfactory results in fixing the melting-point curve or solidus , since , according to the theory , when mixed crystals grow ' from a liquid mixture the crystals first deposited differ in composition from the original liquid ; but if solidification proceeds with sufficient slowness , the crystals approximate , as the temperature falls , more and more nearly in composition to the original liquid taken , until finally the last crystals which form should have the exact composition of the original liquid .
The method was found to give satisfactory results in the case of mixtures of azobenzene and benzyl* ' Ber .

The method , therefore , having been tested , there is no reason to doubt that the results described below for the melting-point curves of mixtures of p-bromnitrobenzene and p\gt ; -chlornitro-benzene are very approximately correct .
All the determinations have been very carefully made and each been repeated several times with concordant results .

Examination of the complete figure formed by the freezing- and melting-point curves for these mixtures shows that they form an example of Roozeboom 's fourth type of curves for mixed crystals .
The two branches AC and CB of the freezing-point curve or liquidus have each a corresponding melting-point curve or solidus , AD and EB respectively .
At the temperature 84-5 ' of the transition point C , two solid phases , a and / 3 , may exist in equilibrium with the liquid containing 27'5 per cent , of p-brom-nitrobenzene and 72-5 per cent , of p-chlornitrobenzene .
These two solid phases will contain respectively 30 and 60 per cent , of the bromo-eom-pound .
C is therefore an invariant point , and the transition from one series of crystals to the other , indicated by the horizontal line CDE , takes place at constant temperature .

Varying the composition of the liquid between the limits D and E will change only the relative proportion of the two phases , a and / 3 , without altering the composition of either .
Mixtures between C and D also first form / 3-crystals , but on cooling slightly past the transition point these are all converted into a-crystals .
It has been seen that for mixtures containing 0 to 27*5 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene the rise of temperature in the freezing-point curve is very slight , viz. only 2*5 ' .
According to the theory of mixed crystals of Roozeboom 's Type IV , addition of ^-bromnitrobenzene should raise the melting point of the mixture .
It may be seen , however , that for mixtures containing from 5 to 15 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene the melting points of the mixtures are actually slightly lowered by the addition of j9-bromnitro-benzene .
The lowering is , however , very slight , amounting nowhere to more than 0*6 ' .
This slight lowering cannot be accounted for otherwise than by the assumption that one or both of the substances may -contain some small quantity of impurity .
The melting points obtained for them , namely 124 ' and 82 ' , seem to indicate that - this may be the case , since Fels obtained 126 ' to 127 ' as the melting-point of p-bromnitrobenzene , and 83 ' to 84 ' as the melting point of p-chlornitrobenzene .
Comparing the results here obtained for the melting-point curve with the five melting points obtained by Kremann it will be seen that there is a wide discrepancy in the results .

In the experiments described in this paper it has been found that the mixtures cannot be regarded as completely solid until several hours after the crystals first appeared in the liquid ; and , as stated Q 2 214 Miss F. Isaac .
Crystallisation , etc. , of two [ Jan. 18 above , at least 24 hours were allowed to elapse before the melting point of any mixture was taken .
The Spontaneous Crystallisation of Mixtures of p-Bromnitrobenzene and p - Chiornitrobenzene .
Finally , the methods described in the previous papers have been applied to mixtures of p-bromnitrobenzene and ^-chlornitrobenzene , in order to trace their supersolubility curve or curve of spontaneous crystallisation .
The mixtures were enclosed in sealed glass tubes which also contained some fragments of corundum to produce friction , and the tubes were heated for some time in the oil bath and shaken thoroughly as the temperature of the bath was raised , until all trace of solid had disappeared .
After heating further to at least 10 ' above the freezing-point curve the temperature of the bath was allowed to fall very slowly , the oil being constantly agitated in order to keep its temperature uniform throughout .
Thermometers placed at top and bottom of bath showed this to be the case .
The tube containing each of the liquid mixtures was shaken continuously ( by hand ) in the bath as the oil cooled , until at a certain temperature a shower of very fine crystal needles suddenly appeared in the tube , and thickened very rapidly until the whole tube was opaque .
The temperature at which crystals first appeared in each tube was noted as the temperature of spontaneous crystallisation for that mixture .
The results are tabulated below , and from Percentage by weight of p .bromnitrobenzene in the mixture .

] Substances which form Mixed Crystals , etc. 215 them the complete supersolubility curve is obtained which is shown on the diagram .
The goniometric method of plotting the supersolubility curve from observations of the refractive index , which was used in the research on mixtures of azobenzene and benzylaniline , was not used for the present mixtures , since the high temperatures at which they crystallise render them unsuitable for use in the goniometer trough .
* An examination of the supersolubility curve as it appears on the diagram shows that it , too , exhibits a break or bend for mixtures containing from 27*5 per cent , to 30 per cent , of p-bromnitrobenzene , corresponding to the transition point on the freezing-point curve .
It follows the direction of the freezing-point curve very closely , lying about 4 ' below it on the right-hand side of the transition point , and about l|- ' below on the left-hand side of that point .
It lies entirely above the melting-point curve except just at both the extreme ends , when it crosses it .
In a paper by Vanstone* the author states that the freezing-point curves as usually obtained for mixed crystals from the rate of cooling are in reality the temperatures of spontaneous crystallisation .
This suggests that Kremann 's freezing-point curve , obtained from observations of the cooling-curves , might coincide with the supersolubility curve here obtained .
Comparison with Kremann 's figures shows , however , that his freezing-point curve lies between the freezing-point curve and the supersolubility curve , though on the whole it lies slightly nearer to the latter .
Thus it would appear that in Kremann 's experiments crystallisation started in a supersaturated mixture , but before the mixture actually arrived at the labile temperature .
This is what might have been expected , unless special care were taken to prevent inoculation of the mixture by a crystal germ , by enclosing the mixtures in sealed tubes or other means .
The bath used in all these experiments consists of a square-shaped copper vessel of sufficient depth to allow the sealed glass tubes to be completely immersed .
It was filled with cotton-seed oil and heated by means of a Bunsen burner placed immediately beneath it .
Two round plate-glass windows were inserted in the sides of the bath immediately opposite each other , and held in place by means of brass rings and screws .
The bath was illuminated by means of a ground-glass electric bulb placed behind one of the windows , and the crystals were examined as they grew in the tubes with a lens held at the opposite window .

216 Crystallisation of Substances which form Mixed Crystals .
Conclusions .
The results obtained in this paper may be briefly summarised .
1 .
p-Bromnitrobenzene , / \gt ; -chlornitrobenzene and their mixtures have-been optically examined under the microscope .
2 .
The freezing- and melting-point curves for these mixtures have been determined .
It has been found #that these substances form mixed crystals and give curves of Roozeboom 's Type IY .
The freezing-point curve shows two branches corresponding to two different sorts of mixed crystals and meeting in a transition point at 84*5 ' , for a mixture containing 27*5 per cent , of ^-bromnitrobenzene and 72*5 per cent , of ^-chlornitrobenzene .
The freezing-point curve was found to correspond very nearly to that already obtained by Kreeman for these mixtures , though Kremann 's curve lies somewhat below it .
The melting-point curve also shows two branches , corresponding to the two branches of the freezing-point curve , and on each of these a different kind of mixed crystal is in equilibrium with the liquid .
At the temperature marked by the dotted horizontal line , both sorts of mixed crystals may exist together in equilibrium with a liquid containing 27*5 per cent , of j9-bromnitrobenzene .
The melting-point curve here obtained differs widely from that obtained by Kremann , a large part of the curve lying considerably below the latter .
3 .
The supersolubility curve or curve of spontaneous crystallisation has been determined for these mixtures , and it has been found that each mixture possesses a definite temperature of spontaneous crystallisation .
This curve lies almost Completely between the melting- and freezing-point curves , and , like them , it shows a break in the neighbourhood of the transition point .
