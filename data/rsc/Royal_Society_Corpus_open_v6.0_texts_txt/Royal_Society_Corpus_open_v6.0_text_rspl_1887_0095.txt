In connection with an investigation on heat radiation which I have been carrying on for some time past , and on which I recently presented a communication to the Royal Society , I have had occasion to examine the important results obtained by Mr. Mortimer Evans on the radiation of light and heat from bright and dull surfaces when incandescent ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , * vol. 40 , 1886 , p. 207 ) ; and I have repeated and verified some of his experiments .
Mr. Evans experimented on carbon filaments of incandescent lamps ; and in calculating , for my own use , the resistances of the filaments at different degrees of incandescence I was led to an unexpected result , and hence to an investigation of which I desire just now to offer a preliminary notice .
In order to explain , it is necessary for me to state briefly the object and nature of Mr. Evans ' experiments .
Their object was the comparison of the radiation from surfaces having a bright , polished appearance with that from dull surfaces having the appearance of lampblack ; and he was led to an important practical conclusion as to the superior light-giving efficiency of the brilliant-looking filament .
For these comparisons the same filament was treated in such ways as to alter the surface from dull to bright and back again .
It was taken out of the glass globe for the purpose , and after treatment placed in a fresh globe , which was then exhausted .
The lamps thus constructed and reconstructed were tested at various candle-powers , the energy for each candle-power being determined .
The tables given in Mr. Evans ' paper show for the filaments in different conditions the potential and the current required to maintain different candle-powers from four candles upward .
Using his numbers , and supposing Ohm's* law to hold for the carbon filaments , I have calculated the resistances of the filaments at different candle-powers .
Two filaments used by Mr. Evans afforded satisfactory data for my calculations .
They are designated in his paper D , DD , DDD , and C , CO , CCC .
They had been treated in the following manner:\#151 ; The filaments D and C were " flashed " so as to have a dull surface with the appearance of lampblack .
DD and CC are the same filaments flashed so as to have a brilliant surface , which , though black , has something of the appearance of frosted silver .
DDD , CCC , are the same filaments again rendered dull as at first .
The following table shows the volts , amperes , and calculated resistances at the candle-powers given in the left-hand column:\#151 ; * I have already commenced an investigation into the question of the conformity of carbon filaments at different temperatures with Ohm 's law .

Taking the filament I ) and dividing the resistances of D , DD , and DDD at four candles by those at the higher candle-powers , we obtain numbers , which may be looked on as ratios of conductances , and which may be taken as indicating , though not exactly representing , corresponding changes in the temperature of the carbon .

The filament C gives confirmatory results , but unfortunately it seems to have broken down early in the condition 0C0 .
I find , however , \#151 ; Table IY .

1-047 1-081 1 -028 1-041 1043 Comparing these numbers we are led to the result that , if we admit the assumptions I have made , the temperature to which the carbon must be raised in order that it may give out light of a definite candle-power is higher when the surface is in the dull condition than when it is in a brilliant metallic-looking state .
This result was to me so unexpected that I proceeded to test it directly by the following experiments:\#151 ; Two glass tubes , similar in every respect , were constructed , containing two precisely similar platinum wires cut from the same hank , which had been specially drawn for me some months before by Messrs. Matthey and Johnson .
One of the wires was in its natural bright condition , while the other was covered with the thinnest possible coating of lampblack , which was put on by passing the wire quickly and steadily through the flame of a paraffin lamp .
The construction of these tubes is shown in fig. T. The platinum wire ab is kept stretched by two spiral Fie .

Two loops Z at the other extremities of the spirals pass over two pieces of glass rod gg , gg , which are passed in by side tubes , blown on to the main glass tube ; and the spirals pull on the glass rods .
The ends of the side tubes are sealed up after the glass rods are in their places , with the exception of one , which is used for connecting to the Sprengel pump , and is finally sealed when a complete 436 On Radiation from Dull and Bright Surfaces .
[ June 16 vacuum has been made .
Flexible copper electrodes , ee , are silver-soldered to the loops at the ends of the copper springs , and to multiple platinum wires which are sealed into the glass tube at A and B. Fine platinum wires , pp , are attached to the main wire , and are brought through the sides of the glass tube ; and these serve as potential testing electrodes .
The two tubes and their fittings are , as has been said , perfectly similar in every respect , except that one platinum wire is covered with an extremely thin coating of lampblack .
The two tubes were attached to a glass fork , and were simultaneously exhausted with the Sprengel pump down to about two millionths of an atmosphere , all the well-understood precautions as to drying , \amp ; c. , being carefully attended to ; and they were then at the same moment sealed off from the pump .
The length of the tubes AB is 22 inches over all ; and the internal diameter of the tubes f- inch .
The distance between the potential electrodes pp is 15 inches ( 38T centimetres ) .
The diameter of the platinum wire ah is 0-022 inch ( 0*0599 centimetre ) .
On testing the resistance of the two platinums between the potential electrodes , cold and at the same temperature , it -was found to be the same for both to less than one one-thousandth part of the resistance of either of them .
The tubes having been prepared as described above , they were connected in parallel arc to a battery of six secondary cells in series , a variable platinoid wire being added in series with the tube containing the bright platinum , in order to regulate its current ; and a rheostat designed for carrying strong currents was used to control the whole .
The connexions will be readily understood from a glance at fig. 2 .

With the rheostat and the variable platinoid wire the two platinums were then brought to the same incandescence ( as judged by the eye ) at various brightnesses from just visible redness up to nearly white heat ; and the resistances of the platinums between the potential 1887 .

437 electrodes were measured by means of a bigb resistance reflecting galvanometer , suitably arranged , with shunt and interposed resistance , for the purpose in hand .
The result of my experiments is to bear out completely the deduction which I had made from Mr. Mortimer Evans ' numbers ; and to show that the temperature which produces , for example , the appearance of a certain red heat , is very much higher wThen the surface of the heated body is dulled than wrhen it is bright as in a polished metal .
I am not yet prepared to give a definite numerical comparison ; but in order to show that the difference of temperatures referred to amounts to many degrees of temperature , I may be allowed to give the following statement .
The two wires being at the same dull red heat , which from previous experience I estimate at perhaps 600 ' C. , in the case of the brightsurfaced wire , the ratio of the resistance of the lamp-blacked platinum to the bright platinum was 130 : 93 .
Platinums differ very much as to variation of resistance with temperature ; but in most specimens the resistance is doubled , when the temperature is raised from 0 ' C. to a temperature of from 300Q C. to 400 ' C. ; and for any particular platinum wire the change in resistance is almost in simple proportion to the change in temperature .
From this statement it may be judged that the difference of temperatures between the two platinums , dull and bright , when giving out the same light , was a great many degrees centigrade .
The difference of temperatures of the two glass envelopes was also very striking .
The glass tube containing the bright wire was not even unpleasantly warm ; while in the case of the other it was so hot as to blister the skin of the hand ; and in this connection it is to be remembered that the vacuum in the two tubes was the same .
I propose as soon as possible to continue this investigation and render it more complete .
