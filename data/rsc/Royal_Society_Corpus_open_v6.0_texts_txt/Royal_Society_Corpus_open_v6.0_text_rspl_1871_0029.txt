109 sent in urine is , however , so small that the precise nature of this substance has not as yet been determined .
Finally , the author points out an apparent connexion between this substance and alcohol .
It was found that , after the elimination due to the ingestion of alcohol had ceased , the amount of this substance eliminated in a given time at first remained below the quantity normally excreted , and only gradually rose again to the normal standard .
A careful study of this connexion may perhaps serve to throw some light upon the physiological action of alcohol .

" On the Action of Low Temperatures on Supersaturated Solutions of Glauber 's Salt .
" By Charles Tomlinson , F.R.S. Received December 4 , 1871 .
When a solution of the ordinary ten-atom hydrate of sodic sulphate , saturated at about 93 ' F. , its maximum point of solubility , is boiled and filtered into a clean flask , which , being closed , is left to cool to 40 ' and under , a modified or seven-atom hydrate is formed at the bottom of the solution ; this increases in quantity as the temperature falls , and passes into solution as the temperature rises ; and , so far , the observation is supposed to be complete .
But if a supersaturated solution of Glauber 's salt be reduced from ordinary atmospheric temperatures to low ones by means of a freezing-mixture of snow and salt , the results obtained are so remarkable that I venture to think a short statement of them may be worthy of a place in the * Proceedings , ' by way of addenda to Section II .
of my second paper " On Supersaturated Saline Solutions , " contained in the Philosophical Transactions for 1871 , page 59 .
A solution of one part Glauber 's salt in one of water was boiled and filtered into a two-ounce flask that had been previously filled with strong nitric acid and well rinsed with clean water .
The solution was again boiled in this flask , into which a thermometer was passed , the stem being surrounded by several turns of lamp-cotton , which served to close the flask as soon as it was removed from the source of heat .
Next day the flask was put into a freezing-mixture at about 15 ' F. The solution slowly sank to 19 ' , when there was an abundant deposit of crystals of a peculiar opaque white , not like the transparent octahedra that are thrown down when these solutions cool to 40 ' and under , but very much like the octahedral crystals formed during the cooling of a strong solution of sal-ammoniac .
There were tufts of regular octahedra and fern-like crystalline forms .
During their formation the thermometer rose to 26 ' .
The flask was now transferred to water at 48 ' , when the opaque-white crystals broke up into an amorphous woolly mass .
As the temperature of the solution rose to 40 ' , then for the first time the usual transparent octahedra of the anhydrous salt Jell down .
Next day the XiO Mr. C. Tomlinson on Supersaturated [ Jan. 25 , flask was opened ; crystallization of the- ordinary salt set in from the surface , and the temperature rose from 44 ' to 65 ' .
Thus one more hydrate is added to those already known as belonging to this remarkable salt .
It doubtless contains less water than the seven-atom hydrate ; but I know of no method of testing its hydration , since its existence depends upon the low temperature , and shelter from the action of nuclei .
In this way it resembles the various hydrates described in my paper in the * Transactions.5 The solution was next made twice as strong as before , that is , two parts of Glauber 's salt were dissolved in one part of water , and after boiling and filtering and reboiling as before , the flask was set aside to cool .
When the thermometer marked 42 ' , the flask was put into the freezing-mixture At 38 ' a few transparent octahedra were thrown down , and the heat-currents thereby liberated delayed the cooling .
In fourteen minutes it reached 26 ' , and the transparent crystals at the bottom became opaque white .
The thermometer was stationary during some minutes at 26 ' , when it began again to descend ; but on agitating the flask in the freezing-mixture , crystals of the opaque-white salt were formed , and the temperature regained 26 ' , the solution above being bright and clear , and still supersaturated .
In a few minutes crystallization set in from the surface , and the thermometer rose from 26 ' to 53 ' , the whole being now solid .
These opaque crystals resemble in texture newly formed white lead ; and at whatever temperature they may be formed below 26 ' , their formation causes the thermometer to rise to 26 ' , and that , too , in solutions of 1 part , 2 parts , or 3 parts salt to one of water .
This opaque salt is sometimes amorphous , and then it covers the surface of the flask like thick whitewash .
This effect occurs when the flask is much agitated in the freezing-mixture .
The same flask ( 2 salt to 1 water ) was reboiled without any addition of water , so that the solution was really stronger than that indicated .
At 40 ' there was a fall of transparent anhydrous crystals .
The solution was now purposely cooled very slowly , so that in half an hour it descended only 3 ' , namely , to 37 ' .
There was now a considerable increase of the anhydrous salt so as to cover the bottom of the flask , and to rise a little way up the sides .
The flask was transferred to a freezing-mixture at 10 ' ; when at 33 ' the anhydrous salt became opaque , doubtless from the fixation of a portion of water less than that required for the formation of the seven-atom salt .
At 24 ' opaque tufts and fern-like crystals were formed .
At 22 ' there was a sudden and copious deposit of this opaque-white hydrate ; the thermometer rose to 26 ' , and then suddenly to 52 ' , when the whole mass was solid .
It is commonly supposed that the rise in temperature consequent on the solidification of a supersaturated solution is dependent on its mass ; that when this is considerable , the rise in temperature is so too , but that when the mass is small there is but little heating .
This does not accord HI 1872 .
] Solutions of Glauber 's Salt .
with my experience .
Not much more than half an ounce of a comparatively weak solution of Glauber 's salt , such as 1 salt to 1 water , may rise from 20 ' to 56 ' on suddenly becoming solid ; and with 2 or 3 salt to 1 of water the rise may not be greater , especially if a considerable mass of the two abnormal hydrates be already formed , and only a small portion of the solution remain to become solid .
In another experiment , 3 parts salt to 1 of water were boiled and filtered into two test-tubes and one 2-ounce flask .
One tube , on being put into the freezing-mixture , sank to 35 ' , when the solution suddenly became solid , and the thermometer rose to 78 ' .
The other tube-solution threw down so large a quantity of anhydrous crystals as to prevent the reading of the thermometer .
The solution in the flask threw down anhydrous crystals at 44 ' , and then sank very slowly to 40 ' , where it remained stationary upwards of ten minutes , in consequence of the liberation of heat-currents , occasionally rising to 41 ' .
A large quantity of transparent crystals was now heaped up on the bulb of the thermometer ; the temperature descended to 38 ' , with slight starts upwards ; and in slowly descending to 33 ' , there was a large increase of the transparent crystals .
At 32 ' the flask was transferred to a fresh freezing-mixture at 10 ' , and the solution slowly descended to 22 ' , when it was again removed to a fresh freezing-mixture , also at 10 ' .
Soon a number of large fern-like crystals covered the side of the flask , starting , apparently , from the top of the copious deposit first produced , and rendering the upper part opaque in a well-defined line .
The temperature rose to 26D , and continued there some minutes , when the solution suddenly crystallized , and the thermometer rose to 48 ' .
Supersaturated solutions of potash ahim , exposed to low temperatures , behave much in the same way as the solutions of double salts described in my former paper .
A solution of 300 grains of the salt in H oz. of water , boiled and filtered into clean test-tubes , and , when cold , put into a freezing-mixture at about 0 ' F. , displays the beautiful ivy-leaf kind of foliage , of a brilliant white colour , already referred to .
The growth starts from the bottom or from the surface of the solution , or from both , and soon the whole solution becomes solid .
If the tube be put into water at 32 ' , the solid rapidly melts , and the liquid is a clear bright supersaturated solution as before .
Lowel , in his first memoir ( An. de Ch. et de Ph. 3 serie , tome xxix .
) , found that when supersaturated solutions of Glauber 's salt , in sealed tubes , were subjected to temperatures varying from \#151 ; 8 ' to \#151 ; 10'C .
, they often froze and burst the tubes .
In one case , where the tube did not burst , the solution , in thawing , caused the state of supersaturation to cease .
In another case the frozen solution thawed , and the liquor became supersaturated as before .
Bowel could not reproduce this last effect , nor explain why the thawing should lead to the formation of the ten-atom salt .
But as he did not know the conditions of clean and unclean , he was constantly looking out for some catalytic action in the sides of his vessels to explain the many ] 12 Presents .
[ Dec. 7 , \#171 ; anomalous cases that occurred to him consequent on the use of vessels not chemically clean .
Among the numerous writers on the subject of supersaturation , I know of none that has noticed the formation of the second modified hydrate of sodic sulphate except M. Yiollette , who , in a " Memoire sur la Sursatura-tion " contained in the * Annales Scientifiques de l'Ecole Normale Superi-eure " ( tome troisikme ann^e , 1866 ) , refers in about a dozen words , p.223 , to the formation of another hydrate , " qui cristallise ' difficilement en forme de choux-fleurs , " Presents received D7,1871 .
