An Arithmetical Paradox , concerning the Chances of Lotteries , by the Honourable Francis Roberts , Esq ; Fellow of the R. S. AS some Truths ( like the Axioms of Geometry and Metaphysicks ) are self-evident at the first View , so there are others no less certain in their Foundation , that have a very different Aspect , and without a strict and careful Examination rather seem repugnant .
We may find Instances of this kind in most Sciences .
In Geometry , That a Body of an infinite Length may yet have but a finite Magnitude .
In Geography , That if Antwerp be due East to London , for that reason London cannot be West to Antwerp .
In Astronomy , That at the Barbadoes ( and other places between the Line and Tropic ) the Sun , part of the Year , comes twice in a Morning to some Points of the Compass .
In Hydrostaticks , That a hollow Cone ( standing upon its Basis ) being filled with Water , the Water shall press the bottom with three times the Weight , as if the same Water was frozen to Ice ; and Figures might be contrived to make it press a hundred times as much .
These Speculations , as they are generally pleasant , so they may also be of good use to warn us of the Mistakes we are liable to , by careless and superficial reasoning .
I shall add one Instance in Arithmetic , which perhaps may seem as great a Paradox as any of the former .
There are two Lotteries , at either of which a Gamester paying a Shilling for a Lot or Throw ; the First Lottery upon a just Computation of the Odds has 3 to 1 of the Gamester , the Second Lottery but 2 to 1 ; nevertheless the Gamester has the very same disadvantage ( and no more ) in playing at the First Lottery as the Second .
It looks very like a Contradiction , that the Disadvantage should be no greater in playing against 3 to 1 than 2 to 1 , but it may thus be resolved .
1st .
Lottery con3 Blanks 3 Prizes 16 pence Let the a piece .
sist of and of 2d .
422 shill .
In the first Lottery the Gamester hazards a Shilling to win a Groat , and the Chances being equal , it is evident there is 3 to one against him .
In the Second Lottery the Gamester ventures a Shilling against a Shilling , and the Lots being 4 to 2 , his Disadvantage is 2 to 1 .
And a Lot at either of them being truly worth just 8 Pence , ( viz. the 6th part of 3 times 16 Pence , or twice 2 Shillings ) the Disadvantage must be the very same in both Cases , that is , the Gamester pays a Shillingling for a Lot that is worth but 8 Pence .
The Method of finding this Answer being somewhat out of the common Road , I shall here add it , and thereby infinite Solutions of the same kind may be discovered .
1st Lottery .
2d Lottery .
Let a=the number of Blanks .
m=the number of Blanks b= the number of Prizes .
n =the number of Prizes r= the Value of a Prize .
s =the value of a Prize .
1= to what you pay for a Lot , viz. a Shilling .
So the Lottery has it 's Chances for 1 , and the Gamester his for r 1 .
Now the true Odds consisting of the compounded Proportion of the Chances and the Values , viz. a/ b and 1/ r-1 , the Share of the Lottery will be a , and that of the Gamester rb b. Therefore as the present case stands , the first Lottery must be a=3rb 3b , and by the like reasoning the second Lottery will be m=2s n-2 n. Now the Value of a Lot being the Sum of the Prizes divided by the number of Lots , ( which must be equal in both L'otteries ) it yields r b/ a+b =s n/ m+n .
So to proceed .
