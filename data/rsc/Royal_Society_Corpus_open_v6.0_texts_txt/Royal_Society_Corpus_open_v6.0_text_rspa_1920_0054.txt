]\gt ; Monoclinic Double Selenates of the ] By A. E. H. TUTTON , D.SG .
, M.A. , F.B.S. ( Received June 2 , 1920 .
) This memoir deals with the four double selenates of the series , in which is ] ) and is potassium , rubidium , caesium , and amlnonium .
Only the potassium and anllloninm salts of this copper group have been hitherto investigated .
Their crystals were measured by Haldor and their optical properties were partially investigated by and Christiansen .
The selenic employed was prepared specially for this investigation by Messrs. } ) and Williams , and the author 's thanks are due to Mr. Edmund White for undertaking and successfully the preparation , which has proved to be of remarkable purity and eminently suitable for this research .
The copper selenate required was prepared by precipitating a known quantity of copper hydrate from a solution of pure copper sulphate , by means of only a very slight excess of pure sodium hydrate solution , and it , after very complete and washing , in the calculated quantity of the selenic acid .
The potassium and ammonium selenates used were part of a large stock previously ) repared for the investigation of those salts .
The rubidium and caesium selenates were prepared by dissolving the pure carbonates of the two metals in selenic acid , boiling off carbon dioxide and .
To prepare the double salts , solutions of the alculated molecular quantities of the two constitueut simple salts were mixed , in the presence of one drop of excess of selenic acid .
The solutions were first concentrated to the metastable condition without heating , and they then deposited cventnally in all cases the required hexahydrated crystals of the double selenates of the copper group .
Some crops were affected by more or less opacity of the crystals , but a sufficient number of excellent crops were obtained comparatively free from this defect ( and with numerous individual stals entirely limpid ) , to which these copper salts are somewhat prone .
The crystals of all four double salts possess a light blue colour .

Many crops consist of simple monoclinic six-faced blocks , formed by the two forms and , very htly modified by small faces of and Other crops , however , consist of crystals on which , besides the above four forms , minute faces of a considerable number of other forms are present .
Crops consisting of somewhat large crystals are especially rich in faces .
On some of these crystals the prism formed quite broad strips , and the primary orthopinakoid was often likewise quite prominent , these features clearly exhibited on the typical crystal represented in fig. 1 .
Both and , and also have been occasionally found well developed , but , and were .
all exhibited only as very small or faces .
On the whole , however , this salt affords crystals which are richer in faces than has usually been the case with other members of the double selenate series , such , for instance , as the cobalt group described last year .
* It is that potassium copper sulphate was also observed to be exceptionally rich in faces .

Habit.\mdash ; The crystals of the potassium , rubidium , and caesium salts of this large double selenate and double sulphate series of isomorphous salts have throughout been shown to exhibit characteristic habits of a very Dr. A. E. H. Tutton .
definite kind , and in this copper group the three specific types are clearly exhibited .
They are formed by the relative development of the basal pinakoid and clinodomal prism , the former largely predominating in the potassium salt and the latter in the caesium salt , while in the rubidium salt the two forms are more or less equally developed , the habit of this salt being thus very clearly of intermediate character .
The crystals of the ammonium salt are usually very much like those of the intermediate rubidium salt , but the limits are wider , the type shown by the potassium salt being also frequently approached in different individuals , and the caesium salt type more rarely .
Crystal Elements and Angles.\mdash ; The monoclinic axial angle for rubidium copper selenate is thus approximately the mean of the corresponding axial angles for the potassium and caesium salts .
The axial angle of ammonium copper selenate is nearly identical with that of .
caesium copper selenate .
The morphological axial ratios of the rubidium salt are likewise intermediate between the analogous ratios for the potassium and caesium salts .
* The axial ratios of the ammonium salt are close enough to those of all three alkali metallic salts to indicate true isomorphism .
From the comparative Table on the next page , of 38 measured , the salient fact is derived that the whole of the angles of the rubidium salt are intermediate between those of the potassium and caesium salts ( except for which the angle remains identical ) .
Analysis of the Table shows that the average and maximum changes of are twice as great when potassium is replaced by caesium , as they are when potassium is replaced by rubidium .
The average and maximum changes of interfacial angle are thus directly proportional to the change in atomic weight or atomic number .
* Thus both as regards the axial angle and the axial ratios the constants follow the order of the atomic weights and atomic numbers of the alkali metals Atomic weights : , Bb , Cs Atomic numbers , Rb Cs Monoclinic Double Setenates of the Copper Group .
Comparison of the Inte facial Angles .
: : The average and maximum changes of angle occurring when ammonium is introduced instead of potassium are seen to be intermediate between the amounts caused by introducing rubidium and caesium respectively .
In 33 of the 38 compared angles , the change on replacing potassium by ammonium is in the same direction as when potassium is replaced by Dr. A. E. H. Tutton .
rubidium or caesium ; of these 33 angles , 24 show larger changes for the rubidium replacement , and in 10 of the whole 38 compared angles the change is greater even than when caesium is introduced instead of potassium .
The ] largest ( absolute maximum ) change of angle for the whole group of four salts is which occurs in the case of one angle , , when potassium in potassium copper selenate is replaced by CiPsium , or vice versed .
This angle also showed the maximum change of in the cobalt group .
On comparing the table of crystal-angles for this group with that of the other groups studied , it is observed that the absolute values of the angles are generally distinctly different , often to the extent of half a degree , and occasionally by a whole degree .
In this the copper group shows its individuality .
Yet the relations between the values for the four salts are exactly those exhibited by the other groups .
Hence the esults for the copper group are particularly valuable .
Volume Constants of the Copper Group of Double Selenates .
The density increases with the molecular weight , the changes for the respective replacements of by Bb and Bb by Cs being as 5 : 4 , the effect thus diminishing as the mass grows .
The ammonium salt is naturally much the lightest member of the roup .
The molecular volume of the three alkali metallic salts increases at an accelerating rate , as the atomic weight or atomic number rises , the amount for the two changes of metal being and respectively .
The molecular volume of ammonium copper selenate is close to ( higher than ) that of rubidium copper selenate , a result as regards the ammonium and rubidium salts which has always been observed throughout the series .
There is naturally an increase in the molecular volume on replacing sulphur ( atomic number 16 ) by selenium ( atomic number 34 ) , and as there are two atoms of sulphur or selenium in the molecule of the double salt , we obtain the increase per atom by subtracting the molecular volume of the double sulphate from that of the double selenate and dividing by two .
The results of this operation , for the analogous salts of all the six pairs of Monoclinic Double of the Copper Group .
groups of monoclinic double salts yet completely investigated , are given in the next Table .
The results per atom for the simple sulphates and selenates are also added for comparison .
Increase of Molecular Volume on by Se .
The cop per group here again shows its individuality by affording a somewhat higher range of change in the molecular volume than is exhibited in the other groups .
The molecular distance ( topic axial ) ratios of the rubidium salt are intermediate between those for the potassium and caesium salts , the axial or edge dimensions of the monoclinic elementary cell of the space-lattice thus increasing progressively with the atomic weight or atomic number of the alkali metal .
These constants for the ammonium salt are similar to those for the rubidium salt , two of the three dimensions being slightly less , and the third somewhat greater , the balance corresponding to the very slight increase in the molecular volume of the ammonium salt as compared with that containing rubidium .
Cleavage.\mdash ; There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the orthopinakoid in the crystals of all four salts .
This is the common cleavage direction of the whole series of double sulphates and selenates .
In addition , however , all four salts of this copper group have been observed to cleave with considerable facility parallel to the clinopinakoid Orientation of Optical Ellipsoid.\mdash ; The position of the ellipsoid is conveniently determined by giving the position for a specific wave-length of that one of its two rectangular axes lying in the symmetry plane which is not far removed from the vertical crystal axis ; it is the axis of the indicatrix for all the salts , and the first median line for the potassium and ammonium salts , but the second median line for the rubidium and caesium salts .

selenate . . . .
RbCu CsCu Dr. A. E. H. Tutton .
Thus in the crystals of the salts containing the three alkali metals the ellipsoid is situated so that this axis is further and further removed from the vertical axis as the atomic weight or atomic number of the ] metal increases .
The ellipsoid thus rotates about the fixed symmetry axis when one alkali metal is exchanged for another , and progressively at an accelerating rate , following the ascending order of the atomic weights or atomic numbers of the interchanged metals .
In the case of the ammonium salt the position of this axis is a nearer to the vertical axis than for the potassium salt .
Its position for each of the four salts now under consideration is graphically indicated in fig. 10 , which shows the progression in the case of the metallic salts very clearly .
The positions of the axis are more forwards than for the other groups , a fact also shown by the copper double sulphates .
The progressive relations are , however , the same .
Optic Axial Angles.\mdash ; The plane of symmetry is the common plane of the optic axes for the whole group .
In the cases of the rubidium and caesium salts the sign of the double refraction is positive , and the first median line is the axis of the indicatrix lying in the symmetry plane not very far lemoved from the inclined crystal axis .
In the cases of the potassium and ammonium salts , hcwever , the double refraction is negative , which is uncommon in the series , and the first median lin is the axis of the indicatrix , lying very close to the normal to Optic Axial Angles of the Copper Group of Double Selenates .
The optic axial angle is thus seen Co decrease with the atomic weight or atomic number of the alkali metal , the value for the rubidium salt being intermediate , but much nearer to that of the caesium salt .
The optic axial Monoclinic Double of the Copper Group .
angle of ammonium copper selenate comes between those for the potassium and rubidium salts , and quite close to that of the latter salt .
Refractic Comparison of the Refractive Indices .
The refractive indices have throughout the series exhibited a progressive increase , as potassium is replaced by rubidium , and the latter in turn by caesium , the last-mentioned being the greater .
In of the groups , however , the oppositely progressive effect of the diminution of double refraction has more than neutralised the progression in refractive index as ards the maximum index in the case of the rubidium salt , so that this index for the rubidium salt has been rendered slightly lower than that for the porassium salt .
In this copper group the effect is further aided by the fact that the sign of the double refi.action is by exception ative in the potassium salt , while positive as usual in the series for the rubidium and caesium salts ; the intermediate index of the rubidium salt is thus very close to the minimum index of that salt , while in the case of the potassium salt the index is nearer to the index , as required by negative double refraction .
Moreover , as the optic axial angle of the ubidium salt is very small , the indices and are quite exceptionally close together .
All these effects combine not only to neutralise the usual ression in Dr. A. E. H. Tutton .
refractive index , but actually to render the and indices of the rubidium salt less than those for the potassium salt .
The progression is clearly apparent , however , when the caesium salt is reached .
In this copper group also , the refractive indices of the ammonium salt are nearer to those of the caesium salt than usual , and owing to the ammonium salt being negative in double refraction , and with a very small optic axial angle which brings the indices very close to the indices , the indices of the ammonium salt are even somewhat larger than those of the caesium salt .
Tn these exceptional facts the copper group again shows its individuality , quite subsidiary phenomena affecting the usual clear progression .
Double Refraction.\mdash ; The usual marked diminishing progression , with atomic weight or atomic number of the alkali metal , which has been observed throughout the series as regards double refraction , , is very clearly exhibited by the copper group .
The value for the ammonium salt is intermediate between the values for the potassium and rubidium salts , whereas for the other groups it has lain between the rubidium and caesium salt values .
In all these properties , however , the ammonium salt behaves exactly in accordance with the assumption that it is a member of the isomorphous group , the values being very similar to those for the alkali metallic salts .
Axial Batios of tloe Opiical \mdash ; The second set on the right in the Table , in which the total change in the dimensions of each of the three axes of the optical indicatrix ( ellipsoid ) is expressed , on passing from one salt to another , exhibits clearly the facts referred to under the heading of Refractive Indices .
These ratios are directly proportional to the refractive index , and for the second set the value for the potassium salt is taken as unit for all four salts .

The very important constant molecular refraction thus shows clearly the l.eal progression in refractive power which accompanies the change in the atomic weight or atomic number of the interchangeable alkali metals , removed from the causes referred to under the heading Indices .
The change is an accelerating one , the difference between the values for the rubidium and caesium salts being greater than that between the potassium and rubidium salts .
The conclusion is independent of temperature , similar effects being observed for change of temperature with both density and refractive index .

The molecular refraction of ammonium copper selenate is not far.removed from that of the rubidium salt , although the slight difference ( on the higher side ) in the case of the axis of the indicatrix is somewhat greater in this copper group than has usually been observed throughout the series , owing to the two being of opposite signs of double refraction , which separates unduly the values opposite sides mean , between .
On these values of the molecular refraction for the copper roup of double selenates with the analogous copper double sulphates , it is found that the selenate values are higher by to Lorenz units , or to Gladstone units .
by two , the number of sulphur or selenium atoms present in the molecule , this ives 3 to Lorenz units , or to Gladstone units , for the increase per atom , when sulphur is replaced by the heavier selenium .
The following Table shows how this accords with similar results from the other groups of salts studied .

The copper group again itself by a greater wideness between the limits .
The mean result is about the same , however , as for the other groups studied .
Concluding Remccr ks .
The general results for this copper roup of double selenates confirm those previously established for the nesium , zinc , iron , nickel , and cobalt groups , and for all the analogous double sulphates , and in a peculiarly valuable manner .
For it has been shown with regard to most of the crystallographic ( morphological and physical ) properties dealt with , that the absolute values of the constants expressing them are considerably different from those for the other groups ( in this respect resembling the results for the copper group of double sulphates ) , and yet the relationships are remarkably similar .
The same progression according to the atomic weight or atomic number of the interchangeable alkali metals , potassium , rubidium , and caesium , which by their interchange give rise to three of the four salts , is exhibited with respect to every property .
And the similarity of the fourth Arc in vacuo and in Helium .
5 salt of the group , that of the radicle base ammonium , to the rubidium salt , in regard to molecular volume and the constants involving it\mdash ; the topic axial ( molecular distance ) ratios and the molecular retraction\mdash ; again indicates the closeness to isostructure of the crystals of the ammonium and rubidium salts .
The further progress made since the author 's last memoir ( on the cobalt group loc. cit on the structure of the atom , and the further elucidation of the real of Moseley 's law which has followed therefrom , have but further confirmed and explained the fact that the author 's results are the natural consequence of that law , and of the progressive constructive complexity of the atoms of the elements which by their interchange give rise to the isomorphous series .
The author 's next communication will include the description of the manganese and cadmium roups of double selenates , and will form the concluding memoir of this long series of investigations , which will have included 75 salts , and it will mark the completion of the extensive research which the author proposed to himself and commenced in the year 1890 .

] I. Introduction .
The rapid progress in recent years in the investigation of voltages and resonance potentials in metallic vapours and in their relation to certain spectral series , which for many elements lie in the extreme ultraviolet region of the spectrum , makes it of great importance to obtain as extensive and as accurate as possible a knowledge of the ultra-violet spectra of the elements .
A stimulus has been given to this work by the recent research of Foot , Roguley , and Mohler , the ionisation potential of thallium vapour , and by that of Mohler , oote , and Stinson , on the ionisation potential of lead vapour .
