( Abstract .
) Jacobi discovered the theorem that a fluid ellipsoid revolving with uniform angular velocity round its least axis might be in equilibrium .
Ivory discussed the theorem , and made several statements regarding the limitations of the proportions of the axis .
Ivory 's statements contain various errors and truths based on erroneous reasoning .
The object of the present memoir is to correct Ivory 's errors , to supply his imperfections , and to add something to what is already known respecting the theorem .
