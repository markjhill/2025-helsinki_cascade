The above show that the parabolic form seems to be followed , but owing to the want of absolute uniformity in all parts of a photographic plate , and that errors may arise from want of exact exposure , and , again , from reading the densities , the values obtained are not so accordant as those taken by the visual method .
V. " On the Detonating Bolide of November 20th , 1887 .
" By G. J. Symons , F.R.S. Received December 8 , 1887 .
Shortly after November 20th it was generally reported that an earthquake shock had been felt in the South Midland counties of England , and the author began to collect and examine the facts .
It appeared that the records from Oxfordshire , and the western stations generally , indicated that much louder sounds were heard there than at the eastern stations , e.g. , Essex and Cambridge .
The author thought that , although the phenomenon had been almost universally ascribed to an earthquake , it was more probably due to an explosive bolide , and on receiving from one of the local scientific societies a request for assistance in tracing the shock , the author suggested the alternative explanation .
Mr. Fordham has subsequently written to say that he has already found one person who saw the meteor from Hertford , which he describes as " a brilliantly luminous body travelling across the sky from N.E. to W. " It is further stated that a portion of the meteor was seen to fall from the main body .
Considering that the morning , as shown by the records of the Royal Meteorological Society , was both misty and cloudy , and that at the hour at which it appeared , Sunday morning , 8.20 a.m. , there would be broad daylight , it is improbable that many persons saw it .
Judging by the descriptions of the noise , as well as by the path roughly indicated by the Hertford observation , it seems likely that it exPresent* .
[ Dec. 8 , ploded over the south , of Oxfordshire\#151 ; but further details are much wanted .
The meteor must apparently have been very large , as the explosion was heard or felt over an area of upwards of 2000 square miles\#151 ; the area being 84 miles in length , from about S.W. to N.E. , from the confines of Wiltshire to Newmarket , Cambridgeshire , and of an average breadth of about 25 miles .
The sites whence returns have been received are shown on the annexed map .
