On the effects produced by Poisonous Fish on the Human Frame .
" By Sir William Burnett , M.D. , K.C.H. , Vice-President of the Royal Society .
The author communicates a report which he lately received from Mr. Jameson , the surgeon of the flag ship at the Cape of Good Hope , of the rapidly fatal consequences ensuing from eating small portions of the liver of a fish , known at the Cape by the name of the Bladder or Toad fish , the Aptodactylus punctatus , or Tetrodon of Cuvier .
The symptoms were chiefly pain and burning sensation at the epigastrium , constriction and spasm of the fauces and muscles of deglutition , rigidity of the tendons , coma , paralysis and convulsions , following one another in quick succession , and terminating in death within twenty minutes after the poisonous food had been taken .
Several other instances of the same kind are next related ; and a narrative is subjoined of the case of a seaman who lost his life , with similar symptoms , from the bite of a water snake in Madras roads ; the Coluber laticaudatus of Linnleus ( Hydrus colubrinus of Shaw ) ; and also of a ship 's company who were all severely affected by eating portions of a large Banacuda ( Perca major ) .
The author ascribes the symptoms induced by these deleterious substances to their action on the nervous system alone , there being evidence of congestion only , but not of inflammation , in the stomach and other viscera .
