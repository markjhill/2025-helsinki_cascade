Section I.\#151 ; The results obtained in our former communication on the " Electric Conductivity* of Solutions of Nitric Acid " have led us to continue our investigations upon other physical properties of the same substance , partly with a view of confirming our conclusions , and partly also because previous observations on firstly , the refractive indices of samples of varied concentration , and secondly , the contractions on admixture of the acid with water , are comparatively few .
The conclusions , at which we previously arrived , were that the values of the electric conductivities to a less degree , and the electric temperature coefficients to a greater degree , varied at percentage points approximately corresponding to the composition required by the hydrates HN03.3H20 , HN03.2H20 , HN03.H20 , and 2HN03.H20 ; the two latter being the analogues of orthophosphoric H3P04 and pyrophosphoric acid H4P20r respectively .
It was further shown that acid of 96\#151 ; 99-7 per cent , concentration showed remarkable peculiarities , and the suggestion was put forward by others and ourselves that an initial decomposition into water and nitric anhydride takes place .
In the present work determinations were at first made both of the refractive indices and densities for percentage differences of approximately 5 per cent. ; a rough curve was then drawn , and from any indications given of marked variations of curvature , observations were more especially multiplied on either side of points which might be regarded as critical .
As regards the division of labour , the former of us is mainly responsible for the contraction and analytical determinations , the latter for the optical measurements and the apparatus connected therewith .
The work was conducted partly in the Chemical Department of the University Museum and partly in the Laboratory of Magdalen College .
Lastly we desire to express our thanks to the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society for apparatus purchased or lent ; to the Chemical Department of the University Museum for loan of instruments ; to Mr. E. H. Hayes , of New^College , for assistance in verifying and correcting calculations .

Mendeleef * from results , the source of which is not quoted , has put forward three equations to represent the densities d in terms of percentage p as follows :\#151 ; From 0 to 41 *2 per cent. ( HN03 5H.\gt ; 0 ) : d = 9992 + 57 .

From 63-63 to 100 per cent. : d =10652 +62-08p-0-16/ 2 .
( Density of water at 4 ' = 10000 .
) It was found , however , that the differences between the observed and calculated values were greatly in excess of those which could be accounted for by errors of observation .
Pickering , !
by the application of curves to the results of BerthelotJ for the heats of the dissolution and of Kolb for the specific gravities , deduced the existence of and isolated in a crystalline form the two hydrates ffisr033H20 and HN03.H20 .
He also alludes to a minor alteration of properties at 18\#151 ; 20 per cent. , but without drawing any conclusions therefrom , and to the fact that the maximum contraction coincides with the composition of a definite hydrate .
Al.\#151 ; Purification of Materials and Preparation of Stock Samples .
The methods of purification have been fully described in our previous communications , and our experience has as yet pointed to no improvement , though we have had occasion from time to time to confirm the observations of others , working at other times and places , as to the persistent retention of some ammoniacal compound in ordinary distilled water .
Continued experience has shown that by the methods adopted for the purification of nitric acid , the amount of nitrous , sulphuric , and halogen acids did not exceed 1 , 4 , and 3 parts per million respectively , quantities which may fairly be presumed to have no effect upon the physical constants .

IY.\#151 ; Determination of the Concentration of the Samples .
It is believed that in the majority of cases the mean error does not greatly exceed one part per thousand .
In every case the determinations of the concentration of the samples were conducted either immediately before or after those of the densities or refractive indices , as the most concentrated acid is as hygroscopic a substance as sulphuric acid .
In order to show the degree of concordance obtainable from various methods the following cases may be cited .
The value of a certain soda solution was determined at constant temperature as against a certain hydrochloric-acid solution ; using variable quantities five values were obtained with a mean error of \#177 ; 1 part in 2844 parts , calculated by the method of least squares .
The hydrochloric acid solution had previously been standardised on two different occasions ; at one time as against recrystallised silver nitrate and purified sodium carbonate , and at the other against another sample of silver nitrate of presumably different past history ; the mean error by the one method was \#177 ; 1 part in 1850 parts , and the total mean error by the two methods was \#177 ; 1 part in 1298 parts .
The same solution was determined twice as against a certain sulphuric acid solution , the value of which was ascertained by determining its density at 15'/ 4 ' , ascertaining its percentage strength by interpolation from Pickering 's tables , and hence the amount of acid in 1 c.c. The results of all the determinations may be summarised as follows , and expressed as nitric acid equivalent to soda in 1 c.c. ( i. ) By hydrochloric acid method = O'06136 gramme ( ii .
) By sulphuric " " = 0'06144 " Mean ... ... ... 0'06140 " Namely , a mean error of \#177 ; 1 part in 1533 parts .
By soda it is desired to imply alkalinity only ; the metallic sodium used for its preparation might have and probably did contain small quantities of other alkaline metals , but as such soda solutions merely served as go-betweens to express the one acid in terms of the other two the possible effect of such impurities is thereby eliminated .
Attention has recently been drawn to errors in burettes , not only by the Reichsanstalt of Berlin but also by individual writers , especially Wagner ; * these errors may be summed up as those of ( i ) Parallax , ( ii ) temperature , and ( iii ) drainage .
The last of these varies , of course , with the length drained , the viscosity of the solution , and the often wholly unknown condition of the cleanliness of the glass .

Some Physical Properties of Nitric Acid Solutions .
89 The cause of greasiness in burettes , a perpetual source of trouble in accurate work , has been discussed by various writers , and attributed by them to oils or fats in the distilled water derived from the lubricating materials of the still ( Ostwald ) , or to the vaseline , \amp ; c. , used for lubricating the stop-cock .
Though probably both causes may be at work , yet we consider that this greasiness is produced also by slime-forming bacteria or hypomycetes , especially Dematium , the spores of which settle and develop on the sides of the vessel ; our experience has shown that if the air sucked in by the outflowing solution be filtered through cotton-wool plugs , and if the burette be filled invariably from below , and not , as is customary , from above , its state of cleanliness may be greatly prolonged .
The first table of specific gravities of nitric acid in terms of percentages was constructed by Kirwan ; * subsequent tables were published by Ur , f Thenard and Kolb .
} The numbers given by the last are still reproduced more or less fully in text-books of chemistry and physics , though it is now generally admitted that his results for the more concentrated acids are too low .
But as a considerable advance over previous writers , Kolb pointed out , firstly , that the presence of the lower oxides of nitrogen alters appreciably the value of the density ; secondly , that acid of approximately 100 per cent , concentration has a high coefficient of expansion ; and thirdly , that the maximum contraction on admixture with water occurs at the percentage composition required for the hydrate HN03.3H.20 .
Upon the last result Kolb expressed himself as follows : " Ce fait d'un maximum de contraction correspondant exactement a un melange en proportions definies n'est pas un effect du hasard .
" The most recent work upon the densities is that published by Lunge and Rey , S which is now more generally quoted in technical manuals .
The analytical methods of these last writers are similar in outline to those herein adopted , but their final process of purification consisted in distilling the concentrated acid with sulphuric acid in vacuo , a method which might cause slight contamination , as the vapour pressure of the latter acid under these conditions could not be an insignificant quantity .
The densities were determined for 15'/ 4 ' , but it is not evident as to those actually made , and those interpolated in order to reduce the values to the commercial scale of Twaddell ; further , the results are only taken to O'OOl , which is far within the limits of accuracy attainable .

of corrections for ( i ) percentage proportion of nitrogen peroxide , and ( ii ) variations of temperature .
These writers further pointed out that if the values for the densities of acids above 70 per cent , be represented in terms of percentages , such values lie upon a curve and not a straight line , as indicated by the determinations of Kolb .
Various isolated determinations of acids of various strength have been published by Kohlrausch and Perkin for special purposes in the course of investigations on electric conductivity and specific magnetic rotatory power .
V.\#151 ; The Sources of Error in The sources of error may be classified under three categories , namely , ( i ) weight of glass and its contents taken by themselves ; ( ii ) temperature ; and ( iii ) adjustment .
Firstly .
Weight of Glass and Content These arise from ( i ) corrosion , and ( ii ) absorption .
To avoid the second error of absorption the acids were taken in either a gradually ascending or descending series of concentration ; between any set of observations the tube was not washed out with water , but rinsed frequently with the acid to be subsequently used .
The object of this precaution is to gradually season the vessel , as it were , for the particular acid to be examined , as undoubtedly some of the acid is soaked into the glass ; if , then , in a subsequent observation the acid formerly absorbed is soaked out and replaced by an acid of different concentration , the error produced in the weight of glass and acid is minimised .
The methods recommended by various writers of cleansing with water , steam , or dry air were found to cause error , while the use of alcohol and ether , formerly in vogue , was quite inadmissible .
Secondly .
Adjustment.\#151 ; The instruments were placed in a water-bath at the required temperature , and the solutions drawn off from one limb by bibulous paper until the level-mark on the opposite limb was attained \ for the most concentrated acids , which at once nitrate and render useless the common form of bibulous paper , the only material found suitable was a kind of tissue paper , sold for a wholly different purpose .
In order to estimate the effect of an error purposely committed in the adjustment , the following method was adopted : One of the pyknometers filled with water was placed in a water tank , and a horizontal microscope with vertical movement was so arranged that the adjustment mark was in the field of view ; on the eyepiece of the microscope was etched a 1 cm .
scale , divided into hundredths , so that a difference of a deci-millimetre could be read off .
As the adjustment mark appeared too coarse an object under the magnification , a brilliant Some Physical Properties of Nitric Acid Solutions .
91 bubble in the glass , itself , situated a few millimetres above the mark , was taken as a more convenient standard of reference ; the distance between the lowest part of the bubble and the best defined limit of the adjustment mark was measured once for all .
The water level was then adjusted so that the top of the meniscus was at this ascertained distance , and a weighing of the water contents made ( temperature 24-2 ) ; in subsequent experiments the water level was purposely adjusted 1*6 mm. below and 1 mm. and 2 mm. above the standard mark , both series being required as the capillary limb was not a true cylinder .

Correction for Displacement.\#151 ; All the weighings for the determinations were reduced to a vacuum according to the usual approximate formula W - w(l-- + -^ V P '7 wherein X = 0*0012 is the adopted standard density of air under average conditions , and p taken as at 8*4 ; the circumstance that the smaller weights were of platinum instead of brass affects the results beyond the limits of experimental error and can therefore be neglected .
The densities were throughout reduced in terms of the maximum density of water at 4 ' C. Thirdly .
Temperature.\#151 ; The temperature was recorded by a thermometer , graduated to 0'1 C. , and of such an open scale that 0'03 C. could be read without difficulty ; the zero displacement and the stem errors of the instrument were determined in our previous investigation .
With a view of ascertaining if there existed any appreciable error in the thermometer ( by Casella ) used , and to examine the accuracy of the method , the density of a sample of 44'10 per cent , acid ( selected as approximately the mean of water and 100 per cent , acid ) , was 92 Messrs. Y. H. Veley and J. J. Manley .
determined by five different thermometers , namely , the one used for the investigation , one standard by Baudin graduated to 0'02 C. , one by Delaunay , and two by Becker , these last three graduated to 0'1 C. All these instruments were calibrated in our previous investigation , and have subsequently been submitted again to the same process with the same results .
In each case two independent determinations of the water and acid contents were made , so that either four or two results were obtained according as all the determinations or one in each pair were different .
The following results were obtained for the density at 24-2/ 4 ._ Thermometer .

However this may be , the errors accumulated by the variations of one instrument would not affect any conclusions , and the method , as regards temperature , gives accurate results .
A number of duplicate experiments were made in which one or more of the following were varied : ( i ) stock acid ; ( ii ) pyknometer ; and ( iii ) standard alkali ; the difference in the values obtained did not exceed one or two units in the fourth place of decimals , which would cause no appreciable error in the contractions .
I urther , it is most probable that the divergence in values obtained for the contractions of acidic and saline solutions , to which attention has recently been drawn , * arises rather from errors of analysis and unequal amounts of impurities in materials , than from density determinations with all their consequent errors .

93 VI.\#151 ; Contractions .
From the density determinations the contractions in the formation of 1 gramme of the acid solutions have been calculated .
The volumes occupied by 1 gramme of water at the temperatures of 4 , 14-2 and 24'2 are taken from Rosetti 's tables as at 1 , T00075 and 1'00268 c.c. respectively , while those of 100 per cent , acid are calculated with slight corrections from the density values obtained for the 99'97 per cent , acid previously prepared .
Owing to the difficulty experienced in eliminating the last fractions per cent , of water from the acid no attempts were made to obtain another sample ; therefore , if there had been an error in these density determinations the values for all the contractions would be uniformly increased or diminished , but the conclusions to be drawn therefrom not materially affected .
As it has been shown in the previous sections that from various causes differences in value occurred of some units in the fifth place of decimals in the density determinations , these figures were omitted as inconsequent for the purpose of calculation , and the results expressed in 1/ 100,000 c.c. The results are calculated by means of the formula c = _pV/ 100 +(100-1 ?
) Vi/ 100-V2 , wherein p = percentage of acid , V = volume occupied by 1 gramme of acid , Vi = volume occupied by 1 gramme of water , and V2 the reciprocal of the density for any particular mixture .
The details of one calculation are given for an example : Percentage of acid = 61*53 , of water = 38'47 .
Volume occupied by 1 gramme of water at 14 ' *2 C- .
= 1'00075 c.c. Volume occupied by 1 gramme of 100 per cent , acid at 14''2 C. = 0-65679 c.c. Volume occupied by mixture at 14'-2 C. - 0-72383 c.c. 1\gt ; V/ 100 = 0'40412 c.c. ( 100-1 ?
)Vi/ 100 = 0-38499 c.c. Sum = 0- 78911 c.c. V2 = 1/ D - 0-72383 c.c. Contraction C = 0-06528 c.c. or 6528 x 10-5 .

YII.\#151 ; The Graphical Representation .
When the contractions are plotted out in terms of percentages , the former as ordinates and the latter as abscissae upon a scale of 1 mm. for 10"4 c.c. and lO-1 percentage , there is in each case an ascending and a descending branch .
The maximum corresponds to a percentage 54 per cent. , a result Which is in accordance with the former observation of Kolb , who found a constant maximum from 52-33 per cent , to 54 per cent. The value calculated from this observer 's density at 15 ' for 53 per cent , ( corrected to 14'-2 ) expressed in the terms herein adopted by us is 6968 x 10~5 , whereas that found by us at 52*87 per cent , is 7025 x 10~5 or a difference of 57 x 10"5 , a difference readily explained , having regard to the somewhat crude analytical methods adopted by Kolb .
Further , both the ascending and descending branches consist of a series of straight lines with the exception of the portion between 95 to 100 per cent. , which is markedly curved .
2 he Ascending Brandt consists in all three cases examined of four segments , namely , ( i ) a steep portion from 0 to 19 per cent , with a slight variation at about 4 per cent. , ( ii ) a less steep portion from 19 to 33 per cent. , ( iii ) a flatter portion from 33 to 42 per cent , and an almost horizontal portion at 42 to 53 per cent. ; in all cases the percentages are given in round figures .
The equations for the several straight lines* have been put into the form Ci = C \#177 ; a ( Ap ) , wherein Ci is the contraction to be calculated , C the contraction at the selected origin of the co-ordinates , a a constant and A pthe difference of percentage .
The value of C was determined graphically , being the point of intersection of the two several branches .
The values for a are summarised for the purpose of convenience in the following table :\#151 ; Percentage .

95 It will be observed that the differences in the values of the constant are considerable , with the exception of the slight variation at 4 per cent. , upon which it is not desired to lay stress ; further , the values of the constant are fairly simple integers .
The Descending Branch consists of five segments , ( i ) a rather fiat portion from 54 to 63 per cent. , ( ii ) a steep portion from 63 to 70 per cent. , ( iii ) a more steep portion from 70 to 78 per cent. , ( iv ) an abrupt descent from 78 to 95 per cent. , and ( v ) a curved portion from 95 to 100 per cent. The values for the constant a are summarised in the following table:\#151 ; 1 Pei'centage .

1 77\#151 ; 94 1 -205 -208 -195 !
It will be observed that the difference in value for the portions V and VI is not considerable .
As to Segment IX , or curved portion , it was thought at the earlier-stage of the inquiry that the apparently irregular results obtained with acids of percentage strengths from 95 to 100 per cent , might arise from experimental errors , the possibility of which is greatly increased in the case of solutions difficult to manipulate and of high coefficient of expansion .
With a view of deciding the matter , fresh samples of acids were prepared de novo after an interval of about fifteen months ; concordant results were obtained in the case of two samples of different past history and of approximately the same concentration , namely , 92'34 and 92'66 per cent , respectively , which pointed to an absence of any substantial error in the earlier work .
Further determinations made with samples of concentration intermediate between those formerly made gave intermediate values .
The results are illustrated by certain curves , for a description of which the reader is referred to pp. 100-105 .
Effect of Temperature.\#151 ; Though the mean straight lines representing the observations are not parallel with one another for the three temperatures , yet within the limits 4'\#151 ; 24 ' *2 there does not appear to be any great variation in the percentage composition corresponding to the critical points as conditioned by temperature .
It is very probable that at higher temperatures such variations would occur , Messrs. V. H. Veley and J. J. Manley .
and some if not all , of the critical points would be eliminated .
unfortunately for the demonstration of such a nrobahilito n- ' acid of 100 per cent , concentration or thereabouts undei ordinary conditions much above 25 ' C. without increasing considerably the risk of decomposition , which would render such an acid useless as a standard .
VIII.\#151 ; Discussion .
If the minor vacation at 4 per cent , be dismissed as inconsequent it will be observed that the principal critical points are , in all three " Ses \#174 ; f , tcemPerature examined , in the vicinity of 20 , 33 , 42 54 63 ^:r\thrrtionv* " 2 " P''"7 '"* Bertbelot 's results for the heat of dissolution , and those of Kolb for the contractions tit ) , and would correspond approximately to a hydrate , HNO3HH0O ( 20-31 per cent ) the second to the composition of a hydrate , HN03.7H,0 ( 33-33 per cent ) the third to that of the hydrate HN03.4H20 ( 41*18 per cent ) the fourth to that of the hydrate HN03.3H20 ( 53*93 per cent. ) , the fifth to that of the hydrate HN03.2H20 ( 63-63 per cent. ) , the sixth to that th b6 M^unH2 ' ( 7 ' PCr Cent-)\gt ; and the seyenth to that of fm HNl'3-H2 ' ( 77-77per cent. ) .
Of these the second , third , rth , fifth , and seventh have frequently been alluded to in recent iterature ( vide summary 111 previous paper , loc. so that it will be unnecessary to recapitulate the evidence .
As regards the sixth point 70 per cent. , there appears to have been a considerable diversity of opinion .
Since the acid obtained by the distillation , whether of more concentrated or more dilute acid , has an approximate composition of 6S per ^nt .
older writers regarded the acid as consisting of the hydrate iHNO 3H20 deprived of a small proportion of acid by volatilisation .
But as Roscoe* showed that the composition of the distillate varied with the conditions of pressure , the former view was abandoned , and it was held that the constancy of the distillate was-merely dependent upon the particular conditions of atmospheric pressure under which the greater proportion of mankind lives More recent writers ( Mendeleeff , Erdmann ) have been impressed with the theoretical significance of the hydrate HN0r2H.,0 as the ultimate possible combination of nitrogen with hydroxyl , namely , A(OH)5 and therefore regard the acid of constant composition mentioned above as consisting of the hydrate deprived of a small pro-portmn 'f water by volatilisation .
These writers adduce as evidence that it dry air at 15 ' C. be passed , whether through more concentrated or more dilute acid , the final product in either case contains 64 per * 'Cliem .

acid , or approximately of the composition HN03.2H20 ; further , Pickering ( loc.cit .
) has obtained crystals of this composition by freezing .
As regards the contractions , the change at 70 per cent , appears to be more marked than that at 63 per cent. , and it might be a matter of judgment if the results from 54 to 70 per cent , might not equally well be represented as upon one curve and not upon two straight lines .
The latter view has been adopted to bring the results obtained within these limits into uniformity with the rest .
As regards the abnormality at 95 to 100 per cent. , it is probable this is the result of a wholly different cause ; a similar phenomenon was observed in the electric conductivity , and the suggestion was put forward of an initial decomposition into water and nitric anhydride , but since the latter , when passed into nitric acid of about 100 per cent , concentration , forms a substance of composition 2HN03.N205 or 2N2O5.H2O ( a colourless liquid of specific gravity T642 at 18 ' , crystal-lisable at -5C ) , both the contraction and the electric conductivity numbers might be expressed in terms of this substance , and not in terms of nitric acid 2HN03 or N2O5.H2O .
At present the physical constants of the crystallisable compound have not been sufficiently examined .
IX.\#151 ; The Degree of Discontinuity .
Though in the diagrams of curves the mean straight lines are produced until they intersect , yet the object thereof is to determine each separate origin of co-ordinates ; it is not intended to represent an irregularity occurring suddenly or an abrupt change of events .
The results in themselves show one or two possibilities at each critical point , namely , firstly , a very gradual transition from one phase to another , so that the observation points within about a 2 per cent , limit could equally well be represented on either of the lines ; secondly , a transition stage , in which the observation points lie upon neither of the straight lines , but one generally lower than both .
Examples of each of these two possibilities will be discussed seriatim .
Firstly , a gradual transition .
An example of this can be illustrated from the results obtained at 24-2 for acids of percentage values from 30T7 to 33*87 , and in the following table ( p. 98 ) the observed results for the contractions are compared with those calculated both from the 21 per cent , and the 33*3 per cent , origins of co-ordinates .
It is evident that the result for the 30T7 per cent , acid belongs to the straight line drawn from the 4 per cent , origin , and the result for 33*87 per cent , acid , on the other hand , belongs to the straight line drawn from the 33*3 per cent , acid , while those intermediate could within the degree of experimental error be equally represented as belonging to either line .

As it would appear from a consideration of the examples given above that the observations in the vicinity of critical points may be represented in certain cases as on either , and in others as on neither of the lines meeting at those points , then such points may be regarded as in a certain sense ideal , and the phenomena as continuous .
Some such possibility might tend to overcome the mental difficulty experienced by certain writers as regards the manifestation of sudden irregularities , and throughout the whole course of events from commencement to conclusion one is dealing with combined water and free water , with combined acid and free acid , and in the more dilute solutions with integral or undecomposed molecules as also with their respective ions .

107 of the anhydrous acid is increased by dilution until it has combined with about four times its weight of water , beyond which there is an apparent decrease .
" This alteration would correspond to an alteration at or about a percentage value of 20 per cent. , and will be alluded to more especially in the sequel .
In another passage the authors express themselves as follows : " We have little doubt of the existence of hydrates in solution , but our experiments do not give any clear evidence of them , and though we have looked for coincidences between probable hydrates in solution and changes of curvature in our diagrams , we have not found any that we could distinctly recognise .
" As to these observations the authors would venture to express the opinion that the percentage values , for which observations were made , were possibly in this particular case too few in number to enable any conclusions to be drawn definitely therefrom .
Le Blanc* gives determinations of four samples of percentages varying from 14*09 to 69*18 per cent. , and arrives at the same general result as Gladstone , that the values of the refraction equivalents increase as the percentage decreases , and as the result is in accord with that deduced from an examination of other substances , it is cited as evidence in favour of the dissociation hypothesis of solution .
Lastly Pulfrich , f from an examination of certain solutions , has traced out a relation between the alteration of refractive indices and contractions on admixture , as expressed by the equation N-N"/ N = a ( D - D")/ D , in which N and are the values of 1 , D and D " those of the densities ( i ) for the mixture as observed , and ( ii ) for the mixture if no alteration in volume had occurred , while a is a constant .
It will thus be evident that former observers have viewed their results from the three different standpoints of ( i ) the coexistence of unaltered and uncombined molecules of water and acid respectively ; ( ii ) the dissociation to a greater or less degree of the acid molecules into their constituent ions ; and ( iii ) an aggregation of some kind or another of water and acid molecules , if contraction in volume is taken as a criterion of chemical combination .
It has already been shown by one of us f that the determination of refractive indices is a method as delicate as that of densities for differentiating samples of water of different degrees of salinity .

II.\#151 ; The Spectrometer .
The instrument , for the loan of which we are indebted to the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society , was obtained from Becker ( Meyerstein 's successor ) originally for the purpose of investigating the method of determining the specific refractivities of solids from their .
solutions.* Its graduated circle is 27 cm .
diameter , i and reads directly to one-tenth degree ; it is furnished with two reading microscopes , supplied with micrometers , three revolutions of which correspond to one scale division ; as the micrometer screw heads are divided into sixty parts , an observer is enabled to read directly to two seconds . !
HI.\#151 ; The Prism its Fittings .
As it was thought probable that the more concentrated acids would " corrode a glass prism , and the saline materials dissolved out would alter the refractive indices of the samples , a prism entirely of quartz was constructed under our direction by Mr. Hilger .
The dimensions of its plates , cut with their planes at right angles to their optic axes , - : were 75 mm. x 68 mm. x 6 mm. diameter , of the aperture 20 mm. , and the angle of the prism about 60 ' 6r , an accurate measurement of which is given in the sequel .
At the upper end a hole was drilled so that a thermometer graduated to 0'1 C. could be introduced , when required , into the prism contents .
Solid paraffin was selected as likely to be the best material for cementing the plates on to the main block j the paraffin was purified by boiling with concentrated nitric acid , and then frequently with water , until all the acid had been washed out , dried at 90 ' in a water oven , and thus a material of constant melting point 51 ' obtained .
The process of cementing was conducted as follows : The central block and its plates were cleaned and the former placed upon a wood slab so that the refracting angle was uppermost ; the plates were placed in their proper position and the whole introduced into a water oven , the temperature of which was gradually raised to 80 ' ; the prism with the slab of wood was then lifted out and the thinnest possible film of paraffin run in by capillary attraction by means of a feather until the film had penetrated almost to the aperture j the whole was then replaced in the oven and allowed to cool down slowly .
By this process any strain due to an unequal rate of cooling was avoided .

] Y.\#151 ; Parallelism of Quartz Plates .
This was ascertained ( a)by an optical method , ( b ) by a spher-ometer reading to 0-001 mm. In the first method the two plates A and B were placed successively in a vertical position on the prism table of the spectrometer , which was turned until one edge of the image of the reflected slit of the collimator coincided with the intersection of the cross threads ; micrometer readings were then taken .
The divided circle was then rotated until the image of the same portion of the slit was seen reflected from the other face of the plate , and a second set of readings taken .
The whole series of operations was repeated several times and with different parts of the circle .
By t is method the faces of one plate A were found to deviate from true parallelism by 12 " of arc , while those of the other plate B were optically parallel . .
, In the second method the thickness of each plate was determined at four points , each about 2-5 cm .
from the four angles along the diagonals ; the results were as under : Plate A. Plate B. 6 .
056 mm. 6'944 mm. .049 " '943 " .042 " '945 , , .049 " '943 " Mean ... 6-949 " Mean ... 6-044 " Both of these methods show that no sensible error could arise from imperfect parallelism .
Y.\#151 ; Angle of Prism .
The refractive indices of twenty-four samples were determined with a refractive angle of prism of 60 ' 8 ' 29 " ( mean value of numerous concordant measurements ) , the remaining sixteen samples with a refractive angle of 60 ' 6 ' 7 " ( mean value also of concordant measurements ) ; in every case the angle was measured by the usual method of keeping the telescope of the spectrometer in a fixed position and rotating the prism .
It is possible that the former and higher value arises from some fragment of dust or extraneous matter between one of the quartz blocks and body of prism , and the supposition is apparently borne out by the fact that though the prism has been subsequently re-built on frequent occasions , yet the latter and lower value has invariably been obtained .
Messrs. V. H. Veley and J. J. Manley .
" VI.\#151 ; Effect of Temperature on Refracting Angle .
In the course of the work numerous determinations of the refracting ^ngle were made at different temperatures ; of these the following pair may be cited , each value being the mean of several determinations : Temperature .
Refracting angle .
11*6 60 ' 6 ' 19*0 60 ' 6 ' 2 " This difference is quite insignificant .
It is possible that differences in the refracting angle at different temperatures , noticed by previous observers , may be due not to any alteration in the prism by itself , but to the expansion of the wax or other cementing material , as to the thickness of which and the method of spreading it details are not given .
VII.\#151 ; Temperature .
In the more recent experimental work upon refractive indices the prism has generally been enclosed in some form of jacketing arrangement through which a stream of water at about the required temperature was allowed to flow .
Some of the arrangements suggested increase the difficulty of manipulating the prism in any direction , while for every case it appears probable that , if observations are required at a temperature considerably above that of an ordinary temperature , an optical strain might result from convection currents from the hot jacket , and thus observations at a higher might not be comparable directly with those at a lower temperature .
Some observers have remarked upon the number of constants required for an empirical equation\#151 ; [ P- = ( \+at + bt- + ctz . . .
) \#151 ; to fit the observations ; possibly the explanation may be found in such a strain as described above .
As in this particular investigation the substance under examination may begin to decompose at a temperature of about 30 ' , the plan was adopted of altering the whole temperature of the room so that not only the prism , but also the lenses , telescope fittings , micrometer scales , \amp ; c. , should be affected pro rata as regards their individual coefficients of expansion.* It was judged that , when the thermometer in the prism contents and a second of the same order of delicacy placed on the rotating table registered the same temperature for a time longer than that * This method of working was adopted by van der Willigen in determinations of the \ ariation in refractive index of glass prisms with temperature .
Some Physical Properties jLcicl Solutions .
Ill required , it would be safe to make all the necessary observations and readings .
... .
Our experience has been that if by any chance the prism-contents were altering in temperature the edges of the D-line appeared somewhat blurred , but if the temperature was constant the line was perfectly sharp and well defined .
Though this method of working is accompanied by some personal discomfort , yet it is believed to be susceptible of greater accuracy than when only the temperature of the prism is varied .
VIII.\#151 ; Refractive Index of Water .
As a preliminary experiment determinations were made of for water , purified by the methods adopted by us ; the values found were / Xoi4-2 = 1-33376 and / xD18 = 1-33328 ; the latter does not differ widely from the mean value yf0 = 1'33334 obtained by fomiei observers , whose results have been recently collated by Rudolph ! .
IX.\#151 ; Method of Observation .
The method of conducting a determination was as follows :\#151 ; ( i ) The prism was washed out four times with portions of the prepared sample of acid , then finally charged , allowed to stand for a short time and the thermometer inserted ; ( ii ) Spectrometer telescope adjusted for viewing the collimator slit directly , the point of intersection of the cross lines being made to coincide with the left-hand edge of the image of the slit , and a reading taken ; ( iii ) Charged prism placed upon the table and the position of minimum deviation for the D-line found , the temperature being noted ; ( iv ) Prism removed and ( ii ) repeated ; ( v ) Repetition of ( iii ) after a short interval .
After several hours a second set of experiments wras made .

In the interval which elapsed between the two sets of observations the thermometer was removed and its aperture covered by a quartz plate .
If the two mean values given above are corrected to the same standard temperature , 14 ' 2 ' , the value of the former becomes 29 ' 26 ' 27 " , the latter 29 ' 26 ' 28 " , or a difference of 1 " .
X.\#151 ; Sources of Error and their ^ \#166 ; Effect of Prism on the Acid.\#151 ; In order to ascertain if any chemical action occurred between the quartz and the acid , the following experiments may be cited as a selection of those conducted .
Three samples of 3 86 , 70 04 , and 9Y29 per cent , concentration respectively were chosen , and the value of their refractive indices determined ( i ) as soon as possible after introduction and ( ii ) after the expiry of a known period of time .
The values are given in the following table:\#151 ; Percent- age strength .

II .
Effect of Paraffin on the Acid.\#151 ; In a sample of 29*4 per cent , concentration ( / 'o11 J = T374181 ) a quantity of the above-mentioned purified paraffin in the form of fine shavings was introduced ; the thermometer hole was closed with a well-polished plate of quartz and the whole allowed to stand at ordinary temperature .
At the end of 18 hours determinations gave the value / xD14'2 = 1-374237 and at the end of 42 hours a value pD142 = 1-374258 , or variations of +0 000056 and +0-000077 respectively .
Some Physical Properties of .
Nitric Acid Solutions .
113 It will be evident that in this experiment , purposely conducted in an exaggerated form , the difference produced is very small , and therefore it may safely be concluded that no appreciable effect would be caused by a " very thin film of paraffin in experiments which lasted for 3 hours on an average .
III .
Glass of Thermometer introduced into the Acid .
For the greater period of time during which the experiments were conducted the thermometer hole was closed with a quartz plate ; as the thermometer , made of lead glass , was introduced for only a short time it may reasonably be assumed that the quantity of glass dissolved out under these conditions would be insignificant .
IV .
Personal and Experimental Error due to Micrometer Screw .
The majority of adjustments were probably accurate to \#177 ; 2 " or a possible extreme error of 4 " , a magnitude which would change the value of , x for the weakest acid by \#177 ; 0*000019 and for the strongest of \#177 ; 0-000008 ; the values for / x are therefore correct in most cases to one unit in the fifth place with a variation in the sixth place .
XI.\#151 ; Temperature Coefficients .
In order to determine the above values , the sample alluded to nbo\ e may be given as an illustration and the following results cited : Temperature ( corr .

There is probably some function connecting these two factors , but from certain trials made it does not appear to be of a simple character .
The value for the 60-33 per cent , acid , namely , 0-000406 is not widely different from that 0-000424 given by van der Willigen for his sample of 58*89 per cent , concentration .

115 It will be observed that the values for yD increase slowly with increase of percentage up to 70 per cent. , the maximum value ; from this point the values decrease up to 98-67 per cent. , when there is a slight but apparent reversal .
The value for the anhydrous acid is approximately equal to that of a mixture in equal proportional weights of acid and water , a somewhat curious coincidence .
This maximum value appears to have escaped the notice of previous workers on the refractive indices of nitric acid .
In the following table the values are given for - 1 Gladstone and Dale's'formula , and for / xD2 - l/ ( yd2 + 2 ) d , Lorentz 's formula ; the ratio of the two values is approximately T63 to 1 , the densities in both cases have been interpolated from our results , the fifth decimal place being dismissed as inconsequent , and the assumption being made that at least for small differences in percentages the values may be represented as on straight lines .
In the case of both factors the values decrease with increase of percentage , the variations for that of Gladstone and Dale amounting to 2T4 per cent. , and for that of Lorentz to 23 per cent , of the whole values .
Gladstone ( loc. cit. , supra ) has shown previously that the molecular refractive energies of nitric acid , as determined from aqueous solution , and after taking into account the water present , are not constant , though the variations deduced by this method of representation are not of the same order of magnitude .
The observed results for one of the above factors ( Lorentz ) are compared with results calculated from formula of straight lines Mi .
= M - a ( Ap ) , wherein Mi is the deduced value , and M the values for / xD2 - l/ ( / xD2 + 2 ) d for the several origin of co-ordinates , a is a constant and A pthe percentage differential .
Neglecting the first two values , which stand by themselves , the value for M from 6 to 20 per cent , is taken at 0-20360 , and for the remaining portion at 0-19750 .

117 between 68 and 70 per cent. ; this last difference taken by itself , without consideration of the alteration of / x , is not very marked .
The greatest differences between the observed and calculated results amount in two cases only to \#177 ; 33 parts per 10,000 , but in the large majority of cases to \#177 ; 5 parts per 10,000 , or even less , which is within the limits of experimental error .
The observed points of alteration are in accordance with the points noticed in Section I , though the last point , viz. , at 78 per cent. , is not here apparent .
It is , of course , to be noticed that the density enters as a factor alike into the contractions and Lorentz 's formula , though the refractivity for light is a wholly independent property .
As previously shown , the maximum value for contraction is at 54 per cent. , while that of the refractive index is at 70 per cent , j it would not , therefore , appear probable that Pulfrich 's formula ( vide supra ) , which expresses the relation between ju , and the contraction in terms of a constant , would be applicable in this particular case .
It was found by examples selected from various data that though the formula is applicable approximately for results differing by small percentage concentrations , yet such is far from the case when these differences are considerable .
Refractive Indices Curve .
For obtaining the curve showing the changes in ' the refractive indices , the value for / x for 2T9 per cent , acid was taken as unity ; and in order to keep the curve within moderate limits the differences in the successive values of / x were divided by 3 .
( See next page .
) It will be observed that the observations from 2 per cent , to about 20 per cent , lie upon one straight line , and those from 20 per cent , to about 33 per cent , are upon a second , while those from 40 per cent , to 70 per cent. , the maximum , and beyond apparently lie upon some form of regular curve .
The observations , however , are too few in number , and the scale too small to decide as to whether this curve could be resolved into two or more straight lines .
The general contour of the curve is very similar to those given by v. d. Willigen for / x ( A . . .
H ) in the case of sulphuric acid ; he draws special attention to the maximum value at 83'20 per cent. , and while admitting that his observations are insufficient to show whether the results from 0 per cent , to 80 per cent , are on one or several straight lines , yet alludes to the regularity of curvature in the vicinity of the maximum .

discussed in full ; in the former , those of analysis , unavoidable in this case , temperature , errors of filling pyknometers both with acid and water \ in the latter , those of micrometer screws , divided circle , parallelism of quartz plates , as also the several effects likely to be produced by the various substances with which the acid / .4080 / \#166 ; 3480 90 K)0 solutions of necessity came into contact .
The Results obtained by bot}i methods are given in a series of tables and compared with those calculated from various equations for straight lines .
These show that the 'physical properties display well-marked alterations at definite points\#151 ; in a word , such properties are discontinuous .
Further , such points correspond very approximately to the concenAnatomy and Development of the Stem in \amp ; c. 119 trafcions required for simple molecular combinations only of nitric acid ( HN03 ) with water .
Some of these combinations have been alluded to by previous writers on this and kindred substances , while others have either not been examined or have formed the subject of a diversity of opinion .
In the case of the densities and contractions the best defined points of alteration correspond to the composition of the hydrates HNO3 with 14 , 7 , 4 , 3 , 1*5 , and 1 molecular proportions of water respectively , -while in the case of the refractive indices , apart from consideration of density , the most marked points correspond to the 14 , 7 , and 1*5 hydrates .
In the case of the contractions and electric conductivities , but to a less degree in that of the refractive indices , there is remarkable discontinuity at concentrations 95 to 100 per cent. , which can possibly be explained rather by some decomposition .than by some combination .
Further , the more detailed experiments on the contractions show that these points of discontinuity , though to some degree real , yet to another degree are ideal , in that an apparently abrupt change of .events is resolved into either a gradual transition or a transition stage , which differs from either the preceding or successive phase .
In the present state of knowledge it appears difficult to interpret the course of events between each phase , as there are the possibilities of at least two cases involving two entities , namely , ( i ) combined acid and water with free water , and ( ii ) combined acid and water with free acid .
Investigations into a possible case not readily provided by nature or art , of two liquids which rapidly mix but slowly combine each with .each , might solve many of the problems of solution towards which the present memoir may serve as a slight contribution . .

( Abstract .
) Comparatively little attention has been directed to the subject of the development of the stem .
This research concerns itself chiefly with the development of the cauline fibro-vascular skeleton , since this appears to be most interesting from the phylogenetic and morphological standpoints .
A study of numerous examples drawn from the main groups of the Pteridophyta and Gymnosperms has led to the conclusion that the polystelic type of Van Tieghem does not originate , -as he states , by the repeated bifurcation of the epicotyledonary central
