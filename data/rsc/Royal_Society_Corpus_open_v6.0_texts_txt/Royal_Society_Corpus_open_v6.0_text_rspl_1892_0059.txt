Preliminary Note on the [ June 16 , this extra energy must be obtained from the development of higher pressures in the forward portions of the guns , and it naturally became a question of considerable importance to determine over what surface these higher pressures extended , and to ascertain if they in any serious degree affected the safety of the chase .
At Woolwich , to settle this point , certain guns were prepared in which crusher gauges were placed at various points along the bore , and results were obtained to which I shall presently more particularly allude ; but , considerable doubt having been thrown on the reliability of these crusher gauges , I considered it desirable in a matter of so great importance to ascertain the pressures by altogether independent means , and thus either confirm the crusher-gauge results , or , if the two sets of results should prove to be not altogether in accordance , to throw some light upon the causes of such discrepancies as might exist .
The crusher gauge is , to those who interest themselves with such subjects , so well known , that I shall not attempt here to describe it , and I will only say that I have very great confidence in the accuracy of its results when properly used .
Personally I have during the last twenty-five years made many thousand observations with these gauges , and when properly prepared and judiciously used , not only have I found their results accordant inter se , but I have by totally different determinations corroborated their accuracy .
But I have always held that this gauge and all similar gauges will cease to be either reliable or accurate if there be any probability of the products of explosion being projected into the gauge at a high velocity , the energy stored up in such products being impressed on the gauge in the form of pressure , and this contingency might and does arise either when the gauge is placed in the forward part of a gun , where necessarily the products are in rapid motion , or in the case of the detonation of ' a high explosive ; but , as I have gone pretty fully into this question elsewhere , X need not here pursue the subject further .
The crusher-gauge determinations for cordite , made at Woolwich for the Explosives Committee , under the presidency of Sir E. Abel , having been made in a 4'7-inch quick-firing gun , I arranged a similar gun in such a manner that I was able to obtain a curve determined from the time at which the projectile passed sixteen points arranged along the bore .
Prom this curve , by methods I have elsewhere described , the curve giving the velocity at all points of the bore can be deduced , and from the curve of velocity the pressures generating these velocities can also be deduced .

The explosives used were as follows:\#151 ; ] 892 .
] Pressure developed by some Neiv Explosives .
a. Ordinary pebble powder of the Service .
A charge of 12 lbs. was used ; this charge gave rise to a mean pressure of 15'9 tons per square inch ( maximum , 16'8 ; minimum , 14'9 ) , or a mean of 2424 atmospheres ( maximum , 2566 ; minimum , 2277 ) as determined by the crusher gauge in the powder chamber .
It gave to a 45-lb .
projectile a mean muzzle velocity of 1839 ft.-secs .
, thus developing a muzzle energy of 1055 ft.-tons .
A gramme of pebble powder at a temperature of 0 ' C. and a barometric pressure of 760 mm. generates 280 c.c. of permanent gas , and develops 720 gramme units of heat .
b. Amide powder , consisting of 40 per cent , of potassic nitrate , 38 per cent , of ammonia nitrate , and 22 per cent , of charcoal .
The charge in this case was 10 lbs. 8 ozs .
, and the mean crusher gauge pressure was 15'3 tons per square inch ( maximum , 16*4 ; minimum , 14'2 ) , or a mean of 2332 atmospheres ( maximum , 2500 ; minimum , 2165 ) ; the muzzle velocity with the same projectile was 2036 ft.-secs .
, and the muzzle energy 1293 ft.-tons .
A gramme of amide powder generates 400 c.c. of permanent gases , and develops 821 units of heat .
c. Ballistite .
With this true smokeless powder the charge was reduced to 5 lbs. 8 ozs .
, the sides of the cubes being 02 inch .
The mean crusher-gauge pressure was 14'3 tons per square inch ( maximum , 14*5 ; minimum , 14'1 ) , or a mean of 2180 atmospheres ( maximum , 2210 ; minimum , 2142 ) .
The muzzle velocity was 2140 ft.-secs .
, and the muzzle energy 1429 ft.-tons .
A gramme of ballistite generates 615 c.c. of permanent gases , and gives rise to 1365 gramme units of heat .
d. With the fourth explosive , Cordite , a charge of 5 lbs. 10 ozs .
of 0'2 inch diameter was fired .
The mean chamber crusher-gauge pressure was 13'3 tons per square inch ( maximum , 13'6 ; minimum , 12'9 ) , or a mean of 2027 atmospheres ( maximum , 2070 ; minimum , 1970 ) .
The muzzle velocity was 2146 ft.-secs .
, and the muzzle energy 1437 ft.-tons .
A gramme of cordite generates 700 c.c. of permanent gases at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. of barometric pressure .
The quantity of heat developed is 1260 gramme units .
In the case of this explosive , as well as in that of ballistite , a considerable quantity of aqueous vapour has to be added to the peiananent gases .
The results of these observations are graphically given in the figure .
The ordinates show both the positions at which the pressures were determined , and the magnitudes of these pressures .
On the axis of abscissae is shown the travel of the shot in feet .
Each curve is deduced from the mean of three* complete rounds , * Since these experiments were carried out , a second set of induction coils has been added , so that a single round gives simultaneously the times both at the breech and muzzle plugs .

Preliminary Note on the [ June 16 , Il892 .
] Pressure developed by some New Explosives .
127 Ithat is to say , three rounds with , the breech and three with the muzzle plugs , or six in all .
In the calculation of the pressures it is assumed that before and after the complete ignition of the explosive the pressures will uniformly increase and then uniformly decrease , following the laws regulating the relation between the pressure and volume when permanent gases are permitted to expand with production of work .
It is in the highest degree improbable that in any experiment is this assumption strictly true .
In the case of " brisante " powders , and of high explosives which can be detonated , we know that even in moderately-sized chambers there are wide variations in pressure ; and even when there is comparatively slow combustion , as with ballistite and cordite , it appears probable that the generation of a considerable quantity of the gases may take place in different portions of the bore , giving rise to a corresponding difference in the pressure , and it may be that a portion , of the discrepancies of the crusher gauge when placed in forward positions in the bore , to which I shall presently allude , are due to this cause .
But such irregularities would not very seriously alter the curves shown in the figure .
The areas included between the final ordinate , \#166 ; the curve , and the axis of abscissae , being the total energy impressed on the projectile , would of course remain unaltered ; but the curves , instead of the regular figure there shown , would have a wavy outline , and would show several maxima and minima .
These irregularities of pressure are of no appreciable importance when the strength of the gun , in a radial direction , is considered .
From the same plate can be at once obtained the pressures for the four explosives at any point of the bore ; but for the purpose of applying these results to other guns I give in the annexed table for different densities of the products of explosion ( 1 ) the pressure which has been determined in a closed vessel , ( 2 ) the pressure at the same density , which has been found to exist in the bore of the 4'7-inch gun where the gases have been expanded , doing work on the projectile .

An examination of the results obtained would lead to the conclusion that with the particular size of cordite employed tolerably complete combustion cannot be assumed to have taken place until the projectile has travelled some 6 or 7 feet through the bore .
Indeed , if the size of cordite fired in this gun be even slightly increased , a portion of the cordite is blown from the muzzle unburned , and it is one of the most * ' Phil. Trans. , ' Part I , 1875 , p. 129 .

] Pressure developed by some New Explosives .
129 striking proofs of the regular combustion of the explosive that in all such recovered cordite the diameter is so uniformly decreased that it might readily be mistaken for newly-manufactured cordite of smaller dimensions .
I now make a comparison between the pressures given by cordite as shown on curve B ( see fig. ) and those obtained from crusher gauges .
To facilitate this comparison I have added to the pressure curves I have described a curve showing the pressures developed by cordite when fired in a close vessel , and I have further added the results of five rounds of cordite fired for the Explosives Committee in the crusher-gauge gun , the pressure of each individual round at each point of observation being indicated .
The sample of cordite used in these experiments was not of the same make as that employed in my own .
The pressures given on the axis of y denote those taken in the powder chamber , and are comparable with the crusher-gauge pressures I have given as derived from my own experiments .
It will be observed that the mean chamber pressure indicated is two- or three-tenths of a ton higher than that I obtained ; but it will be further observed that if I attempt to draw " a pressure curve through the mean of the crusher-gauge observation , such curve would indicate pressures far higher than are necessary and sufficient to develop the work impressed on the projectile .
Again , the pressures indicated after the projectile has moved 1 foot are about 2 tons per square inch higher than those observed in the powder chamber , and it will be further noticed that not only are these observations , at all events at certain points , considerably too high , but they exhibit in the forward part of the bore variations quite unknown when the pressures are taken in the powder chamber .
Thus , in the particular experiments I am discussing , the mean pressure in the powder chamber being about 135 tons , the extreme variation in the five rounds amounts only to about li tons per square inch , while the crusher gauge placed in the chase at a point about feet from the seat of the shot , gave in the same number of rounds an extreme variation of 3 tons per square inch , the mean pressures being only about 4 tons , and it will further be noted that , while some of the rounds indicated pressures below those deduced by the method 1 have described , other rounds at the same point indicated pressures even exceeding those which would have existed under the same gravimetric densities in a close vessel ; It may also be noted that from the ciusher-gauge experiments , round 5 should have given the lowest muzzle energy of the series ; as a matter of fact it gave the highest .
My conclusion , therefore , is that , although crusher gauges placed in the chase may , and doubtless do , give valuable comparative results , they cannot be relied on for absolute determinations , unless confirmed by observations altogether independent in their nature .
