Extract of a Letter from Dr. Andrew Cantwell of Montpelier , to Dr. Thomas Stack , dated June 23 .
1732 .
concerning an uncommon Palsy of the Eye-lids .
JUNE 7 .
1732 .
Mons. Guilliminet , Counsellor of the Court of Aides , went hence to Balleruc , ( whither I had been called to attend a Patient ) with a Nun his Daughter , about 30 Years of Age .
This Lady was troubled with as singular a Disease as I have heard of .
It was an intermitting periodical Palsy of the Eye-lids , which began every Evening about six o'Clock , with a Defluxion from the great Canthus , of a whitish Matter of some Consistence ; so that she remained blind till next Morning , and then recovered the Use of her Eye-lids , as before .
This Disorder held her since February last ; from which Time all Remedies ordered her by her Physician proving ineffectual , she was sent to Balleruc for the Benefit of the Waters .
As we lodged in the same House , I had a fair Opportunity of observing the Effects the Waters had on her .
She was pumped on the back Part of her Head and Neck Seven times , without receiving any sensible Benefit : The Ninth time her Disorder seized her an Hour later than usual , and the Defluxion was less and thinner .
The next Evening it retarded two Hours , and the following Night she had as much Command of her Eye-lids as ever .
She took the Douche ( for so we call that way of pumping ) the next Morning and Evening , and was entirely cured .
I sat with her an Hour that Evening , carefully observed her Eyelids by Candle-light , and asked her several Questions on her Disorder .
She opened her Eyes as well as I did mine , and set out the next Day for Montpelier .
