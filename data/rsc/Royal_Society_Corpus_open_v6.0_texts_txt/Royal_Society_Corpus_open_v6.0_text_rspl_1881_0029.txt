* I feel that some apology is needed for using the Japanese word koji , but as there is no foreign product in any way resembling it , I have thought that there would be less danger of confusion arising by retaining the Japanese word than by using the word " malt .
" As will be seen from the foUowing description , the nature of this substance is quite different from that of malt , so that the use of that word might lead to erroneous impressions .
The 6 is pronounced long , as it is a contraction for the diphthong au , the word being written in Japanese kauji , but pronounced as written above .

Section TV.\#151 ; Change which the Rice Grain Undergoes by the Growth of the Fungus .
It is shown by a comparison of the analyses of rice and that the principal change which is to he observed is the conversion of the insoluble albuminoids of rice into the soluble state , and , probably as a result of this , the large increase in the total soluble solid matter .
It may be desirable before entering upon the preparation and properties of the substance which the Japanese call Jcoji , to mention briefly the uses to which it is put in this country .
It is universally employed as a fermenting agent , but it is something differing from such a body as " barm or yeast , " by which Dr. Hepburn translates Jcoji in his invaluable dictionary .
Its principal use is in the production of sake , the alcoholic liquid which is everywhere consumed in Japan .
This liquid is prepared from steamed rice by digestion with Jcoji , the diastase of which effects the conversion of the starch into matter capable of being fermented .
Another use to which Jcoji is applied is in bread-making .
It is also employed in the manufacture of the famous sauce " Soy , " which is likewise a product of fermentation , though its preparation is much more complicated , and has not yet received an explanation .
In " Nature " ( September 10th , 1878 ) , I gave a very brief account of the mode of producing sake , and about the same time Mr. 0 .
Korschelt read a paper before the German Asiatic Society of Japan giving a detailed description of the process , together with some experiments upon the action of water upon Jcoji .
The result of his investigation was that koji acted as a kind of diastase , converting starch into sugar , but he gave no experiments which could serve to identify the product .
In a paper read before the Chemical Society in March , 1880 , of which an abstract appears in the " Chemical Hews , " April 9th , 1880 , I gave a series of analyses of the mash , as the result of which the conclusion was drawn that the diastase of koji , unlike that of malt , yields dextrose and dextrin when it acts upon gelatinised starch .
The conclusion was correct as referring to the ultimate products , but further experience has shown that the first product is not dextrose , but maltose , which , however , is quickly hydrated to dextrose .
Evidence of this will be found in a later part of this paper .
I.\#151 ; Preparation of the Koji .
The rice grain consists of several envelopes , the outer of which are easily removed in the form of chaff by threshing , and after being burnt , the mineral constituents are returned to the soil .
The grain On the Diastase of Koji .
.till possesses a thin adhering skin which is removed by a very rough urocess of beating with wooden hammers , the gram being contained L a wooden mortar* By this operation a large proportion of the .ain becomes broken , and is thus rendered unfit for many purposes , as for eating and for sake brewing .
In the koji manufactory these broken grains , mixed with the thin skin , are converted into koji in the same way as the cleaned and whole grains , but the product is inferior in colour and is put to other uses .
Besides the loss of the skm the " rains are incomplete , one end of each being sharply curved inward owing to the complete removal of the embryo from the rough treatment it has received .
This alone shows that the change which the rice grains undergo in being made into cannot resemble a process of germination .
, , The rice thus cleaned is next soaked in water all night , and , on the following morning , it is heated in a current of steam until each grain is just soft enough to be elastic , an operation which takes from four to five hours .
After this it is thrown upon mats laid upon the ground , and turned over continuously by the workmen until it is quite cool , the temperature taken on three different occasions being 84,8b , and 84 ' F. By this constant working the grains are prevented from cohering into lumps , and the mass feels to the hand quite dry .
To every two bushels the foreman adds three salt spoonfuls of the spores of a fungus , described by the late Mr. Ahlburg as oxyzeee(Ahlb.).f The whole of these spores is mixed with a small portion of the rice , and the mixture is then scattered over the rest of the rice as a husbandman scatters seed over the ground .
The mats are folded over at each corner , and the rice thoroughly worked again to ensure a uniform distribution of the spores .
After this the rice is gathered into baskets , and carried into the coolest part of the " growing chamber .
" This is done about 2 p.m. on the first day .
In the sake breweries , where koji is made for brewing purposes , the " growing chamber " is of a somewhat rough construction , being formed near the surface of the ground , built up with timber , coated with mud , and covered with straw mats to avoid as much as possible loss of heat .
In the koji manufactory proper , however , it is a much more satisfactory place .
It consists of a long arched passage , cut m the thick bed of clay which underlies Tdkio at a depth below the surface of from 15 to 20 feet .
In the manufactory at Yushima , in Tokio , with which I am best acquainted , there are in all four of these * It is a fact of some interest that if the skin be allowed to remain , the sake produced from such koji is more liable to spoil than when the skin is removed .
This is probably connected with the large percentage of albuminoids contained in the skin .

underground passages , only one of which is used during the summer as very little kojiis made during that season .
The height is rather less than 4 feet , the breadth about 7 or 8 feet , and from the entrance , reached by descending a vertical shaft , it extends about 25 or 30 feet in one direction , then bends off nearly at right angles for about the same distance .
From the second passage two others extend , in the same direction as the first , for about 30 feet .
In these the temperature of the air is highest .
Except at the beginning of the season , no fire or heating arrangement is used , but after being disused for a long time , the chamber would be too cold , and would delay too long the formation of the Jcoji .
After the rice mixed with spores has been taken to the growing chamber about 2 p.m. on the first day , it is thrown into a heap , covered with mats , and left for one night .
On the following day about noon ( second day ) it is put into baskets , withdrawn from the chamber , and sprinkled with water .
At this time the temperature of various batches which were examined varied between 75 ' F. and 79 ' F. When the Jcoji is required for sake ' brewing this operation is omitted , and the product is then called'raw koji ( Jup .
The common which is prepared by sprinkling with water is , however , frequently bought by the brewer for the purpose of mixing with the raw About 5 p.m. on the same day ( second day ) the rice is spread over small wooden trays , and placed upon the floor of the growing chamber underneath the trays which at this time contain nearly finished The rice is spread out so that in mo part is the layer of any thickness ; the temperature , however , gradually rises during the night .
A sample of which the temperature was taken at 8 p.m. on the second day was 80''6 F. , the temperature of the air at the same time being 81 ' F. At 5 a.m. on the third , day the workman re-enters the chamber for the purpose of removing the trays of finished koji , and of putting in their place the trays containing the mixed rice and spores of the third day .
This mixture has at 5 A.m. a temperature a little higher than that of the chamber ; the workman then collects the rice on each tray into a small heap , and allows it to remain undisturbed till between 9 and 10 a.m. The grains of rice on the morning of the third day present a slightly woolly appearance , which shows that the spores have already partly developed with the production of mycelial fibres .
The temperature rapidly rises ; at 8 a.m. the temperature of the rice is from 104 ' F. to 106 ' F. , and it increases slightly until between 9 and 10 a.m. , when the workman works the rice over with his hands and spreads it out to cool it .
The temperature of the air during this time remains tolerably constant , as will be seen from the details of the observations given afterwards .
When the rice has become cooler it is again heaped up on the trays On the Diastase of Koji .
nd left till about 1 p.m. , at which time its temperature has again Sen to over 100 ' F. After this , the heaps are broken down and the thin layers gradually become cooler , the workman frequently rubbing the matted masses between his hands to open them .
During this period the mycelium has developed very greatly , long silky fibres binding together the grains of rice .
The is now left until 5 A.M. on the following morning ( fourth day ) , when it is found to have become cemented into one cake by the filaments of mycelium .
It is then removed and preserved on the wooden trays until sold .
I have taken temperature observations at two periods in the year , in May and December .
The temperature of the chamber was taken by means of a Negretti and Zambra maximum and minimum thermometer , suspended with the middle of the long cylindrical bulb about one foot above the trays containing koji , and about the same distance below the roof .
The temperature of the koji was taken by means of a small tube thermometer plunged into the mass on the trays and allowed to remain several minutes , until no further change was observed .
The temperature of the rice on several trays was taken and the mean of the observations regarded as the true temperature .

The increase in the temperature of the hoji in May is by no means so marked as in the second series of observations made in December during which month much more hoji is made than in May .
The temperatures given below refer , like the last , to of the third day only , as it is during that time that the greatest amount of growth takes place .

The observation at 10 a.m. on December 6 was intended to ascertain what the highest temperature attained was , which the workman said occurred about that time ; but on that day the rice became so hot that he was obliged to spread it out before its temperature was taken , so that the number 101 ' F. gives the temperature after partial cooling .
The observation at 1 p.m. was made before the rice was spread out for the second time , and it will be seen that the temperature has risen considerably .
With these results , one cannot doubt jbhe truth of the statement made by the workman that the rice becomes heated during the growth of the mycelium .
Mr. O. Korschelt* has previously remarked that the temperature of the rice rises during the formation of hoji , but he gives only one observation .
He says : " Ich fand dann die Temperatur des Reises zu ' 25 ' C. , wahrend die Luft in der Kammer nur 20 ' C. zeigte .

On the Diastase of Koji .
The rise in temperature is almost certainly due to respiration , a process common to all plants .
I know of no case , however , in which the increase is so great as in the one under consideration .
Sachs says that .
the Spadix of the Aroideae at the time of fertilisation , and especially in warm air , an .
excess of temperature of from 4 ' to 5 ' C. , or even 10 ' C. , has been detected * In the present case the respiration is sufficiently active not only to keep the temperature of the rice above that of the surrounding air about 21 ' F. , but at the same time to keep the temperature of the air in the chamber from 30 ' to 40 ' F. above that of the air outside , because no artificial source of heat is made use of .
It is a little remarkable that the variation in the temperature of the air in the chamber is so small , for , as the place is not artificially warmed , but depends upon the heat given out by the growing fungus , it might be expected to be much higher in the morning than in the evening .
Such a variation will , indeed , be noticed , but not .
to a greater amount than 2 ' or 3 ' F. The constancy in the temperature is no doubt the result of having successive batches in the same chamber .
During the morning only the actively growing koji is there , and in the evening , when the former is cooling down , a new batch is brought in , which gradually rises in temperature during the night and attains its maximum between 8 and 12 in the forenoon .
That the growth of the fungus takes place with .
great vigour is shown not only by the rise in temperature , but by the rapidity with which it removes oxygen from the air .
A specimen of the actively growing koji ( at 8 a.m. ) was placed in a bottle of about 4 litres capacity and well corked .
Tubes were arranged so that a specimen of the enclosed air could be removed from the bottle , and it was then left in the chamber from 8 till 12 noon .
Over the koji which was exposed to the air the mycelium of the fungus had developed considerably and had caused the grains of rice to cake together into a solid mass .
The rice in the bottle , however , remained quite loose , and no increase in the amount of the mycelium could be observed .
Analysis of the air in the bottle showed that the whole of the oxygen had been replaced by carbonic acid .
The inference to be drawn from this experiment is that so long as the oxygen was present the mould went on growing , but that the amount of air contained in the bottle was insufficient for its growth , and hence , instead of becoming matted together , the grains of rice remained distinct .
The diminution in the weight of the rice is considerable .
Mr. Jihei Kamayama was good enough to weigh for me the rice used in one operation , and the koji which was formed from it .
He found that 100 parts of the whitened rice , after being converted into koji , weighed 101*3 parts .
Samples of each were obtained and the amount of water * Sachs , u Lehrbuch der Botanik , " 4th edition , 1874 , p. 694 .
Prof. R. W. Atkinson .
determined .
The rice contained 14'2 per cent , of water and the hVi 29-5 per cent ; thence 85'8 parts of the dried rice yielded 76'35 pa^ of dry hoji , that is , 89 per cent. , and thus a loss of weight occurs amounting to 11 per cent , of the dry rice used .
This loss consists mainly of starch , which is oxidised to carbonic acid and water , and corresponds to an oxidation of 4-9 per cent , carbon .
More carbon therefore , undergoes oxidation than Day found in the case of germinating barley , * which varied from 2*3 to 2'6 per cent. As in one day about 107 lbs. of dry rice are converted into in each chamber , the amount of carbonic acid formed will be y x 5'24=r 19'2 lbs. , and such a large quantity evolved in situations from which it is difficult to remove it frequently leads to stoppage of the work for some time .
The only means adopted of effecting a change of air consists of a square shaft about 8 inches in one direction and 6 inches in the other , leading from the anterior end of the passage into the open air above .
It will be evident , therefore , that as the ventilation depends upon the difference of temperature between the inner and the outer air , it will be much better in winter than in summer .
In fact , it is in the spring and early summer that the stoppages occur , for , as the temperature observations taken during May show , the difference at that period between the inner and outer air is not more than a few degrees .
Under such conditions the growth of the fungus must be much less active , and perhaps this is one reason why the production of in the summer is almost abandoned .
II.\#151 ; Action of Water on Koji .
The hoji prepared in the manner just described consists of grains of rice bound together in lumps by the interlacing threads of mycelium .
A single grain separated from the rest presents a peculiar woolly appearance on the surface , but does not appear to have increased very much in bulk .
Under the microscope , a section shows that the outer cells are loose and penetrated by the fibres of the mycelium , whilst in the centre of the grain the cells have a horny appearance , and the starch granules cannot be distinguished .
When the hoji grains are allowed to remain in contact with water for some time , a large proportion is dissolved by the water , which then assumes a yellow colour .
Very little of the hoji remains except the mycelial fibres and the skeleton of cellulose when the digestion is made in warm water .
The amount of matter brought into solution varies according to the duration and the temperature of digestion .
At low temperatures , and after about fifteen or twenty minutes , from 12 to 15 per cent , of solid matter , calculated on the hoji used , is found in solution ; but if the digestion is allowed to go on at a higher temperature , or for a longer time , from 30 to 60 per cent , will be dissolved .

Thus when 100 grms. were dissolved m 1,000 cub. centims. of water , and kept for twelve hours at a temperature ot 10 ' to 15 ' C. , the amount of solid matter dissolved varied from 22 per * The analysis of the solutions of Tcdjiwas carried out in the following manner .
The total solid matter was calculated from the specific gravity of the solution ta ^en at 16 ' C. , compared with water at the same temperature , by dividing t e excess above 1,000 ( water = 1,000 ) by 3*86 .
This gives the number of grms. m 100 cub. centims. of liquid , from which the percentage is easily found .
The glucose was e termined by the gravimetric process recommended by O bullivan ( Journ. em. Soc. , " 1876 , [ ii ] , p. 131 ) . .
The specific rotatory power of the solid matter in solution was determine y o serving the number of divisions upon the scale of a Soleil-Duboscq saccliarometer which corresponded to uniformity of tint of the two halves of the field.^ The light was always observed through a column of liquid 200 millims. long* The specific Prof. R.

In some solutions in which the nitrogen dissolved was determined , the specific rotatory power of the albuminoids was found to be -40 ' , and it will , probably , not be far from the truth to take this number as the average specific rotatory power of the albuminoids .
^ Two points are brought out by a consideration of Table III .
In the first place the proportion of water used appears to influence con-siderably the amount of solid matter brought into solution The average of the numbers obtained when 100 grms. of were dissolved m 1,000 cub. centims. is only 27 , whilst when the same weight was dissolved in 2,500 cub. centims. the average was 31'4 .
The single experiments given also bear out this with the exception of No. 18 ; but m a matter of this nature no reliance can be placed upon isolated observations .
The second point is that the specific rotatory power of the solids m solution appears to be mainly influenced by the length of the digestion , being much higher when the digestion is short ' than when it is continued for some time .
The average specific rotatory power of the solutions made in eighteen hours was 570,6 ; after twelve hours , 64'-6 ; and after three hours , 69'-3 ; although the last number is not fairly comparable with the two former ones , a different proportion of water having been used .
The explanation of this fact is probably that when the digestion is continued for only a short time , a smaller proportion of albuminoids enters into solution than when the digestion is long continued .
It is probable , in fact , that the albuminoids require time to be degraded to such a form that they are soluble m water .
Hence , when the amount of albuminoids is small , the dextrose and dextrine mainly contribute to the specific rotatory power , which is , therefore , higher .
In Table IV are given a few results of experiments in which the mixture of hoji and water was heated for different periods .

Experiments 2 and 3 ( Table IY ) are interesting as they were made at the same time , with the same specimen of and with the same proportion of water , the only difference being in the time of digestion .
It will be useful to compare them with the results of an experiment made with the same koji at the ordinary temperature of the air .

In the third , the total solid matter has increased very greatly , but the dextrose dissolved has not kept pace with it , and forms only the same proportion as in the solution made in the cold .
The lower specific rotatory power shows , however , that the proportion of the other constituents Prof. R. W. Atkinson .
has not remained the same .
This will be better seen by calculating the amount of dextrine , albuminoids , and dextrose from the specific rotatory power , assuming that of the albuminoids to be \#151 ; 40 ' \amp ; n assumption which , if not .
quite accurate , will , however , not materially influence the results .

25 '3 The amount of albuminoids dissolved out after half an hour 's digestion at 45 ' C. is only about one-eighth of the quantity dissolved after two hours .
This bears out the observations made with respect to the cold solutions of Jcoji , viz. , that the longer the time of digestion the greater was the amount of albuminoids dissolved .
It may reasonably be inferred from this that the albuminoids , as they exist in Jcoji , are not in a soluble form , or not so to any great amount ; but by the growth of the fungus the albuminoids of the rice have been brought into such a state that they are easily degraded by the action of water and rendered soluble .

except at temperature between 45 ' C. and 60 ' C. It then produces a slio-ht difference in the colour of the liquid , which becomes more red ; it reduces slightly the specific rotatory power , and increases the amount of glucose , owing partly to the hydration of the dextrin , and partly to the precipitation of a portion of the albuminoids , especially at the higher temperatures , when the liquid always becomes more or less turbid .
The following series of experiments ( Table VIII ) was made by Mr. Y. Watanabe , Graduate of the University of Tokio , and shows very clearly the effect of heating for one hour at the specified temperatures .

Below 45 ' C. the increase in the specific gravity was so small that it could not be determined with any certainty , and it will be seen that although there is an increase in the amount of dextrose the increase is very small .
Between 45 ' and 60 ' C. the increase in total solid matter and in glucose , and the diminution in the specific rotatory power , ai*e more marked .
From the columns showing the i ncrease in solid matter and glucose , it will be seen that the greatest change occurs at 55 ' C. : and this is borne out by the diminution in the specific rotatory power , which is greatest at that temperature .
The limits of greatest change are from 45 ' to 69 ' C. , for either below or above these points there is a sudden falling off in the increase of dextrose .

The amount of optical rotation was found , by observation , to be 15*8 scale-divisions , and the number calculated was 15*5 .

We thus find the calculated number of divisions of rotation to be +5*43 , against 5 divisions actually observed .

The progress of the inversion of the solution of cane-sugar will be seen from the following observations taken at successive intervals of time:\#151 ; A solution of cane-sugar containing 5*41 grms. in 100 cub. centims. , and giving in a 200 millims. tube an optical rotation of 33*1 scale-divisions ( equal to / \#187 ; =74 ' ) , was employed .
75 cub. centims. of this solution were mixed with 25 cub. centims. of a solution of which contained 0*365 grm. of solid matter , 0*253 grm. glucose , and which gave in a 200 millims. tube an optical rotation of 8 scale* divisions .
It may be remarked that from these and other experiments made with the same solution of Jcoji , it was found to be exceptionally weak in its inverting power .

) Action of Kdji Extract upon Maltose.\#151 ; The Japanese prepare a kind of sweetmeat by the action of malt-extract upon steamed rice or millet , and this product , called dme , from the examination of a large number of specimens , was found to contain from 68 to 94 per cent , of maltose.* A quantity of maltose was prepared from this according to the directions given by Mr. O'Sullivan , f but the purest product which could be obtained contained sufficient impurity to reduce the specific rotatory power from 150 ' to 144'*5 .
For the present purpose it was unnecessary to use an absolutely pure specimen , so this was employed without continuing the attempt to purify it completely:\#151 ; 100 cub. centims. of a solution of maltose containing T334 grm. of solid matter , and the equivalent of 0*855 grm. glucose were mixed with 100 cub. centims of kdji solution containing 3*572 grms. of solids and 2*14 grms. glucose , and the mixture heated for 2^ hours to ,35 ' to 40 ' C. The liquid after heating ( deduction having been made for the kdji solution present ) contained in 100 cub. centims. 1*374 grm. solid matter and 1*348 grm. glucose .
It is evident , therefore , that the solution of maltose had been completely converted into glucose .
A solution of maltose was prepared containing 2*68 grms. of solid matter in 100 cub. centims. , and which gave in a 200 millims. tube a rotation of 32*1 divisions , corresponding to a specific rotatory power P\#151 ; 144'*5 .
100 cub. centims. of this solution were mixed with 100 cub. centims. of kdji extract containing 2*3 grms. of solid matter , and giving in a 200 millims. tube an optical rotation of 10*5 scale-divisions .
This mixture was heated to 60 ' C. for 2 ?
r hours , then cooled and diluted to 250 cub. centims. at 15 ' C. It then contained 2*03 grms. of solid matter in 100 cub. centims. , and gave an optical rotation of 11*5 divisions .

79'*6 The hydrating action of hoji upon maltose is , therefore , very decided .
The action ceased at 79'*6 , probably because the activity of the hoji was exhausted at that high temperature .
The following series of experiments shows the progressive reduction in the specific rotatory power of the solution when observed at successive intervals of time .
100 cub. centims. of the same solution of maltose were mixed with 100 cub. centims. of a freshly prepared extract of hoji , which contained 2*424 grms. of solid matter in solution , and which gave an optical rotation of 11 divisions in a 200 millims. tube .
The mixture of maltose and hoji solutions was diluted to 500 cub. centims. at 15 ' C. , and after standing ten minutes a sample was withdrawn for analysis .
The remainder was placed in a water-bath heated to 45 ' C. , and samples were withdrawn after the lapse of thirty minutes , one hour , and two hours , by which time all the solution had been used up .
The numbers given are corrected for the hoji solution added .

There is no evidence at the end of two hours of the action of the hoji extract upon the maltose having been exhausted , and the fall in the specific rotatory power would doubtless have continued to 59 ' if the experiment had been allowed to continue longer .
The fact that hoji solution thus converts maltose into dextrose is evidence of the difference of this diastase from that contained in malt , which , according to the experiments of Brown and Heron , * has no action upon maltose .
It is a point of interest to * " Journal of the Chemical Society , " 1879 , Trans. , p. 648 .

observe that whilst cane-sugar yields invert sugar on hydration , its isomer maltose yields only dextrose , a fact which indicates a difference iu the chemical constitution of the two bodies , arising probably from the union of levulose and dextrose to form an ether in the case of cane-sugar , whilst in the case of maltose the ether is formed of two molecules of dextrose .

) Action of Koji Extract upon Dextrin\#151 ; A specimen of commercial dextrin was used , probably prepared by the action of heat upon starch , although its history was not known .
50 cub. centims. of a solution of this dextrin containing 2- grms. of solid matter , and having a specific rotary power , 174 ' , were mixed with 50 cub. centims. of solution of kojx , and the mixture heated for 1^ hours at a temperature of 45 ' C. After heating , the solution contained ( deduction having been made for the added ) 2 86 grms. solid matter , and possessed a specific rotatory power , 2 .
ihe activity of the koji solution was destroyed , because when an additional amount of koji solution was added , and the mixture heated for a longer time , the specific rotatory power of the dextrin products furtliei diminished to 85 ' .
This experiment , which has been confirmed by others , leaves no doubt that dextrin gradually becomes hydrated under the influence of the diastase of koji .
( 4 .
) Action of Koji Extract upon Gelatinised Starch .
'W hen extract of koji is added to thick starch-paste at the ordinary temperature of the air ( i.e. , from 15 to 20 ' C. ) , in about ten minutes the paste becomes very thin , but the solution does not become transparent .
When , however , the same experiment is made at any temperature Prof. R. W. Atkinson .
between 35 ' and 55 ' 0 .
, the paste becomes thinly liquid within a minute and a half , and is perfectly transparent in from five to ten minutes .
These results are obtained with a solution containing in 500 cub. centims. the soluble matter of 25 grms. of but it varies with different samples to some extent , and also with the same sample at different .
periods , the activity becoming less as the sample grows older .
If Jcoji solution of greater strength than that mentioned is employed , the hydrating action upon the maltose takes place so rapidly , that its formation may be overlooked .
For a long time , I was under the impression that no maltose was formed , and it was only by using much weaker solutions of Jcoji , that satisfactory evidence could be obtained of its production .
The following experiments will , I think , show that the first action of the Jcoji extract is to split up the starch molecules into maltose and dextrin , and that when the action is continued with a greater quantity of the active agent , the maltose is completely hydrated to dextrose , whilst if samples be taken at intermediate periods , the solution will be found to contain both maltose and dextrose .
In this respect , the Jcoji diastase differs markedly from malt extract , which Brown and Heron have shown to possess no action upon maltose .
It resembles , however , the diastatic ferment of the pancreas , which the same observers , * confirming the work of Musculus and De Mering , f have shown to effect the hydration of the maltose first formed .
The mode of analysis followed was essentially the same as that described in detail by Brown and Heron .
\#163 ; I will give in full the results of one experiment to illustrate the method .
A Jcoji solution was prepared by digesting for a short time 25 grms. of a freshly prepared sample of Jcoji in about 100 cub. centims. of water .
The liquid was then filtered , the residue digested with a fresh quantity of water , and the whole thrown upon the filter and washed , until the ' filtrate amounted nearly to 500 cub. centims. The solution was then diluted exactly to 500 cub. centims. at 16 ' C. The filtration occupied three or four hours , even with the assistance of a filter-pump , on account of the slimy nature of the insoluble matter .
The solution so made contained in 100 cub. centims. 1*46 grm. of solid matter , calculated from the specific gravity ( using the divisor 3'86 ) ; 1*0125 grm. of glucose , and caused an optical rotation of eight divisions in a 200 millims. tube .
This gives a specific rotatory power , p 8 x 0*242 __(56'*3 2 x 0*0146 5 grms. of starch , previously dried at 100 ' C. , were gelatinised with about 75 cub. centims. of water , the paste allowed to cool to 40 ' C. , then mixed with 25 cub. centims. of the Jcoji solution , and left for * " Chemical News , " xlii , p. 63 .

It was then rapidly heated to boiling cooled , and diluted to 250 cub. centims. 100 cSb .

of solid matter , and 0*68 grm. glucose , determined by weighing the cupric oxide after ignition .
The optical rotation in a 200 millims. tube was 32*4 scale-divisions .
As the solutions contained in 250 cubic centims. was 25 cub. centims. ( that is , one-tenth of the whole ) , we must deduct the weight of solid matter and glucose contained in 10 cub. centims. of the koji extract from the weights above found in 100 cub. centims. of the liquid .
The optical rotation must likewise be diminished by one-tenth the amount caused by the koji solution alone .

319 From the experiments described in an earlier part of this paper , which showed that the extract of Uji caused the hydration of maltose , it mio'ht at once be accepted as a fact that longer digestion of the starch products with the Uji solution would result in the complete removal of the maltose , only dextrose and dextrin remaining , the latter beino- much more slowly hydrated than maltose .
We cannot , indeed , expect any indications of definite chemical reactions occurring , because they would be disguised by the simultaneous hydration of the maltose The following experiments illustrate the complete removal of the maltose .

Having thus shown the nature of the reaction which occurs between starch-paste and the diastase of Uji , some experiments will next be Prof. R. W. Atkinson .

The mixture was allowed to stand at this temperature ( 4\#151 ; 10 ' C. ) with an occasional shaking , and samples were withdrawn at the specified times .
After making deductions for the the amount of the starch products was found to be as follows :_ Table X.\#151 ; Action of Koji Extract on Starch at 4\#151 ; 10'C .

It will be seen that in 164 hours the larger proportion of koji used has effected a reduction in the specific rotatory power greater than in 240 hours , with the smaller proportion , but the rapidity of change does not seem to be proportional to the quantity of koji used* The next two series were carried out in exactly the same way , but the temperature of the air varied between 10 and 15 0 .

In the last series , Table XIII , at the end of 72 hours the reduction in the specific rotatory power is not much greater than in the previous experiments after 48 hours , although to all appearance the conditions were identical .
But it is probable that different portions even of the same lot of koji differ somewhat in activity .
Another possible cause of difference is suggested by Carve C. The inclination of that curve between 21 ?

the average inclination after the first rapid fall is over .
This was undoubtedly due to the temperature between these two observations having been higher than the average taken over the whole time .
During the greater part of the time the temperature was not higher than 10 ' C. , except in the middle of the day , when it stood about 1.5 ' C. The two observations at 21^ hours and 26 hours were made On the Diastase of Koji .

No certain conclusions can , I tbink , be drawn as to the reaction heinff expressed by any definite chemical equation ; there is at first in all cases a very rapid fall ; and , in Curve CT the specificrotatory ^ower , after twenty minutes , nearly agrees with that required by Brown \#171 ; md Heron 's equation No. 7 , before alluded to ; but , after this , the absorption of water by the maltose would make the curve very regular , and it would show no breaks in its continuity .
The two following series of experiments were conducted at a tem-perature of 40 ' C. , the flask containing the mixture being immersed in a water-bath kept at that temperature , and samples were taken at certain intervals of time .
The solution used for determining the total solid matter from its specific gravity was rapidly cooled by means o ice and the other portion in which the specific rotatory power was to be determined was poured into a dry flask containing a little salicylic acid , as recommended by Brown and Heron , and also rapidly cooled .
Deduction was made for the amount of koji solution added , as in the previous experiments .
The two series of experiments differ only in the relative proportions of koji and starch used\#151 ; that in the first series being 5 gnus , of kSji to 10 grms. of starch ; and , in the second , 10 grms. of koji to the same weight of starch .

The influence of a greater proportion of the solution will again be noticed in the much greater fall in specific rotatory power in a given time ; and further , that in neither of these curves is any very sudden bending to be observed .
The inclination of the curve during the first half an hour is certainly greater than it is afterwards ; but , although in neither case has the activity of the diastase been destroyed , the bending does not occur at the same specific rotatory power .
This is doubtless owing to the action of the diastase upon the maltose first formed , which at this temperature is rapidly hydrated to dextrose .
The hydration is more rapid in the case of the experiments represented by Curve F , although in other respects the two curves show a remarkable similarity .

rotatory power remains practically stationary at 164-168 ' for If hour , then , when a fresh addition of the extract was made , the curve rapidly falls to 131''8 , at which point it again remains fixed , if we assume , as is probable , that the result at three hours is erroneous .
The first stoppage , and doubtless also the second , was caused by the exhaustion of the activity of the kdji , and not to the decomposition of the starch at that point according to any definite chemical equation , because the action goes on immediately after the addition of a fresli quantity of diastase , and ceases after about the same time .
At 60 ' 0 .
, therefore , the activity of the diastase is very quickly destroyed , and at 70 ' C. the action is so small that no satisfactory determinations could be made .
The extract of 10 grms. of previously heated to 70 ' 0 .
, was added to starch-paste containing 2 grms. of dry starch .
After fifteen minutes the solution diluted to 250 cub. centims. only contained 0'40 grm. of solid matter , and caused a scarcely perceptible rotation of the ray of polarised light .
We may , therefore , conclude that at some point between 60 ' and 70 ' C. , the diastase of koji is destroyed .
The experiments described do not allow us to conclude that the starch molecule breaks up in a definite manner under the influence of koji diastase , as appears to be the case with the starch molecule under the influence of malt diastase ( O'Sullivan , Brown and Heron , \amp ; c. ) , but they do not contradict the supposition , and the results are just such as might be expected , knowing the comparatively energetic action which the koji solution has upon dextrin , and especially upon maltose .
The diastase of koji resembles that of malt in one respect , that its activity is lessened by the presence of certain bodies , such as common salt .
In preparation for an investigation into the chemistry of the " Soy " manufacture , Mr. Watanabe made some experiments upon the influence of varying amounts of common salt upon the activity of the koji solution .
In each experiment 5 grms. of dry starch were gelatinised , and when cold the given amount of common salt was added .
The whole occupied about 150 cub. centims. The required amount of koji extract was then added and the mixture left for one hour .
At the end of that time the solution was diluted to 250 cub. centims. and filtered .
The results give the cupric oxide reducing power of the solid matter in solution , and the specific rotatory power , both corrected for the salt and koji extract previously added .

No other observations have , to my knowledge , been made upon the effect of moulds in transforming starch into sugar , although M. Gay on ( " Count .
Rendus , " tom .
86 , p. 52 ) has shown that cane-sugar is inverted by certain fungi , such as JPenicillium glaucum and Aspergillus niger .
M. Pasteur , in his interesting work on " Beer , " * has drawn attention to the possible employment of moulds in industry on account of the power they possess of destroying organic matter .
He says :\#151 ; ITn jour viendra cependant , j'en suis persuade , ou les moisissures interviendront dans certaines operations de l'industrie par leur pro-prietes de destruction de la matiere organique .

" The industrial employment of fungi under consideration is an illustration of this , for , although the organic matter of the rice is not completely destroyed it is removed to some extent m the form of carbonic acid , and the albuminoids , though not converted into am-monia , are undoubtedly degraded , and brought into such a form that they can be dissolved out in great measure by water .
^ It is doubtless to the presence of albuminoids in this form that koji owes its remarkable action upon gelatinised starch .
XY.__Change which the Bice Grain Undergoes the Groivth of the Fungus .
What is the nature of the change which occurs in the conversion of rice into koji ?
As the grains have been exposed for a period of four or five hours to the vapour of boiling water , and further , as the embryo has been completely removed , it cannot be of the nature ot germination .
The use of the fungus-spores and the growth of the mycelium indicate that the alteration in ' properties is connected with the growth of the mould , and it is probably of a similar character to that described by Brown and Heron , which takes place in a solution of barley under the influence of the yeast cell .
They say : " An aqueous extract of barley , which is submitted for a few hours at a temperature of 30 ' C. to the action of ordinary yeast has its power of transforming starch much increased by this treatment ... ... ... ... ... .
It is evident , that the growing yeast cell is capable of inducing certain modifications in the albuminoids which , during the ordinary process of germination , are brought about by the action of the living vegetable cell itself."* In this case we may suppose that the yeast cell in absorbing nitrogenous food , does so by attacking the insoluble albuminoids contained in the barley , and having taken what it requires , leaves the rest behind in a degraded state , in such a form that water easily dissolves it .
In the formation of koji , we may assume that something of the same sort occurs , the growing fungus attacks the insoluble albuminoids of the rice , and in proportion as they are brought into a soluble state , so does the diastatic property of the rice increase .
The principal aliment of the fungns is , doubtless , the starch granule , and this will be found to be the case on examining the grain microscopically .
The outer layers of the koji grain are loose ; the mycelium penetrates between the cells everywhere , but in the centre the cells are horny , and no starch granules are to be distinguished .
The chemical change which takes place may be seen by comparing the analysis of rice with that of koji .
The rice , before the removal of the thin skin , has been examined by a number of chemists , and as * " Journal of the Chemical Society , " Trans. , p. 653 , 1879 .

all the analyses very nearly agree , the grain may be considered not to vary very much in composition .

A sample analysed in the University Laboratory , contained 16*7 per cent , of albuminoids calculated on the dried substance , and other observers have found from 15 to 16*4 per cent. It therefore contains about twice as much as the average of the whole husked grain , which must be rendered proportionately poorer by its removal .
In one sample of the cleaned rice used in making Jcdji , the amount of albuminoids calculated on the dried grain was found to be 6*47 per cent. The following is a complete analysis of Icoji ; unfortunately I have not the analysis of the rice from which it was made to compare with it .

331 water from hoji .
Referring always to the material dried at 100 ' C. , the total albuminoids in hoji amount to 9'84 per cent. , whilst 8'34 per cent , was found in solution .
In the case of rice , the amount of albuminoids dissolved by water is very small ; in one specimen of cleaned rice examined , it was 1*38 per cent. , the total albuminoids amounting to 6'47 per cent. It is evident , therefore , that one change effected by the growth of the fungus is to increase the proportion of soluble nitrogen .
If the total amount of albuminoids in hoji be compared with the amount in rice , it will be seen that it is greater in the former than in the latter , evidence of the removal of the carbohydrates , alluded to in Section I. The broken grains which result from the cleaning of the common rice are also converted into hoji .
As the bran is mixed with the broken grains , the whole contains a larger proportion of albuminoids than the original rice .
The following analyses were made of the ^broken grains , and of the hoji formed from them .
In both cases the results are given upon the material dried at 100 C. Table XIX.\#151 ; Composition of Koji prepared from Broken Grains .

Beyond the recognition of this alteration in the solubility of the \#166 ; albuminoids , and the related increase in the amount of solid matter dissolved , I have been able to come to no definite conclusion .
I hope , however , to have the opportunity of examining more in detail the nature of the individual albuminoids present in hoji , but thus far , that is a part of the problem I have not touched .
It is , indeed , generally believed , that the converting effect of diastase is owing to the existence of certain albuminoids in solution , and the results obtained in this research go to show that the active properties of hoji are accompanied by the presence of soluble albuminoids , but to go beyond this , and to show how , by the growth of the fungus , this change is effected , is a problem which , however interesting , lies beyond my power .
