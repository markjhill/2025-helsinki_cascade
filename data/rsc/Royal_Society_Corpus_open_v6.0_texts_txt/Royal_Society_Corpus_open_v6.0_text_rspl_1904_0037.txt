) ( Abstract .
) This paper contains an account of the construction and measurement of eleven mercury standards of resistance at the National Physical Laboratory , Teddington .
It is divided into three parts : ( a ) theory of construction ; ( b ) determination of the mechanical constants : measurement of resistance , and deductions .
( a ) Theory of Construction .
The definition of the international ohm necessitates the determination of a length and a mass only , the resistance of a uniform column of mercury of length , L. cm .
, and of mass , W. gr. , being IT .
international ohms .
W 106-32 The difficulties of accurately evaluating L2/ W are discussed in the paper .
The method finally adopted for the determination of this ratio differs from those which have been previously employed .
A quantity proportional to L2/ W was first of all determined for different , but practically similar portions of a selected tube .
The tube was then broken into three parts , the positions of fracture being carefully chosen , so that a mercury column occupying the central portion should ha\ e a nominal resistance of 1 ohm .
The ratio L2/ W for this central poi tion was calculable from the previous observations .
It is shown that this method admits of measurements of a high degree of accuracy , while all the operations involved are of a simple nature .
The effect of liquid and gaseous films in contact with the glass is briefly discussed .
If the same cycle of operations is always adhered to , it is shown that such films produce no disturbing effects .
The fact that the axis of a tube may be undulatory in character , is proved to be a very serious obstacle to an accurate computation of the resistance of a mercury column .
Thus , it is quite possible for the radius of curvature at any part of the axis to be as small as 40 cm .
, and for the maximum displacement of the curve from a straight axis to be 0'015 mm. only , and yet , under such circumstances , the computed resistance is 0*0036 per cent , greater than that calculated by the usual 240 Mr. F. E. Smith .
On of [ Mar. 10 formula .
If such an axis were projected and examined , the cury could not be distinguished by the eye from a straight line .
The correction for conical form was obtained by a method ver , similar to those previously employed by other observers .
( b ) Determination of the Mechanical Constants .
The lengths of the mercury columns , and of the tubes , wen measured in a water bath comparator by Mr. B. F. E. Keeling , tht temperature of the mercury and of the glass being accurately knowi to 0''02 C. The mass of the mercury was determined with a probabh error of about 00005 per cent. These determinations enabled the mean cross-sections of different parts of the tube to be evaluated .
Fron the results , the mean cross-section of the standard portion was deduced , and , finally , that length of a uniform mercury column of similar cross section that would have a resistance of 1 international ohm .
The consistency of the results obtained from different fillings of the tubes , each thread of mercury occupying a slightly different position , maj best be judged from the results of actual observations .
The following values are for the first three standards constructed .
The horizontal lines in the table represent separate fillings of the three tubes:\#151 ; Standard .

59-0337 " 63-5484 " The results withi the remaining eight tubes are equally good .
( c ) Measurement of Resisand Deductions .
The standards were erected in three fashions .
In the first of these , two other glass tubes were connected to the ends of each standard by means of a special connector .
The ends of the tubes thus brought into contact were of the same cross-section , and the shapes of the sections were also identical .
An adjustment was provided for , which insured the absence of internal irregularities at the junctions .
Thin pieces of platinum foil , interposed at the points of union , acted as potential leads , and enabled the resistance to be measured .
The value thus obtained was for a column of mercury completely filling the tube , and terminated by planes at the ends of the tube .
this mode of erection answers capitally with care , but many precautions have to be taken .
The second and third modes of fitting up the standards introduced 904 .

The ends of the tubes passed ato comparatively large vessels containing mercury , into which two ; ads were introduced .
For the measurement of resistance , three methods were employed ; he Kelvin double bridge , the potentiometer , and the Carey Foster-ridge .
The last of these methods is shown to be subject to a onsiderable error when mercury standards are measured .

A comparison with the results obtained by Dr. Glazebrook in 1888 for the specific resistance of mercury indicates that the unit of resistance , as used at the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge , in 1888 , may still be recovered .
