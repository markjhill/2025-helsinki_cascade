A paper was then read , entitled , " On the number of Primitive Colorific Rays into which White Light may be separated .
" By Paul Cooper , Esq. Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. Sec. R.S. From a consideration of the circumstances in which white light is decomposed bythe prism , in different experiments , and of the various appearances of the spectra which result , the author is led to the opinion that the primary colours composing white light are not seven , as conceived by Newton ; nor four , as supposed by Wollas ?
ton ; but only three : and that these three are not red , yellow , and blue , as imagined by Brewster , but red , green , and violet ; the first and last forming the terminal parts of the spectrum , and the green occupying an intermediate position ; and the various tints which intervene being the result of superpositions , in various quantities , of these respective primary colours .
He pursues the consequences of this hypothesis , applying it to a great variety of forms of experiment , not only by the direct observation of beams of refracted light , but by viewing the prismatic spectrum through different media , capable of absorbing each of the primitive colours in different degrees : and he finds the results to accord exactly with the hypothesis he proposes , and on which he therefore concludes that their true explanation must be founded .
He conceives that the errors of preceding experimentalists have arisen from their neglecting to take into account the effects of diffraction , which introduces considerable confusion into the results .
