] It was on the 24th of April that Dr. Herschel first saw the new planet Vesta ; but though he saw her again on the 25th , he could not determine which of several stars he noted was the planet , for want of sufficient motion at that time .
He examined her at that time with a power of 460 , but could not distinguish anything in her appearance different from surrounding stars of equal brightness .
