" By the Rev. Henry Moseley , M.A. , F.R.S. , Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy in King 's College .
The object which the author proposes to accomplish in the construction of this machine , is to determine mechanically the products , quotients , logarithms , squares , and other powers of the natural numbers , by means of combinations of greater simplicity than have hi ?
therto been applied to the purposes of mechanical calculation .
The paper is accompanied by a figure illustrating the principle of the ma ?
chine , but not representing the mechanical details of its construction .
An outline is then given of the essential parts of the instrument , and of the theory of their operation .
