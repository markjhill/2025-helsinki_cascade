I good obselvalions be ithout of Mr. E. J. Stone on Magnetical June 1 kind for the instruments or the observer , although at a conbiderable cost time the comfort of those engnged upon .
The gre iLtest trouble from the ction of the wind upon the instruments , more particularly upon the dip-instrument ; but by patiently aiting ortuuities the injurious effects rising from this catlse be very uearly , if not quitc ninated .
I decided ffiso , ftcr some hesitation , to no assistnnt ith me .
I nxious to avoid unnecessary expense , to obtain great fi.eedom for about the country as possible .
I only bsolutely r some one to entcr the times from a chronometer to the nearest hadf-second ; { I found , fter a cnreful series of experiments upon the point , my vife could do this without any difficulty .
The elror of these time tions does not appear to exceed tenths of second ; and it ould be very difficuIt , ith a illed { ssistant , to obtain , ulder the circumstances of these atioJlS , a much greater degree of .
the lstrumental equipment consisted of : " " Dip , , by DoYer ; Unifilar 1 nriation , and intensity instrumeut combined , by Elliotb Brothers ; a ve-inch Theodolite , for the determination of the udes , loed times , and absolute ilzimuths of malks ; aneroid omeler ; thermometer ; and a pocket chronometer only tn persons and this equipment , it as possible to } freely boul the country a , and with luxury in waggon .
I knew th a chronometel could not be trusted to cnrry ccurate time over such a country as Namaqualand without , at least , special which were not ) to me mder the cironmstances of the case .
I arranged therefore for the determination of local time with the theodolite , and for the of the absolute azimuths of the with the same theodolite immedintely before or fter the determinations of locaI time .
The ill fects of a trip or of the ohronometer ) thus eliminated .
This precaution its found necessary .
The chronometer has stopI)heJl gone again on from the eadful eing of the carts or aggons o cr the rocky roads , and httS on some occasions tripped some seconds from merely being carried about the pocket or hand .
The chrollometer dead-beat pement does not all well fitted rough ork of the kind , and good escnpe- meant old be much .
The chronometer used has a very steady rate when not about , and not much rate , hcn at rest , the effects of the journey .
The gl.eatest inconveuience experienoed in the use of the instrtlments wns the sional of the suspension-threads and the loss of time getting the out of torsion .
After } eral accidents of the ] , 1 nsed thrce instend of two eads of suspellsion ; but incon)elliently ] , and the loss of time in getting threads out of torsion considerable .

The position was not altogether a favour able one for lnngnetical observations .
I had but little choice of stations I fear some little local magnetic lces in the obseryations here , such that the elements might } been found to have differel somewhat with comparatively small shift in geographica position .
I should therefore have been glad to have supplemented thes$ obseryations with a set on the Bushman flats , the bed of a recent with numerous islands ( kopies ) ; but this could not have been done with out proper arrangements for the supply of water .

I desire to oommunioate to the Puoyal Society tho I have , by severing the cerebral hemispheres in definite direotio ] in Man , and also in some of the hihel by then ighing the rated portions , not only arrived at some teresting and important results as to the size of those portions in different animals and in Man , but I am enabled to state that this method , applied to the brains of individnals of different race , sex , , oducation , and occupation , seems likely to furnish means of inyestigating peculiarities in the human cerebrum .
I propose shortly to communicnte my results to the Society .
