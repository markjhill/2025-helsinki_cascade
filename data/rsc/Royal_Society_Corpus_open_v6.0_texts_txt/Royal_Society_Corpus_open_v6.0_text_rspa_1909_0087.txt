( Communicated by Prof. H. A. Miers , F.R.S. Received June 4 , \#151 ; Read November 25 , 1909 .
) The only measurements of the electric conductivity of hydrogen fluoride which have been recorded appear to be those of OstwalcL* These were made at low concentrations , of which the highest was 0*5 per cent. The present work was undertaken with a vieAr to obtaining figures for the electric conductivity of all concentrations up to the anhydrous acid , and also for checking Ostwald 's figures .
In the course of the work it also became necessary to determine the density of hydrogen fluoride for all concentrations .
Preparation of Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride.\#151 ; The method adopted was that of heating potassium hydrogen fluoride , which had been heated at 100 ' for 14 hours and was then dried in vacuo over strong sulphuric acid for five or six days .
The apparatus employed differed slightly from that used by Gore .
It consisted of a platinum bottle of 250 c.c. capacity , in the neck of which was ground a bent platinum condensing tube 500 mm. long and 10 mm. diameter .
This condenser consisted of two parts , which were ground * ' Pliysikaliscli-Chemisehe Tabellen , ' Landolt-Bornstein , ed. 1905 .

131 to fit air-tight .
The upper part was 410 mm. , and the lower was 100 mm. long .
In the lower portion an escape tube was welded , which was 180 mm. long and 4 mm. in diameter .
The receiver was ground to fit the lower part of the condenser , and was a platinum bottle of 100 c.c. capacity .
A platinum stopper fitted either of the bottles .
Each bottle fitted either end of the platinum condenser .
An outer copper tube , measuring 320 mm. in length and 38 mm. in the widest part , narrowing to 12 mm. at the ends , was attached to the platinum condenser by rubber tubing .
This copper tube had a small exit tube and a large upright cylindrical funnel 160 mm. high , in which a freezing mixture could be poured .
Fig. 1 .
This part of our apparatus was made to our specifications by Messrs. Johnson and Mat they .
This apparatus could be easily taken to pieces and cleaned .
The joints were all air-tight .
It was found at the outset that when potassium hydrogen fluoride was heated in the distilling flask , a certain amount of salt spurted and reached the condenser .
To minimise this , a small , hollow , perforated cone was made from stout platinum foil , which was placed in the neck of the distilling flask , with the apex downwards .
With the apparatus as above described , hydrogen fluoride was made in the following manner:\#151 ; A weighed quantity of the acid salt , dried as above described , was placed in the distilling flask , and the outer copper condenser was filled with a freezing mixture .
The distilling flask was then heated , and when two or three drops of acid had fallen , the receiver was attached to the condenser and K 2 132 Prof. Hill and Dr. Sirkar .
Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , surrounded with crushed ice .
The distilling ilask was heated to dull redness and then the receiver detached and stoppered .
This acid , thus prepared , was then redistilled as follows :\#151 ; The condenser was thoroughly washed and ignited , as also the original distilling flask ; the last washing was performed with conductivity water .
The bottle containing the hydrogen fluoride was now made the distilling flask , and the acid gently distilled into the larger platinum bottle .
As a rule , distillation took place rapidly enough without the application of heat ; on very cold days the distilling flask was placed in a vessel of water at about 25 ' C. Purity of the Acid.\#151 ; The acid fluoride was a fine crystalline specimen from Kahlbaum .
Qualitative tests gave no evidence of chlorides or sulphates .
A platinum dish was ignited and weighed , and several cubic centimetres , of hydrogen fluoride added .
This was evaporated , and the dish again ignited and weighed .
There was no increase in weight , consequently the acid contained no solid residue .
Determination of the Strength of the Acid when diluted.\#151 ; The method used for titrating hydrogen fluoride is by means of potassium hydrate with phenol-phthalein as indicator.* This method was adopted by us after experiments with other indicators , and gave thoroughly consistent results when used as follows:\#151 ; The potash solution was used in normal , deeinormal , and centinormal concentrations , and was prepared from potassium hydrate free from carbonate .
This was freshly made from time to time so as to prevent formation of silicate , and was standardised against sulphuric acid of approximately the same dilution .
The usual precautions were taken to keep it free from carbon dioxide .
Titrations were made in a white porcelain dish , which was thickly covered with paraffin wax .
This was found to be greatly preferable to a platinum dish .
A platinum spatula was used as a stirrer .
Acid was poured into the dish , and two drops of indicator added ; titration was taken as complete when a pink tint was manifested .
The weaker solutions of potassium hydrate were used at the end of the titration .
In our preliminary experiments we had great difficulty in weighing out the acid before titration .
The boiling point of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is 19 ' C. , and at high concentrations we always experienced loss by evaporation during the weighings and subsequent operations .
The following plan proved satisfactory :\#151 ; The smaller platinum bottle was cleaned and about 10 grammes of cooled pure water placed in it .
A small platinum funnel was constructed and * Haga and Osaka , ' J. C. S. Trans.,5 1895 ; Zellner , ' Monatshefte,5 1897 , p. 18 \gt ; Winteler , ' Zeit .

133 placed in the neck of the bottle , which was then weighed : a quantity of the acid was then poured through the funnel .
This quantity depended upon the concentration .
After adding the acid the bottle was again weighed as quickly as possible .
The funnel was now washed down with more water and the diluted acid transferred to the waxed porcelain dish and titrated .
By this method loss from evaporation and spurting on dilution was completely overcome , as the following results show .

Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , difference over 43 samples was Oil .
Out of the 43 samples the difference between two titrations exceeded 0*30 only in five cases .
The Water for Conductivity Measurements.\#151 ; Distilled water was boiled in a large Jena flask , and the steam passed first through a solution of boiling permanganate of potash acidified with sulphuric acid and then through permanganate rendered alkaline with caustic potash .
The steam issuing from the last flask passed through a trap in which any suspended impurities were caught , and in which partial condensation took place .
The flasks and trap were connected by wooden corks and rubber joints .
All joints were made as short as possible and slipped over tubes which touched one another .
The trap was fitted with a self-emptying syphon arrangement as shown in the figure .
Condensation was brought about in a hard glass tube surrounded by cold water , and the pure water collected in a Jena flask .
The whole apparatus had been in use for the preparation of conductivity water for three years , and gave water of a maximum conductivity of 2 x 10"6 at 20 ' .
No correction for this was applied . .
The Conductivity.\#151 ; This was determined by Ivohl-rausch 's telephone method in a paraffin cell .
The parts of the apparatus will now be described .
The Bridge Wire.\#151 ; The bridge consisted of a platinum-iridium wire , a little more than a metre in length , stretched between two brass castings by means of stretching screws .
The wire was insulated from the castings by vulcanite blocks and made an air line .
To each end of the wire was soldered a copper rod of 5 mm. diameter , which was bent so as to pass into mercury cups behind the wire .
The total length of the bridge wire , including the ends , which were measured in terms of the resistance of the wire , was 1015 mm. The wire was stretched several months before any measurements were made .
The slider was a short piece of platinum-iridium wire similar to the bridge wire , passing through and over a small vulcanite block .
This was mounted on a brass plate fitted with three pointed feet , two of which slid between two parallel glass rods fixed to the table in contact with one another , while the third foot ran along a strip of plate glass also mounted on the table .
The short platinum-iridium wire passed over the block of vulcanite at right angles to the bridge wire , and a very slight depression of the latter caused 1909 .

135 contact .
The depression was made by means of a vulcanite rod mounted in a little vulcanite frame .
The moment pressure was released the wire resumed its original position , and contact was broken .
The distance between the two wires was less than 1 mm. , so that the sagging of the wire on making contact was negligible .
In the brass plate there was a celluloid window with a fine line scratched on it , which was used for reading the scale over which it lay .

The slider worked excellently , running with great ease and smoothness on the glass rods and plate .
The bridge wire was calibrated after it had been stretched for three months .
The method used was that of Carey Foster .
The gauge was a short length of platinum-iridium wire soldered on to copper rods for use in mercury cups ; a copper strip was the connector and was interchangeable with the gauge .
The wire was very uniform , the greatest and lowest resistances for 1 mm. of wire being 00003174 and 0*0003163 ohm , while over the middle of the bridge ( the part on which the slider was used ) , the difference was half this amount .
The Commutator.\#151 ; It was found impossible to get any distinct minimum on the telephone with high concentrations of hydrogen fluoride when a small induction coil was used to alternate the current .
With very dilute concentrations the induction coil worked well .
A commutator of the revolving drum pattern was made , giving 16 reversals per revolution .
It was turned at the rate of 8 revolutions per second , and consequently the number of reversals per second was 128 .
The commutator was in a different tz .

Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , part of the building , and the current taken into the laboratory by leads running side by side .
With the concentrations giving very little resistance there was still a difficulty in obtaining a sharp minimum .
Various devices were tried for improving the sharpness , such as introducing extra and liquid resistances , but they were of little use .
It was found , however , that two points at which the sound began to increase rapidly on either side of the minimum could easily be read .
The mean of these was taken as the correct reading .
Several readings were taken for each measurement and the mean of these adopted .
The Besistance Box.\#151 ; This was a box of manganin coils supplied by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company and standardised by the National Physical Laboratory at 20 ' C. The coils ranged from 1 ohm to 4000 ohms .
The box resistance was 0*001 ohm and was allowed for .
The Conductivity Cell.\#151 ; Preliminary experiments seemed to show that fluorspar was not affected by the acid , and a cell was cut out of a large block of fluorspar .
This , however , was found to be appreciably dissolved by the strong acid .
Paraffin wax of high melting point was then tried , the cell being cut out of a large block .
This cracked and leaked when cooled to 0 ' C. Bees ' wax was found to be acted upon by the strong acid , while sulphur cracked when cooled to 0 ' C. At last paraffin wax of low melting point ( 40'*4 C. ) was used , and gave most satisfactory results .
The wax was melted and filtered through filter paper into a beaker a little larger than the size of the cell required ; it was kept melted in it for half an hour , and while hot was placed in a desiccator , which was then exhausted .
By this means the air dissolved in the wax was driven off .
Without this precaution the air caused small holes in the cell , causing leakage .
When quite cold the glass beaker containing the wax was put into slightly warm water and the wax block quickly removed from it .
A cylindrical hole of the size required was cut in this , and a lip moulded at the mouth to facilitate pouring out the liquid from the cell .
It was then smoothed by a warm glass rod .
A circular wooden ring with four holes was firmly fixed near the top of the cell by means of wax .
Pour stout silken cords well covered with paraffin wax were tied to the four holes in the wooden ring and served for suspending the cell in the thermostat .
The capacity of the cell was 18 c.c. , but 8 c.c. were sufficient to completely cover the electrodes .
The Electrodes.\#151 ; These are fixed , and occupied vertical positions parallel to one another about 5 mm. apart .
They consist of two small circular platinum plates welded to stout platinum wires , and these in turn were 1909 .
] and Density of Solutions of Hydrogen Fluoride .
137 sealed into narrow glass tubes with about 1 cm .
of wire inside the tubes .
Their relative positions were fixed by sealing the glass tubes together .
The tubes with their ends stopped by pieces of cork were then suspended in the middle of a boiling tube with the electrodes upwards .
Melted soft paraffin wax was then poured into the boiling tube until the whole of the platinum wire except a few millimetres near the electrodes was covered with paraffin .
While the wires were still hot , about half of the uncovered portion of each wire was touched repeatedly with fine paraffin sticks .
Great care was taken to keep any paraffin from touching the platinum plates .
The whole was then left to cool in an exhausted desiccator , and when cold was taken out of the boiling tube as a paraffin rod .
The wax was cut away until the ends of the glass tubes were exposed .
The corks were then removed , and the tubes used as mercury cups .
A triangular paraffin lid was then attached to the paraffin rod at the height required .
The lid was made exactly to fit the top of the cell .
The wax near the electrodes was then smoothed by touching with hot wire , and made into the shape as shown in fig. 4 .
The electrodes were very rigid .
The cell proved a very bad conductor of heat , several experiments with water , potassium chloride solution ; and hydrogen fluoride showed that it took four to five hours for the cell to assume the temperature of the thermostat .
The cell was therefore placed in the thermostat overnight .
The acid was introduced after 12 hours , having been previously cooled to 0 ' by placing the stoppered platinum bottle in melting ice .
The acid and cell were then left in the thermostat for four or five hours , when the measurement of its resistance was made .
Constant of the Cell.\#151 ; The cell with the electrodes after their manufacture was washed thoroughly with conductivity water and dried .
A strong solution of hydrogen fluoride was then put into it and kept overnight .
It was then again thoroughly washed with conductivity water and the electrodes were coated with platinum black by the electrolysis of platinum tetrachloride as recommended by Kohlrausch .
After platinising , the electrodes were thoroughly washed in several changes of water , and then left in conductivity water for some hours .
Further , to make sure that the electrodes and the cell were clean , the resistances of two samples of conductivity water were determined .
The constant of the cell was then determined at 0 ' C. by using a 138 Prof. Hill and Dr. Sirkar .
Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , decinormal solution of pure potassium chloride dissolved in conductivity water .
This value for the constant of the cell was redetermined from time to time , and was found to be unaltered .
During the progress of the work these electrodes were broken up and remade .
The idea was to see whether the glass inside had been affected by the acid , and it was found to be unetched .
As a matter of fact , two sets of electrodes were made originally , and one of these ( A ) was remade three times , and the other ( B ) twice .
The constants were:\#151 ; A. Date .

0*38343 J The Thermostat.\#151 ; Owing to the extreme volatility of hydrogen fluoride at high concentrations , it was necessary to determine the conductivity of acid of all strengths from 30 to 100 per cent , at 0 ' C. Below 30 per cent , the conductivities were measured at 0 ' and also at 18 ' , except in the case of acids whose concentration was less than 0*5 per cent. , when measurements were made at 18 ' C. only .
The apparatus used at 0 ' consisted of a large bell jar of 7 litres capacity , in which was placed a gas jar internally coated with soft paraffin , and fitted with a large rubber stopper also similarly coated .
Through the stopper two narrow glass tubes passed , the lower ends of which were flush with the surface of the cork .
Two wider tubes sealed at one end were let into the top of the stopper to act as mercury cups .
A metal hook was fastened to the lower end of the stopper , for suspension of the cell .
All exposed glass and metal was coated with paraffin .
A hole in the stopper could be used for the insertion of a thermometer , and was kept stoppered by a plug of wax .
The cell already described was suspended in the gas jar from the hook by means of its waxed silken cords .
Two copper wires , silk covered and soaked in wax , passed through the tubes in the rubber stopper down into the mercury cup terminals of the electrodes .
The other ends of these wires were 1909 .

139 bent into the mercury cups in the stopper .
This enabled connections to be made and broken with ease .
The gas jar was surrounded by crushed ice in the large bell jar .
For measurements at 18 ' the method adopted was similar to the above , except that water at 18 ' replaced the ice .
The temperature of the laboratory was about 20 ' during these measurements and the use of a self-regulating thermostat thus rendered practically impossible .
A thermometer reading to tenths of a degree was suspended in the water , and a similar thermometer in the gas jar .
It was found easy to keep the temperature in the latter vessel constant to less than one-tenth of a degree by the simple expedient of adding very small pieces of ice to the water from time to time .
The water during an experiment never varied by more than + 0o,3 from 18 ' , and the air temperature in the gas jar gave no appreciable variation from 18 ' when once that temperature had been assumed by the cell .
The cell being such a bad conductor of heat , there is no doubt that the temperature of the acid was actually 18 ' , a fact which was confirmed by immersing the bulb of a thermometer covered with soft wax and cooled to 18 ' C. in the acid after each conductivity measurement .
In the case of measurements at 18 ' , the acid was put into the cell at the room temperature ( about 20 ' ) .
The water in the thermostat was cooled to 16 ' and allowed to rise gradually to 18 ' , at which temperature it was maintained .
The temperature of the cell was constant after about two hours .
, General Arrangement.\#151 ; The switchboard allowed of the ready interchange of the cell and resistance box from the left gap to the right gap of the bridge , and vice versa .
The telephone was a small one , such as ordinarily used for conductivity measurements , and was of Fritz Kohler 's make .
The resistances of the leads to the resistance box and cell were measured : the former was 0*0010 ohm , and the latter , including the resistance of the platinum wires to the electrodes , was 0*0141 ohm .
These corrections were applied in all calculations .
The resistance box was packed in cotton wool , and the temperature varied very little from 20 ' , the variation not being more than + 2'*5 .
No correction was applied for temperature .
The Method of Experiment.\#151 ; The cell was well washed with conductivity water and dried for 12 hours in an exhausted desiccator over sulphuric acid .
It was then placed overnight in the thermostat at 0 ' .
The acid was made also overnight and kept in the platinum bottle in ice .
At 6 a.m. the acid was poured into the cell , and during the morning , generally about 11 a.m. , a measurement of conductivity taken .
The acid was then titrated as above described .
Titrations were always made from the acid in the cell .
In the case of acid of from 80 to 100 strength , fused calcium chloride was 140 Prof. Hill and Dr. Sirkar .
Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , placed at the bottom of the glass jar in which the cell was suspended .
The hydrogen fluoride was not always freshly made for each conductivity measurement , but occasionally acid from the cell was diluted .
This was done by pouring the acid back into the platinum bottle and then adding a little water , keeping the bottle cool with ice .
As a rule , only one experiment was made per diem , except in the cases of the very dilute acid , which were treated as follows:\#151 ; A pipette of rather less than 5 c.c. capacity was coated inside and outside with paraffin wax , and then calibrated .
It was found to discharge exactly 4*40 c.c. As the acid did not wet the walls of the pipette , no other was used .
Two pipettes full of dilute acid at 18 ( whose strength had been determined ) were discharged into the cell , and the conductivity was measured .
A pipette full of acid was removed , the pipette washed well with pure water , and a pipette full of water added to the cell , and the conductivity again measured .
The water used for dilution , the washing water , and the pipette were kept in special Jena tubes in the thermostat , so that the added water might vary from 18 ' by as little as possible .
One hour was allowed for the cell to resume the temperature of 18 ' .
In the bridge readings the maximum divergence between the two extreme readings in any one set was 1 per cent. , but the average of the extremes is much less than this , being less than 0*3 per cent. As in each case several readings were made and the mean of these taken as the true reading : the error is probably less than this .
The following curve was plotted from the values obtained for the specific conductivity .
The actual figures are given in a subsequent table for convenience in arrangement .
Density Determinations.\#151 ; In order to calculate the molecular conductivity it is necessary to know the volume of liquid containing a gramme-molecule of acid .
Volume measurements with acids of high concentration would be extremely difficult , and no density determinations are available for acid of more than about 50 per cent , strength .
It thus became necessary to plot a curve of the density of the acid of all strengths from 0 to 100 per cent. The densities of 14 strengths of acid were determined as follows :\#151 ; A cylindrical piece of lead , weighing about 14 grammes , was soldered to a short , stout , platinum wire , and the latter bent into the shape of a hook .
The wire projected about 5 mm. from the lead .
The lead and 3 mm. of the platinum wire were coated with soft paraffin .
A small paraffin cell was made similar to the conductivity cell above described , except that 1909 .

141 a white annular plate was fixed to the top of the cell so as to form a projecting ledge right round it .
The weight was suspended from the balance so as to hang in the cell by means of a very fine platinum wire .
Weighings were then made in air , in water at 0 ' , and in the acid at 0 ' C. In the case of the two latter weighings , the cell was surrounded by a beaker of crushed ice .
The projecting ledge of the cell formed a lid to the beaker , and allowed very little water vapour to escape .

Under these conditions the acid fumed very noticeably when above 90 per cent. , but below that there was little fuming at all .
The humidity of the atmosphere was very low , being only 6 per cent , of saturation .

Electric Conductivity [ June 4 , It was found difficult to weigh in the acid more accurately than to 0*0005 gramme .
The error in weighing is , however , less than 0*001 gramme , and the percentage error not more than 0*1 .
The following values were obtained .
These are compared with other published values in the curve plotted below .
It will be seen at a glance that this curve is very similar to the specific-conductivity curve in its general nature .

From this curve the density of acid of any concentration could be estimated .
Hence the numbers of cubic centimetres containing a gramme-molecule of Hi , and the molecular conductivities were calculated .
These values are given in the following table ( pp. 144 and 145 ) .

] and Density of Solutions of Hydrogen Fluoride .
143 Column 9 gives the fraction of ionisation which is calculated from a = For A6\#174 ; in ^ie case hydrogen fluoride we have taken the number 364 at 18 ' and 325 at 0 ' .
The first number is derived from the ionic conductivities at 18 ' , which are 318 for the hydrogen ion and 46*6 for the fluorine ion .
The second number is derived from the following data :\#151 ; Ostwald gives 325 as the ionic conductivity of the hydrogen ion at 25 ' ; at 18 ' the value is 318 , * being a fall of one unit per degree .
Hence at 0 ' the value would be approximately 300 .
Correcting the ionic conductivity of fluorine for temperature , the temperature coefficient being 0*0238 , we get the value at 0 ' = 26*6 .
The sum of these ionic conductivities is 326 .
This number maybe derived in another way .
H. E. Jones gives 380 as the limiting value for hydrogen fluoride at 25 ' .
The value , as calculated above , for 18 ' is 364 .
The difference per degree is 2*3 units , hence the value at 0 ' is 324 .
The approximate correctness of the number 325 is shown by the fact that if we assume the amount of dissociation to be little affected by temperature , at any rate in the more concentrated solutions , we get \#171 ; = fv/ foo = Atl8r/ ya18\lt ; \#187 ; ; substituting 0*0576 for a and 18*30 for fiv\gt ; which is the value for the acid of 29*83 per cent. , we get \#151 ; 318 .
The temperature coefficient for the hydrogen ion at 18 ' is about 0*0153 .
If this is used to calculate the limiting value for the hydrogen ion at 0 ' , the number for f \lt ; \#187 ; becomes very much lower than any of these three numbers given above , and as the coefficient is only correct in the neighbourhood of 18 , ' we discard this method of calculating .
From Table I ( next page ) the two following curves are plotted .
The lower curve is that for the true molecular conductivity , i.e. for the specific conductivity multiplied by the number of cubic centimetres containing 1 gramme-molecule of hydrogen fluoride .
It has been suggested that in this curve the concentrations are expressed in terms of weight along the horizontal axis , and in terms of volume when used to calculate the vertical ordinates ( molecular conductivity ) , and that , consequently , irregularities in this curve might follow those in the density curve .
If , however , we plot a curve from the figures in the last column of the following table , this objection is removed , concentrations along both the vertical and horizontal axes now being expressed in terms of weight .
The conductivity is now expressed as the specific conductivity multiplied by the number of grammes of solution containing 1 gramme-molecule of hydrogen fluoride .

Discussion of the Results .
1 .
It will be seen from Table II that for concentrations of less than per cent , the temperature coefficient becomes practically constant .
If this is applied to the values for the more dilute solutions , we get the following values at 25 , which are compared with Ostwald 's .
Our value is in close agreement with Ostwald 's at = 4 , but those for the higher dilutions are lower than his by an increasing amount .
They are thus more likely to be correct , as any impurity would increase the conductivity .

The curve for the molecular conductivity presents two distinct peculiarities .
The first is a very decided break at about 91 per cent. , and the second is an equally distinct break between 51 and 55 per cent. The first of these breaks is shown upon the specific-conductivity curve , which necessarily is very similar in nature to the molecular-conductivity curve while molecular concentration is high .
The second break is also shown upon the specific-conductivity curve , but is not so obvious at first sight .
It will be convenient to discuss these breaks in turn .
First Break.\#151 ; Whichever conductivity curve is examined it will be found that at 91 per cent , of hydrogen fluoride the conductivity increases with very great rapidity for a very slight decrease in concentration .
It is very nearly doubled for a decrease of about 2 per cent , in the amount of hydrogen fluoride in solution .
The point 91 per cent , corresponds to a definite hydrate 9HF.(H20 ) , but the possible existence of this hydrate in solution does not seem in itself sufficient to explain the large increase in conductivity at that point .
Whereas from 92'81 to 9064 per cent , ( a fall of 2T7 per cent. ) the increase in the value of ^ is only from 4-54 to 5'29 , the increase in / a between 9064 and 88'82 ( a fall of l-82 per cent. ) is from 5'29 to 1004 .
This leads us to think that at this point a break-up of complex molecules begins and that at 89 per cent , there has been a break-up of complex ions into twice as many less complex ions .
The point at which the break occurs is fixed within very narrow limits , and is so almost exactly that of the hydrate 9HnFn.(\#171 ; , H20 ) that the question naturally arises whether this hydrate might not assist the break-up of complex ions .
If the solution at the concentration 91 per cent , of acid does represent a definite hydrate , it is at least possible that as that hydrate ceases to exist with increasing dilution the molecule of hydrogen fluoride which will in any case alter in molecular structure ( owing to the alteration in the amount of water associated with it ) also alters in complexity .
We therefore conclude that the hydrate 9H"F " .
( 7iH20 ) has a L 2 148 Electric Conductivity , etc. , of Solutions of Hydrogen Fluoride .
definite existence in solution , and that with slight increase in dilution this dissociates into simpler molecules .
Second Break , \#151 ; If we consider the specific-conductivity curve , we find that from 0 to 30 per cent , it is a straight line .
The curve then dips , the dip ending at about 53 per cent. , where there is a point of inflection .
From this point the curve is parabolic until it reaches about 88 per cent. The concluding portion has already been discussed .
Turning to the molecular curve , we find the point of inflection clearly marked .
It is even more clearly marked upon the dotted curve , the meaning of which has been explained .
In each of these the point is at about 53 per cent , of hydrogen fluoride , a percentage which corresponds to the formula HF .
H20 ( HF = 52*6 per cent. ) .
We thus conclude that this hydrate has a definite existence in solution .
The density determinations are not of the same degree of accuracy as the conductivity measurements , and they are much fewer in number .
The curves are , however , very similar and the density curve gives corroborative evidence of a break or point of inflection at about 53 per cent. The break at 91 per cent , is not shown , owing to the paucity of measurements .
