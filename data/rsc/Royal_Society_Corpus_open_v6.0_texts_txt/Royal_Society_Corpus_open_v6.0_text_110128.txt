On the Production and Formation of Pearls .

] In his examinations of the organs of generation of the large freshwater muscle , the author often met with seed pearls , either in the ovarium , or connected with the shell upon which the ovarium lay ; and he remarked at the same time that all Oriental pearls have a brilliant central cell , which in the common mode of boring them is destroyed , but which may be beautifully exhibited by carefully splitting the pearl into halves : this cell is just large enough to contain an ovum , which is formed upon a pedicle like the yolk of the pullet 's egg , and is similarly discharged when completely formed .
Thence Sir Everard concludes , that a pearl is formed upon the external surface of an ovum , which having been blighted , does not pass with the others into the oviduct , but remains attached to its pedicle in the ovarium , and in the following season receives a coat of pearl at the same time that the inner surface of the shell receives its annual supply .
This conclusion , he observes , is verified by some pearls being spherical while others are pyramidal , in consequence of the pedicle , as well as the ovum , having been enamelled with nacre .
This paper concludes with an extract from one of the early volumes of the Philosophical Transactions , in which a corresponding account of the growth of pearls is announced by Arnoldi in 1673 .
