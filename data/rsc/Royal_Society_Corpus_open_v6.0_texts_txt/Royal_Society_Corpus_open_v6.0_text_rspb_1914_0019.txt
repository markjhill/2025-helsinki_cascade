Variations in the Sex Ratio Mus rattus .
of function to take place after nerve anastomosis is not due to a simple re-education process , as there is no evidence of this during recovery , but is probably due to an alteration in the centres under the influence of altered afferent impulses from the muscles , the brain thus having the capacity quickly to adapt itself to such alteration .
Variations in the Sex Ratio of Mus rattus Associated with an Unusual Mortality of Adult Females .
By F. Norman White , M.D. ( Lond. ) , Capt. I.M.S. ( Communicated by Prof. C. J. Martin , F.R.S. Received November 28 , 1913 , \#151 ; Read January 22 , 1914 .
) At the commencement of June , 1911 , whilst engaged on plague epidemiological observations in the United Provinces my attention was drawn to the fact that nearly all the young Mus rattus that were being trapped and examined by our staff in Lucknow were females .
It was this strange phenomenon , the parallel of which I had never encountered during a five years ' experience of plague research in India , that prompted the inquiry , the results of which are briefly set forth in this paper .
A few words explanatory of the methods employed in the daily routine examination of rats will show the nature of the material at my disposal .
The prime object in trapping and examining large numbers of rats was , of course , to ascertain how far facts thus collected would assist us in solving the plague epidemiological problems with which we were faced .
The species , sex , and weight in grammes of each rat caught were noted ; the address of the house in which the rat was trapped and the number and species of fleas found on it were recorded .
The sex of each rat was noted after dissection of the animal , and if it were female a further note was made as to the existence of pregnancy .
If pregnant the number of foetuses was likewise written down .
Finally , any pathological or other condition calling for comment was fully described .
All this information , which was in the first place recorded on cards , one card for each rat , was at the end of the day 's work entered in a register .
Weighing the rat was done in a specially constructed spring-balance , by means of which the weight in grammes to the nearest multiple of 10 could be readily and accurately ascertained .
I wish to emphasise the fact that the sex of the animal was noted only after dissection , so that 336 Dr. F. N. White .
Variations in Sex Ratio Mus rattus mistakes under this head were very unlikely to occur .
A young female is not always easily differentiated from a young male by external inspection only .
Under ordinary circumstances M. rattus would appear to be slightly polygamous .
Some observers have stated that it is very markedly so , and explain the fact that about equal numbers of males and females are usually caught by the alleged shyness of the adult female .
This point I have carefully gone into and believe the allegation has no foundation in fact .
As will be shown later , about equal numbers of males and females appear to be born under normal conditions .
When adult age is reached there is either a somewhat enhanced mortality amongst males as compared with females or else males are more wary and so less readily caught .
It should be noted also that females are as readily caught at the height of the breeding season as at other times .
In the presence of severe plague a condition of marked polygamy is sometimes met with .
I believe this to be chiefly due to the fact that plague is a more fatal disease to male than to female rats.* When polygamy is marked rats are scarce or difficult to trap ; on the other hand , when the rat population is very large the numbers of the two sexes trapped appear to be more nearly equal .
In support of these statements Tables II-Y have been produced .
( 1 ) Ballia district : Here plague is always present and rats , probably in consequence , are very difficult to catch .
Out of 4525 M. rattus caught during 10 months 2550 were females , a proportion of 77 males for every 100 females .
If the rats be separated into two groups , young and adult , considering half the rats of 90 grm. and all those of lesser weight as young and the remainder as adults , the degree of polygamy prevailing amongst the rats of Ballia is seen to be even more marked than the above figures indicate .
Of the 1875 young rats 943 were male and 932 female , whereas of the 2650 adult rats 1618 were female and only 1032 male .
In other words , there were only 63 adult males for every 100 adult females ( see Table V ) .
The rats were obtained from places scattered all over the district .
( 2 ) Coimbatore Town : Has suffered from repeated but not very severe epidemics of plague .
M.rattus appears to be scarce ; the catches were very small .
Here of 3889 M. rattus 2072 were females , 88 females for every 100 males ( see Table IY ) .
Here again the excess of females over males affects adults only .
( 3 ) Cawnpore : Here rats were extraordinarily numerous .
When our observations started a mild epidemic of plague was drawing to a close .
No acute rat plague was , however , met with .
During the previous few years * See 3rd Plague Report , 1907 , 'Journ .

Associated with an Unusual Mortality of Adult Females .
337 the city had almost completely escaped plague , though in the more remote past its epidemics had been extremely severe .
Our very high catches indicated a very large rat population and a complete recovery from the ; onslaughts of plague .
In Cawnpore of 51,181 rattles examined in one year 25,838 were females , i.e. , 98 males for every 100 females ( see Table II ) .
( 4 ) Banda Town has never suffered from epidemic plague .
rattus was present in very large numbers .
In Banda of 10,127 rats caught during 11 months 5174 were females , i.e.,96 males for every 100 females ( see Table III ) .
In Lucknow , in which city the very abnormal conditions , fully described below , were present , of 34,908 M. rattus caught during the course of one year 18,396 were females , i.e.,89 males for every 100 females ( see Table I ) .
Disturbance in the Sex Ratio of M. rattus Lucknow and its Readjustment .
A reference to Table I will indicate the nature of the phenomenon in Lucknow to which reference has been made .
The table sets forth the weight frequency distribution of male and female rattus respectively for each of the 12 months from February , 1911 , to January , 1912 .
There appears to have been some influence at work destroying adult females and sparing the males .
This " influence " began its manifestations in March and produced its maximum effect in May and June .
As if to compensate for the apparently wholesale destruction of adult females , females only appear to have been born .
These two processes , the destruction of females and the suppression of male births , proceeded ; pari passu .
In June not a single male rat below the weight of 80 grm. was trapped , whereas 610 females of less weight than 80 grm. were caught .
As the numbers of adults of the two sexes began to approximate more closely the one to the other , young male rats were again trapped in increasing numbers .
In November , December , and January , the sex ratio approximated to that normally pertaining .
Such , in brief , are the facts ; satisfactory explanations of the phenomenon are difficult to come by .
It may possibly be advanced that in the above brief recapitulation of observed facts I have assumed more than the facts warrant .
The objection that is most likely to be raised is to the assumption that failure to catch adult females signifies destruction of females .
The shyness of the female might account for the phenomenon .
This point has been referred to , and it was partly to meet this objection that I studied similar facts concerning 95,629 rats caught in various places .
A reference to the tables of Cawnpore , Banda , Coimbatore , and Ballia rats will show that in no place other than Lucknow was such a circumstance observed .
Female rats are not shyer or 338 Dr. F. N. White .
Variations in Sex Ratio of Mus rattus more difficult to catch than males ; on the contrary , it is possible that males are slightly more wary than females .
As stated above the two sexes are normally produced in equal numbers , though adult females are usually in slight excess of adult males .
It may also be objected that the parallel assumption , that failure to catch young males signifies that no males are born , is not warranted by facts .
This is admitted , but the only other explanation that I can offer is that the males were destroyed by their parents soon after birth ( at a lesser weight than 10 grm. , when it becomes just possible to trap them with the traps we employed , i.e. , at about a week old ) .
That the parents should have destroyed only the male offspring is , to me , less easy of credence than that only females were produced .
It is a matter of regret that my observations did not succeed in throwing any light on the causes of the female mortality .
Tlague was certainly present until April , 1911 , amongst the Lucknow rats , but it was not severe or widespread , and , as has been pointed out , plague is more fatal to the male than to the female .
Whatever the cause was it was a widespread one in the city .
The rats , caught from all parts of Lucknow , represented as fair a sample as could be obtained .
Further speculation on this interesting topic would not prove fruitful .
The rapid readjustment of the sex ratio after so grave disturbance is , to my mind , the fact of chief interest .
In May and June when hardly any females were produced there must have been an extreme degree of polyandry .
From a study of weight frequency curves of pregnant females , I have concluded that for practical purposes 90 grm. represents a fair dividing line between young and adult rats of Lucknow ( Table YI ) .
Half the rats of the weight of 90 grm. can be considered young and half adult .
Employing this approximation , there appears to be an interesting correlation between the excess of adult males over adult females and the excess of young females over young males for the same month * In spite of the absence of any explanation of the facts the phenomenon described appears to me to be of sufficient interest to warrant its publication .
* Mr. Major Greenwood , Jr. , Statistician to the Lister Institute , has kindly supplied me with the approximate correlations between the sex ratios of mature and immature rats for the same month and also for certain sequences .
The groupings appear in Table VII and the coefficients in Table VIII .
It will be seen that the negative correlation for data derived from one month 's records is slightly larger than when the records of successive months are combined .
A possible explanation is that overlapping of different affected colonies produces an apparent synchronism of cause and effect , but the figures as they stand do not warrant any inference .
The enormous excess of young females in May and June is a statistically inexplicable fact .

The Conduction of the Pulse Wave and the Measurement of Arterial Pressure .
By Leonard Hill , F.B.S. , James McQueen , and Martin Flack * ( Received December 20 , 1913 , \#151 ; Read February 5 , 1914 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory , London Hospital Medical College , London Hospital Research Fund ; and the Pathological Laboratory , Aberdeen University .
) It is now well established that in cases of aortic regurgitation placed in the horizontal position the arterial pressure is considerably higher ( 50-80 mm. Hg ) in the leg than in the arm.f Such pressures are taken by the sphygmomanometer , using the armlet method , the armlet being placed respectively round the calf and the upper arm , the disappearance and reappearance of the pulse wave being noted in the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery , and in the radial .
In seeking for an explanation of this phenomenon it has already been suggested by us } : that the " lability " of the arterial wall plays a considerable part , the term " lability " being used to designate the ease with which an artery distends with a rise and recoils with a fall of arterial pressure .
The effect of increased and of diminished lability of the vessel wall upon the conduction of the pulse wave has been demonstrated schematically by * During tenure of Eliza Ann Alston Research Scholarship .
