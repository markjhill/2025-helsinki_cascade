( From the National Physical Laboratory .
) I have been engaged during the last two years on an analysis of the magnetic results obtained at Kew Observatory ( now the National Physical Laboratory ) , during an 11-year period , 1890 to 1900 .
The work has been much interrupted , and is still incomplete .
Amongst the points dealt with is the inter-relationship between sun-spot frequency and magnetic phenomena , and , as this has recently been engaging attention elsewhere , I have decided to put certain of my results on record at once .
It has long been known from the researches of Balfour Stewart , Ellis , and others , that there is a close connection between the times of occurrence of greatest sun-spot frequency and largest amplitude of the diurnal inequality of magnetic declination and horizontal force .
I have investigated whether the numerical relationship between the phenomena can be adequately represented mathematically in a simple way .
A convenient basis for the investigation was presented by the publication by Professor Cleveland Abbe in the ' U.S. Monthly Weather Review , ' for November , 1901 , of a table of sun-spot frequencies as calculated by Wolf and Wolfer for a very long series of years .
After I had carried out all the calculations , Wolfer himself published a similar table* embodying his latest corrections .
The differences from Abbe 's table are trifling , and mainly confined to two years ( 1891 and 1892 ) .
I judged it best , however , to revise the whole of my arithmetic , so as to employ Wolfer 's own most approved figures .
In the following remarks S represents Wolfer 's value for the sun-spot frequency .
The above-mentioned table gives the mean S for each month and for each year .
The magnetic quantity selected for comparison is the mean monthly " range , " meaning thereby the difference between the greatest and # ' Met .
