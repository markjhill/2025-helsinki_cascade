A paper was read , entitled " Some Remarks on the internal Struc ?
ture of the Platypus Anatinus ( Ornithorhyncusparadoxvs , l$\um .
) .
" By Richard Griffin , Esq. Communicated by Dawson Turner , Esq. F.R.S. Having an opportunity of examining two specimens of the Ornithorhyncus , the one male , the other female , belonging to the Norfolk and Norwich Museum , the author found in the latter two large mammary glands , one on each side of the chest , and covering nearly the whole under surface of the animal $ numerous ducts proceeded from them , perforating the skin , at two circular portions , which presented no elevation corresponding to nipples .
The Fallopian tubes terminate by very small orifices in the cloaca : posterior to their terminations the author observed two slightly projecting processes , containing each the orifice of a duct which proceeds to a length of at least two inches , but the continuation of which could not be traced in the specimen examined in consequence of the injuries it had received .
In the male , three pointed processes werenoticed ateach extremity of the corpora cavernosa of the penis , the cavities of which do not communicate with one another , and are separated before their termination .
The spur of the male is furnished with a sac , of the size of a pea , containing a poisonous fluid , which by means of a canal is conducted into a wound inflicted by the spur .
