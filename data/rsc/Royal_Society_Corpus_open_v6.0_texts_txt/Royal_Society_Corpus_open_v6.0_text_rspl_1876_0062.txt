" Note on the Electromotive Properties of Muscle .
" By J. Burdon-Sanderson , M.D. , F.R.S. Received December 6 , 1876 .
In the great work entitled ' Untersuchungen iiber thierische Electri-citat , ' of which the first volume was published by Professor du Bois-Reymond in 1848 , the author promulgated , as the result of the remarkable investigations undertaken by him during the previous six years , certain propositions relating to the electromotive properties of muscle .
These propositions ( which in the original work were printed in large type ) were termed by the author collectively the " Law of the muscle-current .
" They have been accepted by all later observers as fundamental truths .
They are as follows :\#151 ; " The Law of the Muscle-current .
I. arrangements .
A. Strong Currents .
If any point of the natural or artificial longitudinal section of a muscle is brought into connexion with any point of the natural or artificial transverse section of the same muscle , so that no tension is thereby produced , a current is indicated by any galvanoscopic apparatus introduced into the inactive conducting circuit , of which the direction in the circuit is from the longitudinal to the transverse section.\#151 ; B. Weak Currents .
a. Currents of the transverse section .
Further , if any point of a natural or artificial transverse section of a muscle is connected in the manner already described with another point of the same transverse section , or with a point of another natural or artificial transverse section of the same muscle , which we will regard as a cylinder , and if the points are at unequal distances from the centre of the circular area of the transverse section , the galvanoscopic apparatus again indicates a current , though much weaker than the previous one , of which the direction is from the point more distant from the centre to the nearest point.\#151 ; b. Currents of the longitudinal section .
Thirdly , if a point of the natural or artificial longitudinal section , lying nearer to the geometrically central transverse section of the cylinder formed by the muscle , is brought in the same wray into relation with a point of the natural or artificial longitudinal section of the same muscle more distant from the central transverse section , the galvanoscopic apparatus again indicates a current , which is , however , much weaker than that between any point of the natural or artificial longitudinal and any point on the transverse section , but is equal in strength to that between different points on one or two natural or artificial transverse sections .
Its direction in the circuit is from the point lying nearer to the middle transverse section to that further removed from it.\#151 ; II .
Inactive arrangements .
The galvanoscopic apparatus , on the contrary , remains at rest when two points in one or two natural or artificial transverse sections connected through the inactive conducting circuit are at an equal distance from the centre ; 436 Prof. Burdon-Sanderson on the [ Dec. 14 , or when one or two points in the natural or artificial longitudinal section so connected are at an equal distance from the central transverse section .
' ' " The purpose of the present note is to put on record observations which prove ( 1 ) That the unmutilated gastrocnemius muscle of the frog possesses electromotive properties which have not before been correctly described ; ( 2 ) That in the " muscle-cylinder " of Du Bois-Reymond , the electromotive phenomena are dependent on and determined by those of the muscle , and exhibit electrical properties which , in many important respects , are inconsistent with the " law ; " ( 3 ) That the electrical change consequent on excitation , and termed by Du Bois " negative variation , " in like manner possesses characters different from those assigned to it by him ; ( 4 ) That it is not true , as averred by Professor Hermann , that the electrical state of muscle becomes negative during contraction as compared with that of muscle at rest .
On the contrary , the contracting parts become positive .
The following statements refer to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog .
1 .
When one terminal of the Lippmann 's capillary electrometer ( described in a previous paper by Mr. Page and myself ) is connected by a suitable electrode ( to be called the fixed electrode ) with the surface of the back of a previously decapitated and pithed frog , and the other ( the movable electrode ) with the surface of the gastrocnemius muscle at a distance of from two to five millims. from the upper end , it is found that the position of the mercurial column is nearly unaltered , indicating that there is no , or only a slight , difference of potential between the two surfaces thus compared .
If the potential of the surface of the muscle be positive , the neutral point can be found by shifting the electrode further down ; if negative , by shifting it further up .
2 .
If now the movable electrode is gradually shoved down the surface of the muscle without breaking contact , the mercury alters its position so as to indicate greater and greater negativity of the muscular surface , until at last a point is reached near the tendon beyond which the surface again becomes positive , the positivity increasing as the tendon is approached .
3 .
If , the fixed contact remaining unaltered , the points already investigated are compared with other parts of the muscle , it is found that , as a rule , ( a)any two points equidistant from the origin of the muscle exhibit the same potential , and ( b ) that the ends of the muscle exhibit potentials which are identical with the potentials of the inactive tissues ( e.g. subcutaneous cellular tissue , bone , \amp ; c ) in the neighbourhood , this being true both as regards the insertion ( tendon ) and the origin of the muscle .
1876 .
] Electromotive Properties of 4 .
If the tendon is divided and the muscle , remaining attached by its origin , is separated from its other connexions , so that it is out of contact with surrounding tissues , and in this state is reinvestigated , it is found that the negativity increases from its origin towards the negative point , and diminishes from that point towards the tendon in the same way as before , the only change observable being that the absolute difference of potential between that spot and the fixed contact is greater than before , i. e. that all the other less differences are proportionally exaggerated .
5 .
If the muscle is thrown into tetanic contraction by faradization of the sciatic nerve for a period of two seconds ' duration , the excitation is accompanied by an excursion of which the direction is positive , and which attains its maximum during the second half of the period during which the excitation lasts , beginning to decline immediately after its cessation .
The extent of the excursion is such as to indicate that the electromotive force of the muscular tissue diminishes by about a third .
This phenomenon is observed before as well as after separation of the muscle from its connexions .
6 .
If now the muscle is severed in its upper third by a cut transverse to its axis , and again in the region of greatest negativity by a second cross cut , a muscle-cylinder is obtained having the following properties , viz.:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The upper cut surface is negative to the natural surface in its neighbourhood , but positive to the more distant parts .
Between these parts an intermediate zone may manifestly be found where the tension of the natural surface is equal to that of the upper cut surface .
( 2 ) As compared with any point of the natural surface in this zone the lower cut surface is strongly negative ; any point of the natural surface nearer the lower cut surface is also negative , its negativity increasing with its distance from the zone ; and in like manner any point nearer the upper cut surface is positive , the more so the further it is from the zone .
( 3 ) " When the muscle-cylinder is thrown into contraction by contact with platinum wires in connexion with the ends of the secondary coil of a Du Bois 's induction-apparatus , excitatory variations are observed , having the following characters :\#151 ; a. If one terminal of the electrometer is in connexion with the natural surface at a point equidistant from both ends ( Du Bois 's equator ) , and the other with the upper cut surface , the position of the mercurial column indicates that the cut surface is negative to the natural surface , i. e. the former to the latter .
On excitation the difference of tension between the two increases\#151 ; i. e. , in Du Bois 's language , a positive variation occurs , b. If the same part of the natural surface is now compared with the lower cut surface , and the excitation repeated , the difference of tension between the two is found to be in the same direction as in the former case , but much greater .
On excitation it diminishes\#151 ; i. e. , in Du Bois 's language , a negative valuation occurs .
7 .
Trcm the foregoing facts as to the muscle-cylinder prepared in the 438 On the Electromotive Properties of .
[ Dec. 14 , manner directed , it appears that it possesses properties entirely inconsistent with the " law of the muscle-current " in the following respects ( 1 ) That the electrical tensions of the upper and lower cut surfaces , instead of being identical , differ widely ; ( 2 ) That the equatorial zone of the natural surface presents none of the properties assigned to it by the " law " ; ( 3 ) That the excitatory variation is not in conformity with the " law .
" , 1 8 .
On the ground of these experiments I conclude that in the gastrocnemius of the frog the part nearest the tendon is ( in the natural state ) negative to the opposite end , and from the investigation of other muscles of the limbs I infer that in them the distribution of electrical tension on the natural surface is governed by a similar law .
I have further .
shown that the phenomenon hitherto known to physiologists as the " negative variation " cannot be described as " diminution of a previously existing current " between cut and natural surface , but may , in all its phases , be completely explained as a temporary diminution of the electromotive force of those parts of the muscle which are in the natural state negative as compared with the electrically inactive tissues of the body of the animal ; and , as a direct consequence of this , that the excitatory variation of animal muscle is opposed in sign to that of the excito-contractile tissue of Dionoea .
1 9 .
This being understood , all that is observed in the muscle-cylinder can be explained as resulting from the properties exhibited by the muscle itself before its mutilation ; so that it is not only true that the general properties of the cylinder can be deduced from those of the muscle as a whole , but that ( as the Tables show ) the special peculiarities of each particular case may be accurately foretold if the whole organ has before been investigated .

u Preliminary Notice of Investigations on the Action of the Yaso-motor Nerves of Striated MuscleBy W. H. Gaskell , M.A. , Trinity College , Cambridge .

( Abstract .
) When a muscle is thrown into a state of tetanus by stimulation of its nerve , it seems , at first sight , reasonable to suppose that the contraction of the muscle substance must cause a considerable pressure on the vessels of the muscle , and , therefore , that for this reason less blood must pass through ; and , if at the same time that the motor fibres are stimulated vaso-constrictor fibres are also stimulated , one must conclude that during the tetanus of a muscle there is a very much less volume of blood flowing through .
On the other hand , in order for the muscle to do work for any length of time , it is necessary that there should be a greater facility for the removal of the waste products and a more active supply of nutritive material during the state of contraction than when the muscle is at rest .
This hypothesis necessitates , therefore , a greater flow of blood through the muscle during the tetanus of that muscle .
Which of these two statements is the true one , .
Sadler ( Ludwig 's ' Arbeiten , ' 1869 ) has already indicated .
As , however , his method and his results are not absolutely satisfactory , 1 , at the suggestion and with the help of Professor Ludwig , carried out last year , in Leipzig , a series of experiments of the same nature as his , and , by means of much improved
