At Derby ( which differs from London in Longitude five Minutes ) Mr. Flamstead observed the Beginning of the Entrance of the true Shadow , H. 5 .
and 19~ .
The Penumbra was seen in London to continue near half an Hour before it wholly quitted the Body of the Moon .
There was also observed here , about the middle of the total Obscuration of the Moon , an Eclipse of a notable fixed Star , so as that the precise Time of its Immersion and Emersion was seen .
Not doubting but that Mr. Hook himself will shortly make public in a more ample manner these Observations , and divers considerable Particulars by him then taken notice of ; we shall forbear to say any more of it in this Place .
An Account of the Observations of the same Eclipse as they were made at Paris ; communicated by the Learned Bullialdus , in his Letter to the Publisher , dated Febr. 6 .
