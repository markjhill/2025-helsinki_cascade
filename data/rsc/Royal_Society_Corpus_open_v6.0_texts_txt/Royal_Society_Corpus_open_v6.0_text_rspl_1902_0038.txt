The Human Skin .
" By Augustus D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. Received March 17 , \#151 ; Read April 24 , 1902 .
( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London .
) The purport of the following observations was to examine on human skin the electrical reactions described in previous communications in the case of frog 's skin , and in that of the cat 's skin .
llie Main Facts .
The phenomena are in the main similar under similar conditions , viz. , in the case of a freshly removed healthy skin obtained from the operating theatre , the normal current is always ingoing , and the normal response is always outgoing.* In a series of observations\#151 ; with values noted for an ingoing current of between 0*0020 and 0*0200 volt\#151 ; the response has appeared to be quite independent of the magnitude of normal current , and to strong stimulation has usually been from 0*0100 to 0*0400 volt .
As in the case of the frog 's skin , the response to single induction shocks has been in the positive or outgoing direction , to both directions of exciting current .
Tetanising currents ( make and break induction shocks of alternating direction at a frequency of about 60 per sec. ) give therefore a summated positive effect .
At the outset of my experiments on'human skin I encountered doubt and difficulty by reason of the fact that I set myself the difficult problem of determining as far as possible its duration of survival , and by so doing had to deal with cases where a reaction of low voltage is apt to be masked by admixture of polarisation currents .
In my experience , healthy skin from the operating theatre , tested within 48 hours after operation , has always manifested indubitable signs of life , and by indubitable I mean a * ' Foy .

] reaction greater than +0-0050 volt to strong induction shocks of + or - direction * . .
Tested by tetanising currents of alternating directions such skin gives to both pairs of directions a similar indubitable positive response of , e.g. , 0-0200 to 0-0500 volt .
Moribund skin and skin obtained from the post-mortem room , from subjects that have died gradually , have generally afforded doubtful results , and by doubtful results I mean a reaction of variable direction and measured by ten thousandths of a volt .
In all cases the electrodes alone were carefully tested for polarisation , anomalous as well as ordinary , before use and after experiment ; the 'skin was subsequently killed by boiling and the experiment repeated .
The course of events will be best set forth by the detailed account of a single observation .
( Observation 2 .
) Skin of breast , removed for carcinoma , 1| hours after operation .
The single break induction shock of + and - direction gave the response + 0*0180 + 0-0230 , the resistance being 1 megohm .
An Illustrative Observation.\#151 ; To tetanisation of both pairs of directions the responses were + 0*0440 and + 0*0460 .
R now \#163 ; megohm .
After boiling the resistance was only 50,000 ohms .
The next day the reactions of a fresh piece of same skin to strong single shocks + and - were + 0*0050 , + 0*0175 volt .
On the 4th day the reactions were + 0*0025 and + 0*0035 .
In all these cases the positive response was abolished by boiling .
On the 7th day the reactions were doubtful , except in the case of the nipple , where the response to all kinds of excitation was about + 0*0050 .
In this case the conductivity was increased from 100 to 121 by tetanisation .
Diminution of Resistance.\#151 ; A remarkable feature noticed in the outset of these experiments was the- great diminution of resistance caused by tetanisation .
The alteration of resistance was most pronounced in the case of skin which , judging by its response , was most alive ; it was far less noticeable in the case of moribund and doubtful skin \ it was not apparent at all in the case of skin certainly killed by boiling , as might be expected ; however , the resistance of boiled skin was always far below that of the same skin previous to boiling .
All these points will be most clearly apparent by reference to fig. 1 .
The noteworthy points are\#151 ; ( 1 .

The small deflections seen in the case of the dead skin are such as may be observed with a non-living electrolyte , and are due to polarisation .
They follow the direction of the break current , and are due to the fact that the sum , of polarisation countercurrents by the series of make currents is greater than the sum of similar effects by break currents .

A similar inequality , attributable to polarisation ( but possibly in part due to unequal j excitation by the two poles of an exciting current ) is witnessed in the outgoing effects of single break induction currents .
The + ( outgoing ) response after an induction current of - direction is greater than the + response after an induction current of + direction .

Effect of Previous Excitation.\#151 ; The response to a particular excitation is greatly influenced by the previous excitation to which the skin may have been subjected .
In general , the second of two moderate excitations produces a greater effect than the first , while the second of two strong excitations produces a smaller effect than the first .
In the case Dr. A. D. Waller .
[ Mar. 17 , of living skin , the influence of single shocks ( and still more of alternating currents ) is considerable , and must be reckoned with in any estimate of voltage .
In , e.g. , skin No. YII { vide Tabular Summary ) , the difference between the responses in the two directions of tetanisation at 10,000 units on the second and third days depends on the fact that the order of tests was reversed on the two days .
For this reason , in any comparison between the effects of excitation in opposite directions one pair of trials is insufficient : two or more pairs of trials are necessary .
In fig. 1 , e.g. , the result of two pairs of trials is given .
In fig. 4204 the decline of voltage is , in reality , much greater than is at first sight apparent , by reason of the augmented conductivity aroused 6 to bo 30 min. Fig. 3 ( 4204).\#151 ; Same skin 22 hours after excision .

Gradual decline of E.M.F. ; which decline is greater than apparent by reason of increasing conductivity ; the latter , as shown by the standard deflections at beginning and end of experiment , has beeh more than doubled .
by the succession of excitations .
For the same reason it is not easy to make satisfactory observations of the variation in strength of response with variation in strength of excitation , even when the mean of successive effects is taken on ascending and descending scales , the influence of fatigue remains obvious , especially if ( as ought to be done ) the gradual increase of conductivity is taken into account .

On the other hand , summation of effects has been much less apparent .
Locality of the Reaction .
The blaze currents of human skin arise exclusively from its external epithelial strata , not the most superficial keratinised cells , but the underlying and presumably living cells of the Malpighian layer .
This principal fact is demonstrated in various ways :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) A piece of fresh skin , put up as figured , is excited through the electrodes A , B , and led off to the galvanometer through A , C , and then through B , C ( which are previously compensated before each trial ) .

[ Mar. 171 There occur in consequence of excitation from A to B and from B to A\#151 ; response from C to A no response from C to B , i.e. , the electromotive spot has in each case been situated at or near the external surface A. ( 2 .
) The subcutaneous tissue , and the corium itself , give no response .
A slice taken from the sole of the foot and limited to the horny layer gives no response .
A slice of skin taken so as to include the Malpighian epithelium gives more or less well-marked response .
And in this last connection I think it worthy of remark that the response is well marked in specimens of skin that did not include any distinct glandular masses .
In the pads of the cat 's foot where I had expected to have to reckon with glandular as well as cutaneous ] epithelium , it was evident on microscopic examination that no glandular tissue was present , but only some scattered ducts belonging to deep- ] seated glands .
The principal active part was clearly the deeply ] stainable layer of Malpighian epithelium .
The Reaction is Local.\#151 ; The blaze reaction of the skin is exclusively local , and is not propagated to a distance from the excited spot .
And as regards physiological state , it generally happens that closely adjacent portions may exhibit very different degrees of vitality .
This has been particularly apparent in the case of mangled skin and of skin involved in cancerous growth .
In both these cases it was not difficult to distinguish correctly between skin likely to give a poor reaction and skin likely to give a good reaction .
But by reason of such local differences it is not easy to obtain satisfactory instances of declining vitality with lapse of time by taking the reaction of a series of different bits of the same piece of skin ; in general , a decline was evident , but with frequent exceptionally low values at an early stage and exceptionally high values at a late stage\#151 ; .
, No. VI on the sixth day gave +0*0100 and +0*0150 volt to single shocks\#151 ; an exceptionally high value at this period .
Nevertheless , it is possible with care to distinguish amid such irregularities the general decline of skin vitality with lapse of time and the individual differences of vitality in different skins of men and animals .
As regards animals , I have , however , made as yet only occasional and unsystematic observations upon cats and rabbits , from which I have provisionally concluded that the skin of man is more enduring than that of either cats or rabbits ; that the skin of cats is more resistant than that of rabbits , and that the skins of individual cats and rabbits exhibit considerable differences of endurance according to the state of nutrition at the moment of somatic death .
I have been much astonished , and am still somewhat incredulous , of 1902 .
] On Skin Currents .
my qwjx conclusion with regard to the endurance of human shin .
On a healthy skin I have obtained what I take to be signs of life as long as 10 days after excision , and this did not appear to be a longest possible period .
I was fully alive to possibilities of fallacy , and expended much care and time upon their experimental exclusion .
Whether I have succeeded or not is matter for future investigation .
Pathological observations on the human skin in relation to its surgical transplantation to some extent bear out the view that it may survive excision for an extraordinary length of time , especially in a semi-desiccated state and under antiseptic protection .
Wentscher* found , e.g. , that skin grafts , preserved for 7 to 14 ( and in one instance for 21 ) days , recovered vitality in 3 or 4 days , as indicated particularly by the reappearance of karyokinetic figures .
As regards skin taken from the post-mortem room , Schede ( quoted by Wentscher ) made successful transplantation of skin 12 hours postmortem , but was unsuccessful with 24 hours ' old material .
The conductivity of human skin , more especially of fresh human skin , is greatly augmented in consequence of electrical excitation .
It is further increased by boiling , and the change occurring gradually in kept skin is of itself sufficient to greatly reduce the original resistance .
Thus , e.g. , in skin No. II , examined when I had not yet realised the great influence of previous electrical excitation , and did not therefore measure the resistance of the perfectly fresh skin , the conductivity is increased threefold in consequence of tetanisation , and tenfold in consequence of subsequent boiling .
In a later experiment directed specially to this point , the resistance measured by Wheatstone bridge was originally above 230,000 ohms , falling to below 100,000 ohms in consequence of strong tetanisation .
In my first observations , hardly anticipating any such considerable alterations of resistance , I contented myself with recording a standard deflection of O01 volt through the skin ( + electrodes + galvanometer ) to see whether or no the resistance was appreciably altered during observation .
But I also frequently recorded , for the sake of comparison , the standard deflection of 0'01 volt through a megohm ( + galvanometer ) and was therefore able to utilise for the study of alterations of conductivity a considerable body of data directed to other questions .
The alterations were indeed so considerable that it was possible without gross error to calculate absolute values of resistance ( or conductivity ) from the standard deflections recorded at beginning and end of observation .
The comparison of such data with data obtained by direct measurement showed that the calculation was permissible .
Of course the calculated data are valid only in the case of * Ziegler 's ' Beitrage sir Patliologisclien Analomie und sir Allgemeinen Patho-logie , ' vol. 24 , p. 101 , 1898 .

skin has a resistance to be measured in hundreds of thousands of ohms , tetanised skin a resistance of tens of thousands , boiled skin a resistance of thousands .
With regard to the .
cause of this remarkable augmentation of conductivity , we are in presence of two possible alternatives : 1st , a " kataphoric " migration of water ; and 2nd , a dissociation of electro- ; lytes .
I do not at present see my way to the sharp discrimination of thesei two possible factors , and can only bring forward considerations that appear to me to show that the second factor\#151 ; electrolytic dissociation \#151 ; is a chief cause of the increased conductivity , although no doubt transport of fluid , and indeed in certain cases rise of temperature may contribute to the effect .
The diminution of resistance is produced in far more marked degree in living skin than in dead skin .
It is best produced in consequence of the summated effect of alternating currents ; it is evident in consequence of a single strong induction shock .
Thus , e.g. ( Skin IV ) an initial resistance of If megohm , was lowered to 1 megohm after two single induction shocks at 10,000 , and to \ megohm after tetanisation at 1000 for two periods of 5 seconds .
Kataphoric alterations of resistance , as described by du Bois-Rey-mond , are in the sense of an augmentation caused by desiccation at the anode of a strong prolonged galvanic current .
And although there can be no doubt that such anodic augmentation has as its counterpart a kathodic diminution of resistance by reason of augmented moisture , it is not a priori very probable that the great alteration of skin resistance caused by one or several induction shocks is due to predominant kathodic augmentation of moisture .
On Skin Currents .
902 .
] On the other hand , I have observed a case , that of the hen 's egg , in Ihich induction shocks give a similar considerable increase of con-uctivity which I find it difficult to understand otherwise than as an Feet of water transport from electrode to shell at the anodic side , and k\gt ; m contents to shell at the kathodic side .
: I am constrained therefore to leave undetermined the possible ifluence of kataphoric action on skin resistance until I shall have bund means of investigating the phenomenon further .
i1 Alterations of temperature produce alterations of resistance of the kin as of any moist conductor , viz. , augmentation of resistance with bwered temperature , and diminution of resistance with raised temperature .
In the case of the living skin ( as in that of some other iving tissues ) I have witnessed at the moment of congelation and on ubsequent thawing , two well-marked effects that appear to be most Significant of a phenomenon of dissociation .
At a critical temperature : _4 ' to -6 ' of the cooling chamber ) a sudden electromotive discharge takes place , attributable to the sudden excitation or explosion \#171 ; jf living matter in the act of congelation .
Subsequently , on return of ; he frozen skin to the original temperature , the resistance is very much reduced , a change which is attributable to mechanical or chemical dissociation of the previously frozen tissue-elendents .
j Thus , e.g. , in Experiment 4209 the resistance of the skin ( corrected lor electrode resistance ) at 18 ' was 150,000 ohms before congelation , 10 min. Fig. 4 ( 4209).\#151 ; Skin No. Ill , 2nd day after excision .

The responses to excitation of + 0,0040 and + 0*0080 previous to congelation , were abolished in consequence of congelation .
Sources of Fallacy\#151 ; Doubtful Cases .
In ordinary cases ( i.e. , with healthy skin a few hours after removal from the body ) and with ordinary care , the results of experiment are unmistakable , and there is no room for doubt .
A clear , positive response of more than 0*01 volt , to single shocks of both directions and to alternating currents of both pairs of directions , is proof that the skin is living .
But at later periods , and in cases of skin obtained from the postVoltage of Response of Human Skin after Excitation by Indue Single break current .

| mortem room , more or less doubtful results may be obtained , and unless due regard is paid to possible sources of fallacy , wrong conclusions may be drawn .
A principal source of fallacy lies in the electrodes ; it is less liable to be of disturbing effect in the simple case of excitation by single shocks ; it is more liable to give rise to ambiguous results in the more doubtful cases where alternating currents are required , the resulting polarisation in such case being less easy to recognise as such than in the case of single shocks .
In such cases , when single shocks produce -only polarisation effects , the voltage of any true response that may co-exist is low , and although alternating currents may then bring it into evidence , still we are not wholly free from a polarisation resultant which is of complicated origin and of inconstant direction .

Nos. I to XI were taken with ekms sent to me by Mr. Plimmer from the operating theatre and the room of St. Mary s Hospital .
Nos. XII to XYIII were taken with , for the most part , an amputation skin sent to me from Guy 's Hospital and from Great Ormond Street by the kind directions of Mr. Lane . .
T.he f 'f groups are in complete agreement with the statements made m the text , and with the representative experiment of which the graphic record is reproduced m fig. 1 , viz. , to both directions of single induction shocks , and to ot pairs of directions of alternating tetanising currents the electrical response ot living skm was outgoing ( + ) .
A maximal value of the response under favourable conditions was +0-04 to + 0 *05 volt .
It was noticed on more than one occasion that the summated effect of tetanisa-tion was of about equal voltage to the single response , to a single induction shock ten times as strong .
It was noticed more than once that the electrical response was small immediately alter excision , greater 24 hours later , and subsequently diminishing day by day .
I consider it probable that the smallness of the response of quite freshly excised skm is an effect of the excitation or " shock " of manipulation .
In one particular ms ance , in which the skin had been very thoroughly cleared of subcutaneous tissue , o serve little or no response on the 1st day , and a typical response on the 2nd and succeeding days .
Skm No. 2 observation was most carefully followed out .
It was undoubtedly lvmg on the 7th day , when the following record was obtained , which illustrates o min. Pig .

Positive ( outgoing ) responses to 4* and \#151 ; break induction currents ( coil at 10,000 ) , and to brief tetanisation in both pairs of directions ( coil at 1000 ) .
at the same time the fact mentioned above , viz. , that the summated effects at a given strength of excitation are approximately equal to the single effects at ten times that strength .
The same skin afforded data that illustrate the progressively declining u vitality 99 of surviving skin .
The following tabular summary of notes will suffice to illustrate this point:\#151 ; 1902 .

In all cases where note was taken of the " normal current " this was found to be of ingoing direction , i.e. , contrary to what might be given as current of injury from inner to outer surface .
The voltage was in no case nearly as high as the-voltage of a response\#151 ; e.^ .

-0*0040 " -0*0060 " -0*0130 " In the second group of cases , Nos. XII to XVIII , the skins were those of infants on whom circumcision had been performed , and included therefore a layer of mucous membrane .
In these cases also the normal current as regards the layer of true skin was ingoing ] and the response was outgoing .
But the results are complicated by reason of the mucosa , which as far as I have yet seen responds usually by an ingoing current .
Further observations directed to this point are , however , , necessary .
The conductivity and its modifications are in all cases indicated by means of standard deflections by a given voltage\#151 ; usually 0*01 volt .
The resistance , in a few instances wheatstoned , is generally calculated by reference of the deflection to that of the same voltage through a megohm\#151 ; and usually the disposition of the galvanometer was such that O'Ol volt through 1 meghom ( i.e. 1*10~8 amp .
) gave a deflection of 10 mm. The values for conductivity are given in millimetres of deflection by 0*01 volt , and each millimetre expresses therefore 1*10~9 mho .
