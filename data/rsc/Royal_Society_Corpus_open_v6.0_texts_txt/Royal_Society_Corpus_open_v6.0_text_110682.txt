The reading of a paper , entitled , " On the Nervous System .
" By Sir Charles Bell , F.R.S. , was resumed and concluded .
The author adverting to the papers on the nervous system , which he presented to the Royal Society nearly twenty years ago , recapitulates the train of reasoning which originally led him to the inquiries in which he has been so long engaged , on the different functions of different classes of nerves , and adduces various patho ?
logical facts in corroboration of the correctness of the views he then entertained .
With regard to the spinal nerves , cases are related where , in consequence of disease of the bodies of the vertebrae , the an ?
terior columns of the spinal cord , and anterior roots of the nerves were affected , and paralysis of the muscles to which those nerves are distributed was produced , while the posterior column of the cord was uninjured , and the sensibility unimpaired .
The author next considers the respiratory system of nerves , which he regards as being both muscular and sensitive , and describes as arising from a tract of the spinal cord , on the outside of the corpus olivare , and anterior to the processus ad cerebellum ; and which constitute columns having no decussations with one another , as is the case with the other systems .
The conclusion he originally formed , that both the phrenic and the spinal accessory nerves are provided for motion , which he had deduced from the anatomical fact of the former taking a direct course to the diaphragm , and the latter a circuitous one for the purpose of associating the muscles of the respiratory organs with those which act on the chest , is , he thinks , amply confirmed by subsequent experiments .
He concludes his paper with some remarks on the supply of blood to the respiratory system of nerves , which supply , being derived from branches of the vertebral arteries , affords an explanation of several pathological phenomena .
