] The uterus described in this paper had acquired its full development upon the right side only .
The left side exhibited a straight line , about half an inch distant from its centre .
Upon this side also all the appendages of the uterus were deficient , though their rudiments might be traced .
This woman was the mother of eleven children of both sexes , and had been delivered of twins , male and female , a few days before her death , which was occasioned by diseased heart and aneurism of the aorta .
Dr. Granville remarks that this is the first case upon record which disproves the opinion that the different sides of the uterus are concerned in the production of the two sexes .
It also shows that twins of both sexes may be derived from one ovarium .
This paper concludes with some remarks upon supposed cases of superfcetation .
