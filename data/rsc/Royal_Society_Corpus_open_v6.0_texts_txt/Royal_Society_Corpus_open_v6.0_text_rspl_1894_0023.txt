In Part VII* it has been shown that whilst cadmium can act as ; " solvent 99 metal towards either of the immiscible pairs\#151 ; lead and j zinc , bismuth and zinc- this is not the case when aluminium is sub- i stituted for zinc , because cadmium and aluminium ( contrary to the usual statements in the text-books ) are not miscible in all proportions , unlike cadmium and zinc .
Accordingly , it becomes of interest to examine the behaviour of ternary metallic mixtures where j cadmium and aluminium are the two immiscible metals , more especi- j ally when a 4'solvent ' metal is employed also capable of use in similar fashion with the immiscible pairs , aluminium and lead , aluminium and bismuth , so as to trace out the effect of substituting cadmium for lead or bismuth .
Such a solvent metal is tin ; the volatility of cadmium , however , precludes the possibility of employing | elevated temperatures above the boiling point of that metal ( about J 770 C. ) ; but , thanks to the physical attraction of molten aluminium i for cadmium ( comparable with that of water for gaseous hydrochloric t acid ) , it is possible to keep molten in long narrow crucibles metallic f mixtures containing simultaneously aluminium and cadmium , with- I out any material amount of volatilisation of the latter metal taking I place from the surface of the lighter alloy that floats up ( of which aluminium necessarily constitutes the majority ) , so long as the j * Part I , ' Roy .

131 temperature does not exceed 700 ' to 750 ' .
At temperatures of 800 ' and upwards , however , so much cadmium vapour is given off from the heavier alloy ( in which cadmium predominates ) as seriously to interfere with the experiment , not only because of the alteration in composition thereby produced , but also because of the intermixing effect tending to prevent proper separation by gravitation of the lighter and heavier alloys from one another .
Binary Alloys of Aluminium and Cadmium .
A series of observations was first made to determine the composition of the binary alloys formed when aluminium and cadmium are melted together and well stirred , and then allowed to stand at a temperature of 700\#151 ; 750 ' ( averaging about 725 ' ) for several hours .
The following figures resulted as the averages from twelve tolerably concordant experiments:\#151 ; Heavier alloy .

The alloys were prepared by melting the aluminium , then adding the tin , and finally the cadmium , well stirring as soon as the latter was fluid , pouring quickly into the red-hot clay test-tubes , and maintaining these at 700\#151 ; 750 ' ( averaging about 725 ' ) for from six to eight hours in the lead bath .
The analysis was made by dissolving in hydrochloric acid solution containing nitric acid , diluting and precipitating with sulphuretted hydrogen , and separating the tin and cadmium sulphides by means of ammonium sulphide , the tin being 132 Dr. C. R. Alder Wright .

The filtrate from the sulphides was precipitated by ammonia , the weight of the A1203 finally obtained being corrected for traces of iron and silica present .
As in all previous experiments , the percentages were calculated on the sum of the weights of the three metals found as 100 .

78-2 10-0 11-8 Obviously the effect of substituting cadmium for lead is to depress the critical curve ; it cannot , however , be said with certainty that the same remark applies to the substitution of cadmium for bismuth , although this is probable ; for the cadmium curve , being obtained at 725 ' , is not directly comparable with the bismuth curve obtained at 800 ' ; were the former obtainable with accuracy at 800 ' , it would doubtless be considerably depressed as compared with the curve at 725 ' , and would consequently probably lie wholly inside the bismuth curve at 800 ' ; even as it is , the right-hand branch lies inside .
In confirmation of this , experiments now in progress with aluminium- j cadmium-silver alloys indicate that the critical curve for these alloys lies well inside that with aluminium-bismuth-silver alloys .

Stu As regards the direction of slope of the the-lines , it is noticeable that they are similar in this respect to those obtained with aluminium-bismuth-tin alloys , always sloping downwards to the right ( i.e. , the heavier alloy containing a larger proportion of u solvent " than the conjugate lighter alloy ) ; with aluminium-lead-tin alloys , the lower alloys exhibited a slope to the left , and the upper ones to the right , presumably owing to the formation of a definite compound of tin and lead ( probably Pb3Sn ) , no analogue of which appears to be produced with either bismuth and tin or cadmium and tin .
Alloys containing Aluminium and Lead ( or Bismuth ) as Immiscible Metals , and Antimony as Solvent .
It has been shown in Part VII that when antimony is used as polvent metal , zinc and lead ( or zinc and bismuth ) being the immiscible pairs , the series of conjugate alloys producible are exactly comparable in general characters with the previously described ternary a loys with tin or silver as solvent .
Precisely the same remark VOL. lt .
L Dr. C. R. Alder Wright .
[ Feb. 15 , j applies to the corresponding alloys where aluminium is used instead .
of zinc , with only this difference , that when the proportion of anti- i mony present exceeds a certain amount the mixtures employed no i longer remain completely fluid when kept for several hours at temperatures near 850\#151 ; 900 ' C. ; more or less of the difficultly fusible | antimonide of aluminium , SbAl , described in Part VII , * separates : out in the solid state ; so that in certain cases where the proportion j of antimony is large enough to form a " real " alloy a separation of j the constituents still occurs in consequence of this action , the com- j pound tending to float up through being lighter than the remaining j fluid portion containing the whole of the lead .
In consequence , the critical curve indicated by plotting as usual the compositions of the lowermost and topmost portions of the compound ingot ultimately I obtained exhibits a sort of excrescence or horn in the central portion , j where this abnormal separation occurs .
A similar separation by j solidification of aluminium antimonide is also observed in the case of ; alloys containing ( in suitable proportions ) aluminium , antimony , and some third metal miscible in all proportions with either of them !
separately ; thus with zinc as the third metal , under proper condi- j tions , solid aluminium antimonide separates , the fluid mother liquor , ] so to speak , consisting of the zinc , together with whatever aluminium ; or antimony may be present in excess , and such an amount of AlSb ] as this fused mixture of metals may be capable of permanently dissolving at the particular temperature of the experiment .
Mixtures of Aluminium , Lead , and Antimony .
The following average values were obtained on examination of !
twenty compound ingots ( forty alloys ) , prepared by fusing together the weighed metals at a temperature above the melting point of j silver , and well stirring , pouring into a nearly white-hot clay test-tube , and keeping this for six to eight hours in a lead bath at the highest temperature practicable with the appliances used .
This temperature varied between about 850 ' and 920 ' , averaging near 880 ' ; even at the j hottest , fragments of pure silver did not run down to a liquid , although they fritted together ( melting point of silver near 950 ' 0 .
) .
The analysis was made in the same way as that of the zinc-lead-antimony alloys described in Part VII , excepting that the acid filtrate from the precipitated sulphides of lead and antimony was directly neutralised with ammonia , the precipitated alumina being j weighed , and corrections made for small quantities of F203 and Si02 j present .
* The existence of this definite compound , described by the author in the * Journ. Soc. Chem. Industry , ' 1892 , p. 492 , has been since confirmed by D. A. Roche ( ' Moniteur Scientifique , ' 1893 , p. 269 ) , who appears to have been unacquainted with !

i. Fig. 2 represents these values depicted graphically on the tri- j angular system , the outer dotted line , No. 1 , being the curve obtained with aluminium-lead-tin alloys at about 800 ' ( Part VI ) , and the inner dotted line that for zinc-lead-antimony alloys at 800 ' ( Part VII ) .
Obviously , the first five the-lines belong to a perfectly regular j curve , which , by analogy with the other two dotted curves , might be expected to follow approximately the course indicated by the middle dotted line No. 3 ; so that the the-lines 8 , 9 , and 10 doubtless represent I simply the effect of the separation of solid aluminium antimonide I from what would otherwise be a " real " alloy , this action probably taking place partly during the period of tranquil fusion , and partly during the short time requisite to cool down the resulting compound ingot .
In the case of the-lines 6 and 7 , the mixtures of metals used appear to have corresponded with ideal alloys , and the heavier alloys j that were obtained did not widely differ from such as would be expressed by points on the normal critical curve ; but this was not | the case with the lighter alloys , where the quantities of aluminium On certain Ternary Alloys .

] and antimony present relatively to the lead are abnormally increased through the formation of solid AlSb and its admixture with the fluid lighter alloy .
As regards the direction of slope of the the-lines , it is noticeable that they all slope downwards to the left , as in the case of zinc-lead-antimony alloys .
Obviously , the substitution of aluminium for zinc in these raises the critical curve , as in all other similar cases so far examined .
On the other hand , the substitution of antimony for tin depresses the curve ( so far as the normal portion is concerned , at any rate ) , just as in the case of zinc-lead-tin and zinc-bismuth-tin alloys .
Mixtures of Aluminium , , and Antimony .
A parallel series of experiments with aluminium-bismuth-antimony alloys gave the following results as the averages from the examination of twenty-five compound ingots ( fifty alloys ) .
The analysis was made as in the case of zinc-bismuth-antimony alloys ( Part VII ) , except that the acid filtrate from the precipitated sulphides of bismuth and antimony was precipitated with ammonia , the A1203 ultimately .weighed being corrected for Fe203 and Si02 ( p. 138 ) .

Obviously , the substitution of bismuth for lead depresses the critical curve , as usual ; the uppermost portion shows precisely the same irregularity in the form of a central hornlike excrescence , due to the separation of solid SbAl , as was observed with aluminium-lead-antimony alloys ; whilst the lower portion of the right-hand branch shows the same kind of sharply-marked inward depression as was previously observed with zinc-bismuth-antimony alloys , due to the formation of the definite compound of bismuth and antimony , Sb2Bi3 , aluminium ( like zinc ) being capable of dissolving this compound to a greater extent than mixtures of the two metals where one or the other predominates beyond this proportion .
