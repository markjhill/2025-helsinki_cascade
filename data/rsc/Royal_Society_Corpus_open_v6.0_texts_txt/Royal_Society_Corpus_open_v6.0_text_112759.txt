Crab-oil is obtained from the nuts of a tree named by botanists Hylocarpus carapa , and also Carapa Guianensis .
The tree grows abundantly in the forests of British Guiana ; the oil is prepared by the Indians , who bring it to George Town for sale .
The oil is obtained from the kernels by boiling them for some time , and then placing them in heaps and leaving them for some days ; they are then skinned , and afterwards triturated in wooden mortars until reduced to a paste , which is spread on inclined boards and exposed to the sun ; the oil is thus melted out , and trickles into receiving-vessels .
As no investigation , so far as I have been able to ascertain , has ever been made of the acids contained in this oil , Professor Galloway , to whom I am indebted for the samples of the oil , recommended me to examine them ; and the examination was conducted under his direction .
The oil was in the state in which it is sold by the Indians ; it possessed the appearance of a semifluid butyraceous mass , evolving a peculiar penetrating odour ; its melting-point was 55 ?
C. To obtain the acids , the oil was saponified with a solution of potassic hydrate , and the soap thus obtained dissolved in a large quantity of distilled water ; to the solution sodic chloride was added in considerable excess ; the soap which separated was washed and afterwards dissolved , and the solution treated with hydrochloric acid ; the liberated fatty acids were collected and pressed , then melted in boiling water , and frequently washed to remove all traces of sodic chloride ; the acids were again saponified , and again treated with sodic chloride , but the soda-soap was on this occasion decomposed with tartaric acid .
The mixed acids had a melting-point of 40 ?
C. The acids were dissolved in boiling alcohol of 89 per cent. ; the solution , on cooling , deposited a white radiated crystalline mass , which was repeatedly recrystallized from alcohol until it acquired a constant melting-point ; it was then saponified with a solution of potassic carbonate , and the solution of the mixed potash salts was evaporated to dryness on the water-bath ; the fat salt was then dissolved in absolute alcohol .
The alcoholic solution , unless extremely dilute , does not crystallize on cooling , but merely forms a strong jelly , which was , after pressing , dissolved in water , and the fat acid separated by a strong solution of tartaric acid ; the separated acid was washed with boiling water until all potassic tartrate and tartaric acid were removed : it was subsequently twice crystallized from absolute alcohol : its meltingpoint was then found to be 57 ?
C. The acid , when pure , presents the appearance of a white glistening radiated crystalline mass : two combustions were made ; the acid employed in the two analyses was obtained from two different saponifications I. -259 grm. gave 17115 CO2"and 295 11O0='194 C and -0327 II .

32 I1127 284 100-00 Prejparation of the ' 2aric Salt.-A hot alcoholic solution of the acid was saturated with ammonia in slight excess , and boiledc with a solution of baric acetate ; the precipitate falls as a white'flocculent mass , which , when thoroughly washed , dried , and powdered , has the appearance of a glistening spongy powder .

C. The difference in the melting-points of the acid mass before it was treated with alcohol , and the melting-point of the palmitic acid , indicated that at least one other acid was present , but in very minute quantity .
I attempted to determine the nature of the acid of lower melting-point by exposing the residues obtained from the first three crystallizations of the hard acid to cold in a bath of sodic sulphate and hydrochloric acid , all the hard acid which crystallized out being rejected ; the portion which remained fluid was saponified with potassic carbonate , and the solution of the potash soap was subjected to fractional precipitation by means of plumbic acetate ; the second and smaller precipitate was collected and washed , and treated for some time at a moderate temperature with dilute sulphuric acid ; this caused the separation of a reddish oily-looking liquid which was collected and dissolved in boiling alcohol ; it was afterwards saponified with potassic carbonate , and the silver-salt prepared from that salt .
I only obtained sufficient of the silver-salt from about 2 lbs. of oil to make one determination of the silver and one of the carbon and hydrogen , and frr a these determrinations I did not obtain concordant results , and want of material compelled me to relinquish the further examination of the acid .
