] The most abundant product resulting from the mutual action of sulphuric acid and alcohol , without the application of heat , is the sulphovinic acid ; but on distillation this peculiar product disappears , and ether is formed ; and it becomes a question what part the sulphovinic acid plays in this process .
In opposition to the assertion of Messrs. Dumas and Boullay , that this acid is not concerned in the production of ether , the author contends that whenever ether is formed , it is in consequence of the decomposition of the sulphovinic acid .
He obtained ether from this latter fluid by distillation , when neither sulphuric acid nor alcohol were present ; but if a certain quantity of water has been previously added , the sulphovinic acid is resolved into alcohol and sulphuric acid , and no ether is obtained ; whereas during the distillation of ether in the ordinary way , the sulphovinic acid is re-converted , more or less , entirely into sulphuric acid .
Hence he infer.s that the formation of the sulphovinic acid is a necessary and intermediate step to the production of ether from alcohol and sulphuric acid .
As ether may be formed from alcohol , by the intermedium of sulphuric acid , so by the same intermedium may alcohol be obtained from ether , the sulphovinic acid being in either case formed according to the mode of combination of the hydrocarbonous base .
This theory is also illustrated by the employment of olefiant gas as the hydrocarbonous base , for by combining this gas with sulphuric acid , we may form sulphovinic acid , from which we may obtain at pleasure , by varying the circumstances of the decomposition , either alcohol or ether .
