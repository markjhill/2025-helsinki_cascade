J. NANSON .
Communicated by Professor F.R.S. Received Jnne 5 , read June 17 , Given an equation the form , we obtain by diffel eiation respect to each of the bless equations , togethel with the ol'iginal equation equations , from the constnuts , we have a system of nonlinear partial diffelential tioJlS .
Conversely , a system of ?
non-lioear partial diffelential equations with independent variables , if there ists { equation with r constants , giving rise , as , to the system tions , then this is the " " complete \ldquo ; of the given system .
Starting with such a system of partial diffelelltial tions , it is in the present papel proposed to defcrmine the collditions which mnst be tisfied in older thnt the system admit of a complete , and also to -ind of solution , if exists the conditious referred to llot The late Professor Boole en elegnnt method of system of ] of the first but I am not av th any one the cnsc of -linear system .
Let us begin xs ith the se the dent 1 is not explicitly the proposed hich can thelefore bc ) sented in the form . . . . . . . . .

are such that for every } the condition is identically sntisfied .
If we mine r functions , . . .

the determination of under the above conili tions is a part of the problem considered in Boole 's 'Differential Equa tions , ' volume , p. 115 : the determination is showr to be possible , and a method is given for effecting it .
Hence we see when the conditions are satisiied , the proposed systen has a complete primitive .
lVhen the given system is linear ome , these conditioJlS are idelltica with those used by Boole , p. 81 .
Next suppose that the condition is not sittislied for ever !

If be less than have system similnr to the original one , only containing more equations .
1Ve may therefore apply the above process to this system , Rlld so either demonstrate the non-existence a solution , or find a complete of the form that is , an integral of the , or fall upon a llew system to the given system ( i ) , only mole equations either of the previous systems .
By contiuually ting this process , it is seen that we must cither arrive a solution or prove that a solution docs not exist .
We have now to consider the case in hich the dependcul ariable z is explioity iuvolved in the proposed system , which is therefore ftble in the form . . . . . . . .
Now Jet . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
( liii ) be any relntion between the primitive riables which tisfies the system .
Differentiating with respect to of the ?
independent riables x , . . .
, we Hence , , . . .
, and subshtuting in the proposed systcm ( vii ) , we get a system of equations hich the type is Mr. .
J. Nanson on Diferential . . . . . . .
Hence considered as a funclion of the independent variable1 , . . .
must satisfy a system of partial ential e of the first order ; and in this system the dependent variable does no : .
appear explicitly .
If , then , there be any value of which satisfies system , it can be found by the method given above ; and provided it in .
volve in its expression , the value of found from the equation will be a solution of the original system .
If does not occur in the pression for , then the proposed system can have no solution .
Suppose the systcm of equations of which ( ix ) is the type to have 8 complete primitive of the form coutaining the arbitrary constants , . . . .
Then the equation gives us the of in the form And it is to be observed this value appears to contain one more than the number of arbitrary constants indicated by the theory of the genesis of the systcm ( vii ) as the proper number .
But from the fact tisfies the system ( vii ) of equations , it follows that the constants , . . .
must be equivalent to constants only .
An instance of this occurs the first example given below .
The results of the preceding inquiry may be collected into the ing rules .
systpm of -linear partial differentinl equations of the first order in independent variables , and in which the dependent varinble does not explicitly , to find the nature of the possible ] ution . .
Let the equations by ] gebraical reduction be brought to the form . . . . . . . .
( xi ) , . . .
and examine whether the condition is identically satisfied for pair of the functions , . . . .
If it bs so , then the systcm ill have a primitive of the form , . . . . . . . .
( xiii ) hich may be formed by the method of Boole rel.erred to .
But if an Equations of the First Order .
of the equations of condition ( xu ) be llot satisfied identic , ib will a llew partial differential equation to be combined with the en system .
Let such combination be presented in the form . . . . . .
( xiv ) this system in the just done ( xi ) , we either solntion of the form or fall upon a system of equations to and ( xiv ) .
ceeding in this we mustfinally arrive solution of the form is less than , or else we shall the system ; and if the conditions are sntisfied , we solution ; but conditions not tisfied , then there is no solution . .
Required the integral of the neous c Let be iLnd let ; then and the colldition is tisfied .
Also it is eitsily seeu thnt the functions satisfy the leqnisite conditions .
Hence we take , . . . .

Have the simultaneous equations , any solution ?
Proceeding as in the last example , we find and the condition is not tisfied .
Accordingly we rite From these we find ' and arc thence led to the alcnt system , Also it is ] yseell thttt he metions , .
