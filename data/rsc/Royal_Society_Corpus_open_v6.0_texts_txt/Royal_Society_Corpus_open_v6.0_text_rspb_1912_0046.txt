The Measurement of Trypanosoma rhodesiense .
223 first hour was 108 per minute , while feeding with diabetic blood ; during the second hour , after the addition of pancreatic extract to the same blood , the heart beats rose to 144 per minute .
We hope to continue these experiments , and especially to determine the respiratory quotient in the normal and in the diabetic heart , and the influence of pancreatic extract on the same .
So far as our results go , they seem to indicate that the pancreas normally produces a hormone which circulates in the blood , and the presence of which is necessary in order that the tissue cells may be able to assimilate and utilise the sugar of the blood .
In fact , they indicate that the second of the two explanations , which have been mentioned above as having been proposed for the occurrence of pancreatic diabetes , is essentially correct .

] Introduction .
The following paper contains the results of a biometric study of Trypanosoma , rhodesiense ( Stephens and Fantham ) .
This trypanosome , which is dimorphic , was described by us in July , 1910 .
It was considered to be a new species of trypanosome , producing Sleeping Sickness in man , since it could be distinguished morphologically by the fact that a certain percentage of short forms showed the nucleus either close to or even posterior to the blepharoplast , a feature which has never been recorded for T. gambiense , either before or since .
Otherwise , in external morphology T. rhodesiense closely resembles T. gambiense , for there are long , slender forms and short , stumpy forms , together with intermediate forms .
These flagellates were figured by us 224 Drs. J. W. W. Stephens and H. B. Fantham .
[ Mar. 28 , ( 1910 ) in our original plate and are well shown in the accompanying coloured plate , for which we are indebted to Lady Bruce .
Methods .
The blood-films used were quickly dried , fixed in absolute alcohol , and stained with a modified Romanowsky solution .
Films of this nature contain trypanosomes most nearly approximating to the natural size .
The flagellates suffer shrinkage in films fixed with sublimate-alcohol .
One thousand specimens of the trypanosome have been measured after the manner introduced by Sir David Bruce for the differentiation of various trypanosomes .
In this method the length of the median longitudinal axis , including the free flagellum , is determined as accurately as possible .
We found it advisable to modify Bruce 's method in some respects:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Instead of drawing the trypanosomes with a camera lucida , it is much easier to project them on a screen , using a photomicrographic apparatus in a dark room , and then to trace them in outline with a finely pointed pencil .
The magnification is verified by projecting a millimetre scale in the same manner .
The magnification adopted was 2500 diameters , using a 2-mm .
apochromatic objective and an 8 compensating ocular .
This method not only saves much eyestrain in drawing , but is also much quicker .
( 2 ) A more important modification consists in the actual mode of measuring the trypanosomes drawn on paper .
Sir David Bruce uses for this purpose a pair of compasses , set at a fixed distance of 2 mm. , his trypanosomes being magnified 2000 times .
There are , however , two objections to this method:\#151 ; ( a ) It cannot and does not give an accurate measurement , because the compass makes a series of " jumps " and theoretically and actually the measurements given are always less than the true ones .
We can illustrate our objections perhaps by supposing that we have to measure the outline made by the teeth of a saw .
If the teeth are equal and the distance between the compass-points is equal to the depth of a tooth , then the course can be measured .
If the depths of the teeth are unequal , then it will be impossible to get an accurate measurement by the compass method , though this can be accurately done by the " tangent line " method .
Although the curves of a trypanosome do not change their direction so acutely as the outline of a saw , yet the curves often do change their direction to some extent and the principle of the objection remains .
We therefore used the method which we call the " tangent line " method .
The requirements are:\#151 ; ( 1 ) a piece of tracing paper on which a straight line is drawn in ink , ( 2 ) a pin , ( 3 ) a millimetre scale .
The tracing paper is 1912 .

225 placed over the drawing of the trypanosome , which is seen through it .
When the tracing paper is fixed by slight pressure of the pin placed on the ink line , the tracing paper can be rotated and the most tortuous curves followed with ease .
One end of the ink line is placed on one end of the trypanosome .
If the axis of the trypanosome curves , for example , at the nucleus , the pin is placed at this point and the paper is now rotated until the ink line coincides with the new direction of the axis .
This is done as often as is necessary , and in fact the sharpest curves can be followed in this way , which is impossible by a compass , the points of which are at a fixed distance .
Finally the other end of the trypanosome is reached , the pin is placed there and the actual extent of the ink line traversed is measured by the millimetre scale .
Further , the method has the advantage that it can equally well be applied to the measurement of any other curved line , for example , the axis of a spirochaete .
( b ) Another objection to the compass method is that , if a start be made at the non-flagellar end of the^ trypanosome , it is uncertain that the finish will be exactly at the end of the flagellum .
If not , there is always a portion of a compass distance which has to be guessed .
With the tangent line method this is avoided , and the finish is exactly at the end .
The measurements could also be made by a self-registering rotameter ( " map-measurer " ) , but we think that it is not quite such a convenient method for accurately following the curve .
It may be added that all the trypanosomes were outlined by one of us , and measured by the other .

If now the 1000 T. rhodesiense are divided according to length into three groups\#151 ; ( a ) short and stumpy forms of 13 to 21 microns , ( jb ) intermediate forms of 22 to 24 microns , and ( c ) long and slender forms of 25 microns and upwards ( as has been done by Sir David Bruce in his researches on trypanosomes ) , and comparison of them with Bruce 's results for T. gambiense and T. brucei be made , the following percentage distributions are obtained :\#151 ; Table V. Short and stumpy , 13\#151 ; 21 Intermediate , 22\#151 ; 24 fi .
Long and slender , 25\#151 ; 39 / a. per cent. per cent. per cent. T. gambiense ... 51 2 23 -1 25 -7 T. brucei 32 -8 25 *5 41 -7 T. rhodesiense 36 1 19 -8 44 *1 We note that T. rhodesiense is richest in long and slender forms and poorest in intermediate forms .
If the percentages in the three groups are calculated for ( i ) each of the hosts infected with T. gambiense recorded in Bruce 's Table III , and for ( ii ) each of the hosts infected with T. rhodesiense recorded in our Table I , then large variations are found to occur .
Thus , from a comparison of 1000 T. gambiense , measured from seven species of animals by Bruce , on a variety of { days , and 1000 T. rhodesiense , measured by us from eight species of animals on a variety of days , the following results are obtained Table YI . .

If , again , a study of the distribution of 1000 gambiense , 1000 T. rho-desiense , and 1000 T. brucei* is made by the more usual method of quartiles or octiles , the following results are obtained:\#151 ; Table VIII .

[ Mar. 28 , We also give a chart of six hundred T. rhodesiensb taken from the same species of host , namely , rats :\#151 ; Microns Chart 2.\#151 ; Curve representing distribution , by percentages in respect to length , of 600 specimens of T. rhodesiense from rats .
( See Addendum .
) If we now consider the graphic representation of our measurements of T. rhodesiense , as seen in Charts 1 and 2 , and compare them with Bruce 's curves of T. gambiense and T. brucei , we note the following points :\#151 ; .
While T. gambiense presents a curve with a single marked peak at 20 g , T. rhodesiense presents a series of small irregular peaks extending from 18 g to 28 g , with the highest peaks at 20 g and 26 g. In the case of T. brucei there is a slightly irregular curve extending from 18 g to 26 g , with a well-marked peak at 24 g. Considering the three curves together , we note again that T. rhodesiense appears to be different from T. gambiense , but that the difference from T. brucei is slight .
Discussion of Results .
1 .
We consider that a sample of 20 trypanosomes , at least in the case of dimorphic species like T. rhodesiense , from a particular slide on a particular day is too small , as the average length obtained in this way may vary in extreme cases between 24'4 g and 29*1 g ( see Table I , Bat B 42 ) .
2 .
The day of infection on which the measurement is taken is very important , for , as we have seen in Table VII , on one day 10 per cent , of stumpy forms may be found , on another day 95 per cent. This must , we think , be due to an actual change in the number of trypanosomes of any particular length present , and not to an error of measurement .
3 .
It is probable also that the host from which the trypanosome is taken is an important factor .
It is difficult to be quite certain of this , I 1912 .
] The Measurement of Trypanosoma rhodesiense .
233 because the variation may be due to the cause just stated , namely , the day of infection .
4 .
However , giving these sources of error due weight , we think that the fact that there is a general resemblance between the curves representing the measurements of these three trypanosomes , T. brucei)shows that the method is a trustworthy one .
5 .
The measurements of T. rhodesiense are much closer to those of brucei than to those of T. gambiense .
We do not consider , however , that identity of measurement would necessarily imply identity of species .
We still believe that the difference in internal morphology , namely the presence of the posterior nucleus , is sufficient to separate T. rhodesiense both from gambiense arid T.brucei .
' 6 .
We think , however , that in the future , in order to get as accurate results as possible , it will be necessary on any particular day to measure larger samples than 20 trypanosomes .
How large these samples must be it is , at present , impossible to say , for we have not the requisite data .
This is a point we propose shortly to investigate .
At present we would suggest that , in order to eliminate unknown possible variations due to the use of different hosts , samples should always be taken from the same animal , and , as we have shown that there are large variations on different days , samples should be taken on every day of the infection .
Tame rats would appear to be the most suitable animals , as they are susceptible to the large majority of pathogenic trypanosomes .
( See Addendum .
) Mr. Walter Stott , Honorary Statistician to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , has kindly examined our figures and curves , and is of opinion that , on the whole , the data at present available are insufficient to enable statistical criticism to be applied , as there are no standard curves for comparison .
We propose therefore shortly to investigate the subject further from the various additional points of view that we have indicated. .
Addendum , April 29 , 1912.\#151 ; Since writing the preceding we have completed a fresh series of measurements of Trypanosoma rhodesiense from a single rat , beginning with the first day of infection , and measuring 100 trypanosomes per day during 10 consecutive days of infection .
We have thus obtained measurements of 1000 trypanosomes from the same rat .
On representing the results graphically , it was found that the curve resembled that of Chart 2 ( for 600 trypanosomes from rats ) , rising with slight irregularities to a peak at 26 / a(as does the curve of Chart 2 ) , and then falling rapidly to 34 / / , .

) While carrying out other work at Mpumu , the opportunity has presented itself of examining the Hemiptera from the surrounding country , and some interesting protozoan infections have been found .
The group has a certain importance in this connection in that it includes the two parasitic genera , Cirnex and Conorrhynus .
Cimex has fallen under suspicion in regard to kala azar , and a species of Conorrhynus is definitely incriminated as the transmitting agent of the South American trypanosomiasis .
Certain non-parasitic species , generally belonging to the group of the Reduviidse , occasionally attack man .
An instance of this has been reported by Dr. H. L. Duke from the neighbourhood of Mpumu .
He has on several occasions been bitten by a hitherto unrecorded species of Henicocephalus .
Cases of this kind are also known from other part of Africa , and from India .
It is , therefore , not without interest to obtaih some knowledge of the Protozoa infesting Hemiptera generally , and more especially of the flagellates .
So far as I am aware none of the species dealt with here are known to attack man or other vertebrates .
