" On the New Gases obtained from Uraninite .
( Sixth Note .
) " By J. Norman Lockyer , C.B. , F.R.S. Received September 10 , 1895 .
As Mr. Crookes has now published* the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectra of the new mineral gases observed by him in the tubes supplied by Professor Ramsay , I propose in the present paper to bring together some notes I have made ( some of them some time ago ) on the same subject .
The researches made at Kensington in connection with the new gases obtained from broggerite and other minerals has consisted , to a large extent , of comparisons of the lines in their spectra with lines in the spectra of the sun and stars .
Preliminary accounts of these comparisons have already been given , and they show that the bright yellow line seen in the gas from broggerite is by no means the only important one which appears .
Although the general distribution and intensities of the lines in the gases from broggerite and cleveite sufficiently corresponded with some of the chief " unknown lines " in the solar chromosphere and some of the stars to render identity probable , it was desirable to see how far the conclusion is sustained by detailed investigations of the wave-lengths of the various lines .
The Yellow Line X 5875'9.\#151 ; Immediately on receiving from Professor Ramsay , on March 28th , a small bulb of the gas obtained from cleveite , a provisional determination of wave-length was made by Mr. Fowler and myself , in the absence of the sun , by micrometric comparisons with the D lines of sodium , the resulting wave-length being 5876,07 on Rowland 's scale .
It was at once apparent , therefore , that the gas line was not far removed from the chromospheric D3 , the wave-length of which is given by Rowland as 5875'98 .
The bulb being too much blackened by sparking to give sufficient luminosity for further measurements , I set about preparing some of the gas for myself by heating broggerite vacuo , in the manner I have already described .
A new measurement was thus secured on March 30 with a spectroscope having a dense Jena glass prism of 60 ' ; this gave the wave-length 5876'0 .
On April 5th , I attempted to make a direct comparison with the chromospheric line , but though the lines were shown to be excessively near to each other , the observations were not regarded as final .
Professor Ramsay having been kind enough to furnish me , on May 1 , with a vacuum tube which showed the yellow line very brilliantly , a further comparison with the chromosphere was made * ' Chemical News , ' August 23 , 1895 .
1895.1 On the new Gases obtained from on May 4 .
The observations were made by Mr. Fowler , in the third order spectrum of a grating having 14438 lines to the inch , and the observing telescope was fitted with a high power micrometer eyepiece ; the dispersion was sufficient to easily show the difference of position of the D3 line on the east and west limbs , due to the sun 's rotation .
Observations of the chromosphere were therefore confined to the poles .
During the short time that the tube retained its great brilliancy , a faint line , a little less refrangible than the bright yellow one , and making a close double with it , was readily seen ; but afterwards a sudden change took place , and the lines almost faded away .
While the gas line was brilliant , it was found to be " the least trace more refrangible than D3 , about the thickness of the line itself , which was but narrow " ( ' Observatory Note-book ' ) .
The sudden diminution in the brightness of the lines made subsequent observations less certain , but the instrumental conditions being slightly varied , it was thought that the gas line was probably less refrangible than the D3 line by about the same amount that the first observation showed it to be more refrangible .
Giving the observations equal weight , the gas line would thus appear to be probably coincident with the middle of the chromospheric line , but if extra weight be given to the first observation , made under much more favourable conditions , the gas line would be slightly more refrangible than the middle of the chromosphere line .
Pressure of other work did not permit the continuation of the comparisons .
In the meantime , Rung and Paschen announced* that they also had seen the yellow line of the cleveite gas to be a close double , neither component having exactly the same wave-length as D3 , according to Rowland .
They give the wave-length of the brightest component as 5878,883 , and the distance apart of the lines as 0323 .
This independent confirmation of the duplicity of the gas line led me to carefully re-observe the D3 line in the chromosphere for evidences of doubling .
On June 14 observations were made by Mr. Shackleton and myself of the D3 line in the 3rd and 4th order spectra under favourable conditions ; " the line was seen best in the 4th order , on an extension of the chromosphere or prominence on the north-east limb of the sun .
The D3 line was seen very well , having every appearance of being double , with a faint component on the red side , dimming away gradually ; the line of demarcation between the components was not well marked , but it was seen better in the prominence than anywhere else on the limb .

[ Nov. 21 , ordinarily seen , and as taken in tke comparison of May 4 , does not represent the place of the brightest component of the double line , so that exact coincidence was not to be expected .
Though the observations are not yet quite completed , the circumstance that the line is double in both gas and chromosphere pectrum , in each the less refrangible component being the fainter , taken in conjunction with the direct comparisons which have been made , render it highly probable that one of the gases obtained from cleveite is identical with that which produces the D3 line in the spectrum of the chromosphere .
Other observers have since succeeded in resolving the chromospheric line .
On June 20 , Professor Hale found the line to be clearly double in the spectrum of a prominence , the less refrangible component being the fainter , and the distance apart of the lines being measured as 0'357 tenth-metre.* The doubling was noted with much less distinctness in the spectrum of the chromosphere itself on June 24 .
Professor Hale points out that Rowland 's value of the wave-length ( as well as that of 5875'924 , determined by himself on June 19 and 20 ) does not take account of the fact that the line is a close double .
Dr. Huggins , after some failures , observed the D3 line to be double on July 10 ; f he also notes that the less refrangible component was the fainter , and that the distance apart of the lines was about the same as that of the lines in the gas from cleveite , according to Rung and Paschen .
It may be added , that in addition to appearing in the chromosphere , the D3 line has been observed as a bright line in nebulas by Dr. Copeland , Professor Keeler , and others ; in / 3 Lyrae and other bright line stars ; and as a dark line in such stars as Bellatrix , by Mr. Fowler , Professor Campbell , and Professor Keeler .
In all these cases it is associated with other lines , which , as I shall show presently , are associated with it in the spectra of the new gases .
The Blue line , A 447P8.\#151 ; A provisional determination on April 2 of the wave-length of a bright blue line , seen in the spectrum of the gases obtained from a specimen of cleveite , showed that it approximated very closely to a chromospheric line , the frequency of which is stated as 100 by Young .
This line was also seen very brilliantly in the tube supplied to me by Professor Ramsay on May 1 , and on May 6 it was compared directly with the chromosphere line by Mr. Fowler .
The second order grating spectrum was employed .
The observations in this region were not so easy as in the case of D3 , but with the dispersion employed , the gas line was found to be coincident with the chrotno- * ' Asfc .

] On the new Gases obtained from spheric one .
In this case also , the chromosphere was observed at the sun 's poles , in order to eliminate the effects due to the sun 's rotation .
In a former note* I have pointed out that this line does not appear in the spectra of the gases obtained from all minerals which give the yellow line .
Besides appearing in the spectrum of the chromosphere , the line m question is one of the first importance in the spectra of nebulae , bright line stars , and of the white stars such as Bellatrix and Rigel .
The Infra-red Line , X 7065*5.\#151 ; In addition to D3 and the line at 4471*8 , there is a chromospheric line in the infra-red which also has a frequency of 100 , according to Young .
On May 28,1 communicated a note to the Royal Society stating that this line had been observed in the spectrum of the gases obtained from broggerite and euxenite , f solar comparisons having convinced me that the wave-length of the gas line corresponded with that given by Young ; and I added it follows , therefore , that besides the hydrogen lines , all three chromospheric lines in Young 's list which have a frequency of 100 have now been recorded in the spectra of the new gas or gases obtained from minerals by the distillation method .
" M. Deslandres , of the Paris Observatory , has also observed the line at 7065 in the gas obtained from cleveite .
J Other Lines.\#151 ; Determinations of the wave-lengths of many other lines in the spectra of the new gases have been made , chiefly with the aid ofja Steinheil spectroscope having four prisms , and the results leave little doubt as to the coincidence of several lines with those appearing in the chromosphere , nebulae , and white stars .
It seems very pi'obable , also , that many lines which have been noted , and for which no origins have yet been traced , belong to gases which have not hitherto been recorded in the chromosphere .
The following table summarises the chief lines which have so far been recorded in the new gases from various minerals , some of which show D3 while others do not .
Only those lines which also appear in the spectrum of the chromosphere , nebulae , or Orion stars , are given in the first instance .
There are other lines which are probably also associated with chromospheric ones , but further investigation of them is considered desirable before they are included in the list .
The first column of the table gives the wave-lengths of the lines on Rowland 's scale , while the second gives the wave-lengths on Angstrom 's scale ; the third gives the frequency of the lines in the chromosphere according to Young .
In the fourth column lines photographed with the prismatic camera during the total eclipse of April 16 , 1893 , are shown ; these have been included because in some cases * ' Roy .

[ Nov. 21 , lines which appear to be comparatively unimportant in Young 's list were photographed as important lines .
The fifth column indicates probable coincidences with lines in the spectrum of the Orion nebula ; the accuracy of these wave-lengths is of necessity less than in the case of the chromosphere ; with the exception of D3 they are taken from my paper on the photographic spectrum of the Orion nebula.* The sixth column shows probable coincidences with dark lines in the spectrum of Bellatrix , this being taken as an example of the Orion stars , f the lines 4922-3 and 5015-8 have been photographed since the date of the paper to which reference is made .

X This line is too close to a hydrogen line to enable a definite statement to be made .
S Professor Young has recently called attention to the fact that although this line was not included in his chromospheric list , lie observed and published it in 1883 ; its frequency is about 15 .
