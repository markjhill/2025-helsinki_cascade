" The Electric Fluid .
" By W. F. Stevenson , Esq. , F.R.S. The author denies the existence of two electric fluids , and maintains that all the phenomena are explicable on the hypothesis of a single fluid ; which when present in a conducting body renders it positive , and in a non-conducting body , negative ; but a body which is naturally a conductor , may , he asserts , be rendered otherwise , by changing its form .
