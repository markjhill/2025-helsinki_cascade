Received June 19 , 1888 , ( Abstract .
) The paper contains an account of experiments made to determine the value of the resistance of a column of mercury , 1 metre long and 1 sq .
mm. in cross section , in terms of the B.A. unit .
The method employed differed very slightly from that of Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick ( 'Phil .
Trans. , ' 1883 ) .
Tubes of about 1 , 2 , and 3 sq .
mm. in cross section were calibrated and filled with mercury .
They were then immersed in melting ice , and their resistance compared with that of the B.A. standards , using Carey Foster 's method and the B.A. bridge .
The length of the mercury column , occupying nearly the whole of the tube , was measured , and the mass of the same determined .
From this the average cross section is obtained , and hence the value of r , the resistance of a column 1 metre long , 1 sq .
mm. in cross section .
The mercury used to find the cross section was with few exceptions that which had been employed in finding the resistance .
The results of the measurements are given in Table I. In the table , Column 1 gives the number of the tube , Column 2 the number of the observation .
L is the length of the tube , and a the mean radius of the cross section , R the observed resistance in B.A. units .
The mean value of r found from the three 1 mm. tubes is 0 95354 B.A. units .
The other four tubes of one-half and one-third units respectively lead to the value r = 0-95344 B.A. units .
The difference between the two is considerable , and reasons are given for assigning more weight to the first value .
For an account of the experiments and of the small precautions necessary to secure accuracy , reference must be made to the paper .
Table II gives a list of the various values which have been found for r with the lengths of the column of mercury which , according to the different observers , has a resistance of 1 ohm ( 109 C.G.S. units of resistance ) .
In combining our own observations we have assigned weights to ' the various tubes inversely proportional to their diameters , and we find , as our final value r = 0*95352 .

It is sbovvn that probably Lord Rayleigh 's value of r may be too high by as much as 0-0002 , in consequence of the fact that the mercury in his terminal cups was 5 ' or 6 ' 0 .
, but no complete explanation of the differences between his result and those of Rowland , Kohlrausch , and ourselves , has been found .
The difficulty of working with tubes such as those used by the Lorentz , 1\#151 ; 2 metres in length , and 1 , 2 , and 3 cm .
in diameter , may perhaps account for his value for the ohm , viz. , 105*93 .

( Abstract .
) The author examines the structure of the skull in the Dicynodontia , and discusses the interpretations of its elements and affinities given by Sir Richard Owen , Professor Huxley , and Professor Cope , and arrives at the conclusion that the interpretation of the bones of the palate may be varied .
The quadrate bone is found , though it is absent from many specimens owing to loose articulation , and the malleus is recognised as a normal element in the skull , which articulates -with the quadrate and is free , except at its extremities . . .
palatine bones are internal to the pterygoids , and the pterygoids extend forward to the maxillary .
The columella is found m more than one specimen .
Many new specimens are described which further elucidate the structure of the skull .
