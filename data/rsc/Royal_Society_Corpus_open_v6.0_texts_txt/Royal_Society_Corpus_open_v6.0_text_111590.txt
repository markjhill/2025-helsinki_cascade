( Abstract .
) The author sketches the investigation of the way of throwing various series of integer terms into arithmetical progressions , such as the sums of squares , cubes , &amp;c. of figurate numbers , of the powers of a number , &amp;c. He also gives the resolution of a given number , 2 in certain cases , into arn arithmetical progression .
Thus , having the theorem that N can be resolved into an arithmetical progression when 16 N ?
I is a square , he is enabled to detect factors in N ; he thus shows that 2079519603 has 43 and 101 among its factors .
Among theorems which the method gives , may be noticed the following , as one of a peculiar and unstudied class .
If in the series 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , &amp;c. four terms be taken , and the next one omitted , then the four next terms taken and the next three omitted , then four terms taken andfive omitted , and so on , the four terms taken will in every case conisist of numbers prinme to one aothe
