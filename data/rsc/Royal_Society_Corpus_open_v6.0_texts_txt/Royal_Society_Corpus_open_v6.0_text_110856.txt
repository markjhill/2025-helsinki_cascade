" On the supposed Properties of the Electric and Magnetic Fluids .
" By W. F. Stevenson , Esq. , F.R.S. The author is of opinion that electricity is a single undecomposable fluid , and that the distinction usually made into vitreous and resinous , or positive and negative electricities , is derived altogether from the direction of its motion and the circumstances under which it is presented ; and , according as it is found on a conducting or non-conducting body , it is positive in the former case and negative in the latter .
The quality of the electricity is , according to the author , modified by the form of the conducting body , which , when globular , opposes its escape ; but , when pointed , facilitates its passage in a current .
He considers the magnetic fluid as obeying the same law as the electric fluid , that is , moving in a current , which when aided , and not interrupted , will always be found positive , or having a north pole , at that end of the conductor or magnet where the fluid is escaping ; and negative , or with a southern polarity , at the opposite extremlity .
