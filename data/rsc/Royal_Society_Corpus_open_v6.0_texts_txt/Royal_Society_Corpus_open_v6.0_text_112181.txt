The principal object of this paper was to trace the relation between the decrement of mean temperature and the increment of height above the level of the sea in different regions of High Asia , to connect the variations observed from the general mean of the whole ( 390 feet increase of height for a diminution of 1 ?
F. in mean temperature ) with the variations 547 Mr. Hartnup on testing Chronometers of season and of geographical position , and also to point out the cause of certain peculiarities in the climate of High Asia .
As it has been ascertained that the paper was read to the Academy of Scielces at Berlin on the ist of June , and is printed at length , with its accompanying plates , in the ' Monatsbericht ' for August 1865 , the reader is referred to that puhlication .
