) Up to the beginning of 1909 it was believed that the spread of trypanosome diseases , such as Sleeping Sickness and Kagan a , was effected by the-mechanical transmission of the parasite by the tsetse fly .
The proboscis was .
supposed to be contaminated by being dipped in the infected blood , and some of the trypanosomes were pictured as remaining for some time within the : tube and capable of being injected into a fresh animal at the next feed of the fly .
Successful experiments were described which seemed to prove that the tsetse fly was capable of remaining infective for 48 hours , but not longer and it was thought that any given Sleeping Sickness area would be free from danger a few days after the infected population had been removed from it .
Dr. Kleine , however , at the end of 1908 , showed that the tsetse fly remains infective for a much longer period , and that a period of non-infectivity of 20 days or more elapses before this power of passing on the parasite is .
gained .
In other words , that the Trypanosoma , gambiense undergoes some process of development in the fly before it is able to infect a fresh animal .
It-was evident , then , that the mechanical theory had to be modified .
It was now held that , in addition to the mechanical method , a mode involving a developmental phase within the fly must be reckoned with .
But it was still considered likely that the mechanical was by far the more common mode of infection , and that for every case due to a developmentally-infected fly , a hundred would be due to recent contamination .
At the same time , it was quite evident , from an examination of the old feeding experiments after 8 , 12 , 24 , and 48 hotirs , that the successful results recorded might have to be credited to late-infectivity rather than to mechanical transmission .
The experiments lasted so long that there was enough time for the unsuspected late development of the parasite in the fly to have caused the infection .
1 The following experiments were therefore made to put this matter to the ' proof .
The flies , after having had their infective feed , were , as a rule , not allowed to feed on a healthy animal for more than 12 days , in this way ; Transmission of Sleeping Sickness by the Tsetse Fly .

A. Mechanical Transmission of Trypanosoma gambiense .
Interrupted Feeding .
In interrupted feeding , the cage containing the flies is first placed on the infected animal for some little time , then suddenly transferred to the healthy animal , and so backwards and forwards for 10 to 15 minutes .
This is meant to imitate the conditions in Nature , when sick and healthy natives are sitting together on the Lake-shore , and the tsetse flies are continually flitting from one to the other .

The trypanosomes are usually very few and far between in the blood of cattle , which probably accounts for the negative result .

The goat , Experiment 1495 , was examined daily for trypanosomes until October 16 , but none was seen .
On October 1 , 21 days after the last feed of infected Olossince palpalis , 4 c.c. of the blood of this goat were injected into monkey , Experiment 17,77 .
This monkey showed trypanosomes on October 16 , proving that the goat , Experiment 1495 , had become infected from the monkey by interrupted feeding , though trypanosomes failed to appear in its blood .

1 .
The mechanical transmission of Sleeping Sickness by means of Glossina palpalis can take place if the transference of the flies from the infected to the healthy animal is instantaneous\#151 ; that is , by interrupted feeding .
2 .
This mechanical transmission does not take place if an interval of time comes between the feedings .
3 .
Mechanical transmission plays a much smaller part , if any , in the spread of Sleeping Sickness than has been supposed .
