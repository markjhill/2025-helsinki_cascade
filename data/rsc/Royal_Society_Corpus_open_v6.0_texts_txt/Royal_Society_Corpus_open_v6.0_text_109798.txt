Further Experiments on the Light of the Cassegrainian Telescope compared with that of the Gregorian .
By Captain Henry Kater , Brigade-Major .
In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K.B. P.R.S. Read November 18 , 1813 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1814 , p. 231 .
] The experiments detailed in the present letter were conducted exactly in the same manner as those detailed by Capt. Kater in his former communication , for the purpose of comparing a new Cassegrainian telescope , made by Mr. Crickmore of Ipswich , with the Gregorian used in the former experiments .
The diameter of the large speculum in this instrument is 4*9 inches , but was reduced by a ring of pasteboard to 3-6 , in order to render the illumination equal to that of the Gregorian , in which the large speculum measured 3*95 inches .
The areas exposed to the light being estimated at 7-152 and 10*593 , and the magnifying powers at the same time being 157 and 125 respectively , the illuminating powers of the two telescopes are inferred to be as 678 to 290 .
The mean of this and the two former experiments , without makifig allowance for the imperfect polish of the Cassegrainian in one of them , gives the comparative superiority in the illuminating power of the Cassegrainian more than 2 to 1 ; or if the experiment which the author considers less perfect be rejected , it would appear to be 2to I in favour of the Cassegrainian construction .
