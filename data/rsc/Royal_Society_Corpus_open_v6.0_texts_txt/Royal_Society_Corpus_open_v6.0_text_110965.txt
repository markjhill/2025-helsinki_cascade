" By Henry Bence Jones , M.D. , F.R.S. , Physician to St. George 's Hospital .
The chemical analysis of this substance showed it to be the hydrated deutoxide of albumen , of which 66'97 parts were contained in every 1000 parts of urine , an amount equal to the proportion of albumen in healthy blood ; so that every ounce of urine secreted was equivalent to the loss of an equal quantity of blood .
The peculiar characteristic of this substance was its solubility in water , and its being precipitated by nitric acid ; the precipitate being dissolved by heat , and again thrown down by cold .
The urine which contained it was reddened by the addition of nitric acid ; a phenomenon , the occurrence of which might , in filture cases , lead to its re-discovery .
A letter was read from William A. Norton , Esq. , addressed to the President and Fellows of the Royal Society , and communicated by Lieut.-Colonel Sabine , R.A. , For .
Sec. R.S. , containing the notice of some results which the author states he has obtained fiomi a mathematical investigation founded on a new theory of Terrestrial Magnetism , and which he intends , at an early period , to communicate to the Society .
