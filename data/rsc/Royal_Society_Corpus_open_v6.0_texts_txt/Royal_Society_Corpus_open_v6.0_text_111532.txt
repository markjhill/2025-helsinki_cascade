496 If the space be nearer to the station , or if the difference in density be more than 1-100th part , these deflections must be multiplied by a corresponding quantity .

The paper is concluded by a revision of some of the calculations in the former communication .
The mass of the mountain region abQve the level of the plains is shown to be somewhat more than four-millionths of the mass of the earth .

( Abstract .
) The author in this paper gives an experimental demonstration of the correctness of Professor Thomson 's formula , 0= , Te , where 0 is JK ' the thermal effect , T the temperature from absolute zero , e the expansibility by heat , p the pressure , J the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit , and K the capacity for heat .
The fluids experimented on were water and oil , with the results tabulated below : Temperature Pressure Experimental Theoretical of the liquid .

" Note on Archdeacon PRATT'S paper on the Effect of Local Attraction on the English Arc. " By Captain CLARKE , R.E. Communicated by Lieult.-Colonel JAMEs , R.E. Received June 30 , 1858 .
The following letter of Colonel James will explain the nature of this communicatio n ; the numerical statements , being not susceptible 497 of abridgement , are reserved for the Philosophical Transactions , in which the paper will appear .
' Ordnance Survey Office , Southampton , June 29,1858 .
" In the valuable communication by Archdeacon Pratt 'On the Effect of Local Attraction upon the Plumb-line at Stations on the English Arc of the Meridian between Dunnose and Burleigh Moor , ' which is published in part 1 .
vol. cxlvi .
of the Philosophical Transactions , the data for the calculation are taken from vols .
ii .
and iii , of the Trigonometrical Survey , which were published in 1811 .
Since the publication of those volumes the triangulation has been extended over the whole of the United Kingdom , new bases have been measured , and all the calculations have been revised ; and as considerable errors have been detected in the distances used as data by Archdeacon Pratt , I directed Captain Clarke to substitute the correct distances in the formulae used by the Archdeacon , and recompute the ellipticity and the amount of the local attraction at the several stations .
The accompanying paper contains the results ; and you will see that we have simply made the numerical computations without presuming to alter the formulae employed ; in fact I have considered it almost a duty on our part to supply the labour of recomputation , the necessity for which was caused by the errors in our first published volumes .
