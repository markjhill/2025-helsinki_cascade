) In an earlier paper* of this series it was shown that cholesterol is not excreted in the feces of herbivorous animals , and that when rabbits are fed on a diet free from phytosterol but containing measured quantities of cholesterol , a portion of the latter substance is absorbed .
The hypothesis was put forward that cholesterol is a substance which is strictly conserved in the animal economy ; that when the destruction of the red blood corpuscles and possibly other cells takes place in the liver , their cholesterol is excreted in the bile , and that the cholesterol of the bile is reabsorbed in the intestine along with the bile salts , and finds its way into the blood stream to be used in cell-anabolism .
It was also suggested that any waste of cholesterol might possibly be made up from that taken in with the food .
In order to test this view , comparative estimations were made of the total cholesterol content of the blood of rabbits that had been respectively fed on bran which had previously been thoroughly extracted with ether , and on the same extracted bran with the addition of known amounts of cholesterol , care being taken that the animals were otherwise identically treated and were kept in good health .
The results of the experiments showed that some , at any rate , of the cholesterol absorbed found its way into the blood stream .
It seemed to us desirable to ascertain next whether the cholesterol was absorbed into the blood stream as such or in the form of esters or in both states , and also whether the phytosterol of vegetable food can be utilised for the formation of cholesterol in the organism .
Owing to the small percentage of these substances in the blood , it did not seem probable that the chemical methods hitherto available for their estimation were sufficiently accurate to give reliable information unless in each experiment a larger number of animals was taken than we could conveniently attend to .
It seemed iikely , however , that a comparative study of the inhibitory effects of the sera of rabbits fed * " Origin and Destiny of Cholesterol , " Part III , 'Roy .

Origin and Destiny of Cholesterol in the Animal Organism .
231 on different diets on the haemolytic action of saponin on blood might throw light on the points mentioned .
The experiments of Hausmann , * * * S Abderhalden and Le Countf have proved that whereas cholesterol and phytosterol inhibit the action of saponin , their esters do not do so .
More recently WindausJ has shown that the inhibitory action of cholesterol and phytosterol is due to the fact that they form pharmacologically inactive compounds with saponin .
We therefore decided to make a comparative study of the inhibitory action of the sera of rabbits fed respectively on ether-extracted bran and extracted bran with cholesterol , extracted bran and extracted bran with cholesterol esters , and , finally , extracted bran and extracted bran with phytosterol .
In the present paper an account is given of these experiments .
Method of Feeding the Animals under Experiment.\#151 ; In each experiment , two large healthy rabbits , A and B , were fed for nine or ten days on bran which had been thoroughly extracted with ether .
Excess of food was placed in the cages so that the animals could eat as much as they wished .
In the case of rabbit A , after the third day a weighed amount of cholesterol mixed with a small quantity of moist extracted bran was given daily in addition , care being taken that the animal ate the whole of it .
The rabbit was killed three or four hours after the last cholesterol meal , and the blood collected in a sterile vessel .
The blood was allowed to clot and was placed in the refrigerator until the serum separated .
The rabbit B was killed at the same time and its blood collected and treated in a similar manner .
Great care was taken to keep the animals in good health and as far as possible under the same conditions .
It is also desirable not to extend the experiment over too long a period lest the continued sameness of the diet should have a deleterious effect .
If the animals are in bad health , more especially if they waste away and become emaciated , the results are entirely vitiated .
This is well illustrated in the following experiment , which was commenced for another purpose and only continued as a matter of curiosity .
Six medium-sized rabbits , weighing respectively 1*3 , 1*4 , 1 , 1-2 , 1'5 , 2'3 kilogrammes , which were , to begin with , in very poor condition , were fed for three weeks on extracted bran .
They continued in poor condition and became very emaciated , and had the experiment been further prolonged would no doubt have died .
They yielded altogether only 190 grammes of blood .
The blood was analysed by the method described in an earlier paper .

Origin and [ Apr. 3 , of pure cholesterol benzoate was obtained , corresponding to 01423 gramme of cholesterol , or OR 745 per cent. This is a higher percentage than we have ever found in healthy animals , even in the case of those fed on diets rich in cholesterol .
We have not yet had an opportunity of making further experiments in this direction , but we do not think the result is in disagreement with the hypothesis referred to at the beginning of this paper .
Method of Carrying out the Haemolytic Experiments.\#151 ; The method employed is to mix together a suspension of blood corpuscles , a solution of saponin and the serum , making up to a constant volume with physiological salt .
For this purpose the following solutions are used :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Physiological salt\#151 ; a 0'85-per-cent .
solution of FTaCl ( specially purified ) in distilled water .
( 2 ) Saponin ( Merck)\#151 ; a O'Ol -per-cent , solution in the physiological salt .
( 3 ) Rabbit 's blood corpuscles\#151 ; a 5-per-cent , suspension in physiological salt .
In carrying out the experiments , the mixtures of blood , saponin , serum , and physiological salt are very carefully measured into glass tubes with accurately ground glass stoppers .
The tubes are then placed in clamps fitted on to a circular plate of wood in such a manner that they radiate from the centre to the circumference .
This disc , with the tubes attached , is slowly revolved in a vertical plane by means of a clockwork drum , the whole apparatus being kept at a constant temperature of 37 ' by placing it in an incubator .
As the tubes are completely inverted during the revolution of the disc , the corpuscles are kept equally distributed throughout the mixture without violently agitating the contents .
Elastic bands hold the stoppers securely in position to prevent their coming out of the tubes as they expand with the heat of incubation .
The most favourable period of incubation was found to be three hours .
After this the tubes are placed on ice and the corpuscles allowed to settle , or they may be at once centrifugalised .
In either case the amount of haemolysis is judged from the colour of the clear supernatant liquid .
By taking readings of a tintometer [ Michael ] , on consecutive days , it was found that the tint of the tubes kept on ice did not vary , this showing that further haemolysis than that taking place during incubation was prevented entirely by placing on ice .
The ice method was adopted generally .
Experiments to ascertain whether Cholesterol administered with the Food and absorbed by the Animal appears in the Blood Stream as such .

It was found , however , in the course of the experiments , that the least amount of saponin needed to cause haemolysis varied slightly with different specimens of rabbit 's blood .
For this reason it was necessary always to have the serum of a rabbit fed on extracted bran alone to compare with the serum of a rabbit fed on extracted bran and cholesterol , etc. , so that the comparative experiments were carried out on the corpuscles of the same rabbit .

It is obvious , therefore , that the cholesterol absorbed from the food appeared in the blood stream in the free state .
Whether any entered in the form of esters it is impossible to say , but experiments are in progress which we hope will throw light on this subject .
It now seemed of interest to ascertain whether , the animals being fed on esters of cholesterol in addition to extracted bran , the esters were absorbed entirely as such , or whether they undergo hydrolysis in the process of digestion , and find their way into the blood stream as free cholesterol , in part , at any rate .
Eor this purpose we made use of pure cholesterol oleate and cholesterol stearate for feeding the animals .

As cholesterol is not a normal constituent of the food of rabbits , it appeared interesting to find out ( 1 ) whether vegetable phytosterol is absorbed by the animal if given in the food ; ( 2 ) whether this can be utilised by the animal .
Experiment V.\#151 ; To ascertain whether the phytosterol of the food in the 1909 .
] Destiny of Cholesterol in the A7iimal Organism .
241 case of rabbits is excreted unchanged or whether any is absorbed or destroyed during digestion .
A large healthy rabbit was fed for eight days on a mixture of equal parts of extracted bran and extracted wheat germ , and the faeces were collected during the last seven days .
The faeces , which when dried weighed 60 grammes , were extracted with ether and the ethereal solution saponified with sodium ethylate .
The unsaponifiable matter was obtained in the form of a clear stiff oil , weighing 04115 gramme .
This was dissolved in 5 c.c. absolute alcohol and left to crystallise .
A small quantity of greasy crystalline matter separated , too small to be readily purified .
It was not cholesterol , but consisted of the crystalline " phytosterol " of bran , from which it is difficult to free completely the original bran by simple extraction .
The animal was then fed for one day on the same diet , the faeces being discarded , and for the following eight days on a daily ration of f gramme of phytosterol ( from wheat-germ ) , 30 to 40 grammes of extracted bran and an equal quantity of extracted germs of wheat , care being taken that the animal ate the whole of the phytosterol\#151 ; 2 grammes in all .
It was then fed for four more days on the same diet , but without phytosterol .
The faeces collected during the 12 days weighed , after drying , 189 grammes .
The animal remained in good health and its weight was constant all through the experiment .
The faeces were treated as before and yielded 2496 5 grammes of greasy unsaponifiable matter .
This was repeatedly recrystallised from alcohol and two crops of pure phytosterol were obtained , the weights and melting points of which were : crop 1 , 0-6465 gramme , M.P. = 132 ' C. ; crop 2 , 0'603 gramme , M.P. = 132 ' 0 .
The mother liquors and residues were then evaporated to dryness and heated for a few minutes at a temperature of 180'\#151 ; 200 ' C. with benzoyl chloride .
The product was then poured into a suitable quantity of alcohol and allowed to stand .
The difficultly soluble crystalline matter which separated was recrystallised from hot alcohol .
In this manner 0449 of white phytosterol benzoate was obtained which on recrystallisation from ethyl acetate was obtained in characteristic crystalline form and melted at 141 ' C. P3675 grammes of pure phytosterol were therefore recovered out of the 2 grammes administered .
A consideration of the quantity of phytosterol recovered and also of the relative quantities of unsaponifiable matter obtained in the two parts of the experiment makes it clear that some of the phytosterol of the food was either destroyed or absorbed , but most probably absorbed .

The results agreed entirely with the above tables .
The serum of the rabbits fed on ordinary bran and wheat-germ shows a slightly greater inhibitory power than the serum of the rabbit fed on extracted bran .
This seems to indicate ( 1 ) that some of the phytosterol of the wheat-germ found its way into the blood stream , or ( 2 ) possibly caused an increase of cholesterol in the blood .
Rabbits experimented on disliked the wheat-germ so that it was often neglected , the extracted bran being always given the preference .
We therefore resolved to give , in subsequent experiments , weighed quantities of pure phytosterol .

Further , it was found that on addition of greater quantities of saponin to the same volume of blood , if the serum were added in proportional quantities , haemolysis was in every case prevented , if the ratio between saponin and serum were the same as that which prevented haemolysis in the above experiment .

Conclusions .
1 .
When cholesterol is given with the food of rabbits , some is absorbed and finds its way into the blood stream as free cholesterol , only a portion of the total cholesterol given in the food is absorbed , the rest being excreted unchanged .
The amount of cholesterol which finds its way into the blood stream was not increased in our experiments by increasing the amount given in the food .
It would appear probable , therefore , that the animals only take up such an amount of cholesterol as they can utilise .
2 .
Cholesterol when in the form of esters undergoes hydrolysis in part , at any rate , during digestion , and appears in the blood stream as free cholesterol .
3 .
When animals are fed on phytosterol , this substance is in part absorbed , just as in the case of cholesterol , and appears in the blood stream either itself or in the form of cholesterol .
The latter point can , however , only be decided by the examination of very large quantities of the blood of animals fed on phytosterol .
Experiments are now in progress which we hope will decide this question .
We take this opportunity of expressing our thanks to the Government Grant Committee of the Eoyal Society for assistance in carrying out this work .
