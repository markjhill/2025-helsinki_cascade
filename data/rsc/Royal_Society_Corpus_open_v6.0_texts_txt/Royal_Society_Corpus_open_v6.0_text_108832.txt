ONE of the first efforts towards the formation of the Calculus of Functions is due to LAPLACE , whose solution of the functional equation of the first order , by means of two equations in finite differences , is well known .
Functional equations were afterwards treated systematically by Mr. BABBAGE ; his memoirs were published in the Transactions of this Society , and there is some account of them in Professor BOOLE'S Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences .
A very important functional equation was solved by POISSON in his Memoirs on Electricity ; which suggested to me the investigations I have now the honour to lay before the Society .
I have commenced by discussing the linear functional equation of the first order with constant coefficients , when the subjects of the unknown functions are rational functions of the independent variable , and have shown how the solution of such equations may in a variety of cases be effected by series , and by definite integrals .
I have then considered functional equations with constant coefficients of the higher orders , and have proved that they may be solved by methods similar to those used for equations of the first order .
I have next proceeded with the solution of functional equations with variable coefficients .
In connexion with functional equations , I have considered equations involving definite integrals , and containing an unknown function under the integral sign ; the methods employed for their resolution depend chiefly upon the solution of functional equations , as effected in this paper .
The Calculus of Functions has now for a long time engaged the attention of analysts ; and I hope that the following investigations will be found to have extended its power and resources .

W. H. L. RUSSELL ON THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS .
The general linear functional equation of the nth order with constant coefficients is ( V , x)+wap((4k )+ b("-zx)+ ... + ( +h4(x)+ k(x)=F'(x ) where the subject , x is supposed to be the same as in the preceding equations .
Let x=X(z ) , and ( xr)=X(z})=X(mz)suppose ; then 42(x)=Xm2Z , 43-=Xm3 , Z &amp;c. , and the equation becomes pX(n + z ) x+ apX(m " z)+ bpX(m 2z ) + + .
( + '%(mz ) + k+X(z ) =F(z ) .
Let z=- , and the equation becomes PX(m ) +CI(Pxr+ ) +%(_+2 ) +k%(p+X ) +x ( D+ ) =F%(m+ ) This equation may be written { +aS~+ b2 V+ + ... ^("-)+ ; ( =F(m ' or ~**+PX(c ) +A{F ( 4X )-s ) FX ( my++X l ) + Fa ( 1 fn+2 ) + &amp;c. } { FX ( me+n)- ?

We now proceed to consider functional equations with variable coefficients .
And first let the equation be ( x)--(x)k{c+e }F(x ) , where X(x ) and F(x ) are known rational functions of ( a ) .
Let a+ bu , , ~~~~~~~ thenu then a+ bu , c+ eu , Suppose a solution of this equation of finite differences to be A+Bz uC +E 268 the equation becomes Let u( ?

We may hence immediately deduce the value of p(x ) .
It is evident that the functional equation 4t'( ) ( )=r(x ) , DCC(aC+L+xI)(I.t +CC ) =F ) DCCCUL : I. '2 o0 269 when 4v and F1 are known functions of ( x ) , may be reduced to the form ( -a+bx+cx2)op , ( x ) =F(x)~(a+bx+cx2 ) by making ~ , ( p)=+(x)(px ) .
The second equation has already been considered ; it becomes , therefore , interesting to ascertain what equations are included under the form of the first equation , in other 4/ ( , ) words , to consider what forms the algebraical expression p(a+ bx+c2 ) can possibly take .
The following are a few of them : V/ ( x+2 V/ ac-b ) x--a x--a2 { x-_2bx+b -_4ac V/ a+ Vc.x a(b + cx ) ( 2a+b +cx x(6b + cx ) ' a-Cx Many others may , in like manner , be imagined ; and the same methods , mutatis mutandis , apply to functional equations of the higher orders with variable coefficients .
I now come to the consideration of equations involving definite integrals , when the equation contains an unknown function under the sign of definite integration .
Let us take the equation I ' FF , ( ( ) + F2(a ) .
2Jo F3(C ) +F4(a)xl +s((().)=F(c ) where p(x ) is an unknown function of ( x ) not containing ( a ) , F , ( ac ) , F(a ) .
* .
, F , ( a ) rational functions of ( a ) which is supposed to vary independently of ( x ) , to determine P(x ) .
Suppose the equation can be written in the form S A(x)dx 1f -(x )2 ( 1 - ) Jo 121 -2X(l 22 ) + ( a)2 12( -2 ) +2 where X(x)= ( = )/ 1-2 .
Let x=sin , and the equation reduces to j$dox(sin 2 ) { X-2a cos 0+ ( xa)-2+ -l cos 0 a=1 F( ) or if ( 1 2 ) ( Asin D ^-oJdO .
1 -2e cos 1we find AX(a ) + ^(a)= 2F(a ) .
Suppose the solution of this equation be determined by the former investigations to be 4( .

O+-:)-=f(a ) ?
Assume X sin =a ?
t+a cos O+a , cos 20+a3 cos 30+ ... , 270 then since 1 -a2_ 1 -2a cos d+1 -20 cos -2 cos 2-t+ ... , we have ( ao+a , a +a2M2 + ... )=f(o ) ; ?ao+ +al2s + ... =a(6 ) ao+a , +s-o+aj-27o + ... =f(s- ) .
Hence X ( sin V)-2 + } whence p(x ) can be determined .
Similar treatment will of course apply to the equation S Fl a+F2ax2 + F3a.x4+. .
Fr(a ) + Fn+l()+ ... )=F(a ) , but the functional equation employed for its solution ( when possible by this method ) will be of a higher order .
Let us , lastly , consider the equation o Fj(x)p(x ?
( oc))F(o ) , to find p , where F1x is a known function of ( x ) not containing ( a ) , and ( a ) varies independently of ( x ) .
Let , ( a)=P3 , then a=---'3 , and the equation becomes JS1:i')(x)=-P F-1(P ) .
Let ( x)=A+Axp+Ax2P +. .
