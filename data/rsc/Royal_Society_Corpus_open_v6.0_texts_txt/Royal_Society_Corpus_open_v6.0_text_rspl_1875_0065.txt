455 two , an afferent and a motor , just as , in Man , the double function of an ordinary spinal nerve is divided in the head between the 5th and 7th pairs .
And it seems not unlikely that while the " axial cords " ( motor nerves ) of the arms are derived from the peripheral part of the Crinoidal axis , the " ventral bands " ( sensory nerves ) are derived from the central part of that axis , which has been shown to be continued , as the " axial prolongation , " to the oral ring .
The Society then adjourned oyer the Easter Recess , to Thursday , April 27 , 1876 .

The Presents received were laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The Bakerian Lecture , \lt ; ( On the Gaseous State of Matter , " was delivered by Prof. T. Andrews , LL. D. , E.R.S. , Vice-President of Queen 's College , Belfast .
The following is an Abstract :\#151 ; After referring to certain modifications in his former method of working at high pressures , the author describes some preliminary experiments which were undertaken to determine the change of capacity in the capillary bore of the glass tubes under the pressures employed .
Erom these experiments it appears that , on raising the pressure from 5 to 110 atmospheres , the capacity was increased for each atmosphere by only 0*0000036 , and that this change of capacity was chiefly due to compression of the internal walls of the glass tube .
Another set of experiments was made to ascertain whether air or carbonic-acid gas is absorbed at high pressures to any appreciable extent by mercury .
Eor the method of operating and other details reference must be made to the original memoir ; but the general result is that no absorption whatever takes place , even at pressures of 50 or 100 atmospheres .
The pressures are given according to the indications of the air-manometer in the absence of sufficient data ( which the author hopes will be soon supplied ) for reducing them to true pressures .
In the mean time it is probable , from the experiments of Cailletet , that the indications of the air-manometer are almost exact at 200 atmospheres , and for lower pressures do not in any case deviate more than from the true amount .
In a note which was published last year in the 'Proceedings ' of the Society ( No. 163 ) , it was staffed that the coefficient of expansion ( a ) for heat under constant pressure changes in value both with the pressure and Prof. T. Andrews on the [ Apr. with the temperature .
The experiments on this subject are now completed , and are described at length in this paper .
The final results will be found in the two following Tables .
In the first Table the values of a are referred to a unit volume at 0 ' and under one atmosphere .

It will be observed that the value of a , increases with the pressure until a very high pressure is attained , when it changes its direction and diminishes .
This apparent anomaly depends upon the carbonic acid at the high pressure having passed from the gaseous state proper to the intermediate conditions , which the author has formerly described as establishing a continuity between the gaseous and liquid states of matter .

In the second part of the paper the general properties of the ordinary gaseous state are considered .
As the basis of this inquiry , the following Table of the compressibility of carbonic acid at 6'*5 , 64 ' , and 100 ' is given , in which e is the ratio of the observed volume of the carbonic acid at the pressure p and temperature t ' to its volume under one atmosphere at the same temperature von .

This change of direction in the value of p is explained by the circumstance already mentioned , that the carbonic acid at the higher pressure has been reduced to the liquid volume ( although no liquefaction has taken place ) in passing through the conditions of matter intermediate between the gaseous and liquid states .
The relations between the volumetric curves in the ordinary gaseous state for different temperatures are determined by means of what the author calls the homologues or homologous points of those curves^\#151 ; that is , | the points in any two isothermals where the values of p are equal , or p v *=p ' v ' , \gt ; ( All From a careful analysis of the experiments described in this coinmuni- S ; cation and in his former Bakerian Lecture , the author shows that the , -.-ordinary gaseous state is characterized by the ratio of the external pres-f : sures for all the homologues of any two given temperatures being con- .

] where rff is a constant .
It must be carefully observed that v and v in equation ( A ) are the volumes of the gas on different isothermals . .
It follows from these results that , in the case of a body in the ordinary gaseous state , if the relations of pressure and volume are known at any one temperature , the corresponding relations at any other temperature Gan be calculated from the observation of a single homologue at the second temperature .
Thus the whole relations of volume and pressure will be known from a set of primary observations at a fixed temperature and the determination of one homologue for each of the other temperatures .
The general form of the primary curve itself , or curve exhibiting the relations of pressure and volume at a given temperature , is next investigated ; and the author finds , as the result of all his experiments under very varied conditions of temperature and pressure , that the value of e(l\#151 ; p ) is constant for the same temperature .
Hence we have for the third equation of the ordinary gaseous state v(l \#151 ; pv ) esc .

( C ) From this last equation the relations of homologous points , as defined by equations ( A ) and ( B ) , may be deduced .
The author concludes with some general observations on the action of the internal attractive forces in the ordinary gaseous state , and also on the resistance to diminution of volume which , under certain conditions , modifies largely the effects both of external pressure and of internal attraction .
