] Among the sources of error to which chronometers are liable , the effect of the variable density of the medium in which the balance vibrates has been overlooked ; the author therefore proposes to investigate the effects of diminished and increased pressure , of transference from one to the other , and of the ordinary variations of atmospheric .
density upon the rates of chronometers .
In respect to diminished pressure , he found that chronometers gained by being placed in air of less density than that of the ordinary state of the atmosphere , and that , on the other hand , they lost when subjected to air of greater than ordinary density .
These experiments were made with a variety of chronometers , placed in the receiver of an air-pump , or in that of a condensing apparatus .
In respect to the influence of ordinary changes in the density of the air , the author remarks that pocket chronometers are more readily affected than box chronometers , but that they all exhibit an increased rate under diminished density , and vice versed .
The authorshows that these changes in the rates , as observed in the air-pump and condensing apparatus , are independent of the changes of temperature , resulting from changes in the density of the air thus rapidly effected , and therefore proceeds to inquire into the actual cause of the changes which his experiments indicate ; he refers them to an increase in the arc of vibration when the density is diminished , and to a diminution in the arc under increased density .
