] The obliquity of the ecliptic , as deduced from the early observations by the Greenwich quadrant , compared with the present obI liquity , gives the diminution for an interval of nearly sixty years , with almost sufficient accuracy to state with some confidence the mass of Venus ; blut to obtain this point with certainty , the present obliquity , deduced from a mean of the observations of different astronomers , should be used .
Upon this subject the author alludes to the opinion of astronomers , that observations of the winter solstice have given a less obliquity than those of the summer solstice , -an opinion sustained by the observations of Maskelyne , Arago , and Pond , but questioned by Bessel and Bradley .
Dr. Brinkley refers this difference to some unknown modification of refraction ; he has observed that at the winter solstice the irregularity of refraction for the sun is greater than for the stars at the same zenith-distance .
He points out the necessity of paying attention to the observations at the winter solstice , and gives a table , exhibiting the mean obliquity reduced to January 1813 .
Dr. Brinkley next alludes to the maximum of the aberration of light , which appears from his observations of last year to be 20 " 80 .
