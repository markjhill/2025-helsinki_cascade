Extract of a Letter from F. J. H. Wollaston ( dated Sydney College , Cambridge , February 24 , 1784 ) to the Rev. Francis Wollaston , LL. B. F. R. S. Read December 14 , 1786 .
I SEND you an account of a remarkable stream of light which appeared last night , from about 9 h. 5~ to 9 h. 25~ , extending entirely across the hemisphere from W. to E. It rose from the horizon , about 10~ S. of W. , near ~ and ~ Ceti ; thence ascended in a straight line , inclining a little S. to ~ and ~ Tauri , where it made an angle with its former course , and proceeded nearly in a vertical circle over ~ Aurigae , ~ Ursae majoris , by Cor Caroli to Arcturus , setting in the horizon about 20~ N. of E. The light was steady , not undulating like Aurora ; and as it converged towards the horizon at each end , had much the appearance which I conceive the tail of a comet must make whose nucleus is just in the horizon .
That was particularly the case at the W. end , where it was brightest , growing gradually fainter towards the zenith ; the E. part was nearly of the same brightness .
The greatest breadth of the stream in the zenith was about equal to the distance between the Pointers in Ursa major .
It disappeared gradually .
When first I saw it , it did not incline so much towards the S. at its W. end as afterwards ; but rose directly up from ~ Ceti to the zenith .
I should like to know , whether this has been seen elsewhere , and in what direction .
I remarked it , because I never saw a stream extend so steadily across the heavens .
There was very little of Aurora in any other part of the sky ; indeed what would not have been observed at all , had it not been for this stream .
