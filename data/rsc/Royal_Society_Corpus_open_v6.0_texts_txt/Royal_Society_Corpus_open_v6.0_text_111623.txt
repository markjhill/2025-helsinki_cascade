Supplement to a Paper , read February 17 , 1859 , " On the Influence of White Light , of the different Coloured Rays and of Darkness , on the Development , Growth , and Nutrition of Animals ' .

The aipparatus used in the following experiments , was described in my Paper ; but in the present instance , only two of the cells were employed , viz , that exposed to ordinary white light , and that from which all light is excluded .
In order more effectually to prevent the possible admission of light , the following precautionls were adopted with the dark cell:-1 .
The perforated zinc floor was covered with thick brown paper .
2 .
The under surface of the lid was lined with black cloth , to secure accurate adjustment when shut .
3 .
The opaque black glass was covered with an additional coat of black oilpaint .
4 .
The lid was never opened in any light except that of a candle or of gas .
March 20th , 1859.-A number of ova of the Silkworm ( Bombyx mori ) , all of the same age , were placed in each of the two cells .
No change was observed until May 18th ( sixty days after the commencement of the experiments ) , when one larva emerged from the ovunm in each cell ; and during twelve days , larvae continued to emerge in the light and in the dark at the same rate .
June 9th.-Sixteen larvae , as nearly as possible of the same size , were selected ill each cell , and the rest removed .
The experiments then proceeded with these thirty-two individuals , and no death occurred from first to last .

The longest and shortest periods in the darkened cell twenty-two days and seventeen days , in the light cell nineteen days and seventeen days .
June 9th.-On selection of sixteen of the largest larvae from the inhabitants of each cell , it was noted that , when sixteen were selected from the darkened cell and several of similar size removed , only four could be found as large in the white cell , the remaining twelve selected were therefore of a rather smaller size .
This difference in the two cells became less obvious afterwards , but , throughout the experiments , there was a slight differenlce of size in favour of the darkened cell .
With these exceptions , no difference could be detected between the results obtained in the cell from which light was completely excluded and in that exposed to its full influence .
The larva , the silk produced , and the mnoths from the two cells , when placed side by side , could not be distinguished from one another .
The ova were of the same colour when first deposited , and unilderwent the samze changes of appearance , at the same time , in the dark and in the light .
So far , thbeefore , as the direct agencey of light is concerned in the development , growth , nutrition , and coloration of anlilmals , the results of these experiments closely correspond with those already recorded in my Paper .
