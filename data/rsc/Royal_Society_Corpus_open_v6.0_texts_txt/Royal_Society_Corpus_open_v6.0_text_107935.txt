I PROPOSE in this paper to extend the equations I have already given for determining the planetary inequalities , as far as the terms depending on the squares and products of the eccentricities , to the terms depending on the cubes of the eccentricities and quantities of that order , which is done very easily by a Table similar to Table II .
in my Lunar Theory ; and particularly to the determination of the great inequality of Jupiter , or at least such part of it as depends on the first power of the disturbing force .
That part which depends on the square of the disturbing force may I think be most easily calculated by the methods given in my Lunar Theory but not without great care and attention can accurate numerical results be expected .
I have however given the analytical form of the coefficients of the arguments in the development of R , upon which that inequality principally depends .
It is I think particularly convenient to designate the arguments of the planetary disturbances by indices .
The system of indices adopted in this paper is given as appearing better adapted for the purpose than that used in my former paper on the Planetary Theory ; but it is not advisable to make use of the same indices in this as in the Lunar Theory .
I have also given analytical expressions for the development of R to the terms multiplied by the squares and products of the eccentricities inclusive , and for the terms in r ( d ) multiplied by the first power of the eccentricities , which are I believe the simplest that can be proposed .
The following are the arguments which occur in the Planetary Theory .
