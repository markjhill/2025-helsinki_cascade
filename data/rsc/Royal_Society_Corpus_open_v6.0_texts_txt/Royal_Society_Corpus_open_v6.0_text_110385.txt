A paper was then read , entitled , " An Account of some Experiments made in the West Indies and North America , to determine the relative Magnetic Forces , in the years 1831 , 32 , and 33 .
" By the Rev. George Fisher , M.A. , F.R.S. The experiments of which the results are given in this paper were made by Mr. James Napier , late Master of H. M. S. Winchester .
The needles were precisely similar to those used in the experiments described by the author in a former paper ; and the observations were made with great care , and repeated several times at the same places * by which it appeared that the intensities of the needles continued unchanged during the whole period of the experiments ; and the mean of all those made at one place was taken as the result .
From these the relative forces at different places were computed , and stated in the form of a table .
