137 latency .\#151 ; The effects and after-effects occur very sharply at beginning and end of strong illumination of moderate duration .
The latent period is between 3 and 10 sec. Fatigue and Recovery.\#151 ; The effects of successive illuminations ( of 5 minutes ' duration ) progressively diminish if repeated at " short " intervals ( 10 minutes ) .
At intervals of about 1 hour , successive illuminations of 5 minutes produce approximately equal effects .
With the leaf of Mathiola , I have used periods of illumination of 2 minutes at intervals of 15 minutes without provoking any obvious sign of fatigue .
Conclusions.\#151 ; The leaves of certain plants under favourable conditions of life exhibit electromotive effects and after-effects , amounting to \#177 ; 0-02 volt in response to illumination .
As in the case of animal tissue , it is possible that the negative ( zincative ) effect may be significant of dissimilation , and the opposite effect or after-effect significant of assimilation .
The absence of distinct response in petals indicates that chloroplasts are essential to the reaction .
The absence of distinct response in the green leaves of trees and shrubs is possibly due to a lower average metabolism in such leaves , as compared with the activity of leaves of small young plants , in which leaf-functions are presumably concentrated within a smaller area .

A former paper* describes the apparatus by which I examined the influence of temperature upon the viscosity of argon and other gases .
I have recently had the opportunity of testing , in the same way , an interesting sample of gas prepared by Professor Dewar , being the residue , uncondensed by liquid hydrogen , from a large quantity collected at the Bath springs .
As was to be expected , !
it consists mainly of helium , as is evidenced by its spectrum when rendered luminous in a vacuum tube .

the temperature of the room was to show that the temperature effect was the same as for hydrogen .
In the former paper the results were reduced so as to show to what power ( n)of the absolute temperature the viscosity was proportional .

Air 0*754 Ill *3 Oxygen 0-782 128 *2 Hydrogen 1 Helium J 0*681 72*2 Argon 0*815 150 *2 Since practically only two points on the temperature curve were examined , the numbers obtained were of course of no avail to determine whether or no any power of the temperature was adequate to represent the complete curve .
The question of the dependence of viscosity upon temperature has been studied by Sutherland , * on the basis of a theoretical argument which , if not absolutely rigorous , is still entitled to considerable weight .
He deduces from a special form of the kinetic theory as the function of temperature to which the viscosity is proportional c being some constant proper to the particular gas .
The simple law Oi , appropriate to " hard spheres , " here appears as the limiting form when 6 is very great .
In this case , the collisions are sensibly uninfluenced by the molecular forces which may act at distances exceeding that of impact .
When , on the other hand , the temperature and the molecular velocities are lower , the mutual attraction of molecules which pass near one another increases the number of collisions , much as if the diameter of the spheres was increased .

The Declination and Horizontal Force are deduced from hourly readings of the photographic curves , and so are corrected for the diurnal variation .
The results in the following tables , Nos. I , II , III , IY , are deduced from the magnetograph curves , which have been standardised by observations of deflection and vibration .
These were made with the Collimator Magnet , marked 66a , and the Declinometer Magnet , marked 66c , in the Unifilar Magnetometer No. 66 by Elliott Brothers , of London .
The temperature correction ( which is probably very small ) has not been applied .
The Declination and Horizontal Force values given in Tables I to IV are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the Fifth Report of the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing magnetic observations , and the time given is Greenwich Mean Time , which is 20 minutes 18 seconds earlier than local time .
The following is a list of the days during the year 1897 which were selected by the Astronomer Royal as suitable for the determination of the magnetic diurnal variations , and which have been employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables January ... 6 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 26 .
