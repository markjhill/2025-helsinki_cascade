Read May 23.* In order that observations on the specific gravity of sea-water should be made in the Arctic Expedition of 1875 , by the method successfully used on board Her Majesty 's ship " Challenger , " !
Sir George Hares , when he left that ship to take command of the expedition , brought with him one of Mr. Buchanan 's hydrometers .
Professor Hartley superintended the construction of its graduated weights , and suggested the supply of apparatus for the volumetric estimation of chlorine ; and , on the departure of the expedition , both sets of observations were allotted to me .
Storms interfered with observations in the Atlantic , but they were begun on entering Baffin 's Sea , and continued till the ships finally rounded Cape Farewell .
Most of the samples of water examined were from the surface , or from close beneath the floes ; but whenever the exigencies of ice navigation permitted , samples were obtained from various depths by means of " Buchanan 's bottle .
" The " bottle " was also used in winter quarters , at first through holes made in the new ice , and afterwards of greater depths , when tidal fissures formed wide enough to let it pass down between the heavy floes .
In very cold weather , or when surface fresh water lay over a salt stratum with a temperature below the freezing point , it was found necessary to be specially careful to prevent the addition or withdrawal of ice by the cold brass of the bottle ; and during winter , water , however obtained , had to be re-mixed after it had acquired the temperature of my cabin , for ice formed in transit from the floes to the ship , melted , and lay in a differently refracting layer on the surface .
The temperatures were ordinarily taken with an open scaled centigrade thermometer , verified at its zero .
Its readings were constantly checked by observations with the Miller- Casella and Hegretti and Zambra instruments , by which all the temperatures away from the surface were obtained .
In the reduction of the specific gravities to a common temperature , Hubbard 's coefficients were at first used , but all the observations on sea-water in the subjoined tables have been re-calculated by the formulae published during the absence of the expedition by Professors Thorpe and Rucker .
J In the few instances in which the observations were made at minus temperatures , the reductions have been arrived at * See ante , p. 446 .

545 by extrapolation ; but taking Hubbard 's curve as an extreme , the error possible in the small range of temperature involved cannot extend beyond the fifth place of decimals .
The uncertainty of the process has , however , induced me to discard a column in which the specific gravities were expressed at the natural temperatures .
In both tables Stampfer 's coefficients have been used for the waters from melted ice .
But that an Oertling balance and a reserve of pure nitrate of silver were supplied , the chlorine .estimations must have been omitted , for the standard silver solutions were destroyed by freezing a disaster which considerably curtailed the number of experiments .
The water of the polar basin , to such depths as we reached , had already acquired the low specific gravity characteristic of outflowing polar currents .
This low specific gravity was maintained during winter and spring , after nine months ' perpetual freezing .
It is to be remembered , however , that the samples were from no great depth , and from a zone of the Polar Sea that annually receives , not only its own precipitation , but also the precipitation of the neighbouring shores , and that , too , at a comparatively high temperature .
The channels between the Polar Sea and Smith 's Sound contain two strata of sea-water , not owing their temperatures to local causes\#151 ; an upper stratum of polar water overlies a warmer northward flowing extension of the Atlantic .
The specific gravity observations show that the relative position of .
the layers is due to salinity influencing their density more than temperature .
To overlie the polar water , the denser stratum would require a temperature above 10 ' C. The highest deep temperature obtained was below the freezing point , but there is sufficient range between the specific gravities of the deepest samples obtained and of Atlantic water to permit warmer Atlantic water to exist at a greater depth .
In places where the deep water yet retains some temperature above the freezing point , direct dilution at its own depth , with fresh water from deep icebergs or subglacial streams , may so far reduce its salinity as to let it carry warmth to the surface , and thus help to occasion the well known " rottenness " of floes in the neighbourhood of icebergs and P'lRiOlGr clitis .
In addition to low specific gravity and temperature , the waters of outflowing polar currents possess a third characteristic in the disturbed proportion between their chlorides and sulphates , pointed out by Forchhammer* His great range of observations gives an oceanic proportion of 11-87 of sulphuric acid to 100 of chlorine ; while his polar currents show an average increase in the proportion of sulphates amounting to '52 .
The sealed samples of water brought home by me * " Phil. Trans. , " 1865 , Part I , p. 228 .

for verifications yielded 11 " 21 of sulphuric acid* ( S03 ) to 100 of chlorine in the deep warm water of Smith 's Sound , and 11*59 in the polar water , showing an excess of *38 in the latter .
Forchhammer attributes this disturbed proportion either to a scarcity of fucoidal plants or to the vicinity of volcanoes .
If it be assumed that the dilution of outflowing polar currents is due rather to shore precipitation than to transference of polar precipitation through the perennial floes , the littoral character of the currents will alone account for the increase of sulphates .
On quitting Robeson Channel , Her Majesty 's ship " Alert " found herself on the shores of a sea covered exclusively with the heavy ice before met with only in outlying fragments .
The pack edge grounding along the shore in fourteen fathoms , and forced upwards towards the beach , formed a barrier reef , inside which the ship found shelter .
As soon as new floe consolidated it , it was found that the grounded masses , resembling icebergs in their size and stratification , differed from them in being salt , and the first chlorine estimations were made in search of ice fit for the ship 's use during winter .
On the return of daylight , further observations both on the composition and structure of the ice were begun , in the hope that they would throw some light on the place and mode of growth of the stupendous floes .
All but the surface of the floating ice was out of reach , hut plenty of sections were afforded by the great fragments forced upwards on the beach .
A floe grounded a quarter of a mile ahead of the ship had split into several rectangular segments .
Its largest masses were separated by a narrow cleft passing vertically through the ice and exposing a fresh section , measuring 47 feet at right angles to the plane of stratification .
The floe was belted with a shelf of ice , marking the sea-level previous to its last upheaval .
The cleft intersected this tide-mark 11 feet from its top surface .
The floe sides under the mark were grooved with the vertical channellings of last season 's subaqueous thaw , but neither the tide mark nor the groovings passed into the cleft , and the sharp edges of the latter had evidently not been exposed to the warmth of last summer .
Hr .
Rae has pointed outl how readily salt ice may lose its entangled brine by drainage ; it thus also loses its cryohydrates when the temperature rises above their freezing points ; but since the upheaval of this floeberg was recent , and since the temperature of the air was yet below what the ice possessed when submerged , it was fair * Precipitated with barium chloride instead of nitrate , as the latter , used by Porch-hammer , requires much manipulative skill in its subsequent separation from the sulphate .

547 to infer that this fragment of floe had lost little of its saltness , certainly none of its salt ice by drainage ; moreover , it afforded decided facilities for obtaining samples of ice from every height of a considerable section , and accordingly serial chlorine estimations were made from top to bottom of it .
The lowest part of this section was probably not the bottom of the floe , but samples of deep ice were obtained from an almost overturned mass , exhibiting the mammillary elevations common on the under side of the floes , and in one part studded with stones and grooved by motion against the bottom .
' Our watering berg offered a section where 30 inches of snow-formed ice lay over what had once been a superglacial pool in the hollows of a " blue-domed " floe .
It will be seen , on reference to the tabulated chlorine estimations , that , while the annual floe of one winter 's quarters held one-sixth the chlorine of sea water , the most salt parts of the polar floe held but one-fifteenth .
The chlorine , however , does not represent all the salts , and water from such ice is quite too brackish to drink .
If the salinity of the polar floes leaves their mode of growth doubtful , evidence much more to the point is supplied by their structure .
The upper ice of upheaved segments , not only at Floeberg Beach , but along the shore as far as my sledge journeys extended , displayed more or less distinct horizontal stratification , like that of glacier The stratification was strikingly regular and parallel , decreasing m width from above downwards , sometimes ending abruptly , but generally becoming indistinct and gradually disappearing 20 feet or more from the top .
Each stratum consisted of an upper white , merging into a lower blue part , the difference in colour depending on the greater or less number and size of the air-cells in the ice .
The lower blue passed abruptly , but without break in structure , into the spongy white of the layer beneath .
After spring , when all exposed ice-surfaces became white and granular , the stratification was to be detected only by the unequal disintegration of the white and blue parts , causing in well-marked floebergs a crenulated outline in the profile of a section ; the blue , hard and unchanged , lying m the angle , and the white , granular and swollen , in the convexity .
This unequal disintegration is to be attributed to the lesser transparency of the white parts to solar radiation rather than to any difference in salinity represented by the trifling and possibly experimental difference in specific gravity , shown by estimations Nos. 106 and 107 .
a-he indistinctness of stratification produced by summer is not permanent .
The old floebergs worn into " blue domes , " and " pie " shapes were well marked in early spring , though they had evidently borne the thaws of many seasons .
The stratification was most readily seen from a little distance I have marked it in a sketch of a floeberg at Cape Joseph Henry made quite a quarter of a mile off , but frequently the limits of 548 Dr. E. L. Moss .

the layers could not be decided upon at arm 's length , and in getting samples and measurements the easiest method of procedure was to stick on pieces of paper and adjust them to the layers , by retiring to a distance of 20 or 30 yards .
The thinnest strata observed occurred in the sides of a water-worn ravine in a floeberg off Cape Rawson ; in the middle of the bank , where the sections were nearly vertical , they measured 7 inches .
An iceberg off Cape Napoleon had strata only 4 inches wide .
The widest I have any notes of were in the top of the cleft floeberg already described .
Here they were 3 feet deep ; but , 28 feet lower down , the lowest distinguishable strata were 18 inches deep .
Although the extremes differed so widely , the great majority of the stratifications showed layers between 10 and 15 inches wide .
In instances where stratification ceased abruptly , the ice immediately beneath was a sort of conglomerate formed of masses broken from older floes cemented together by frozen sea-water , * with differently inclined lines of air-cells , and occasionally enclosing aggregations of bright-yellow Diatomacece .
One such aggregation from a floeberg grounded on an island in Black Cliffs Bay , has been submitted to Rev. Eugene O'Meara .
He has identified the Diatomacece in it , and informs me that they are all of decidedly marine growth .
Stratification was not distinguishable in the masses of which the conglomerates were composed ; indeed , submersion appears to play an important part in its obliteration .
On the 28th March , 1876 , I cut a pit through the snow on the top of our watering berg and filled it in with minute-crystalled snow from a little under the surface .
On the 8th of May , the lower crystals were adherent to the ice beneath , and had become distinctly larger and granular , differing little from those in the undisturbed snow beside them , which were by this time like small transparent hailstones , often already grown together into rods and groups .
The temperature of the air in the meantime , though rising , had never reached 0 ' C. , while the ice yet retained much of the cold of early spring .
A similar growth towards the cold , but upwards instead of downwards , takes place while the temperature of the air is below that of the floes or the earth , and helps the wind to harden and crust the upper snow .
With a hope of testing this growth , two cubes were cut out of the same block of snow , and made to weigh exactly 50 grms. each .
No. 1 was suspended level with the ground , and No. 2 4 feet 8 inches above it , in a niche in a snow-house .
They were then built up and left for ten days , meantime the temperature of the air averaged \#151 ; 350,5 C. , while the ground under 5 feet 6 inches of snow was \#151 ; 20o,6 .
On re-weighing , No. 1 had lost T15 grms. , and No. 2 had gained '3 .

Admiral Wrangell , in describing the heavy ice grounded along the northern shores of Siberia , accounts for both its thickness and its stratification by the sliding one upon another of thinner floes * Admiral Belcher referred some of the great ice mases in Wellington Channel to the same cause , t but the stratification of the floes met with by our expedition cannot be thus accounted for .

i. The subject of this sketch afforded the only instance of stratification overlying a " blue dome " seen by me .
Any deviations from the horizontal and parallel were in fact extremely rare , and one of the first convictions forced upon me by the facts of the stratification was that the floes which showed it could not have been formed in such a region of chaotic disturbance as lay about us .
Massive floes drifted from the westward into the channels of the Parry group , or floating southward in Spitzbergen seas , have made arctic travellers familiar with the glassy " blue tops " or domes of ice standing up through the surface snows .
\#163 ; The upper part of many of our grounded floes exhibited such domes in section , and in every case the wavy outline cut through the horizontal strata .
The larger mounds often occurring in miniature mountain ranges on heavy floes are not to be confounded with " blue domes .
" They occur along ancient lines of fissure , and are simply old hummocks rounded off by snowdrift .

floe ice has been frequently recorded ; sometimes it is clearly traceable to neighbouring land , at others , as in the case of the kryokonite of Professor Nordenskiold , * and the dust of the East Greenland , f and Spitzbergen ice-fields , $ its source is more or less conjectural .
At Eloeberg Beach every breeze strewed the ice with dust from shore , consisting of fine sand from the neighbouring hills ( effervescing with acid ) , and organic debris o.f all sorts , bits of saxifrage and moss \#166 ; and lemming pellets predominating .
Such dust was generally confined to the surface of the ice , but a fragment from a bud of Saxifraga oppositifolia , recognised by its claw , was found in a dust-line 45 feet deep in the ice of a large berg off the " south ravine , " and a dust-line 4 feet deep in the ice of our watering berg , marking the bottom of one of three successive " super-glacial lakes , " S yielded a lemming hair and a shred of bird 's down .
Another kind of dust of less obvious origin commonly occurred in , as well as on , the floes .
It was first noticed in the " Cleft Eloeberg , " already described in connexion with the chlorine estimations .
The walls of the cleft exhibited duplicate sections of an old surface pool , and the bottom of the pool was marked with a dust-line .
A similar , but fainter , line passing through the whole berg , lay 8 feet deeper down without any appearance of a pool over it .
In these and other dust-lines observed in the floes the line consisted of scattered black points in the ice , sometimes two or three in a cubic inch , oftener only the same number in a cubic foot .
Each spot consisted of a single air-cell , rarely more than inch in diameter , with its lower half lined with impalpable dust , but otherwise like the air-cells around it .
The spot was Fig. 2 .
sometimes quite solid .
Specimens were obtained for examination by chipping out lumps of ice holding granules or freighted cells , washing them in their own surface-melting , and putting them into clean bottles till the cells released a little bubble and the dust fell to the bottom , often retaining its shape till shaken .
As the surface of a wasting floe progressively lowers , these granular masses are collected into groups , and keep below the general surface in little pits .
Enough dust was obtained from the " Cleft Floeberg " and from the * Prof. NordenskiSld 's " Expedition to Greenland , " Arctic Manual , p. 325 .

551 subglacial surface of the salt ice of our watering berg to study its characters en mass .
Similar dust , but in microscopic quantity , was procured from a line 2 feet deep in a heavy floe , a mile in diameter and two from the shore , drifted into a curve of the coast south of Cape Joseph Henry , and at the same depth from an old " blue top " m Black Cliffs Bay , and also from the dust-line already mentioned as containing the saxifrage leaf at a depth of 45 feet .
A very much worn floe to seaward of the ship supplied a large quantity of dust with precisely similar inorganic contents , but enormously magnified in apparent quantity and converted into a slimy , granular , sour-smelling mud by a growth of a phycochromaceous Alga* Some of the granules deep in ice were altogether inorganic , others held another Alga composed of groups of dark brown spheres 3 01o o inch in diameter , associated with spined hemispherical cups x eoo diameter , apparently the skins of zygospores .
In dust-spots under-lying distinctly salt ice Diatomacece naturally attached + were not uncommon . .
The inorganic part of the dust consists of a reddish impalpable sand of even-sized particles , rarely reaching a\#163 ; o inch in diameter , but averaging one-tenth of that size .
Placed in a Sonstadt 's solution , specific gravity 2'72 , it separates into a red part that floats , and a much smaller dark green part that sinks .
The former consists of angular and rounded transparent quartz and rounded red quartz .
The fraction that sinks contains rounded grains of hornblende , angular and rounded augite , brown scales of mica , and numerous crystals of magnetite , sharply angular and often imbedded in augite or quartz .
The dust becomes bright red on incineration , but some of the particles still remain magnetic .
I searched carefully for , but never found , a magnetic particle capable of reducing sulphate of copper .
Two samples of ice-dust were obtained from icebergs , the one at Cape Frazer , the other at Cape Louis Napoleon .
In both instances the dust was in granules imbedded 20 feet or more from the top surface of the berg .
Neither contained any organic matter .
One remained on the filter-paper aggregated in the granules or oolite-like grains .
Both effervesced with hydrochloric acid , but otherwise possessed the same mineral characters as the floeberg dust .
During winter at Floeberg Beach an attempt was made to collect atmospheric dust by means of an extemporised Maddox aereoscope , but it invariably got blocked with snow when there was any wind , and was of course useless when there was none .
A sheet of glass , exposed in absolutely calm weather on top of Thermometer Hill , was more successful .

tions on a star of magnitude 2 ' 15 ' from the horizon ) were swept off into a clean stoppered bottle , and brought on board the ship and melted , a very small , but quite distinct , sediment formed , consisting of quartose particles , a few red grains , and very minute opaque nodules ; thus fairly representing the chief constituents of the ice-dust .
I have to regret the incompleteness and absence of pre-arranged order in the observations that were made , but most of the subjects were altogether unforeseen , and it was necessary to take them up and make the best of them just as they presented themselves .
My notes have perhaps little bearing on the place of growth of the so-called " polar floes any hypothesis on that subject must give full weight to their wide distribution on both the oceanic and littoral confines of the unknown area ; but the stratification of the floes unmis-takeably indicates that the precipitation of the region where they form accumulates where it falls .
The " conglomerate " sometimes under-if tells of slow lateral removal by fission and intermediate freezing , while the " blue-topped ** floes and the wasting grounded ice mark a region where temperature gathered in summer by the naked land releases the precipitation and restores it to the sea in the shape of outflowing arctic currents of low specific gravity .
