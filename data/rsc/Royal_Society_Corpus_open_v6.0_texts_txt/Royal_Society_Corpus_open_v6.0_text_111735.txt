" On a property of Numbers .

I know not whether the following property of numbers has been made public .
A number of six places , consisting of a repetition of a period of any three figures , is divisible by the prime numbers 7 , 11 and 13 .
Thus 376376 , 459459 , 301301 are so divisible .
A number N of six places may be thus written : N=100.000 a+ 10.000 b+ 1000 c+ 100 d+ 10 e+f , which , when divided by 7 , will give a quotient q and a remainder 5a+4b+ 6c+ 2d+ 3e+f .
Now if d=a , e= b , f=c , this remainder may be written 7 ( a+ b+ c ) , which is divisible by 7 , whatever be the values of a , b , c. In like manner if a number of six places be divided by 13 , the remainder will be 4a+3b+12c+9d+10e+f ; and , as before , if d=a , e=b , f=c , the remainder may be written 13(a +b+ c ) , which is divisible by 13 , whatever be the value of a , b and c. In the same way it may be shown that a number of this kind is divisible by 11 .
When the first figure of the period is 0 , and the second any whatever i and j , the number is OijOj= ijOij ; or any number of five places , the first two and the last two being the same , while the middle place is 0 , is divisible by 7 , 11 and 13 .
Thus 34034 , 14014 are so divisible .
When the first two places are 0 , the number may be written O0i00i=i00i , or any number of four places , the first and last figures being the same , while the two middle places are 0 , is divisible by 7 , 11 and 13 .
Thus 5005 , 8008 are so divisible .
Like properties may be found for 17 , 19 , 23 , but the periods are longer .
The prime divisor being 2n + 1 , it is manifest the number of places in the period cannot exceed , however it may fall short of n. Thus when the divisor is 17 , the number of places in the period is eight .
