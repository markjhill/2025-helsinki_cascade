Artesian Wells and Bore-holes l. Introduction .
Page The opinions of physicists and geologists as to what may be the probable thickness of the crust of the Earth differ very materially .
On the strength of its great rigidity and the absence of tides , physicist\#163 ; contend for a maximum thickness and the comparative solidity of the whole mass of the globe .
On the evidence of volcanic action , the crumpling and folding of the strata in mountain ranges , its general flexibility down to the most , recent geological times , and the rate of increase of temperature in descending beneath the surface , geologists contend for a cmst of minimum thickness ( although respecting the measure of this there is great difference of opinion ) and a yielding substratum , as alone compatible with these phenomena .
My intention here is not to enter upon the general question , but to la.y before the Society the results of an inquiry on one section of it -namely , the rate of increase of temperature beneath the surface , -a fmbject equally affecting the argument on both sides .
My attention was more specially directed to this subject in connexion with an inquiry on the cause of volcanic action , during which I found that the recorded observations gave so wide a choice in the selection of a mean rate for the increase of temperature , or as termed by Professor Everett , the " thermometric gradient , " that very different values might VOL.

be and were attached to it by different writers .
I was thereby led to collect the scattered evidence bearing on the subject , with a view to see whether it were not possible to fix upon some more definite and less elastic rate .
If the inquiry does not lead to any material alteration of the averages now usually accepted , it may , at all events , serve to eliminate some sources of error , and to restrict the limits within which the true rate may lie .
It may also serve to show how far the differences in the observations in different geological areas are due to causes common to all , and how far they are special to each or due primarily to geological structure and local causes .
At present , owing to the wide differences in the recorded observations , it is very usual to take a general mean rate of 1 ' F. for every 50 to 60* feet of depth , or of 1 ' C. for every 30 metres .
Others take even a lesser rate of increase , and everyone must have felt the want of the greater certainty which can only be given by a restriction of the limits of variation to more definite bounds .
I had already in connexion with work on artesian wells , and as a member of the Royal Coal Commission of 1866 , in connexion with the " Possible Depth of Working , " got together a considerable number of observations , and to those I have added a considerable number of others , many of them not before recorded .
Although some of the earlier observations may seem to be of little value , I have thought it best to keep the record of all in the general list ( Table I ) for reference in case of need , as with corrected data respecting the surface temperature and height , some of them may possibly hereafter prove available .
A list of all local observations may be useful also at any time for further research which is still much needed , particularly in connexion with artesian wells , which under all circumstances , appear to afford the best and surest index of underground temperatures .
I need scarcely say that I treat the subject solely from the geological point of view .

3 The subject of underground temperature is far from being new .
It attracted attention a century and a-half ago , some observations having been made by Gensanne in 1740 in the mines of Alsace , which if we take the mean annual temperature at the mines of 47 ' F. , give , curiously enough , an increase of 50 feet per degree Fahr. Towards the end of the century , a few experiments were made by Saussure in Switzerland , and by Humboldt in America , hut the more important ones were those made by Daubuisson in 1803 , in the mines of Saxony and France , which gave a :rate of increase varying from 54 to 72 feet per degree F. De Trebra carried on similar observations in one of the Saxony mines for two years , which , taking the surface temperature at 44 ' , show an increase of 57 feet per 1 ' Fahr. Passing over some minor observations , we come to the series of careful and systematic observations commenced in Cornwall by Dr. Forbes and by Mr. R. Were Fox , about 1820 , and which were carried on by the latter continuously until 1857 .
Other Cornish geologists followed , Mr. W. J. Henwood especially , who between 1837 and 1858 , made a large number of experiments , not only in Cornwall , but also in the mines of South America .
Notwithstanding that the instruments had not the perfection of those of later date , the observations are of great value , as they were conducted under very varied conditions , and with a full understanding of the various causes of interference to be guarded against .
They show very considerable variations in the rate of increase with depth .
Mr. Fox records a range for 1 ' F. of from 32 to 70 feet , from which De la Beche deduced a mean from 46 to 51 feet ; and Henwood , while finding the results to range as widely as did Mr. Fox , nevertheless estimated from a large number of averages the gradient for 1 ' F. to be from 37 to 41 feet only .
Iii 1822 , Cordier published his celebrated " Essai sir la Temperature de l'fnterieur de la Terre , " and in this he recorded the observations previously made by Gensanne , Daubuisson and Fox , together with some observations made by himself in the coal-pits of France .
The several results showed variations extending from 13 to 57 metres per 1 ' 0 .
, but he concluded the mean to be about 1 ' C. per 25 ml\#183 ; tres of depth .
Amongst the most careful of the early observations are those made by De la Rive and Marcet in an artesian well at Pregny near Geneva .
In this case , the thermometer was protected against pressure , and the result gave a rate of increase of 48\#189 ; feet per 1 ' F. This was shortly followed by Professor Phillip 's well-known observations in the deep coal-pit of Monkwearmouth , Sunderland ; great precautions were taken against error , and in the result an increase of 1 ' for every 62 feet of depth was obtained .
B 2 4 Prof. J. Prestwich .
At thjs time a number of deep artesian wells were being made in France by Messrs. Degousee and Laurent and other engineers , and M. W alferdin invented an overflow maximum thermometer , which carefully guarded against pressure , gave excellent results , and which he employed to check many of the earlier observations made without this necessary precaution .
The numerous artesian wells also made abont this time in Algeria , Venice , and other \#183 ; parts of the Continent by Degousce and Laurent , gave important results .
Those in Algeria Reem to show that the rate of increase is there more rapid than in Europe .
Admirable discussions of the question were made from time to time by Arago : the last being that published in his " CEuvres Comp lets " in 1856 .
In this he reviews the whole subject , gives elaborate particulars of most of the recorded ob .
; ervations , with the advantage of more accurate surface temperatures , and concludes that the rate of increase is very variable , and may be taken at from 20 to 30 metres for each degree centigrade .
In 1861 Sir W. Fairbairn gave an account of the observations , so frequently referred to , in the Dnkinfield Colliery , where the rate of increase was estimnted at 1 ' F. for every 79 feet .
Professor Hull also brought together in his " Coal Fields of Great Britain " ( Edit .
187:3 ) , a number of observations made in the coal- \#183 ; pits of this country , and drew especial notice to the Rosebridge Colliery temperatures .
The general conclusion at which he arrived was that the underground temperature varies , being much influenced by the dip of tho strata , but may , as a mean , be taken at GO feet per 1 ' .
the Royal Coal Commission of 1866-70 was the means of obtaining through its Committee " On the Possible Depth of Working , " a mass of most valuable evidence from practical coal-owners , inspectors , and managers , relating to the temperatures at depths in the coal mines of Great Britain .
The general opinion of these gentlemen was that the temperature increased at the rate of about 60 to 63 feet for each degree F. , and the Committee concluded that the rate of increase of the temperature of the strata in the coal districts of England is in general about 1 ' F. for every 60 feet of depth .
In 1867 a Committee of the B1\#183 ; itish Association was appointed ( at the suggestion , I believe , of Sir W .
Thomson ) " for the purpose of investigating the Increase of Underground 'l'cmperatures 'downwards in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water , " with Professor Everett as secretary .
To this Committee we are indebted for a series of sixteen very valuable annual reports , in which are recorded a large number of observations carried on with corrected instruments supplied by the Committee , and under the able superintendence of its secretary .
Each set of observations is discussed at length ; the causes of interference are considered ; and detailed particulars are given of all the On Undergrowzd Temperatw\#183 ; es .
5 conditions 0\#163 ; depth , strata , isolation , \amp ; c. , under which they were made .
In the summary of results given jn the Report for 1882 , Professor Everett , after describing the instruments used , the methods of observation , and the many questions affecting the value of the observations , such as the heat generated by the boring tools , or by chemical action , the effects of ventilation , the convection of heat by air and water currentR , \amp ; c. , proceeds to a comparison of results .
Taking the list of 36 localities of which Professor Everett gives the recorded 1\#183 ; esults , and classifying them as-1 .
:Metallic Mines ; 2 .
Coal Mines ; :3 .
Wells and Wet Borings ; 4 Tunnels ; he found that in the- Metallic } , fines , the increase of temperature with depth varied from 1 ' F. in 47 feet to 1 ' in 126 feet ; Oortl mines , the range was le F. in 45 feet to 1 ' in 79 feet ; Wells and borings gave from 1 ' F. in 41 feet to 1 ' in 130 feet , or excluding the wells of La ChapeUe and Bootle , which are open to suspicion of convection currents , the least rate of increase was 1 ' in 69 feet ; Tunnels .
In the only two great tunnels in which observations have been made , that of Mont Cenis gave an increase 0\#163 ; 1 ' for '79 feet , and that of St. Gothard of 1 ' for 84 feet , but in a subsequent report Dr. Stapff has shown that an important modification is necessary for a portion of the tunnel .
In deducing a mean from these various results , Professor Everett has considered it best to operate not upon the number of feet per degree , but upon its reciprocal the increase of temperature per foot ; and assigning to the results of the observations at the thirty-six localities of which he gives the list , weights proportional to the depths , he finds the mean increase 0\#163 ; temperature per foot to be 0\#183 ; 1563 , or about , / - .
of a degree per foot-that is , 1 ' F. in 64 feet.* In the subsequent report of 1883 , however , taking the corrected readings of Stapff for the St. Gothard and Mont Cenis tunnels , this mean is reduced to 1 ' 1 !
' .
in 60 feet .
Scrtttored observations have also been made within the last few yaars in different parts of the world , some in particular of much interest on the deep hot artesian well of Buda-Pesth , by ProfesRor Szabo , and by othe-rs in America and elsewhere ; while temperatures :)\#163 ; a number of ordinary wells have been taken by the Rivers Pollution Commission .
Amongst those to whom I am indebted for furnishing me with observations in wells and mines in their respective districts , .
Professor Everett observes , however , in a pre , ious paper ( 1874 ) that some of the best observations give a rate of about 1 ' F. for 56 feet of descent , and that this seems a fair average .

not hitherto recorded , are Pr0fessor G. Dewalque of Liege , Professor Gossclet of Lille , M. F. L. Cornet of Mons , and others .
Professor Lebour has further discussed the subject , with reference especially to the nature of the experiments still required to improve our knowledge of it , in an interesting paper read before the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers , in 1882 .
In this be gives a list of observations made at fifty-seven localities , and deduces from them an average rate of increase of 1 ' F. per 64\#183 ; 28 feet of descent ; but he remarks that all the observations recorded are by no means of equal value , and points out that the mean rates of increase in the best obseITations cluster about the numbers 1 ' F. per 50 or GO feet . .
General List .
( Table I , p. 56 .
) I have given in a general list all the observations on underground temperatures of which I have been able to find a record.* The number of different localities , mines , \amp ; c. , where such observations liaYe been recorded , amounts to 248 , and the number of stationst to 530 .
I have only omitted a few which were obviously wrong , together with some of the observations repeated frequently in the same mine , or repeated more frequently than necessary for our object in mines in .
the same district , and which would only add needlessly to the length of the list.t Neither have I considered it necessary to give in all cases the full details of the observations , as these will be found in the Ol'iginal papers referred to .
I have confined myself to giving the principal and essential facts and results .
The observations are given in the order of date , an order which , afl a general rule , agrees with that of their reliability , although there are several remarkable exceptions .
The superiority of the later observations consists chiefly in tho perfection of the instruments and methods of experimentation .
Most of the more general disturbing causes interfering with accuracy of the results were well understood and gual'ded against by the early observers .
The particulars of depth , temperature , and modes of proceeding- , are given in the terms of the original observers .
On two points only , on which their information was often urnwoidably imperfect , have I made any alteration-points which even now are in many cases not ac:cnratoly determined-viz .
, the mean annual t.emperature of the surface , and the height of the surface above the sea-level .
These * I should feel greatly obliged by information reRpecting any other observations .
t By " station " I mean all the separate points in a mine , or at the several depths in a well , at which the observations have been made .

7 alterations will account for occasional differences in the thermometric gradients , between the observations as originally recorded and as given in these lists , which in most cases will be found referable to my taking a different mean annual temperature to that used by th~ original observer .
HEIGHT OF TIIE SURFACE.-As this influences both the surface and underground temperatures , it is important that it should be determined with precision .
This is not always possible , although the later publications 0\#163 ; the Ordnance Survey have in many cases furnished us with levels , which , if not at the precise spot , are sufficiently near to form , with a knowledge of the country , a near estiniate ; but not unfrequently mines are in out-of the-way places , where only roughly approximate estimates can be made .
Several of the surface heights given in this table necessarily come into this category , and are therefore subject to future correction ; while there are many cases in which I am unable to give even an approximate height .
MEAN ANNUAL TE~IPERATURE.-This is a point on which it is indispensable to have exact information , for it is one in which the difference even of one or two degrees materially affects the calculations .
There are yet , however , many of the places in the lists , where satisfactory information is wanting , and the accepted temperature may therefore require revision .
For places 011 the Continent , the , rnrks of Arago , * which embody all that was then knowu of the mean temperature of places , both in France and other parts of the world , are of great value .
The publications of the Meteorological Society of Scotland hrwe done much to give us exact data respecting the mean temperature of places in Great Britain , t and I am further indebted to Mr. Robert H. Scott , of the London Meteorological Office , for valuable information respecting the latest recorded mean temperature of places both in this country and on the Continent .
There are , besides these , the older and more general tables of Dove .
Where the temperature of the locality cannot be had , that of some place near and on or near the same level has been taken .
Where there is an important difference of height between the place at which the surface temperature has been taken and the site of the underground experiment , an approximate allowance of 011e degree F. ( + or - ) is made for every 300 feet of difference of level .
When , however , as is sometimes the case , a mean annual surface temperature is not obtainable , a near approximation may often be made by means of ordinary surface wells of about 40 to 50 feet deep , and springs .
This plan has been , Pspecially in the earlier observations , frequently adopted .
What is really desirable is that the datum line whence to commence * " Notices Scien1ifiques , " Tol .
v , p. 518 .
Edit .
1857 .
t Especially tho number of Journal for November , 1883 .
8 Prof. J. Prestwieh .
the measure of the increase of tempP.rature with depth , should be\gt ; placed at that point below the surface , at which the changes of annual temperature cease to h:we effect .
Any such determination* might a]so with advantage be applied to the correction of the past observations .
In the absence of this information , we have for the present to be satisfied with the mean surface temperature , where known , and take that as the datum line from which to calculate the descending rate .
Sometimes this has been the mode adopted , and the gradient calculated from the surface ; at other times it has been calculated by supposing the mean invariable surface-temperature to lie at a depth of 50 feet , and taking that as the datum level from which to start .
Thus , some of the original estimates have been founded on calculai ; ions commencing from the surface , and others at 50 feet beneath it .
Either , therefore , some of these estimates are too high in consf'quence of the deduction of 50 feet from the depth , or others are too low in consequence of not making an allowance for the zone of variable temperature .
But as the mean annual temperature of the ground at the surface general1y in these latitudes exceeds that of the air by about 1 ' , it follows that if we take the mean temperature of the air at the place of observation , and calculate the rate of increase from the surface , instead of allowing 1 ' for the higher temperature of the ground and with a datum line 50 feet lower , we shall come to nearly the same result .
At the same time it must be admitted that in so doing , we may sometimes be liable , especially with stations of moderate depth , to make the rate of increase with depth less than it should be .
It is therefore the more important in future observations to determine if possible the temperature at a depth of 50 to 60 feetor where the first bar of uniform temperature may happen to be- and to calculate from that point the rate of increase of temperature with depth .
Failing this , starting from the surface with the mean annual temperature of the place will no doubt give an approximate result .
Thus the mean temperature of Paris is 51 ' F. , and the temperature of the cellars of the Observatory at a depth of 9,5 feet is 53 ' F. , or 2 ' higher , so that if in this instance , whether we start with a surface temperature of 51 ' or a temperature of 52 ' at a depth of 50 feet , the result would be almost exactly the same .
In looking over Table I , the essential differences in the results obtained in Mines , Coal-pits , and Artesian wells will be at once apparent .
This arises both from the circumstance that not only in each of these * This was done in the case of the experiments at Grenelle , where a datum line based on the t e mperature and depth of the cellars of the Paris Observatory was employed .
These are 29 metres ( 95 feet ) deep , and the thermometer stands invariably at 11\#183 ; 7 ' 0 .
( 53 ' F. ) , the mean annual temperature of Paris being 10\#183 ; 6 ' C. ( 51 ' F. ) .
This is , however , a greater depth than necessary .

While a general cause affecting each group is conductivity , which variably influences all the rocks , and which is itself liable to be influenced by a number of causes to which we shall refer separately .
W c shall be able therefore to deal more readily with the subject , if , as Profcsso1 Everett has done , we divide the observations in Table I into groups in accordance with these considerations , and take each separately in the following order : I. Coal Mines .

( Table II , p. 88 .
) Considering the general uniformity of geological structure of the Coal-measures , the temperature observations in coal mines are more discordant than might be expected .
This depends upon various causes , of which ventilation is seemingly the principal , while in some cases differences of conductivity may possibly have influenced the results .
It is true that in most cases the sources of error have been carefully guarded against , but it is doubtful whether in others sufficient allowance has been made for them , and whether in some they have not altogether been overlooked .
The main disturbing causes are as follows:- Loss of Heat through E :rposed Surfaces.-To guard against the cooling of the coal or rock produced by ventilation , it bas been customary to place the thermometer in holes 2 to 3 feet deep , but it is a question whether this is sufficient , for we are rarely informed , as is essential , of the precise time that the face of the coal or rock has been exposed .
Even in the best observations we are only told that they have been made in " freshly exposed faces , " which may or may not be sufficiently soon .
For on these working faces the ventilation is necessarily well maintained , and consequently the difference between the temperature of the air and of the strata is there often most considerable , and the cooling of the rock very rapid .
On the surface of the ground the diurnal variation of temperature 10 Prof. J. Prestwich .
extends to the depth of about 3 feet , and it has been shown by means of thermometers sunk in the grounds that at a depth of*1 foot the monthly fluctuation is from 33 ' to 54\#183 ; 0 ' or = 21 \#183 ; 0 ' 2 feet , , , , , , 36 to 52\#183 ; 5 or= 16\#183 ; 5 4 , , , , , , 39 to 51\#183 ; 8 or= 12\#183 ; 8 8 , , , , , , 42 to 50\#183 ; 0 or = 8\#183 ; 0 At the depth of 29 feet at Greenwich , the annual fluctuation is still 2 ' to 3c F. , and to reach the limits of range , or where it is at last reduced to y ' , ,-th of a degree F. , we must go in this climate to a depth of from 50 to 80 feet .
Now it is evident that , owing to ventilation , there is a permanent difference between the temperature of the air in a mine and the temperature of the rock , analogous to the diurnal variation on thP , mrface of the ground , and that its effects will extend with equal , if not greater , rapidity in the one case as in the other .
Any surface of rock exposed to air of a lower temperature will lose heat with a rapidity proport , ionate to the difference in temperature between the two bodies and to the conductivity of the rock .
Therefore as convection currents and ventilation are constantly introducing into the shaft and mine air of a lower temperature than the underground rocks , these latter must suffer a loss of heat from the moment they are so exposed .
To avoid this , the best observers have , as just m eutioned , operated in freshly exposeu .
surfaces , where the loss is at a minimum : on the other hand , numerous observations have been made on surfaces exposed for a length of time and often under conditions of which we are not informed .
Thus in the well-known case of the Dukinfi.eld Colliery , near Staleybridge , it is stated that the bore-holes were driven to such a depth as to be unaffected by the temperature of the air in the shaft , and the thermometers were left in the holes from \#189 ; to 2 hours ; but we are not informed of the depth of the holes , nor of the temperature of the air in the shaft , nor of how long the rock had been exposed .
We know only that the shaft , which was a very large one and carried to a depth of 2151 feet , took 10 years to sink .
At this depth the temperature of the rock was 75 ' F. , and the estimated rate of increase was calculated to be 99 feet for l ' F. The observations were carried on during the whole of the time that the work proceeded .
Although we do not know the temperature of tho air , the action of convection currents or of ventilation is cll:larly shown in the irregularities of the rock temperatures in summer and winter , even at great depths .
Thus , on the 12th June , 1849 , the shaJt had reached a depth of 704 feet , and the rock temperature was 58 ' .
The same temperature was noted with slight fluctuations until the 22nd December , at which time the * Prof. James D. Forbes , " Trans. Roy .
Soc. Edin .

Ou [ .inde1\#183 ; g1\#183 ; ound Temperatw , es .
11 depth had been reached of 810 feet .
In February , 1857 , at a depth of 1450 feet , the temperature was 67\#188 ; 0 , which rose with abnormal rapidity to 72f0 in August , at a depth of 1689 feet .
It then slightly decreased , partly recovering and ending in October at 72\#190 ; 0 , when the depth was 1840 feet .
In March , 1858 , it had fallen to 71\#189 ; 0 at 1881 feet , and then rose by July , at 2055 feet , to 75\#189 ; 0 .
After the winter , in March , 1859 , at ~151 feet the thermometer stood at 75 ' , or half a degree less than it did in J u]y at a depth of nearly 100 feet less .
I can only attribute these fluctuations to the influence of the seasons and convection currents , or to some unmentioned form of ventilation .
A new shaft sunk in 1858 , not far from the other , gave , in the same way , analogous results , viz. , an increase of 1 ' F. for every 90 feet .
When , howevc1\#183 ; , at a subsequent period , and when the works of this colliery had been carried to the great depth of 2700 feet , observations were made in ga11eries at a distance from the shaft , with instruments furnished by the British Association Committee , and in holes 4 feet deep , an amended reading of 1 ' for every 72 feet was obtained .
Still that rate of increase is slow , and Professor Everett has drawn attention to the fact that there are other collieries such as those of Ashton Moss , Denton , and Bredbury , within a few miles of Dukinfiold , in which the results are in close agreement with those obtained in the latter .
It has been suggested in explanation of this , that the rapid dip of the strata at Dukinfield facilitates the transmission and escape of heat .
It is quite possible that this cause may have an influence , as the experiments of Herschel and Lebour have shown experimentally that the conduction of heat is more rapid along the planes of cleavage , or bedding , than across them .
Nevertheless no such difference exists in other mines where the stratigraphical conditions are alike ; the strata in the Liege , Mons , and V alenciennes coalfields ( Nos. 140 , 214-16 , 145 ) are more disturbed , and dip at more rapid angles than at Dukinfield , and yet the deep temperatures there give no such slow rate of increase .
Again , Mr. Garside draws attention to the circumstance that the Red Sandstone , overlying the Coal-measures in the area , is highly charged with water , which is largely drawn upon for water supply .
This may reduce the temperature of that mass of rock , but the effects would hardly reach to the great depths and extent observed .
Some of the anomalous results may also be attributable partly to the excellent ventilation of these deep pits .
At the Dukinfield Colliery , about 58,000 cubic feet of air circulate through the pit per minute .
The mean annual temperature of the air at the surface is 48 ' F. , while the return air from the pit has a temperature of 73 ' .
But then again the ventilation at Rosebridge and other large pitswhere the rate of the increase of temperature is more rapid and neat\#183 ; er the probable normal-is not less carefully attended to .
Still , 12 Prof. J. Prestwich .
that ventilation has a prepo11derating influence is shown by an experiment of Mr. Win , who found that in a rise of the Dukinfield Colliery , where owing to defective ventilation the temperature of the air and rock were both 76 ' , the rate of increase from the surface gave only 55 feet per degree .
Other causes have also been suggested for the lower temperature of the Dukinfield pit .
Mr. Dickinson states that before the shaft was sunk , two of the principal seams of coal in the upper part had been worked away from other pits , and that the lower seams had been worked a long way from the outerop down towards the Astley pit.* The Dukinfield observations , therefore , while they confirm the general law of increase of temperature with the depth , are scarcely admissible in estimates concerning the exaet rate of increase of temperature with the depth , and it would be safer to omit them in such calculations .
I do not mean to imply that good observers have or would select long exposed and cooled surfaces , but others have done so , and my object here is to show that cooling must at once commence , and that it is difficult to escape in any part of the pit , or however early the experiments are made , from the effects of ventilation .
It is not a question of weeks or months , but of days , if not hours .
Effects of Ventilation.-The evidence given before the Committee of the Royal Coal Commission of 1867 , " On the Possible Depths of Working , " is particularly valuable for the information it affords respecting the effects of ventilation .
At the Pendleton Colliery ( Nos. 104 and 122 ) , near Manchester , the coal in a level 500 yards from\#183 ; the down brow , had a temperature of 70 ' , and at 1000 yards distant , in the same level , and when just opened , it had a temperature of 83 ' F. At tho Rosebridge Colliery , Wigan , the temperature of the Raven coal in the shaft was 78 ' , whilst at 630 yards distant it had a temperature of 88 ' .
The air at the bottom of the down-shaft at a depth of 1800 feet was 60\#183 ; 5 ' , and , after circulating 1500 yards , 73 ' .
At another time it was 51\#183 ; 5 ' ; after circulating 2400 yards , 67\#183 ; 5 ' ; and 1tfter 3140 yards , 71 ' .
In July , 1858 , the strata at the same depth had a temperature of 80 ' ; in March , 1861 , it was reduced to 72 ' .
At the Annesley Colliery ( No. 106 ) , Nottinghamshire , a .fresh cnt coal at a depth of 1425 feet had a temperature of 73 ' , and six months later it had fallen to 64 ' .
In another case , the coal cooled 11 ' in three onths .
The volume and velocity of the air currents vary greatly .
In one place a circulation of 5000 cubic feet per minute is recorded .
In another pit the circulation was 100,000 cubic feet per minute , while * Coal Commission Report , vol. ii , " Depth of Working .

Mr. Dickinson found that at a depth of 2088 feet in one of the Pendleton pits the temperature at 500 yards from the engine brow was 78 ' , and at 1000 yards distant 82 ' .
In the same pit at a depth of 2214 feet and distant 200 yards from the engine brow , the coal in 14 Prof. J. Prestwich .

The general opinion amongst the witnesses seemed to be that the effect of ventilation was to reduce the temperature of the pits some 9 ' to 10 ' F. , though some estimated it at as much as 15 ' to.20 ' .
The effect of exposure is well shown in the following records from one of the pits at Ruabon .

The rate of increase here for the first 1000 feet is 1 ' for every 95 feet , whilst for the whole 1770 feet the rate of increase is 1 ' for every 61 feet .
This is clearly due to the circumstance that the shaft had long been sunk to 1004 feet and the mine cooled , and only recently opened to 1770 feet .
Mr. Lupton mentions that in a pit 1425 feet deep , the fresh cut coal had a temperature of 73 ' , whereas at the end of six months it had fallen to 64 ' .
In another case a period of three months had sufficed to reduce the temperature 11 ' .
After the air in the pits has circulated a certain distance ( estimated by one of the witnesses at one mile ) , it may become in the face of the workings hotter than the rock ; while the difference , which arises from the heat of the lights and the men in an instance given , does not exceed +20 .
The extent to which the temperature of the air affects that of the coal is also shown in the table of experiments , given on next page , made by Mr. Wood in another Durham Colliery ( No. Report , p. 14(J ) .
Here the difference between the coal and the air in the part of the pit through which the intake air circulates , is from 4 ' to 6\#189 ; 0 , or an average of 5 ' ; whereas in the return air at the same distances from the shaft , the differences are reduced to an average of ] i 0 .
In the Crumbouke mine the face of the coal which had been worked two years had , according to Mr. Dickinson , lowered 4 ' .
A. similar loss was shown at the Rosebridge Colliery , but after a longer interval .

Even in the two pits off work , we have in the one instance 44,550 cubic feet of air passing out per minute , with a gain in temperature above that of the outer air of 17 ' F. , and in the other case 25,500 cubic feet pass out with a gain of 18 ' F. In those instances the temperature of the outer air was only in one observation under 50 ' F. At other seasons of the year , with the outer thermometer lower , and with the difference .
of temperature between the circulating air and the strata greater , the loss of heat would proceed still more rapidly .
Mr. Forster mentions that he has known ice form at the bottom of a coal shaft , and Mr. Bald , speaking of the Whitehaven Collieries , states that the cii-culation of a.ir sometimes causes the water to freeze on the sides of the shaft , and " oven form icicles upon the roof of the coal within the mine , " whilst the air from the rise-pit issues in a dense misty cloud .
In consequence of the allowance necessary to be made for these effects of ventilation , some of the witnesses , while taking the actual rate of increase at about from 50 to 60 feet for each degree F. , considered that the normal rate might not be more than 50 feet per degree .
As a rule , the deeper the mine the greater must be the ventilation , and therefore , the more rapid must be the cooling of the underground strata .
But the amount of ventilation depends also not only on depth , but on the quantity of gas present in the coal .
Mr. W arington Smyth says , * that " in round numbers 100 cubic feet of air per minute IDay be required for the health and comfort of each person underground , or for 100 men , 10,000 cubic feet ; but if fire-damp be given off_.c_say at the rate of 200 cubic feet per minute we should need at the very least thirty ti.mes that amount of fresh air to dilute it , or 6,000 cubic feet in addition .
Increase the number of men and liability to gas , and 40,000 to G0,000 cubic feet of ai.r may be indispensable for safety .
" It is evident , therefore , that the rate of cooling from ventilation in different coal mines and at different depths i.s likely to be very val'iable .
The greater the heat and the more gas in the coal , the more rapid will be the cooling , and this may possibly account for the great discrepancies between the thermometric gradients at different collieries .
Until , however , we are in possession of all the collateral conditions , it will not be possible to assign in each instance , the precise weight to be attached to this disturbing- cause .

17 minerals , which is of rare occurrence in coal mines , and the heat arising from the men , horses , and lights , which can only be of import : : mce in shallow mines , for :in deep mines it is rarely that that source of heat brings up the temperature of the air to the normal temperature of the rock , there are few causes likely to produce an abnormal rise of temperature .
There is one , however , which though of exceptional occurrence , should be noticed in connexion with this subject , and that is the heat produced by the crushing of the rocks which sometimes takes place in coal mines .
'Phe Crushing of Roclc.-It is certain that in coal mines where pillars are crushed and the strata pressed up in creeps , more or less heftt is liberated .
No experiments , however , have been made to determine what , in these cases , are the exact effects produced , but some of tho evidence given before the Coal Commission fully establishes the general fact .
Mr. Elliot , * in speaking of one of the pits in South Wales , mentioned that when " a creep takes place , he has known the temperature very much increased , " and in one case where " the pressure began to crush the pillars , the heat produced was so great that he feared it would set fire to the coal .
" In some cases the pressure has been such as " to grind the rock to powder , like the effect of a dozen mill-hoppers , and this was accompanied by considerable heat .
" He had often found the air very hot when a sort of temporary creep occurred .
Escape of Gas.-On the other hand , a cause productive of a loss of heat is a more constant disturbing cause .
There are few coals which do not give off gas when first exposed .
In some seams it may be observed exuding from the freshly broken surfaces with a hissing sound ; and , if in large quantity , as in the case of the so-called " blowers , " or sometimes near faults , it issues with a rushing noise like the steam from a high-pressure boiler .
Some of these blowers will be exhausted in a few minutes , others will last for years-like that at Wallsend , which gave off 120 feet of gas per minute.t The common gas on these occasions is light carburetted hydrogen .
It must exist in the coal under the enormous pressure either highly condensed , if not in a liquid state , otherwise it is hardly conceivable how the discharge could be maintained so long .
The pressure of this gas is said to equal sometimes 300 to 400 lbs. to the square inch.t In any case the escape of this gas from the coal , in which it apparently exists in an infinite number of small cavities , must be to * Coal Commission Report " On Possible Depths of Working , " p. 112 .
t " Coal and Coal Mining , " p. 204 .
:t : [ Sir Frederick Abel states that , if cavities are bored into the coal and plugged , the gas speedily accumulates so as to exercise a pressure of several hundred pounds upon the square inch , as indicated by pressure-gauges fixed into the cavities .

Under this enormous pressure we do not know what the critical point may be.-January , 1886.J VOL. XLI .

reduce the temperature of the body from which it escapes , though here again no special experiments have been made to ascertain the exact loss of heat from this cause .
I find , however , one of the witnesses* on the Coal Commission remarking that in a pit the depth of which had been increased from 830 to 1588 feet , the temperature of the coal was lower at the greater than at the lesser depth , and be attributed this to a strong blower of gas issuing from the coal , which at that point was sensibly co01"r to the touch .
On a Table also put in by Mr. Elliot , and referring apparently to , the same case , it is stated that , In the Lower Duffryn Mine at a depth of ... . . .

1269 feet , 1020 yards , the temperature in a dry hole with little gas was 74 ' F. At the Cym N eol Colliery , at depths of 990 and 1150 feet , and .
1350 and 1070 yards distant from shaft , the temperature was respectively 62 ' and 65 ' , which is abnormally low , but it is stated that the observations were made in wet holes with blowers .
This escape of gas from the body of the coal may account for the observation of another witness to the effect that " the coal gives out heat quicker than the rock , " and that the temperature of the coal is , on the whole , less than that of the associated rocks .
In several cases observations have been made in the same pit , both on the coal and on the underlying shale , and generally the temperature of the rock has , been found to be higher than that of the coal .
In the Rams Mine , Pendleton , for example , the temperature of the coal in a hole 3 feet deep was 82 ' F. , and in the floor 83 ' F. ; in the Crumbouke Mine the coal was 80 ' F. , and the floor 82 ' F. ; and in other levels it was 80 ' and 80 ' , and 78 ' against 82 " F.

If the coal is cooler than the rock , it must * Mr. Wilmer : " Coal Commission , " p. 118 .
arise from an independent source of cooling in the coal , such as that just mentioned which would be caused by the escape of gas condensed under great pressure .
It is an effect important to notice , inasmuch as not only is the discharge of gas from coal of frequent , and often constant occurrence , but also from the circumstance that it affects especially the fresh opened surfaces of coal in which the temperature observations have so commonly been made .
The E.-fJects of Irregularities of the Surface.-Although it was known that the underground isothermals under mountain masses are not prolonged in horizontal planes , but follow in a certain ratio the curves of the ground above , little was known to what extent mines were affected by the smaller irregularities of the surface until Mr. George lJlliot , M.P. 's experiments in coal pits in Glamorganshire , showed that there is a sensible increase of heat with an increase in the mass of the superincumbent strata .
This important point has been rarely , or never sufficiently , taken into consideration in any of the underground temperature observations .
The following observations and sections of Mr. Elliot* laid before the Coal Commission were mostly made in abandoned parts of the pits , so as to avoid as far as possible both the effects of ventilation and of working , and the holes , in which the thermometers were placed , were 4 feet deep .
Only the depths and temperature of the coal are given in the original sections .
I am responsible for the isothermal lines which I have plotted on these data , for the purpose of showing the more precise manner in which the temperature at depths 1s influenced by the surface heights .
At Upper Du:ffryn Colliery , in South Wales , the top of the shaft is 400 feet above the sea level , and the shaft 360 feet deep .

the circumstance that at this point the surface of tho ground has risen so much that the seam .
of coal lies 1690 feet below tho surface , or 1330 feet lower than at tho bottom of the shaft .
The distance from the shaft might partly account for this difference , but only partly for that between stations 2 , 3 , and 4 .
.A.t the Cym N col Colliery one station is under a valley , and two under the adjacent hills , rising about 500 feet above the valley .
No. 2 station is only 480 yards distant from shaft ( not in section ) , against 1070 from Station No. 1 , and 1350 yards from Station No. 3 .
At that time the temperature of the outer air was 69 ' F. FIG. 2.-Section at Cym N eol , Abcrdare District .
In a similar way the New Tredegar Colliery is situated in a valley 670 feet above the sea level , and the works pass under a hill which rises 617 feet above the valley , with the effect of raising the temperature of the same coal 11 ' F. , though 2 ' to 3 ' of this may be owing to distance from shaft .

Notwithstanding the distance of Station No. 3 from the shaft , the fall On Undei\#183 ; ground Temperatures .

Outside the thermometer marked 59 ' F. FIG. 4.-Section at Vochriw Dowlais , A.berdare District .
It will be noticed that the observations in all these pits were made when the thermometer outside stood high , so that the cooling effects of the outer air would be less at the stations near the shaft than at other seasons .
There is no other coal-field in Britain so hilly as that of South 1.Vales ; still it frequently occurs that a shaft is sunk in a valley , and the works pass under adjacent hills ( or the reverse ) , which though not so high as those of Wales , are of sufficient height to influence the temperature more or less .
Many of these are points which have commonly not been noticed in the discussion of this question , yet they must not unfrequently have influenced the observations .
In all coals there is an escape of gas when first opened out , and in some it is very large , as in several of the South Wales pits ; others are merely called " gassy , " and there fewer precautions are required .
Amongst the pits in England , where recorded temperature observations have been made , and which are situated in districts sufficiently hilly to be affected by irregularity of surface , are the Dukinfield and some of the pits in the Manchester district .

Besides these more essential points , it is well to know the temperature of the air outside , the dip of the strata , their hydrogeological conditions , together with any local causes tending to increase or lower the temperature .
It is only when all these essential conditions are known and can be taken into account , that we can hope to arrive at a more exact estimate of the real rate of increase of temperature with depth in Coal Mines .
It is to be feared that very few of the observations recorded in Table II satisfy this standard .
While they present many points of interest , and confirm the general fact of an increase of temperature with depth , they fail , I think , to give the more precise information required .
For these reasons I feel that only a very small selection can be made , and I doubt whether those even give sufficiently true readings , though they may give the best approximation that can at present be obtained .
In making the selection , the points I have looked to are ( l ) accurate mean surface temperature , ( 2 ) height of ground , ( 3 ) temperature of air in gallery-or , when that is not given , such a distance from shaft as will ensure the minimum of difference between the t-emperature of the air and the rock*-(4 ) distance of the working face from the shaft , and ( 5 ) depth of trial hole .
Permanence of temperature at a station is not , as it has been often considered , a sign of its correctness , or of its being the true normal temperature .
On the contrary , when it is stated that the thermometer in the same hole continues to give the same reading for a long period , it is evident that , instead of having a more definite value , it cannot represent the normal temperature of the rock , but that of the rock or coal after cooling to a point at which an equilibrium has been established between the temperature of the strata and that of the circulating air .
Such readings therefore are too low .
Amongst the best recorded observations are those at Boldon in the Newcastle coal-field ( No. 150 ) .
The holes in the rock wflre there 10 feet deep , the temperature of the air in the gallery was nearly the same as that of the rock , and the mean annual temperature well known .
At the North Seaton Mine ( No. 217 ) , the station being half a mile from the shore , and more than that distance from the shaft , a certain uniformity of temperature between the rock and the air was necessarily ensured , although that is not mentioned .
The experiments at Hetton Colliery ( No. 116 ) seem to fulfil the required conditions , but I do not place implicit reliance on them , because the holes were first filled with water and then left for forty-eight * It is said that at about the distance of a mile from the shaft the temperature of tho air approximates to that of the coal , but this of course is a very variable result .

23 hours , after which the thermometers were left in them for twenty-four hours , so that the coal was exposed for at least for three days , if not more , to a current of 5000 cubic feet of cooler air per minute .
Further , it is stated that there was no difference in the temperature after the lapse of a fortnight .
I infer from this that the coal here again had reached a cooling point at which the equilibrium between the air and \lt ; :oal had been temporarily established .
The experiments at South Hetton ( No. 136 ) have especial value , as they were made in a bore-hole drilled into the strata at the bottom of a shaft , 1066 feet deep , to a further depth of 878 feet .
The first reading made on the completion of the hole , and while yet dry , gave a temperature of 96 ' F. Three years later the experiments were repeated , but in the meantime the hole had become filled with water , and silted up to the depth of 234 feet .
The thermometer was , however , pushed down in Lhe silt to the depth of 26 feet .
, and a tempera.ture of 77 ' recorded .
Whilst no doubt the first readings were rather too high , as the heat -caused by the tools could not have been all lost , * it is equally probable that convection currents may have cooled the mud in the bore-hole .
Taking , however , the temperature in the bore-hole between the depths in it of 100 and 670 feet ( 1166 and 1736 feet below surface ) , we have a difference of 11 ' , which gives a rate of increase of 52 feet per degree .
The strong ventilation , and the uncertainty about the length of -exposure , are objections to the otherwise careful records of the Pendleton Colliery ( No. 104 ) , and the same doubts attach to the other deep works of this district .
It is true that many of the observations are said to have been made in newly-opened ground , but we do not know whether this means an hour , a day , or a week , and as in all newlyopened mines the ventilation must be well kept up for the sake of the workmen , the rate of cooling must be rapid .
the Wakefield pit ( No. 120 ) bad been newly opened .
Ventilation was stopped as much as possible at the stations , and the temperature of the air was very near the normal ; the hole in the coal was 6 feet deep , and distant 600 yards from the shaft .
In the Barnsley pit ( No. 119 ) the station was too near the shaft , and the air was much below the normal .
The observations , both in the Radstock and Kingswood Collieries ( Nos. 163 and 155 ) , were made in holes only 2 feet deep , and the thermometers allowed to remain respectively two , five , and seven dayslong enough for the rock to cool , as shown by the fact that after another week the thermometer at Kingswood gave the same reading .
The temperature of the air is not given .

collieries , in consequence of the deflections of the isothermal lines by irregularities of the surface .
The particulars of the Norley Cornery , Wigan , ( No. 111 ) are insufficient , though the result there obtained seems to confirm the observations at the Rosebridge Colliery .
The observations in tho Mons Collieries ( Nos. 215 , 216 ) were made at a distance from tho shaft , and in dry galleries without ventilation .
.At Liege ( No. 141 ) the unusual precaution was taken of making the holes 5 metres deep , while the temperature of the air in the galleries was only 1 ' lower than that of the coal .
I have not taken any of the earlier observations , owing to the uncertainty attaching to the instruments , and , after eliminating others for the reasons named , we are reduced to the following small number of available observations : Original Tempera\#183 ; Rate number Place .

49 \#183 ; 5 This seems a very small selection to make , but I believe that the disturbing causes I have mentioned operate so constantly , that an element of uncertainty is introduced at the very opening of a pit , and that , without further precautions than hitherto taken , the observations are not reliable for the purpose of those exact values necessary to determine the true thermometric gradient .
Instead of making the observations in a newly-opened and wellventilated part , with fresh faces of the coal emitting pent-up gaRes , it might be desirable to try an isolated abandoned unventilated gallery , and there place thermometers in the coal and the rocks above and below the coal .
The holes should be 5 or G or more feet deep , and the gallery then closed at distances of 200 to 300 feet by a series of diaphragms to stop ventilation and convection currents , and the place ~10t opened for several months , by which time the end station would On Underground TempeTatm\#183 ; es .

Mines other than Coal .
( Table III , p. 96 .
) The causes affecting the thermal conditions of Metalliferous Mines are very different to those which obtaiu in Coal Mines .
In them we have to deal almost exclusively with crystalline and schistose rocks .
Not only does the conductivity of such rocks differ materially from that of the Coal-measures , but the disturbing causes common to tho two have in general very different values .
Ventilation is a cause affecting both , but it affects them unequally ; and while in Coal Mines the influence of water is generally , ery small , it plays an important part in Metallic Mines .
On the other hand , chemical decomposition and hot springs , which are common disturbing causes in the latter , are of rare occurrence in the formet\#183 ; .
Ventilation.-I have so fully described the effects of ventilation in the section on Coal Mines , that I only need mention here in what respects its effects differ in other mines .
Besides , we are not in possession , in respect to meta1lic mines , of such detailed particulars as those which the Report of the Coal Commission gives of tho Coal * Or , deeper holes and well distant from the shaft might nnswcr .
i6 Prof. J. Prestwich .
Mines .
The effects are modified in the two cases by differences in the structure of the shafts and galleriei ; , and while in the one the presence of the coal-gases necessitates excessive ventilation , in the other , hot springs and chemical decomposition , though they raise the temperature , do not render so active a ventilation imperative .
In some of the Cornish mines the current of air is hardly felt , and it is stated generally by Mr. Robert Were Fox , * that in deep mines the temperature of the rock and that of the air do not materially differ , except when the currents are strong .
At the same time it is evident that strong currents of air do sometimes prevail .
An instance is mentioned by Mr. Robert Huut , t where at the bottom of a mine 1950 feet deep , the current of air was so strong that it was difficult to keep a candle alight .
In another , in all the levels ( which were of great extent ) of one hot lode at the depth of 1410 feet , the ventilation was so effective that the temperature of the air was never higher than 70 ' F. These mines must suffer , as in coal mines , a great and permanent reduction of temperature in the proximity of the down shafts .
This is especially noticeable in severe winters , and when the ventilation is active the effects of this will extend to a considerable distance from the shaft .
Daubuisson mentions that during a severe winter , and with the outer air at a temperature of -15 ' R. ( -2 ' F. ) , the shaft of the Beschertgluck mine , in the Freiberg district , was lined with ice to a depth of 80 toises ( 480 feet ) , and that the temperature of the air at the bottom of the shaft was\#183 ; \#189 ; ' R. ( 33 ' F. ) .
Dr. Clark( " Travels in Scandinavia , " ) says that in descending the great iron mines of Persberg , in Sweden , which are 450 feet deep , he found large masses of ice covering the sides of the walls , and that it had accumulated in large quantities in the lower chambers .
But the formation of ice is not confined to these more rigorous winter climates , for Mr. Moyle speaks of finding , on one occasion , ice in abundance in the Tin Croft Mine , Cornwall , at a depth of 318 feet below the surface , and says that the ladders became impassable , crevices were filled , and icicles formed all around !
That this must produce a permanent effect is clear from the circumstance mentioned in connexion with coal mines , where the walls of deep mines near the shaft are so cooled in winter , that in summer the air circulating by them is of a higher temperature th::i , n the rock .
On the other hand , the temperature of the air in a metallic mine is more apt than in a coal mine to become heated by the combustion of candles , the explosion of gunpowder , and the presence of the workmen .
Some of the observations of Mr. Fox show the effects of ventilation in the Cornish mines .
Thus at Ruel Damsel Mine ( No. 21 ) , the tern* Coal Commission Report , vol. ii , p. 211 .

The effect of these conditions , in estimating the rate of increase of temperature with depth , is clearly shown in the last column which I have added for this purpose .
But although there may be extreme cases , it is probable , as a general rule , that the ventilation does not produce the extent of difference between the temperature of the air and of the rock that it does in coal mines .
Mr. Fox who , to avoid the effects of ventilation , always , if possible , made his observations near the ends of the levels , states that in those cases there is little difference between the temperature of the air and the rock .
A.t the same time it is possible that , even then , the uniformity may be owing to the rock having permanently cooled down to the temperature of the air-though it may not be much .

The effects of ventilation are also shown in another way .
Some of the early experiments of Dr. Forbes were made in the water in sumps and pools , which necessarily would be much exposed to the cooling effects of the circulating air .
His tables , which give the results of observations in six mines ( No. 18 ) , show a rate of increase of temperature relatively less with increased depth .
The observations are so much at variance with those subsequently made by Mr. Fox and Mr. Henwood , that I can only attribute the discrepancy to the cause I have here named , viz. , a relatively greater cooling of the water , due to increased ventilation at increased depths .
It is not necessary to give the whole series : tho following instances bring out the fact : Depth .

Fox 's later observations in rock give different results .
The Effeds of the Percolation of Water.-But while the effects of ventilation are not\#183 ; so general and disturbing in Metallic Mines as in Coal l\Iines , the effects produced by the underground waters are of much greater importance .
The alternation of impermeable with permeable strata , and the multiplicity of faults in the Coal-measures , so impede the descent of the surface-waters , that there are mines so d1\#183 ; y as to necessitate the introduction of water to keep down the dust .
Tho :Metallic Minos being , on the contrary , commonly in crystalline , schistose , and slaty rocks , have more uniformity of structure ; and , being also generally hard and compact , they are more or less impervious .
When , however , they have been disturbed and fissnred , they give freer passage to water ; and when , further , they are traversed by veins and faults , these frequently serve as channels or conduits , more or less free , for the surface-waters , and considerable quantities of water pass through them .
Consequently water is one of the great obstacles to deep mining with which the workmen have to contend .
water finds its way to all dept , hs , and with more or less rapidity .
Mr. Henwood states that in some mines a great increase follows soon on heavy autumnal rains , and that in others , months intervene before the effects are felt .
In districts formed of the usual alternations of sedimentary strata , it is estimated that on an average about one-third of tho rainfall passes underground ; while in Cornwall , where granites and slates exclusively prevail , Mr. Heu wood estimated in his survey of the Gwennap district--which consists chiefly of slates-that about a fourth of the rainfall is absorbed , the moan annual rainfall there being 46 inches , or equal to 166,834 cubic feet per acre .
The local percolation is , however , extremely variable , as in some mines the quantity pumped up does not exceed 5 gallons , while in others it amounts to 186 gallons per minute .
The same observer found that water passes more freely through slate than through granite , the quantity yielded by mines in slate being about four times as much as that in granite .
In a period of five years ( 1833-7 ) the water pumped per minute from forty mine\amp ; , amounted on a mean to the following proportions :- , ---- Gra. .

Mr. Henwood 's account of the quantity of water that passes undC'r 30 Prof. J. Prestwich .
ground in the Gwennap district is of much interest .
The mines i.n that district , over an area of 5500 acres , were combined for drainage purposes .
A great adit carried away the water above the sea-level while a deep-seated level collected the water at the depth of fro~ llOO to 1200 feet .
At the time that Mr. Henwood wrote the former was discharging 1475 cubic feet per minute , and from the latter 909 cubic feet were being pumped up , or together above 10 million gallons in the twenty-four hours .
Taking the mean temperature of the surface at 50 ' , as the water issues at a temperature of from 60 ' to 68 ' F. , or at an average of more than 12 ' above the mean of the climate , it is easy to conceive how large must be the amount of heat which the waters abstract from the mines , and how considerable the cooling of the enclosing rocks which must result therefrom .
Another observer , writing a few years earlier , states that the discharge at the Ruel For Mine from a depth of 9.50 feet , was 1,692,660 gallons every twenty-four hours ; at Dolcoath Mine , from about 1400 feet , 535,173 gallons ; and at Huel Abraham Mine it reached the large quantity of 2,098,320 gallons.* Mr. Henwood remarks that " the largest streams of water flow through cross-veins ; small ones through the lodes , whilst but little issues from the rocks whether granitic or slaty .
" Where the water dribbles slowly through the rocks to great depths , it will no doubt acquire the normal temperature of the depth , but where it passes more rapidly through the veins and lodes , the temperature will depend upon the time occupied in transit and on the volume of water .
If \#183 ; the flow is rapid , as it evidently is in some mines , the surface-waters may carry the influence of the above-ground temperature to considerable depths .
If on the other hand , the vein is one in which the ore is subject to decomposition by the surface-waters , those waters will have their temperature more or less raised .
A copious .
stream of warm water is considered among the Cornish miners a favourable indication of the proximity of a lode .
Nevertheless , Mr. Henwood , who , as we may feel assured , fully understood all the contiugent conditions , considered that by a careful selection of the underground springs and by taking them when freshly opened , they gave safer temperature results than did the undisturbed rock .
HOT SPRINGS.-These are not uncommon in metallic mines .
They a , re due to two causes .
lstly , to chemical decomposition ; 2ndly , to water coming from greater depths .
The first of these causes is a very general one-especially in copper and iron mines , in which the lode consists of iron and copper pyrites_ The surface-waters decompose these sulphides , converting them into sulphates , which by further changes that need not be here described , pass into the oxides and carbonates of these metals .
That the action * Dr. Forbes , " Trans. Roy .
Geol .
Soc. Cornwall , " vol. ii , p. 167 .
On Under91\#183 ; ound Tem , pe1\#183 ; atures .
31 jg general jg shown by the cfrcumstance that tho upper part of all these lodes consists near the surface of a crust , several feet and some6mes several fathoms thick , composed of the oxidised products of copper and from sulphides ; this part of the vein is known in Cornwall under the distinctive term of gossan .
In these cases , the water is commonly impregnated with some of the resulting soluble sulphates , and has its temperature raised by this decomposition .
Mr. R. Hunt mentions* two marked instances of the heating effects arising from this cause .
In one case the temperature in the level of a copper mine stood at 100 ' F. , but on the removal of a very large deposit of the copper pyrites " the level became cold enough to make the agent wish for a great-coat .
" The exact difference js not given .
In another case , a large deposit of iron pyrites was opened at about half a mile distant from a bot lode , 1530 feet deep , in the Clifford Amalgamated Mine , and the mere fact of opening the mine there and removing the iron pyrites , considerably reduced the temperature in tho mine .
When it was closed the temperature rose to its former height .
Spriugs of various degrees of heat ( one was as high as 124 ' ) are often met with .
The miners of Cornwall have long held that the lodes containing tin are , at equal depths , colder than those in which copper ores occur ; a fact which is no doubt due to the facility with which the cupreous pyrites decomposes .
There must also be cases in which water from greater depths is brought up along lines of fissure ( lodes and cross-veins ) ; for as these are prolonged downwards , they may traverse at greater depths strata , veins , or faults , charged with water , which , when thus tapped , will outflow at any levels lower than the height at which the water stands in the supplying source .
It sometimes also happens that at the same.depths , but in distant parts of the same level , the water is of different temperatures .
In one instance there were springs at 102 ' , 110 ' , and 124 ' , and in another case ( Wheal Wreath ) , the temperature of a small stream at the east end of a lode ( tin ) was 71 '\#183 ; 5 , while a spring at the west end of the lode had a temperature of 7 5 ' ( both being at the depth of 1422 feet ) .
On the other hand , when the water is jn considerable volume , and percolates rapidly , it must tend to have a lower temperature than the normal rock temperature , as in the instance where , in two adjacent mines , large streams both coming out of veins , had the same temperature of 67\#183 ; 5 ' at the respective depths of 588 and 722 feet .
The observations of Henwood likewise tend to show that the range of temperature of water in the same level is subject to great variation .
In consequence of the uncertainty attaching on the one hand to * Coal Commission Report , A 4-10 .
' I 32 Prof. J. Prestwich .
observations taken in rock , and on the other to those in water , Cormsh geologists have been divided in opinion as to the best plan to adopt .
The two great authorities on the subject , Mr. R. Were Fox and Mr. W. J. Henwood , respectively gave prcference , the one to rock and the other to water ( or rather springs ) , and we may feel sure that the subject was well weighed and considered by both .
Either system is in fact open to some objections , and neither can be employed without recourse to those safeguards and precautions , which no one knew better how to use than these two experienced observers .
Mr. Henwood gives as his reason for preferring springs , -that the rocks forming the sides of the shaft and levels must , to a certain extent , partake of the temperature of the air circulating through them , and that this air could not escape the influence of heat-producing causes at one time , and at another of the cooling effects of the intakeair .
For the same reason he objected to the use for temperature purposes of the water standing in the levels , or sumps .
He found it difficult to select stations at which the influence of those conditions would be always alike , and he was led to confine his observations as much as possible to the temperature of the streams of water immediately as they issue from fresh opened unbroken rock , -before they could be affected by the temperature of the levels , -as the places which would give the most correct temperature readings .
The following observations appear to me amongst the most reliable of those obtained in springs .
The deepest \#183 ; seated springs arc probably the most free from interference by the surface temperature and other disturbing causes .

The more ra.pid gradient in No. 1 is probably due to the heat resulting from the oxidation caused by the surface-waters .

The following observations made in the rock appear to be amongst the most reliable of the results obtained , the temperature having been taken in holes 2 to 3 feet deep , and the stations having been selected at places where no working had recently been going on , and as distant as possible from the shaft : No. m Temp.

43\#183 ; 2 , , Foreign Mines.-We know too little of all the conditions which obtain in foreign mines to draw any definite conclusion as to the rate of increase of temperature .
Possibly the observations may prove available when we have more certain information respecting the mean annual temperat-ure at each place , the height of the mine above the Rea , and the position , especially in mountainous districts , of each station with reference to its depth beneath the surface .
This latter element is one , which the coal-mines observations previously given , clearly show should be taken into account .
In Cornwall it is not of much importance , as the elevations are small , and the On Underg1\#183 ; ound Temperatw\#183 ; es .
mines are rarely more than 100 to 300 or 400 feet above the sea level ; but the mines of Freiberg are on higher ground , whilst those of Prizbam and Chemnitz are situated amongst high hills , and the temperature at the end of a long gallery may be , in relation to depth beneath the surface , very different to that given by the depth of the shaft .
The mines of Freiberg are those in which the greatest number of observations have been made , though none of them are of very recent date .
The deepest mine , and one in which the observa.tions were rnaue in holes in the rock ( gneiss ) , gives , if we are right in our estimate of the surface temperature , * a rate of increase with depth of 54 feet per degree .
But in this instance , -as in the case of Mr. Fox 's observation ( No. 73 ) in Dolcoath Mine , where the thermometer was left in position for one and a half year , -it was here left two years , and there must have been as before described , a cooling of the rock , such as would reduce the temperature so far below the normal , as to place it in equilibrium wit-.lt the temperature of the cooler air in the galleries .
The temperature of G6 " at Freiberg , and of 76 ' at Dolcoath , with their thermometric gradien1s of 54 and 53 feet , I take to represent the normal temperature of the rock , minus the loss of heat due to ventilation ; and if that can be estimated at anything like the loss shown to have taken place in a level in the Wheal For Mine , which , after it had been opened some time and the mine had been deepened , amounted to about 6 ' , or in a similar instance mentioned by Mr. Henwood , where the difference amounted to 7 ' , it would indicate a normal temperature of these mines more in accordance with the gradient which we have adopted on other grounds .
For the same reason the numerous observations made by lvfr .
Henwood in the mi11es of Brazil and Chili , are , \#163 ; or the present , not available , though it is possible that t.hey may be rendered so at a -future period , should the other factors necessary for determining the rlifference between the surface and the underground temperature be ascertained .

( Table IV , p. 106 .
) This class of observations presents results much more uniform than those taken either in Coal or Mineral Minrs , and whereas the observations in Mines were in Palreozoic or crystalline rocks , those in Wells are , with few exceptions , either in Cretaceous , Jurassic , or Triassic .
'l'his is based on the temperature of Dresden , the nearest place where we have recorded ob~ervations .
The mean annual temperature of Dresden is 47 ' , and a. the mine is situated at the height of about 1300 feet , or ubout 900 feet above Dresden , if we allow 1 ' for every 300 feet of elevation , we shall have about 44 ' for the surface ti:mperature at the mine .

strata , where the rocks are , as a rule , softer , more permeable lo water , and less disturbed .
Many of the interfering causes difficult to eliminate in the case of the MineR , do not exist with the Artesian Wells .
The causes of interference in the latter are reduced mainly to two , namely , pressure on the instruments and convection currents .
The early experiments , where no precautions were taken against pressuni , are consequently unreliable .
Walferdin introduced improved and protected instruments , although in some previous cases , as in Marcet and De la Rive 's observations , protected thermometers had been used .
The need of protection against convection currents had also not escaped attention , but it was not until the later observations , instituted by the Committee of the British Association , were made , that more efficient safeguards were introduced to protect more completely against the subtle influence of these currents .
It is clear that we must reject all the early experiments made with unprotected thermometers ; and it is not certain whether also a large number of those made with protected thermometers , but without protection , and sufficient protection , against convection currents , should not also be rejected .
In large bore-holes the disturbance from this cause is so great that the consequences are at once sufficiently apparent to oblige the rejection of the observations .
The ordinary deep artesian wells of Paris , such as Grenelle and others , all agree in showing a rate of increase of 55 to 58 feet per degree F. ; but the great bore-hole ( 4\#188 ; feet in diameter ) through the same strata in another part of Paris ( La Chapelle St. Denis ) , where the water does not overflow , gave a rate of increase of 39\#189 ; feet per degree for the first 100 met.res ( 328 feet ) , which is too rapid , whilst at the depth of 660 met , res ( 2165 feet ) the rate of increase was only 1 ' in 84 feet .
This is clearly due , as stated by Professor Everett , to the overheating of the upper part of the column of water and to the cooling of the lower part by the action of convection currents .
In the report of a deep boring at Moscow it is stated , but without explanation , that from 350 feet to the bottom at 004 feet the tempet\#183 ; ature was nearly constant at 10\#183 ; 1 ' C. ( 50\#183 ; 2 ' F. ) .
The diameter of the bore-hole is not given , but I judge from other circumstances that it is not less than 2 feet , and can only account for the uniformity of temperature by the action of convection currents .
The mean annual temperature of Moscow is 39\#183 ; 4 ' .
Professor Everett* also directs attention to the manifest action of convection currents in a shaft at Allend~the , about 350 feet deep , with nearly 150 feet of water , in which the temperature was practically the same at all deptlis .

Even in the deep and narrow bore-hole at Sperenberg , it was shown that the first experiments with thermometers protected against pressure , but not against convection currents , gave wrong results , for in the first instance at a depth of 100 feet , the temperature was found to be 11 ' R. , and at 3390 feet , 34\#183 ; l O R.

gives a difference of 31 " for the whole depth , or 64\#189 ; feet increase for each degree F. If it stood by itself this might appear nothing remarkable , yet it is evident , from the series of observations that were taken in this bore-ho]e , that the temperature or rate of increase at the depth of 100 feet , which was equal to 1 ' in 10 feet , and at 300 feet to 1 ' in 28 feet , is excessive , and that this excess can only have been acquired through loss of heat by convect.ion currents at the bottom and a corresponding gain at the top , and thus making the readings too high at top and too low at bottom .
If , however , we take an intermediate station at a depth of 1000 feet- .
, where the temperature averages 60\#183 ; 2 ' , we get a mean , and more probably truer , rate of increase with depth of 4 7 feet per degree .
Owing to the large diameter of the bore , to the many water-levels in the rocks , and to the circumstance that when the observations were made there was no sufficiently free outflow of water on the surface , such as would check the convection currents , there can , I think , be no doubt that the temperature of the well at Bootle ( No. 153 ) , sunk in the New Red Sandstone at Liverpool , is influenced both by convection currents and by the influx of waters at different levels .
It is clear , therefore , that great uncertainty attaches to all observations made in bore-holes with standing water , the error being in proportion to the diameter of the bore-hole ; and that where experiments have been made without plugging , all the deep temperature readings will be too low .
Even with this precaution , it may be a question whether the bottom water and that of the adjacent rock may not have had their temperature permanently lowered before trial .
This might be remedied to some extent by the use of more than one plug , and the stoppage of the circulation throughout the whole depth of the bore-hole for a certain time .
There are , however , some artesian bore-holes , where the sources of error have been reduced to a minimum .
Amongst those are1 .
Kentish Town ( No. 129).-These careful experiments were carried on for some years by Mr. Symons .
From the circumstance that the mud at the bottom of the bore-hole into which the thermometer was sunk , was free from convection currents , the results obtained show , in all probability , a near approximation to the normal temperature .
At the same time the long period that the well had stood neglected allowed the play of those currents in the water standing in the tube above the mud , and this may possibly have effected a slight reduction of temperature , but it cannot he very material .
2 .
Richmond.-The observations here were made by Professor Judd with standard instruments .
The overflow was too small to give the correct temperature , though enough to check convection currents , and consequently the temperature was ascertained by letting down a thermometer to the bottom of the well .

The first experiments at GrenelZe were made when the bore-hole had reached the depth of 400 metres ( 1312 feet ) , and when no work had been going on for some weeks .
The thermometers , of which three sets were used , were left down thirty-six hours .
They were protected against pressure , and Arago remarks that the chalk through which they were boring made so thick a paste filling the bore-hole , that convection currents were hardly possible .
All three sets of instruments gave results within a fraction of a deiree to one another.* 4 .
In the bore-hole of the well at the Ecole Militaire the experiments were made by Walferdin under very similar conditions .
5 .
Pregny near Gen eva.-The thermometer was here protected against pressure , and to a certain extent against convection currents .
The bore-hole was small , and the water stood at a small depth below the surface .
6 .
The observations at the well at Ostend , with the water also slightly overflowing , were made by Professor G. Dewalque , of Liege , with protected thermometers at the bottom of the bore-hole .
7 .
At Sperenberg , especial care was taken against convection currents , though how far these currents may hq , ve operated in reducing generally the temperature in the lower part of the bore-hole , befol'e the experiments commenced , may be a little uncertain .
These seven wells give a mean rate of increase of rather more than 51 feet for each degree F. in depth ( see p. 40 ) .
The reason why I have not included a larger number , is because in these cases I believe in the existence of some undetected errors , such , for example , as , amongst many others , those mentioned in the following instances .
Swinderby.-I have already explained my objections in this case .
Of the first series of observations down to a depth of 1500 feet , Professor Everett remarks " it is obvious that nearly all the temperatures are largely affected by convection , " he considered .
the bottom temperature at 2000 feet as less likely to be vitiated by convection in consequence of the small diameter of the bore-hole .
[ But if we take , as I have suggested , a mean depth and a mean temperature , I believe we should have in the thermometric gradient of 47 feet per degree , a nearer approach to the true normal at Swinderby .
Even in cases where the temperature is uniform from top to bottom , and there appears to be no clue to follow , as in the instance with the Moscow Well ( No. 135 ) , where Professor Lubinoff records a temperature of 10\#183 ; 1 ' C. ( 50\#183 ; 2 ' F. ) , if not for the whole depth of 994 feet , at least from 350 to 9~4 feet , it seems possible to obtain an approximate gradient .

Under certain conditions , these wells must give not only the nearest , but a very near , measure of the underground temperature , at the level from which the water rises .
These conditions arelst .
A sufficient depth and a sufficient distance of the out-crop of the water-bearing strata from the point of overflow .
In a case like the Grenelle well , which is nearly 2000 feet deep , and where the stratum which serves as a channel for the water does not come Lo the On Unde1'ground1e1nper ?
tu1\#183 ; es .
41 irnrfaco for a distance of above 100 miles , these conditions are most favourable .
It is very interesting to find , from information which M. Daubree has just ( Dec. , 1884 ) obligingly obtained for me , that the temperature of the water at the Grenelle well is now precisely the same ( 27\#183 ; 8 ' C. ) , if not O\#183 ; l ' C. higher , than it was at the commencement of the overflow forty-two years ago .
In London , the distance of 10 miles at which the Lower Tertiaries and the Chalk out-crop is also no doubt sufficient , but it is a question whether the excessive pumping and constant passage of water may not have cooled the channels .
2nd .
A sufficient volume and consequently rapid upward flow of the water in proportion to the depth , otherwise the water will part with some of its beat , as it rises through the tube .
This may possibly be in some small degree the case at Grenelle , for in the carefully conducted observations of Arago and Walferdin , when the well had reached a depth of 400 metres , the temperature ( 23\#183 ; 75 ' C. ) gave a rate of increase of 55 feet per degree , instead of that of ,58 feet when it overflowed .
At the Ecole Militaire , the rate was , as ascertained by WalferJin , 5-1 feet .
It is possible , therefore , that the slower rate of increase at Grenelle indicated by the overflow water at a greater depth ( ,548 metres ) may arise from a reduction of temperature duo in part from the water overflowing with a veloQity by no means great , but mainly from the diameter of the tube at the top being considerably gl'oator than at the bottom .
The conditions of depth and volume are generally satisfactory in the case of the great saline wells in Germany , especially in the instance of the well at Neu Salzwerk .
Humboldt states the supply of water was very abundant , the outflow being then at the rate of 422,000 gallons daily .
Its ascensional force was remarkable , as was also the enormous discharge of carbonic acid .
The deep artesian wells of Minden , which derive their water from the same source , give very similar results .
The discharge of water at the thermal springs of Mondorff in Luxembourg is very much less than at those of Neu Salzwerk .
It is situated further snuth , and the height of the ground is considerably greater , being 6'73 feet above the sea-level ; the mean annual surface temperature adopted by Walferdin was 48\#183 ; 4 ' F. , but this was only an estimate .
The mean temperature of Luxembourg , according to Arago , is only 8 ' C. ( 46\#183 ; 5 ' F. ) .
The depth of the artesian well at Tours is much less than that of the above , but the ascent of water was rapid and the discharge large .
The observations there were made by W alferdin , as were also tbose at Rochefort .
The following list is confined to those wells where the overflow is abundant , and where the observations have been marle by competent observers .

4U \#183 ; l We thus have in these wells an average rate of increase of 49 feet for each degree F. , or if we take the mean of the two lists , of almost exactly 50 feet per degree .
Before , however , accepting this conclusion , two points should be reserved for correction hereafter , namely : 1st , the determination of the precise temperature at a depth where the annual surface changes cease to be felt .
2nd , whether there is any loss of heat , and what the amount , by the water in ascending through the tu bes .
This latter is , I believe , not an unimportant consideration .
The experiments at Grenelle indicate the probability of some such loss , and the form of construction of the tubes gives strength to the supposition .
If the tubes of an artesian well were of the same diameter throughout , the passage of any given portion of the water from the depth to the surface would be direct , and the velocity the same throughout , ; but the tubes in almost all these wells decrease in diameter from the top to the bottom , consequently , instead of the whole body of water being in continuous and uniform motion throughout the length of the t.ube , the velocity of the water gradually decreases from the bottom to the top , currents are established at the points where the tubes enlarge , and a certain time beyond that required for its direct trajectory must elapse before the whole of the water issues at the surface .
For example , at Grenelle , where .
the difference between the size of the tubes at the top and bottom of the bore-hole is less than in some wells , there are four tubes of the respective diameters of 0\#183 ; 25 m. , _0\#183 ; 22 m. , 0\#183 ; 18 m. , and 0\#183 ; 17 m. As the lesser the depth of the well th~ On Underg1\#183 ; ound Ternpe1'atures .
4.3 fewer the changes of tu bes , the differences in this respect , together with the differences in length of the tube , may possibly help to explain the reason why the wells of 300 to 600 feet deep gave generally a moee rapid rate of increase than the wells of 2000 feet , an\lt ; l may also account for the different rates of increase at the several wells , for which otherwise there is no apparent cause .
I have excluded a large number of overflowing wells because of the uncertainty which aUaches to the instruments used , or to some essential point of which we are in ignorance , such , for example , as the influx of other springs , the precise depth , the size of the tubes , \amp ; c. These reasons apply to such wells as those of N ewrort ( No. 210 ) , Falkirk and Midlothian ( 45 ) , Dunkirk and Bourbourg ( 209 , 208 ) , Alfort ( 49 ) , Meaux ( 62 ) , Arcachon ( 183 ) , and others , where we do not know whether or not standard and protected instruments were used , or whether the experiments .
were in all such eases made by competent observers .
With respect to the extra-European observations , still greater uncertainty attaches from our ignorance of the general conditions , and especially of the exact mean annual temperature of the several places .
At the same time there are some exceptions worthy of consideration .
The experiments in the Sahara Desert ( No. 88a ) were made by an engineer of great experience in the construct.ion of artesian wells , and accustomed to observations of this description , and are the mean of results obtained at a number of wells .
The observations at Charleston and St. Louis appear reliable , only in these cases more particuln.rs are desirable .
The African and Indian experiments seem to indicate a more rapid rate of increase of temperature with depth than occurs in Europe .
Not so the American ( U.S. ) observations , which appear to indicate conditions very similar to those which obtain here .
Not much weight can be attached to the solitary observation in South America .
It requires confirmation .
IV .
Tunnels .
The few observations of this class , limited as they are , show not only the modifications of the gradients caused by inequalities of surface , but bear also on some important geological questions connected with the structure of mountain chains and metamorphism .
The first great tunnel was that of Mont Cenis , which is about 7 miles long , and passes under a ridge of the Alps rising 9532 feet above the sea level , and 5280 feet above the tunnel .
After making a correction for the convexity of the surface , Professor Everett estimates the rate of increase of temperature with depth to be l ' F. in 79 feet .
But the observations there were commenced late , and were not very complete .
44 Prof. J. Prestwich In the St. Gothard tunnel , where very full and complete observations were carried out by Dr. Stapff , the results are of much interest .
The tunnel is about 9 miles long ; the summit level of the ridge above the tunnt\gt ; l is 10,040 feet above the sea level , and 5578 feet above the tunnel .
This , after allowing for the convexity of the surface , gave a rate of increase of 1 ' F. in 82 feet .
But Dr. Stapff* has since pointed out that in one part of the tunnel the rate is considerably more rapid .
He found that the relative temperature of the ground above the northern end of the tunnel was much higher than in other parts-that in the plain of Andermatt the mean rock temperature was several degrees above the normal , while at the south end of the tunnel it was some degrees be1ow it .
The latter circumstance was easily explained by the presence of cold springs ; and some higher temperatures in other parts of the tunnel were attributable to the decomposition of the rock ; but there were no apparent reasons for this excess of temperature in the northern end of the tunnel , where it passes through gneiss and granite .
The difference was such that instead of a rate of increase of 1 ' in 85 feet in the centre of the tunnel , or of an average rate of increase for the whole tunnel estimated by him at 57\#183 ; 8 feet , the rate was here 1 ' F. in 38 feet .
Dr. Stapff says that there is no obvious explanation of the rapid increase in the granite rocks at this end of the tunnel , and that it is probably to be attributed to the influence of different thermal qualities of the rock .
He mentions , further , that this granite belongs to the massif of the Finsteraarhorn , which is of a differP.nt ( newer ) geological age to that of the central axis of St. Gothard , and that it is therefore not to be wondered at " if one of them be cooler than the other .
" He elsewhere r emarks that there is ah , o a wellknown local focus of heat ( decomposition of rock ) below the valley of Andermatt , which may exercise a sufficient influence .
I myself am disposed to attribute the greater heat of these rocks to mechanical action rather than to the later protrusion of the Plutonic rocks , or to any subsequent decomposition of these rocks .
If the pressure , force , and friction accompanying elevation of mountain chains be attended by the development of great heat- a heat sufficient to produce great chemical changes even in the Tertiary strata- then it may be possible for some of the newer mountain chains sWl to retain a portion of that heat .
The facts brought forward by Dr. Stapff in the St. Gothard tunnel give material support to this view .
Although Mallet failed to show that the heat produced in the crush~ ing of rocks by the lateral pressure , arising from the contraction of the crust of the earth as a consequence of its slow secular refrigeration , * " Trans. North of England Inst. .

45 was sufficient to fuse the rocks and account for volcanic phenomena , he nevertheless brought prominently forward the enormous heatproducing power of the disturbances caused by this contraction .
He made a series of elaborate experiments to ascertain the force required to crush blocks of a given size ( 3 or 3\#189 ; cubic metres ) , and measured the work done by the estimated heat eyolved by the crushinO " of l cubic foot of several classes of rock by the number of cubic 0 feet of water at 32 ' F. converted into steam of one atmosphere , or 212 " F .
This method , although not perfectly satisfactory , is sufficient to prove the essential fact that a mechanical disturbance of the rocks may develop a large amount of heat .

The heat produced on the metal surroundings by the crushing was in most cases easily perceptible to the hand , and was so great in some of the granit.es and porphyries as to necessitate a delay for the apparatus to cool .
Both Mallet and Rankin were of opinion that " in the crushing of a rigid material such as rock , almost the entire mechanical work ( with the small residue of external work ) reappears ns heat .
" If , therefore , the disturbance affecting the massive strata of a great mountain range were sudden or of short duration , an inten se degree of h eat might be rapidly developed ; but there is r eason to suppose that such movements have been of extreme slowness duriug .

long periods of time , and it was only when the tension had reached a certain point that fracture and disruption , accompanied by a more rapid motion of the parts , took place .
What the force of the pressure may have been in these cases is shown by the compression of the strata in the Alps , by the extraordinary folds and inversions of the rocks , and by the vertical cleavage ( a resultaut of pressure ) which the whole mass of rocks has undergone .

But althoug-h the compression may have been excessive , and the actual mechanical displacement great , the crushing was not .
so complete nor so sudden as to produce the extreme effects indicated by the experiments .
Complete crushing is not , however , neces , - , ary for our object , since the experiments show that on the first yielding of the rocks , which takes place when the weight is rather more than one-third of the crushing weight , a large portion of heat is given off .
Consequently not only would the heat be developed very gradually ( and mueh of it might be dissipated during the long periods that tho disturbances lasted ) , but also the major effects obtained artificially would never be realised in nature .
Nevertheless , although fusion may not have taken place , there were molecular and chemical changes produced in the rocks which indicate the existence of very consid.__.rable beat ; and there is reason to believe that this heat was often due to mechanical causes , and not to the protrusion of the molten granitic centres .
In fact M. A. Favre and other Swiss geologists now con , - , ider the granite in those ranges to have been in existence in its present relative place when the elevation and crushing occurred .
Mallet further showed that the quantity of heat developed varied greatly in different rocks , and that , although compressed by the same force before their elastic limits were passed , yet , when released , it would render a quartz rock nearly three times as hot as a slate rock .
On Underground Tempei\#183 ; atures .
47 Consequently granite and gneiss , with their large proportion of free quartz , would be more affected than the other rocks .
" \-Vhen , therefore , we consider at how late a geological period some of the great mountain chains have been uplifted , it is not impossible , looking at the magnitude of the massifs , that some residual portion of the heat produced by compression , faulting , and crushing , may still exist in such modem chains as the AlpR and the Himalayas , or in Continental areas of recent elevation when that elevation has been accompanied by compreRsion and faulting .
'fhis is a consideration which , although exceptional , should not be overlooked in the general question of undergrournl ternperatureR , especially in mining districts , where we have to deal with disturbed areas , with their faults , dykes , and mineral veins ; at the same time , there can be little doubt that the disturbances in most of these areas are of such high antiquity that there is in most imJances small probability of the rock showing remaining traces of therma , l effects due to these causes .
Ne\"ertheless , when the area has been affected by late disturbances , it is possible for the thermic uormal to be influenced by such a cause independently of the action of any volcanic or igneous rocks.* CONDUCTIVITY OF THE ROCKS .
EFFECTS OF SATCJRATIO~ AND hIBIBITION .
Although it is evidently possible to account for many of the apparent discrepancies in the thermometric gradients by the causes discussed in the foregoing pages , yet it is equally evident that .
there are irregularities -not only between the rocks in the three gron ps of observatious , but also common to individual instances in each scp\#183 ; trate group-which these causes do nut adequfltely explain .
As th0 rocks in efl.ch group are of very different lithological characters , and as there are also occasional lesser differences of characters in the members of each separate group , the common disturbing cause may .
in some measure depend upon those differences of structure and composition which variably affect the conductivity of the rocks .
The researches which bear most directly on this inquiry are those of Professors Herschel and Lebourt in this country , and M : .
Jannettazt in Frnnce , the former relating more especially to the differences dependent upon the lithological structure of the rocks , and the latter to t !
.iose dependent on the component minerals .
Tabulating the results of Professor Herschel and Lebour 's experiments in accordance with their geological relations , as grouped in Tables II , III , and IV , we obtain the following mean conductivities for the several groups of rocks : .

331 This shows a considerable difference between the conductivity of the metamorphic and palreozoic rocks of the Mineral and Coal Mines , and that of the newer strata in which the Artesian Wells are usually situated ; but therA are conditions , hydro-geological and structural , obtaining in the rock masses themselves , which introduce many modifications affecting the value of these differences .
For example , in each group there are subordinate beds , which may have more or less local influence .
In the first there are seams of coal , of which the conductivity is extremely small , though these seams form but a fraction of the euti1\#183 ; e mass .
Thus there areNo .

Besides , the coal seams vary very much in thickness , and are of limited range , that is to say , they form thin plates never coextensive with the Coal-measures them~ selves ; at the same time , when one thins out , it may be replaced by another on a different level .
In the crystalline and schistose rocks , veins and layers of quartz and of quartzite are of common occurrence , though very irregular in their mode of distribution .
The quartz veins and seams are generally thin , but the quartzite often forms masses of large dimensions .
In the Artesian Wells gypsum and rock salt are of not unfrequent occurrence in the Triassic strata ; in the remarkable instance of the VOL. XLI .

This condition becomes , in considering the question of conductivity in relation to underground temperatures , a matter of very great importance , for in nature dry rocks are the exception and wet rocks the rule .
The level of permanent saturation of the strata is regulated by the sea level Off the outside , and by the level of the river valleys and their tributaries inland .
All the rocks below those levels are , as a rule , permanently saturated with water , while between the valleys the line of water level rises in proportion to the distance the water has to travel , and the friction offered by the rocks before it escapes as springs .
In the chalk hills of Kent or Surrey , for example , which rise to the height of 500 to 600 feet , the water level stands 200 to 300 feet beneath the surface , while below that level , the rock , whatever its thickness , is in a state of saturation .
In the valleys the chalk is saturated to the surface ; and Artesian Wells are always in relatively low levels .
It is the same with the sandstones of the Trias or of the Coal-measures , only that in the latter the presence of faults often cuts off the supply , and segments exist with but little water except that of imbibition .
This water of imbibition , or quarry water , is present in rocks above the line of permanent saturation , it being a property that depends on the capillarity of the rock , which is very strong in chalk and oolite , while it is slight in quartzose grits and sands .
There are therefore few rocks in which the influence of water is not felt .
* It may , however , be a question whether it is not intercalated with thin seams of gypsum .

3\#183 ; 00 19\#183 ; 56 19\#183 ; 30 It is clear then that the conductivity of the underground rocks must , except in some very hilly districts , be taken solely as that of wet rocks .
In the harder and more compact rocks there will be little difference , but in the softer and more porous rocks the difference arising from this cause must be very considerable .
The conductivity even of coal will be increased , although the quantity of water that coal imbibes is very small .
But unwrought coal also contains a large proportion of gas- and gas in a state of extreme condensation , or possibly in a state near liquidity , and this also may have an effect upon its conductivity .
Foliation and Oleavage.-The other condition , to which we have already alluded , is that produced by foliation and cleavage , and by the angle at which the strata lie .
Messrs. Herschel and Lebour showed , for example , that the conductivity of slates varies accordingly as it is taken across or along the planes of cleavage- that while the conductivity along the planes of cleavage is equal to that of the crystalline rocks , it is no greater than that of soft sandstones across .

184 , 20d M. Jannettaz* has extended the inquiry to a great number of other rocks , and he shows that the variation in conductivity in many rockB is largely dependent upon the presence of mica .
He found that in a crystal of mica , heat was conducted about two and a-half times more rapidly along the planes of cleavage than perpendicular to it .

53 The thermic curves attain their maximum variation in talcose and micaceous schists and in slates .
The greatest inequality , 1 : 3 , was shown by a specimen of a talcose rock , of sp. gr. 2\#183 ; 7 .
The variation exists in all rocks showing Rchistosity or lamination , but in ordinary stratified rocks the thermic curve remains that of the circle .
It was found that the variation exists also in rock crystal , gypsum , felspar , \amp ; c. All the specimens experimented upon were dry .
It is evident then that in gneissic rocks and slates , the dip , cleavage , and foliation may have a very important effect on the conduction of heat ; lamination has a similar but lesser effect in argil1aceous shales ; in ordinary sandstones and limestones no such effects are produced .
\#183 ; whilst these effects therefore may be very manifest in the rocks generally associat.ed with Mineral Veins , they can only be small in Coal Mines , although they may be in some places increased by a larger propo1\#183 ; tion of mica in the sandstones and shales .
There is also the further consideration with strata , such as those of the Coal-measures , that although there may be separately little difference in the thermic axes of the different rocks , the differences of conductivity in the various component strata may , as with foliation , allow of a variable transmission of heat along the planes of the inclined strata at their outerop .
But , even if that be the case , the effect would be merely local , possibly affecting the mass of inclined strata to a. given depth , but in no ways affecting the special problem in relation to the general body of strata unaffected by those local conditions .
CONCLUSIONS .
The list of selected cases on which these conclusions are based may appear small , but I feel satisfied that the sources of error in experiments of underground temperatures are so many and so obscure , that without the fuller information which we have in these few instances , the larger number are not available for our purpose , though they all bear on the general question , and with the corrected data before named it may be possible to utilise some of them hereafter .
We now require , however , for this object those observations only which give the nearest possible approximation to the true thermometric gradient , and for this it is necessary to reject all the doubtful and more uncertain cases .
For these reasons I have confined myself , in tho case of the Coal Mines , to the limited number of the eight instances given in the list at p. 24 ; and in the Mineral Mines to eighteen of the seemingly most reliable rock and spring observations of Fox and H enwood .
The Artesian Wells give more uniform results , - results which , under certain conditions , should be perfectly true .
I have , however , only been able to select , fifteen wells , of which eight are overflowing wells , and seven not-overflowing .
'i ' 54 Prof. J. Prestwich .
Taking these three classes of observations we obtain the following values for their several gr11dients :Thermometric gradient per 1 ' Fahr. Coal mines ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

43\#183 ; 2 , , Artesian wells . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
50\#183 ; 0 , , The mean of the three thus gives a general thermometric gradient of 47\#183 ; 5 feet per degree .
I do not , , however , by any means consider this more than an approximation to the true normal gradient .
In Coal Mines the effects of ventilation , and in other Mines the effects of chemical action and the circulation of water , have yet to be more accurately determined ; while in the case of Artesian Wells , I believe the gradient of 49\#183 ; 5 feet may be too low in consequence of the unequal velocity of the water in deep overflowing wells , and of the uncertain measure of convection currents in those which do not overflow .
Admitting , however , these determinations to be approximately correct , they show that different geological areas have , in all probability , different gradients , and indicate possible inequalities in the underground isothermals , unless the altered conditions which come into play at greater depths tend to reduce and level them .
There is reason also to believe that the conductivity of the rocks at great depths may be affected by their hydromeiric state and temperature .
The descent of the surface water may ultimately be retarded or stayed by friction and heat .
Faults , although they may stay its descent , leave untouched the water originally enclosed or imbibed .
M. Delesse , who made some calculations on the probable depth to which water descends , concluded that water might circulate to the depth of about 8 miles before this limit was reached .
Further the experiments of Regnault determined the expansive force of the vapour of water up to a temperature of 239 ' C. , the pressure then being equal to 27\#189 ; atmospheres .
Beyond this , it has only been carried by empirical formuloo , but both experiment and calculation indicate that , with the increase of temperature , the increase of force is extremely rapid , and there is in all probability a point at which the vapourtension of the heated water will equilibrate the hydrostatic pressure .
With respect to the possibility of change in the thermometric gradient at depths , it is known that the conductivity of wrought iron diminishes as the temperature increases , and at a rate agreeing very closely with the empirical law that the conducting power o~ iron for heat is inversely as the absolute temperature .
What the variation in rocks may be has yet to be dete4mined experiOn Unde1\#183 ; ground Temperatures .
55 mentally ; * we may presume it to exist , although it may differ materially in degree .
Therefore , taking into consideration the probable limitation of the percolation of water , and the possible diminution of conductivity with increase of depth , if there should be any alteration in the thermometric gradient , at great depths , it will be more likely to be in the direction influenced by these more or less certain factors , or in fa , our of a decreased conductivity and a more rapid thermometric gradient , rather than otherwise .
I have made a few attempts to ascertain , with the data in our possession , whether there exists any indication of such variation within the limits of the depths reached , by comparing the gradients of the upper wit , h the lower portions of the mines , but without arriving at any satisfactory result .
t It is true that in the Coal :Mines , taking a depth below 1000 feet , the gradient , in all cases except two , shows , with increased depth , an increased rapidity , but it is a question whether this is not due to ventilation and convection currents causing too low a reading of the gradients in the upper part of the mines , and so throwing an apparent gain into the gradients in tho deeper parts of the mines .
In the Mines other than Coal , some show at great depths a more rapid , and others a slower gradient , but it has to be observed that generally there is greater steadiness in the gradients at depths beneath 500 or 600 feet , than in those which are shallower .
In Artesian Wells and bore-holes , on the contrary , the gradient is often more rapid in the upper than in the lower section of the wells , but this is clearly due to the action of convect.ion currents ; while the decrease in the diameter of the bore-bole with the increase of depth , by unequally checking the flow of water , differently affects the temperature of the water in the tubes as successive depths are reached .
Looking , however , only at the more certain and determined causes which have interfered with the value of even the best observations , I believe that the effect of them has been to make the readings for the Artesian Wells and bore-holes especially , as well as the Mines , too low ; and it may be a question whether a general average gradient of 45 feet per degree would not be nearer the true normal than the one of 47\#189 ; -feet obtained by the foregoing investigation . .
The large propor~ion of iron pi-esent in the deeper seated igneous rocks is an element to be considered .

" * ' In Cornwall a mean surface temperature of 50 ' , 51 ' , 52 ' , or even 53 ' F. was adopted in the early underground observations , and thermometric gradients were calculated on those several different scales .
'.l.'he more recent observations of mean annual temperature , which I have received from the Meteorological Office , give for Penzance 51'15 ' , Truro 52 ' , Falmouth 51\#183 ; 4 ' , while Plymouth is 51\#183 ; 3 ' , and the high ground of Dartmoor 45\#183 ; 8 ' .
Taking the height of the mining districts to vary from 100 to 800 feet , we may take the mean annual tempemture of those districts " in block " at 51 ' .
Mr. R. Were Fox plac\#163 ; d the1\#183 ; morneters 3 feet underground , at a height of 300 feet above the sea-level , near Dolcoath Mine , which gave a mean annual temperature of 49\#183 ; 94 ' F. ; at 300 feet near Gooland Mine , which gave 48\#183 ; 99 ' ; and at 120 feet at Falmouth , where it recorded 50\#183 ; 67 ' .
His opinion was I On Undei.ground Tempemtures .

( a ) Here the temperature of the air in gallery was 72 ' .
hat the mean surface temperature of Cornwall was under 51 ' , and possibly even )Ss than 50 ' .
This will account for the apparent discrepancy between the gradients , f many of the original observers and those given in the Tables II , III , IV .
t A subsequent observation ( No. 73 ) of Mr. Fox , made a year later , at the lepth of 1380 feet , gave a rather lower reading .
A thermometer 4 feet long vas placed in a hole 3 feet deep , at a spot where no workmen were employed , nd where the current of air was small .
The hole was filled with clay round the _tern of thermometer , which was left in that situation for eighteen months , and was ound always to indicate a temperature of 76 ' or 76\#189 ; 0 .
In the experiment of 1820 he thermometer was buried in the rol'k to the depth of 6 or 8 inches , and filled \#183 ; ound with earth .

Column 1 of these tables gives the original number of the observation in the general list of Table I. Instead of the columns for the height and temperature of the surface , given in Table I , another giving the thermometric gradient , are substituted in the following tables .
For subjects peculiar to the separate tables , special columns are introduced in each case .
The gradients for the total depths are given in stronger type than the others .
Column VIII in Tables II and III gives the temperature of the air in the gallery in which the rock or spring temperatures are taken .

X Notes and remarks .
* The temperature observations in this pit were made in a bore-hole ( a ) drilled at the bottom of the shaft , which is 1066 feet deep .
The first series of obserrntions were made by Mr. Atkinson in April , 1869 ( Coal Commission Report , vol. ii , pp. 128 and 133 ) , after the boring operations had only ceased twenty mim1tes .
The temperature at the bottom of the bore-hole , then 858 feet deep , or 1924 below the surface , was 96 ' .
The experiments were repeated after the boring operations had been suspended about a week , and the temperature found to be the same as before .
But those made three years later ( April , 1872 ) , and recorded in the British Association Reports , show a considerable decrease of temperature .
The abandoned bore-hole had then silted up to the depth of 644 feet .
The encased thermometer was pushed down io 26 feet in this , or to a depth of 1736 feet from surface , where the temperature \#183 ; was found to be 77\#183 ; 1 ' .
t The observations were made in holes at bottom of shaft during sinking .
: ) : The distances in Column IV are from the down-brow .
S '.the temperature of the I rocks in this pit was from 2 ' to 4c higher than that of the coals .
ii The first series of observations at Dukinfield , although taken with great care , are wanting in details .

* This result is asrnming the mean temperature to be 75\#183 ; 2 ' , which is that of Jabalpur , a neighbouring town nearly on the same level .
In tho Brit. Assoc. Rept .
the rate of increase ( 68 ft. ) is calculated from the temperature at the depth of 60 feet ( 81 ' ) " \#183 ; here the water may be affected by conwction currents .
t The surface temperature at the African wells is ver_y uncertain . !
The obserntions a:t 3029 feet were taken with great care , and were considered reliable .
The discrepancy at the greater depth is at present unaccountable , unless it were due to convection cmTents .
S fat this well an infiltration of water from a higher level was suspected .
