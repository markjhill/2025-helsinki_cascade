Vacuum Arc among proteins , the analogies between its general behaviour and that of other gels are sufficiently close in all other respects ; the effect of the lyotrope salts , for instance , is substantially the same on gelatin , albumin , and even on gels of such extremely dissimilar chemical nature as agar and silicic acid .
Even if the experiments throw no light on the origin of types of organic forms , it is probably not straining the analogy too far between the one gel used experimentally and the more complex gels which constitute organisms , or portions of them , if we suggest that they lead one to appreciate the possibilities of variation through changes\#151 ; some of them exiguous\#151 ; in the surrounding medium , the salt concentration in the organism , and the temperature .
A still closer approach to natural conditions can obviously be secured by using more complex gels , especially such as contain dissolved or emulsified fat , and by discharging them , not through air , but under the surface of the coagulant .
Preliminary trials with the latter procedure have shown the necessity of much more elaborate apparatus than that used hitherto , and the \gt ; extension of the investigation in the sense outlined above must be deferred to a more favourable opportunity .

Introduction .
In the prosecution of the work on ionisation potentials recently set in train by one of us , it became of importance to extend the development to include an examination of the series spectra of certain of the elements farther down in the ultra-violet region than was accessible with an optical system of quartz .
In order to carry out this extension of the work , a small 60 " prism and two bi-con vex lenses of about 15 cm .
focal length for the visible range of wave-lengths , all of good quality fluorite , were made for us by the Adam Hilger Co. , and these optical parts were used in the construction of a spectro- i Spectra of various Elements in the Extreme Ultra-violet .
317 graph made up in the laboratory workshop of the University of Toronto , after our own design .
* Great difficulty was experienced in developing the instrument to a stage which would enable one to make rapid and satisfactory progress with it .
The working out of a satisfactory arrangement of devices for establishing and maintaining at will an arc in vacuo was found especially trying , but eventually the main difficulties were overcome .
The most rapid progress could be made , it was found , by cutting out all more or less complicated arrangements and using only the simplest possible operating attachments .
2 .
Apparatus .
The general characteristics of the spectrograph will be readily seen from the sketch shown in fig. 1 .
The apparatus as in actual use is shown in the photographs of Plate 7 .
The prism was mounted on a platform in a central Oil seal Outlet to vaciiorrii pump Collimating lens Electrodes Wax seal Sensitized plate Fig. 1 .
brass chamber from the two opposite sides of which projected a brass collimator tube and a brass tube terminated by a plate holder .
This latter consisted of a shallow rectangular box carrying a frame which could be slightly rotated when adjustment was necessary .
The box was provided with an opening at one end through which the photographic plate could be slipped into position .
When the plate was in position and ready for an exposure , the opening was closed with a small brass cap and the joint made air-tight by means of a rubber washer .
The operation of inserting the plate and of closing the opening in the plate holder was , of course , carried out in the dark .
The photographic plates used were narrow strips cut from Schumann plates recently prepared and put on the market by the Adam Hilger Co. 2 d 2 318 Prof. McLennan , Messrs. Ainslie and Fuller .
Vacuum Arc In the course of the experiments it was found necessary to remove all water vapour from the spectrograph in order to secure*the best photographic results in the region of shorter wave-lengths .
For this purpose a large cylindrical brass drying chamber , shown in fig 1 , was attached to the collimating tube .
Through a narrow opening in one end of this chamber it was possible to insert or remove when desired a shallow tray filled with phosphorus pentoxide .
The plate , P , fig. 1 , provided with a rubber washer enabled one to close the opening quite satisfactorily .
The collimator tube was provided with two closely fitting tubes , A and B , concentric with it .
One of these , A , carried a disc in which was inserted the condensing fluorite lens , and the other , B , carried a plate to which the slit jaws were attached .
The focussing fluorite lens was carried on a disc borne by a sliding tube , E , similar to A and B. The edges of the discs which , carried the lenses were pierced with a number of holes so that the air had free access through them to all parts of the instrument .
The air was removed from the apparatus by means of a set of oil-sealed mechanical Trimount pumps , the connections being made with lead piping at the points shown in the figure .
Before the instrument was used with a vacuum arc , the slit , lenses , and prisms were all carefully adjusted so that with an aluminium spark in air as a source the lines in the neighbourhood of X 1858 A , as well as those up to X 2200 A , could be seen clearly focussed and well up on the right-hand side of the plate .
Various forms of " lamp " or " lantern " were tried out without success , * but the simple arrangement shown in fig. 1 was finally adopted as giving the best and at the same time quite satisfactory results .
The arrangement consisted of a T-tube , D , attached to the collimator by means of a shoulder at C. One electrode was led in from below and the other through the end of the " lantern .
" When soft metals were used the lantern was turned through an angle of approximately 45 ' so that both the electrodes were at an angle with the vertical .
Flexible joints with oil seals were used with each of the electrodes , so that they could be readily adjusted without allowing any air to enter the spectrograph .
The electrodes were originally insulated with ebonite bushings , but in later work , where high temperature arcs were used , the ebonite was replaced by porcelain bushings .
The lantern was provided with a window of glass through which the arc could be viewed .
A short glass G-eissler tube , not shown in the diagram , was connected with the spectrograph .
The terminals of a small 4-volt induction coil were attached to this tube , and when the discharge from the coil was sent through i Spectra , of various Elements in the Extreme Ultra-violet .
319 it the appearance of the discharge served as a guide to estimate the degree of exhaustion attained within the instrument .
The Trimount pumps were found to be exceedingly efficient .
When all leaks were stopped and the pumps put into operation , the cathode ray vacuum was obtained in a few minutes .
Initially , the apparatus was exhausted several times and washed out with hydrogen before steps were taken to make an exposure .
After the last washing the pumps were kept running for a quarter of an hour before an exposure was made .
At this stage the Geissler tube showed a faint greenish yellow fluorescence similar to that exhibited by a " hard " X-ray tube .
In the later experiments it was found that washing out with hydrogen was not necessary when plenty of phosphorus pentoxide was used .
The arc used in the experiments was produced by joining the electrodes to the 220-volt D.C. mains with a suitable resistance in series to regulate the current .
The arc was established by simply bringing the ends of the electrodes together and then drawing them slightly apart .
With substances having a high fusion point such as copper , the temperature of the arc was not sufficient to melt the metal and the arc was of an intermittent nature giving an intense flash on each break when a current of 8 to 15 amperes was used on closed circuit .
For metals of low melting point quartz tubes were originally placed around the metal , leaving a small end projecting so as to permit electrical contact to be made .
When the arc was once started the metal at the top of the electrode melted and a continuous intense source of light was secured with a current of from 4 to 6 amperes .
In the later experiments with soft metals it was found to be more convenient to place the metal in hollows made in the ends of two iron rods used as electrodes .
The time of exposure was equivalent to about 5 minutes continuous arcing , By one or other of the methods indicated above , arc spectra for copper , aluminium , zinc , carbon , iron , tin , thallium , lead , nickel , cobalt , and cadmium were obtained .
In later work , a hydrogen discharge tube of the end-on type was constructed so as to fit in the socket at the end of the collimator , which was also used for attaching the vacuum arc lamp .
A fluorite window was sealed in the end of the discharge tube through which the light passed to the slit .
Ihe discharge was obtained by attaching the tube to a small induction coil without additional capacity in the circuit .
In addition to the spectrum of hydrogen , several lines were obtained corresponding to the main lines of the carbon monoxide spectrum as given by Lyman .
This , no doubt , was due to an impurity in the hydrogen used in the discharge tube .
320 Prof. McLennan , Messrs. Ainslie and Fuller .
Vacuum Arc In order to compare the metal spectrum with that of hydrogen , an adjustable cover was provided for the slit , so that one half of the slit could be exposed for the metal arc and the other half for the gas discharge .
By means of this slit cover , the metal and gas spectra were photographed on the same plate one above the other .
In working with metal arcs the secondary hydrogen spectrum was always present along with the metal spectrum .
The lines due to this gas effect were , however , easily picked out by having the metal and hydrogen spectrum photographed together on the same plate .
When an intermittent arc with a small current was used , the time of exposure was longer , and the secondary spectrum came up strong , while with higher currents the arc remained much steadier , and the secondary spectrum was relatively much weaker .
3 .
Method of Determining Wave lengths .
In calculating the wave-lengths of the lines in the different spectra certain lines previously measured were used as standards .
From these the wavelengths were determined by means of graphical interpolation .
In making a calibration curve , the hydrogen and aluminium lines as measured by Lyman were used for the region from A , 1850 A down .
For the region above A 1800 A , carbon monoxide lines as given by Lyman , together with copper and thallium lines as measured by Eder and Yalenta , were used .
The plates themselves were measured with a Hilger comparator , and the average of results from several plates was used in each case .
A list of lines used as standards is given in Table I , together with their wave-lengths and the name of the observer . .

Results for Metal Arcs .
( 1 ) Zinc.\#151 ; The results obtained for this metal below X 2025-5 A are given in Table II , together with the results of Eder and Yalenta and of Saunders , * who all used a zinc spark as source .
Those obtained by Wolff by the use of a prism spectrograph and a zinc vapour arc lamp are also included in the Table .
Down to X 2025'5 A , the results obtained in the present work agreed closely with those of Eder and Yalenta and of Saunders .
Between X2025 A and X 1600 A , Saunders gives a list of seventeen faint arc or spark lines , and Wolff three arc lines , for which no corresponding values were found in this work . .

Vacuum Arc no corresponding wave-length was found in our work .
A number of lines , however , were observed in this work for which no corresponding measurements were found in the lists of other observers .
It is interesting to note that our results with the vacuum arc brought out several faint lines not secured with an ordinary vapour arc lamp such as Wolff used .
The metal employed in this work was that classed as chemically pure .
It should be noted here that there was little similarity between our list and the results given by Handke* for the zinc spark .
( 2 ) Aluminium.\#151 ; The vacuum arc spectrum for this metal was obtained by using aluminium terminals made from ordinary commercial metal .
The arc obtained was of the intermittent type giving an intense source of light for the short intervals when the circuit was broken .
The wave-lengths in the region investigated were well covered by those of Lyman , Handke , Eder and Yalenta , and Takamine and Mtta.f It is interesting to note that the vacuum arc spectrum for this metal corresponded closely with its spark spectrum .
Saunders also observed the same phenomenon in his work on the vacuum arc spectrum of aluminium .
The measurements for this metal , together with the wave-lengths recorded by other observers for the spark spectrum below X 2000 A , are given in Table III .
As might be expected from other work , the lists for the spark spectrum contain more lines than were obtained with a vacuum arc .
( 3 ) Copper.\#151 ; The copper vacuum arc spectrum was obtained by using electrodes made of the metal itself .
With a current of 9 amperes the arc was almost continuous .
The results obtained in this work below X 2037 A are given in Table IY , together with values of wave-lengths which correspond with ours , as given by Handke and by Eder and Valenta for the copper spark .
Their measurements are not given in full , because they contained a great many lines which were not observed in our work .
Our list however includes several lines not given by these investigators .
The results indicate that the relative intensities of the lines in the vacuum arc spectrum of this metal are more nearly like those of the spark spectrum than of the ordinary arc in air .
In this regard our results confirm those of Saunders .

( 4 ) Thallium.\#151 ; The vacuum arc for thallium was obtained by placing the metal in cups in the end of iron electrodes .
A continuous intense arc was obtained with a current of 6 amperes .
The measurements for wave-lengths below X 2000 A are given in Table Y. Saunders has measured the vacuum aic and spark spectra for this metal , and the results in full , as given by him , aie included in the Table .

This may be due to a difference in I Spectra of various Elements in the Extreme Ultra-violet .
325 the conditions under which the arc was operated .
Generally speaking , Saunders ' measurements are higher than ours .
This may be due to the fact that he based his work on standard lines different from those used by ourselves .
Takamine and Nitta measured two lines in the vacuum arc spectrum of this metal at X 197T8 A and X 1908'2 A ( in air ) .
In our results a line was noted corresponding to the latter , but none for the line X19718 A. Below X181A2 A several new lines were observed and measured . .
( 5 ) Tin.\#151 ; The vacuum arc spectrum of tin was obtained by using a sample of chemically pure metal in iron electrodes .
With a current of 5 amperes on closed circuit an intense intermittent arc was secured .
The measurements obtained for this metal below X 2152 A are given in Table YI , together with results obtained by Saunders , who measured the arc spectrum of tin down to X 1811,29 A. Between X 2092'14 A and X 1811'20 A four lines were measured by us which are not given in his work .
It is noteworthy that among the lines missing from the spectrum as recorded by Saunders , there is the line X 1899'8 A , which , according to our work , is one of the strongest lines in the spectrum .
Below the range covered by Saunders ' work several new arc lines were photographed and measured .
The spectrum is remarkable for the number of strong lines between X1500 and X1400 .
The Table does not include lists of wave-lengths of those observers who investigated the spark spectrum only .

71,402 ( 6 ) Lead.\#151 ; The vacuum arc of lead was secured by placing the metal in iron electrodes .
A current of 4 amperes was used , and this proved to be 326 Prof. McLennan , Messrs. Ainslie and Fuller .
Vacuum Arc sufficient to give an intense arc which was nearly continuous .
The measurements of the wave-lengths below \2170 A are given in Table VII .
Saunders has also measured the vacuum arc spectrum of lead , and his measurements are included in the Table .
Where the range is common , the results given in our paper agree fairly well with those of Saunders .
His work showed more detail in the region down to X 2022*64 A , while our work brought out more for the region below that limit .
This , no doubt , was due* to the fact that the optical system of the instrument used by him apparently included two thin plates of quartz , which would tend to absorb the fainter lines below X 1850 A. With our system of fluorite , the possible attainable limit was well below the range for which the instrument was adjusted .
The arc spectrum of lead was similar to that of tin , in that it included several strong lines well distributed over the range studied in the work .
Chemically pure samples of the metal were not obtainable for this work , and hence commercial metal was used , which may have given rise to lines belonging to metallic impurities .

A continuous arc was i Spectra of various Elements in the Extreme Ultra-violet .
327 obtained by using a current of 10 amperes .
The spectrum obtained consisted of a line spectrum , the measurements for which are given in Table VIII .
A set of poorly defined bands was also observed on our plates , but as the measurements for these were found to be in good agreement with the results of Lyman , they are omitted .
In the plates these bands seem to correspond with those of the carbofi monoxide spectrum as obtained from a discharge tube .
This may have been due to the fact that the carbon arc was at a very high temperature compared to that of the discharge tube .
We did not have time , however , to make a detailed study of this point .
Very little information has been found available concerning the line spectrum of carbon in the region investigated by us .
Comparing our results with those given by Eder and Valenta , two lines at A 2296 94 A and A , 1930T2 A were found to correspond very well with strong lines obtained in our work .
Outside of this there was little similarity , and so their list is not given in full in Table VIII .
It was noticed that the wave-lengths 1548-5 A , A. 1550'7 A , X 1656'8 A , and the triplet ( X1560-5 A , X 156T2 A , and 1562-0 A ) as measured in our work corresponds apparently to the lines A , 1548-2 A , A. 1550-8 A , A 1656-8 A , and X 1560'2 A given by Lyman as lines of uncertain origin .
The triplet at A 1561 A is very prominent , and was present in the spectra of all the metals studied , except that of zinc .

Using the pieces of metal in iron terminals an intense arc was secured with a current of 12 amperes on closed 328 Prof. McLennan , Messrs. Ainslie and Fuller .
Vacuum Arc circuit .
Similar to that of iron , the spectrum given by cobalt showed up prominently several lines belonging to carbon .
This can be seen from Plate 10 , r 1562*4 A Nos. 5 and 6 , where the strong lines X 1656*9 A and \\lt ; 1561*5 A are common L1560-5 A to both the iron and the cobalt spectrum .
As Eder and Yalenta have given a list of wave-lengths down to X 2173*44 A for the cobalt spark spectrum , which covers the measurements in our work for that region , our results are confined to the wave-lengths below X 2173*44 A , and these are given in Table IX .
The wave-lengths recorded for the spark spectrum by Bloch and Takamine and Nitta are not included in Table IX because there does not appear to be a marked similarity between the arc and the spark spectrum for this metal .

It was very difficult to secure a strong arc , and with currents as high as 16 amperes , only an intermittent arc of moderate intensity was secured .
In the resultant spectrum several lines belonging to carbon showed up prominently .
Omitting these from our list the measurements of the lines apparently due to iron itself are given in Table X. This list does not include wave-lengths of lines which showed up on one or two plates , but with such a small intensity that accurate measurements for them were not possible .
As far as is known this is the first time the vacuum arc spectrum of iron has been measured .
Eder and Yalenta , Bloch , and Takamine and Nitta give measurements in this region for the iron spark spectrum , and their lists contain a large number of wave-lengths .
The spark spectrum , as a whole , differs considerably from the vacuum arc spectrum as obtained in our work .

With a current of 7 amperes on closed circuit , an intense intermittent arc was secured .

i Spectra of various Elements in the Extreme Ultra-violet .
331 for the wave-lengths of this spectrum below X 2000 A are given in Table XI .
The spectrum is remarkable for the large number of sharply defined lines which it included .
Eder and Valenta and Bloch* have measured the spark spectrum of nickel , and give lists which contain a great number of wave-lengths not observed in our work .
This may be largely due to the fact that they used a spark as a source of light while we used a vacuum arc .
In all our plates lines were observed at X 2195*2 A , X 2187*5 A , and X 2218*3 A. Below X 2000 A many new lines were observed and measured .
For the work with nickel it was not possible to secure chemically pure metal .
The samples used for electrodes were of the ordinary commercial quality , and as a consequence , some of the fainter lines recorded in the Table may have been due to impurities .
( 11 ) Cadmium.\#151 ; The results obtained with the cadmium arc below X 2000 A are given in Table XII .
This Table also includes the wave-lengths of the spark spectrum of cadmium as given by Saunders , McLennan and Edwards , f Bloch , and Takamine and Nitta .
The wave-lengths of the cadmium vacuum arc spectrum , as measured by Wolff , are also given .
Between X 2000 A and X1840 A it will be seen by reference to Table XII that practically all of the wave-lengths observed by us with the vacuum arc are included in the wave-lengths given for the spark spectrum by McLennan and Edwards , Bloch , and Takamine and Nitta .
Below X 1840 A the only results recorded are those found by Saunders and by Wolff , and the wave7lengths given by them , with the exception of the last three of Wolff 's , are in good agreement with our measurements .
Our list of wave-lengths , it will be seen , contributes a number of additions to the spectrum of cadmium as hitherto known .
The work with cadmium was done without the gas comparison spectrum .
As a consequence , the measurements are not quite so accurate as the work with the other substances , and may contain a few lines belonging to the secondary gas spectrum .
As far as possible , however , such lines were eliminated by comparing the wave-lengths obtained in the spectrum with the wavelengths of the strong lines in the hydrogen spectrum .

cadmium , and aluminium are well covered by the results for the spark spectrum of these metals , as obtained by previous workers .
2 .
For tin , lead , and thallium , Saunders has given measurements down to X 1700 A , and the results of his work have been found to correspond fairly well with our results .
Below the region covered by Saunders ' work many new lines have been observed and measured .
3 .
The measurements for the vacuum arc spectra of iron , cobalt , nickel and carbon appear to be the first obtained for the arc spectra of these substances in the Schumann region .
For these spectra nearly all the measurements down to X 1850 A as given in our work , are covered by previous work on spark spectra of these metals , but in the region between X 1850 A and X 1400 A several new lines were photographed and measured .
DESCRIPTION OF PLATES .
Plate 7 .
Gives reproductions of photographs of the vacuum spectrograph , showing two views of the same instrument , as taken from different positions .
Plate 8 .
These are reproductions of the spectra obtained for carbon , copper , cadmium , zinc , and aluminium .
To secure them a small current was used in the arc , and , consequently , the spectra include not only the metal lines but also lines due to the secondary spectrum of hydrogen which showed up prominently .
Plate 9 .
Number ( 1 ) is a reproduction of the spectrum obtained from the discharge tube as used in this work .
It shows portions of both the hydrogen and carbon monoxide spectrum as indicated on the plate .
Numbers ( 2-5 ) are reproductions for carbon , copper , zinc , and aluminium , each showing the metal spectrum and the hydrogen spectrum one above the other .
Larger currents wrere used for these than for the a re spectra as shown in Plate 8 , and as a consequence the secondary spectrum of hydrogen is much fainter .
Plate 10 .
These are reproductions of the spectra of thallium , lead , tin , nickel , iron , and cobalt , with the hydrogen spectrum shown in each one .
