( Abstract .
) The memoir deals with the theory of the conditions to which a series of logical class-frequencies is subject if the series is to be self-consistent ; i.e. , if the class-frequencies are to be such as might be observed within one and the same logical universe .
The theory has been dealt with to a limited extent by De Morgan , in his ' Formal Logic ' ( " On the Numerically Definite Syllogism " ) and by Boole , in the ' Laws of Thought ' ( in the chapter entitled " Of Statistical Conditions " ) .
In the present memoir the first section deals with the theory of consistence , by a simple method , up to class-frequencies in five attributes , and a general formula is then obtained , giving the conditions for any case .
In the second part of the paper some illustrations are given of the geometrical representations of the conditions obtained in Part I. In the case of three second-order frequencies ( AB ) , ( AC ) , and ( BC ) , the complete conditions of consistence may be represented by a tetrahedron with its edges truncated .
The first-order frequencies are treated as constant , ( AB ) , ( AC ) , ( BC ) as co-ordinates , and the limits to ( BC ) , for example , are given by the points in which the line drawn through the point ( AB ) ( AC ) parallel to the ( BC)-axis cuts the surface .
The general form of the surface depends on the value of the first-order frequencies .
If ( A)/ ( u ) = ( B)/ ( u ) = ( C)/ ( u ) = i ( u ) being the total frequency , the edges are not truncated and the " congruence-surface " becomes a simple equilateral tetrahedron .
The limits given to ( BC ) in terms of ( AB ) and ( AC ) in this case are shown to correspond to the limits to the correlation coefficient 3 in terms of ri2 and r13 in the case of normal correlation .
The congruence-surface shows very clearly the nature of the approximation towards the syllogism , as conditions of the " universal " type ( all A 's are B , or no A 's are B ) are approached .
One or two illustrations are also given of congruence-surfaces for third-order frequencies , the first- and second-order frequencies being both treated as constants .
In the third part of the paper some numerical examples , and sketches of congruence-surfaces for actual cases , are given , in further illustration of the theory .
