) During experiments upon the permeability of the yeast-cell it was found that , when yeast was immersed in a molar solution of sodium chloride , and allowed to stand at air temperature , the amount of gas produced by autofermentation was considerably greater than that given by a water control .
The production of carbon dioxide by autofermentation of yeast is brought about by the action of at least two enzymes .
The reserve material of the cell , for the most part glycogen , is first converted by a glycogenase into a sugar , which in turn is fermented by zymase with the production of alcohol and carbon dioxide .
As the rate of autofermentation is considerably less than that produced by the same yeast in presence of excess of sugar , it follows that the rate of autofermentation is controlled by the rate of production of sugar within the cell , in other words , by the rate of action of the glycogenase .
An increase in the rate of autofermentation , therefore , indicates greater activity of this enzyme within the cell .
In order to investigate the action of solutions of various salts upon the rate of autofermentation of yeast , this was ascertained by measuring the volume of carbon dioxide evolved during successive intervals of time by means of the apparatus described by Harden , Thompson , and Young ( 1 ) .
The yeast employed was prepared from top-yeast as obtained from the brewery by pressing out the wort in a small hand press , it having been demonstrated ( 2 ) that practically the whole of the interstitial liquid can be removed in this way .
A certain weight of such pressed yeast was carefully weighed into each of the fermentation flasks , and treated with a certain volume of the various liquids under experiment , controls being made with water .
The liquids were saturated with carbon dioxide at 25 ' , the temperature of the water-bath .

In the former case fermentation practically came to an end after six hours , at which time 60 c.c. of gas had been collected as against 31 c.c. from the water control ( Table I ) .
In the latter case evolution of gas continued steadily until , after about 60 hours , the volume of gas was identical with that from the sodium chloride experiment .

Experiments were next made in order to determine the optimum concentration of this substance , which would give a maximum rate of autofermentation at the temperature employed .

Harden and Pain .
Action of Dissolved [ Oct. 17 slight difference is observable in the effect of concentrations ranging from O'7 to 1*1 molar .
Experiments made with other salts showed that the phenomenon described for sodium chloride is a general one for all salts , both of inorganic and organic acids .
The following salts were all found to give positive results .
Chlorides of sodium , potassium , lithium , ammonium , magnesium , calcium , and barium ; sulphates of sodium , potassium , ammonium , and magnesium ; sodium salts of phosphoric , hexosephosphoric , arsenic , acetic , malic , citric , lactic , pyruvic , and glyceric acids .
With the salts of organic acids , the possibility exists that these may themselves be the source of the carbon dioxide .
Neubauer ( 3 ) and Neuberg , Hildesheimer , Tir , and Karczag ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) have , in fact , stated that some races of yeast are capable of producing carbon dioxide from salts of lactic , glyceric , pyruvic , oxalacetie , and many other acids .
As this phenomenon is accompanied by the disappearance of the acid in question , it can readily be distinguished from that which forms the subject of the present paper .
2 .
The Nature of the Effect Produced by Salts on the Autofermentation of Yeast .
It seemed advisable at the outset to ascertain experimentally if the increase in the rate of gas production were actually due to stimulation of the glycogenase , as was to be expected , or of the zymase .
The sugar fermentation of 1 grm. of yeast immersed in molar sodium chloride gave only 1*7 c.c. of carbon dioxide per five minutes , as against 4T c.c. in the case of a water control .
The action of the zymase is therefore inhibited rather than enhanced by this treatment .
The increase in the rate of autofermentation would accordingly seem to result from a more efficient working of the glycogenase .
This might be due to one or more of the following causes:\#151 ; ( 1 ) To some specific action of the salt employed .
( 2 ) To a concentration within the cell by removal of water as a result of plasmolysis .
( 3 ) To removal from the cell of some substance or complex which has an inhibitory or controlling action upon the rate of glycogen fermentation .
( 4 ) To disorganisation of the cell , whereby the factor controlling the access of enzyme to glycogen is in some way modified .
( 5 ) To " hormone " action of the substance on the lines suggested by H. E. and E. E. Armstrong .
( 1 ) Specific Action.\#151 ; In order that a specific action should be exerted , it is essential that the agent should be capable of entering the cell .
As regards 1911 .
] Substances upon the Autofermentation of Yeast .
this question , in an earlier work* the conclusion was reached that most salts are probably not capable of penetrating beyond the outer layers of the cytoplasm .
This would render any specific action upon the enzyme very doubtful .
Moreover , it is improbable that so many different salts should exert a similar effect .
Further , such action , if exerted in the cell , should also be exhibited in the contents after removal from the cell .
The following table shows the result of addition of salt to yeast-juice both in presence and absence of added sugar :\#151 ; Table III.\#151 ; Effect of Sodium Chloride upon Fermentation by Yeast-juice .

These numbers prove that the autofermentation is diminished in practically the same proportion as the sugar fermentation , and they afford no evidence of acceleration of the action of the glycogenase .
Very similar results were obtained with zymin .

This , however , does not exclude the possibility that certain substances which accelerate the action of yeast-juice and zymin may also exert a specific effect upon the autofermentation .
( 2 ) Plasmolysis of the Cell.\#151 ; It has been demonstrated by Pain that with molar concentration of sodium chloride strong plasmolysis occurs , while decimolar solution produces no such result .
The effect of these concentrations upon the autofermentation of yeast is shown in the following table:\#151 ; VOL. LXXXIV.\#151 ; B. * Pain , loc. cit. 452 Messrs. Harden and Pain .

Experiments were , therefore , made to determine the effect of iso-osmotic solutions of various substances , which had all been found to produce plasmolysis in a similar manner to sodium chloride .
The osmotic coefficients were taken from the tables given in Pfeffer 's 'Physiology of Plants , ' and in some cases the freezing points of the solutions were determined .

In order to obtain convincing proof of this , it was necessary to find some OLAR CHLORIDE M 454 Messrs. Harden and Pain .
Action of Dissolved [ Oct. 17 , substance which would produce no plasmolysis of yeast even in concentrated solution , and to show that it would not cause acceleration .
In earlier experiments urea was found to produce no plasmolysis at molar concentration .
The determination of the effect of this substance upon the rate of autofermentation was therefore of first importance .
In one experiment molar urea was compared with molar sodium chloride and water .
The urea was found to be without influence , as shown in the curves ( p. 453 ) .
In the following experiment ( No. 85 ) the effects of isotonic solutions of urea , sodium chloride , and potassium nitrate were compared .

The fact that plasmolysis of the cells is not produced by urea solutions would seem to indicate that this substance can penetrate freely through the cytoplasm of the yeast cell .
An experiment was made to investigate this point , the method described by Paine ( 2 ) being employed ; 100 grm. of yeast were suspended in 100 grm. of molar urea solution , allowed to stand 20 hours at a temperature approximating to zero , and the distribution of urea determined ( Table IX ) .
Urea is thus seen to penetrate readily into the cells , the factor lv representing the coefficient of diffusion being of the same order as that obtained for alcohol , namely , 0'85 to 0'87 .
Although urea enters the cells it is without influence upon the rate of autofermentation .

In order to investigate this 10 grm. of pressed yeast which had been passed through a 3 mm. sieve were placed in a fermentation flask and subjected to a current of air for 20 minutes .
This flask and a control were then connected with the gas-measuring apparatus and warmed in the water-bath at 25 ' .
The rate of autofermentation was considerably increased by this simple method of removing water .

( 3 ) The possibility of the removal from the cell of some inhibitory or controlling substance during plasmolysis is negatived by these last experiments , wherein the increase of autofermentation was produced under conditions which render such removal impossible unless the substance be a volatile liquid .
( 4 ) The disorganisation of the cell , possibly by the disintegration of a material membrane or network , has been adduced as the cause of some of the effects of anaesthetics on the living cell [ Overton ( 7 ) , Lepeschkin ( 8 ) , Hans Meyer ( 9 ) ] , and it is not impossible that in certain instances this phenomenon plays some part in the acceleration of the autofermentation of yeast .
This possibility is specially present in the case of a substance like toluene , which exerts an anaesthetic effect upon yeast .
The following experiment is typical of many ; 10 grm. yeast were mixed with ( a ) 25 c.c. water , ( b ) 25 c.c. water and 5 c.c. toluene , well shaken , and incubated at 25':\#151 ; Table XII.\#151 ; Effect of Toluene on the Autofermentation of Yeast .

The effect is not due to a specific action on the enzymes , since toluene has either no effect or a slight inhibitory effect on the autofermentation of yeast-juice , as is shown by the following result : 25 c.c. of yeast-juice in three hours gave 40'3 c.c. of C02 ; in presence of 5 c.c. of* toluene the same volume of yeast-juice gave 34 c.c. It is , however , not impossible that this result may be explicable on the ground of plasmolysis .
In spite of the small solubility of toluene in water a considerable degree of plasmolysis is observed when yeast is shaken with water and excess of toluene .
Further experiments on this point are in progress .
( 5 ) With regard to the possibility that the foregoing changes may be ultimately due to the action of hormones in the manner suggested by H. E. and E. E. Armstrong ( 7 ) no very definite conclusion can be drawn .
The action of toluene on yeast undoubtedly presents the closest analogy to that which it exerts on the Aucuba leaf , and it cannot be denied that the various salts employed do penetrate at all events into the outer layers of the yeast cell .
Several of the phenomena , however , appeared to be difficult to explain in this way , especially the lack of action of a substance like urea , which penetrates the cell , and the causation of the phenomenon by simple drying .
In any case the acceleration caused by salts is accompanied by concentration of the cell contents , so that dilution cannot in these instances be the effective cause , as suggested by Armstrong* for the phenomenon observed by him .

Effect of Alcohol on Autofermentation .
The plasmolysing effect on yeast of solutions of alcohol was found to be practically absent from concentrations up to 10 per cent , ( rather more than * Loc .
cit. 458 Messrs. Harden and Pain .
Action of Dissolved [ Oct. 17 twice molar ) , but above this concentration plasmolysis became well marked .
The influence of alcohol solutions on the autofermentation of yeast is shown by the following curves , which apply to 10 grm. of yeast:\#151 ; 5 TlMC IN lO HOURS 15 20 Concentrations of alcohol which plasmolyse the cells produce a considerable increase in the rate of autofermentation .
With 20 per cent , the action of the enzyme almost came to an end after about seven hours , at which time 147 c.c. of gas had been collected as against 52 c.c. from the water control .
The weaker concentrations of alcohol at first produced an inhibitory effect upon the rate .
After a short time , however , the rate increased , and then slightly exceeded that of the water control .
Eventually , after eight days , the volume of gas yielded from each , with the exception of that in presence of 20 per cent , alcohol , was practically identical and approximately equal to 200 c.c. 1911 .
] Substances upon the Autofermentation of Yeast .
The behaviour of alcohol , therefore , is in accord with that of urea , although the effect is not quite so simple .
Summary .
1 .
All dissolved substances which plasmolyse the yeast-cell also cause a large increase in the rate of autofermentation .
2 .
Substances such as urea , which even in concentrated solution do not produce plasmolysis , have no accelerating effect .
3 .
Toluene produces a similar effect to concentrated salt solutions .
4 .
The effect produced by salts is probably a direct result of the concentration of the cell contents due to plasmolysis , but in the case of toluene it is possible that some other factor ( such as disorganisation of the cell , or hormone action ) is concerned .
