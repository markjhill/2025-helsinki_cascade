) One of the most remarkable examples of spectrum lines which are common in celestial bodies , but which have hitherto resisted all attempts to reproduce them in the laboratory , is afforded by the higher members of the Balmer series of hydrogen .
As many as 29 members of this series have been observed by Dyson* and Evershedf in the chromosphere of the sun , but the greatest number observed in the laboratory by AmesJ and by Cornu was only 13 , and the last of these were of such a character that it would hardly have been possible to record them without a previous knowledge of their localisation .
In many respects the failure to reproduce in the laboratory lines whose chemical origin is known , and which are so prominent in celestial spectra , is even more conspicuous than in the case of the nebular and coronal lines , which cannot yet be referred to any atom known in chemistry , and which may be due to substances which do not , or perhaps cannot , exist under terrestrial conditions .
A further interest has been added to the problem by the important theoretical wrork of Bohr , whose theory of the production of the Balmer series requires that the space occupied by a hydrogen atom , in the process of emitting lines of the higher members of the Balmer series , is such that these radiations cannot be expected to be visible except under conditions of extremely low pressure .
Bohr has pointed out that this view is consistent with the appearance of the lines in celestial spectra , and our inability to produce them under the conditions ordinarily obtaining in the laboratory .
Living and DewarS have found that in a mixture of the more volatile gases of the atmosphere , consisting mainly of neon and helium ' and containing hydrogen , the Balmer series could be traced as far as the ninth member ; and in a recent investigation ] !
we have made a quantitative comparison of the distribution of intensity in the earlier members of the series in hydrogen , and in neon containing hydrogen as an impurity .
This observation of Living and Dewar is remarkable , but we have recently found that similar results can be obtained in helium containing hydrogen at pressures so great * ' Roy .

Qualitative Experiments .
Vacuum tubes of the H type were filled with pure helium at a pressure of 41 mm. of mercury in the usual manner by heating powdered thorianite in a silica side-tube , and allowing the gases evolved to pass into the exhausted tube through a tube containing pieces of fused caustic potash and a U-tube containing charcoal , which was cooled in a vessel containing liquid air .
The electrodes of the vacuum tube had not been completely cleared of hydrogen , and when the helium was admitted , a fresh evolution of hydrogen from the electrodes took place .
The partial pressure of the hydrogen thus liberated must have been very small , and was , in fact , scarcely noticeable on the U-tube containing mercury which served as a pressure gauge , and which showed a pressure of 41 mm. of mercury .
At this pressure , however , the spectrum of hydrogen predominated and far surpassed the helium lines in brilliance .
In another series of tubes , which were filled in a similar way , but which contained helium at a pressure less than 1 mm. of mercury , and into which a larger quantity of hydrogen had been admitted by heating a palladium tube connected with the circuit in a Bunsen burner , and which therefore contained a far greater proportion of hydrogen , the helium spectrum was predominant .
The spectra obtained with these tubes at 41 mm. pressure were somewhat surprising .
The spectrum was first photographed with a small quartz spectrograph , but the results were disappointing , owing to the fact that in the region more refrangible than about 3850 A the individual lines were to a great extent masked by a continuous spectrum .
A higher dispersion being desirable , the spectrum was photographed with a concave grating spectrograph having a grating of 4 feet radius of curvature and ruled with 20,000 lines to the inch .
With this instrument the continuous spectrum was less troublesome , and 12 members of the Balmer series could be seen on the plate .
The lines were surprisingly sharp ; the last member observed , of wave-length 3722 A , was very faint , but there was no doubt as to its presence .
In this region of the spectrum some of the hydrogen lines might be confused with certain of the higher members of the helium series .
In our experiments the helium spectrum was weak in comparison with the hydrogen spectrum , but confusion might be suspected in the case of the hydrogen lines of wave-lengths 3770*7 and 3734*15 A , the wave-lengths of the helium lines in question being 3770*72 A ( int .
1 ) , and the pair 3733*14 and 3733*00 A both of int .
1 , the wavelengths and intensities being those of Bunge and Paschen .
It would be Dr. T. R. Merton and Prof. J. W. Nicholson .
possible for the hydrogen line at 373415 A to be confused with and enhanced by the helium pair at 3733 A , since the preceding member in the helium series at 3868 A appears to be present on the plate , but the hydrogen line at 3770-7 A cannot be affected by the helium line of the same wave-length , since the preceding line in the helium series is not visible .
At first sight it might appear that under these conditions there was a transfer of energy to the higher members of the series , but the nebulous character of these lines as they appear in pure hydrogen suggests that this may not be the case , but that the energy content of the lines as distinct from the intensity at the maximum may be the same , and that their visibility under these conditions may be due io the fact that the energy is concentrated between a narrow range of wave-lengths , instead of being distributed through a broadened line whose apparent intensity is in consequence vanishingly small .
Ames , * referring to the higher members of the series , states that " these lines were the only nebulous lines in the spectrum , but they were sometimes so faint as to escape notice until looked for .
" Quantitative Experiments .
To obtain further evidence on this point we have made quantitative experiments with a view to determining the distribution of intensity in the lines of the Balmer series under different conditions .
These quantitative observations have been necessarily confined to the earlier members of the series , but the conclusion is probably justified that the phenomena which they exhibit will be continued by the members of higher term-number .
For this purpose we have compared the spectra of four vacuum tubes , which will be referred to by the letters A , B , C , and D. A contained water-vapour and was connected to a small bulb containing a few pieces of anhydrous calcium chloride and soda lime .
It may be mentioned that such tubes are very convenient on account of their permanence , when the earlier members of the Balmer series are required ( comparatively free from the secondary hydrogen spectrum ) , the calcium chloride aftd soda lime acting as a kind of reservoir of water-vapour at a low pressure .
At the time this tube was filled it was sealed off at a pressure of about 7 mm. of mercury .
The precise pressure of water-vapour in the tube while it was in use was not known , but it may be safely assumed to have been between 5 and 10 mm. of mercury .
B was a tube containing pure hydrogen at a pressure less than 1 mm. C and D have been described above , the former containing helium with hydrogen at a pressure less than 1 mm. , and the latter helium with a small quantity of hydrogen at 41 mm. pressure .

115 The method of determining the relative photographic intensities has been identical with that adopted in previous investigations ( loc. in which a wedge of neutral-tinted glass was set in front ot the slit of the spectiograph , and the photographic intensities determined from the " heights " of the lines on the plate .
The photographic intensity of a line of wave-length X is defined by logio-1 ( 4 \#151 ; ) according to the theory previously given , where hx is its height as shown on the enlarged photograph , whose magnification is m , the change of density per millimetre of the wedge at wave-length X being denoted by cl\ .
Absolute intensities of any line photographed on the same plate are proportional to the photographic intensities defined in this manner , and the photographic intensities thus form a sufficient basis for comparison of " the behaviour of lines in the same spectrum , relatively to one another , when produced under different conditions of electrical excitation .
The wedge was the same as that used in the work described in one of our previous communications { loc. cit- .
) , in which we substituted the method of calibration of density per millimetre for that of density at the thick end of the wedge , previously adopted.* The heights of the Balmer series lines on the enlarged photograph , with the consequent calculation of their photographic intensities , are given in the subjoined tables .
Owing to a small error in the adjustments in the process of enlargement , the values of m were not absolutely identical , the respective values being mA = 2*345 , mB = 2*337 , mc = 2*326 , and mD = 2*320 .

For convenience of discussion , it is desirable to reduce all the values of the photographic intensities to a uniform standard .
This is given in Table III , on the basis of an arbitrary intensity of 100 for Ha .

No exact investigation of the intensities of the hydrogen lines in water-vapour has apparently been made hitherto , and a comparison of Plates A and B gives interesting quantitative data in this connection .
Evidently , in comparison with the spectrum of pure hydrogen , Plate B , there is a reduction of intensity in the 'lines from water-vapour , which increases in a regular manner towards the violet end of the spectrum .
In the present instance , with Ha of the same intensity in both cases , Hp is reduced almost precisely in the ratio 1/ 2 , Hv in the ratio 1/ 3 , and Hs in the ratio 1/ 4 .
The actual numbers are no doubt accidental , and dependent on experimental conditions such as the pressure , but the general phenomenon is obviously regular and capable of this simple statement .
Another very prominent feature of this comparison is the remarkable suppression of the secondary spectrum of hydrogen in water-vapour .
This is of course well known to occur , but its magnitude has never been measured Note on the Intensity Decrement in the Series .
117 Plate B shows this spectrum very strongly , but on Plate A , from water-vapour , only a few of the stronger lines of the secondary spectrum appear , and these are much reduced in intensity relative to the series spectrum .
There are visible on the plate from water-vapour the lines of wave-length XX 6122 , 6080 , 6052 , 6018 , 5976,5932 , 5884-5888 , 5813 , 4634 , and 4580 A. We have not , however , thought it desirable in this communication to enter into a quantitative discussion of this phenomenon .
The reduction appears to be more or less uniform in order of magnitude throughout the secondary spectrum , but it exhibits selective effects , of which an example is afforded by the two strongest lines of wave-lengths 6018*5 and 4634 A ( the latter is double ) .
Their heights are reduced respectively from 8'5 mm. and 8*8 mm. to 2*8 mm. and 2*5 mm. , the values of being 0*355 and 0444 , and the magnification 2*3 .
We find that the photographic intensities are reduced in water-vapour in the ratios 1 / 10*2 and 1/ 13*2 , respectively , showing the presence of a definite selective action , while Ha is only reduced in the ratio 2/ 3 .
Their reduction-ratios relative to Ha are therefore 6*8 for X6018*5 , and 8*8 for X4634 .
These give sufficient data as to the order of magnitude of the effect .
Owing to the great difference in pressure in the two tubes , it must be emphasised that our results refer to this particular case , for the dependence of the water-vapour spectrum on the pressure has not been investigated in a quantitative manner .
The Hydroyen Spectrum.in Helium at 41 Pressure .
It has already been pointed out that although in the tubes which were filled with helium at 41 mm. pressure , the hydrogen consisted only of the small amount which came out of the electrodes when a heavy discharge was passed through the tubes , the spectrum of hydrogen was nevertheless predominant , that of helium being relatively very weak .
Changes in the distribution ot intensity were to be expected under these wholly new conditions , and , in fact , those which occur are somewhat striking .
By comparison of Plates B and D , as exhibited in Table III , where the intensity of Ha has been taken as 100 in each case , we see that in helium at the high pressure H ) , is reduced roughly in the ratio 3/ 4 , as against 2/ 5 for Hv , 1/ 4 for H$ , and 2/ 13 for He , showing a progressive reduction of a lapid kind towards the violet end of the spectrum .
There is no transfer of energy to the shorter wave-lengths , but an actual transfer in the opposite direction .
It therefore seems certain that in our tubes at 41 mm. pressure the observation of the higher members of the series depends on the fact that their low intensity , relative to that in tubes at a lower pressure containing pine hydrogen , is more than compensated for by the fact that they do not 118 Note on the Intensity Decrement the Series .
suffer the same degree of broadening under these conditions .
This opens up an interesting field for enquiry , for if the broadening ( of this type ) is due to the electric field of neighbouring charged atoms , which previous investigations have , we believe , established , it would appear that the reduction of the broadening in helium may perhaps afford some clue as to the structure , from certain points of view , of the helium atom .
The transfer of energy to members of lower term-number in water-vapour at 5 to 10 mm. pressure , and in helium at 41 mm. pressure , would appear to accord with the theory of Bohr , which demands the existence , for the production of the higher members , of a considerable number of greatly enlarged atoms , but this would appear to be outweighed by the fact that members of the series having a term-number as high as m = 14 are visible at all such pressures .
A precise estimate of the relative intensity which any line should have on this theory is not possible , on the sole basis of the assumptions at present inherent in the theory .
But some simple considerations , based on the degree of packing of the atoms in relation to the diameter of Bohr 's hydrogen atom in its various stationary states , seem to require further assumptions which we cannot regard as reasonable .
Taking the value of N , the number of atoms in a cubic centimetre of gas at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. pressure , as 2'75xl019 , we have ^i5 ' c. x 4i mm. pressure = 1'41 x 1018 .
Thus the mean distance apart of the atoms in our tubes is 21/ 6 x 17"1/ 3 or 1'OxlO-6 .
Now the normal diameter of Bohr 's hydrogen atom ( t = 1 ) is 1*06 x 10~6 cm .
, its diameter in the various stationary states being 106 x 10-8 ( l2 , 22 , 32 , ... r2 ... ) , where t takes a series of integral values , such that , when a line of the spectrum v = B(l/ n2\#151 ; 1/ t22 ) is developed , the electron is passing from the state defined by t2 to that defined by tx .
For the 12th member of the Balmer series , t2 = 14 , ti = 2 .
The presence of this line thus requires the existence of the state r2 = 14 in a sufficient number of atoms , and their diameters when in this state are d = 1*6 x 10_8x 196 = 2D8 x 10~6 .
The diameters are therefore larger than the mean distance apart of the surrounding helium atoms , in the ratio of about two to unity .
Even for the 10th member of the Balmer series , which is very definitely shown on our plates , the diameter of the atom , according to Bohr 's theory , would be 1'53 x 10-6 , or about 1-| times the mean separation of the atoms .
Even if an atom could emit such radiations when in actual contact with another atom , a possibility which could hardly be entertained seriously , the chance of its being able to do so must be vanishingly small , and it cannot be assumed that an atom will expand into the state r = 14 or more , whenever it occupies a sufficiently isolated position to do so , for in this case the hydrogen spectrum from such i Researches on the Chemistry of Coal .
119 attenuated sources as the nebulae might reasonably be expected to be concentrated near the limit of the series .
In the absence of any theory or experimental data which would give a clue to the energy distribution from a source of infinite attenuation , even an approximate estimate of the probable relative intensities of the higher members under the conditions of our experiments is impossible , but , from the available evidence , we feel justified in concluding that assumptions of a far-reaching character will be needed to explain our results in the light of Bohr 's theory .
We can at present offer no explanation for the phenomena observed ; we fear that they constitute a fresh difficulty of some importance in the construction of any theory of the genesis of spectra .

) Introduction .
The experiments recorded in this paper are part of a research carried out in the Department of Chemical Technology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology , at the instance of the British Association Fuel Economy Committee , with the double object of clearing up certain discrepancies in the work of previous investigators and of gaining further knowledge of the chief types of constituents contained in the coal substance .
One of the authors having recently reviewed at some length the present state of science with regard to the composition of coal in his monograph on " Coal and its Scientific Uses " ( pp. 35 to 163 inclusive ) there is no need to treat of the matter again at any great length here .
Special attention may , however , be drawn to the summarised statements given on pp. Ill to 112 and 124 to 128 ( inclusive ) of that monograph concerning the results and views of previous workers and the present state of our knowledge with regard to the primary action of heat upon coal .
There is now general agreement amongst chemists that the constituents of the coal substance may be regarded as consisting principally of three distinct types derived respectively from the ligno-celluloses , resins , and proteins contained in the vegetable dlbrisfrom which the coal originated .
