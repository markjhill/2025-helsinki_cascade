( Abstract .
) In the preceding memoirs on the Calculus of Symbols , systems have been constructed for the multiplication and division of noln-commutative symbols subject to certain laws of combination ; and these systems suffice for linear differential equations .
But when we enter upon the conisideration of nonlinear equations , we see at once that these methods do not apply .
it becomes necessary to invent some fresh mode of calculation , and a new notation , in order to bring nion-linear functions into a condition which admits of treatment by symbolical algebra .
This is the object of the followinD memoir .
Professor Boole has given , in his ' Treatise on Differential Equations , ' a method due to M. Sarrus , by which we ascertain whether a given non-linear function is a complete differential .
This method , as will be seen by anyone who will refer to Professor Boole 's treatise , is equivalent to finding the conditions that a non-linear function may be externally divisible by the symbol of differelntiation .
In the following paper I have given a notation by which I obtain the actual expressions for those conditions , and for the symbolical remainders arising in the course of the division , and have extended my investigations to ascertaining the results of the symbolical division of non-linear functions by linear functions of the symbol of differentiation .
