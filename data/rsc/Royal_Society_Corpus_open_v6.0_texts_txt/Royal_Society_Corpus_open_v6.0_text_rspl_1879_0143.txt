[ May 27 may therefore be safely regarded as the measure of the total nitroeen and as forming 90 per cent , of it .
\#174 ; ' Note.-An exception to this , of course , is found in the rare cases of acute yellow atrophy of the liver , bat even in these cases it is doubtful whether the replacement of the urea by leucin and tyrosin is a con stant phenomenon .
In one case , * which clinically presented the features of acute atrophy of the liver , and in which , post the liver was found in the condition of acute fatty atrophy , the urea was still normally formed , leucin and tyrosin being absent .

Y. " On the Amount of Nitrogen excreted in the Urine by Man at Rest .

, and W. J. RUSSELL , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received May 6 , 1880 .
Two methods of investigation have been adopted in inquiries of this kind .
The first by stopping the ingestion of nitrogen , either by absolute deprivation of food , i.e. , by starvation , or by the giving of non-nitrogenous food .
The second by reducing the ordinary diet to the lowest possible 'limit compatible with health .
To the first objection may be made that the experiments are violent , and cannot be long maintained , and that they subject the body to most abnormal conditions .
Such violence to the ordinary chemistry of the body produces its evidence in the excretions .
The nitrogen in the urine under these circumstances varying even more irregularly and widely than under normal conditions , and the short possible duration of the experiments rendering the conclusions drawn , from the small number of Observations , unsatisfactory .
From all these objections the second course of investigation is free , no violence is done to the body , and the observations may be prolonged * " Pathol .

And here two courses are open , both of which lead in the same direction , though starting from opposite sides .
The one which consists in taking , as Playfair and Edward Smith have done , the minimum diets upon which life has been sustained , and estimating in them the amount of nitrogen present .
The other in reducing the diet to the lowest possible limit until physiological equilibrium is established , and then estimating in the urine the amount of nitrogen excreted .
It is this latter course which we have followed .
The three cases we have examined were patients suffering from the same affection , viz. , aneurism , a disease which produces mechanical rather than constitutional symptoms , and in these cases , so long as the treatment was carried on , produced no symptoms at all , so that for all practical purposes the patients may be regarded as healthy men .
They were all placed under the conditions of the most absolute rest , not being allowed to sit up in bed , or even indeed to feed themselves .
Their diet was then reduced till it was found that the health was suffering , and then increased until a condition was reached , which may be called one of " clinical equilibrium , " when the health so far as could be determined clinically was perfect .
The condition of clinical equilibrium being reached , the amount of nitrogen in the food was determined by direct analysis .
In two of the cases the diet consisted of ten ounces of solids and ten ounces of liquids , distributed as follows : Meat ... .
4 ozs .
Bread Potatoes ... .
... .
2 " Butter 1 " 10 ozs .
Water ... ... 4 ozs .
Wine ... ... ... ... 3 " Teaf ... ... ... . .
3 " 10 ozs .
By calculation from Barkes ' tables , this should yield 6*3 grms. of nitrogen .
Analysis gave a somewhat higher number : in the first determination 7*07 , and in the second 6*95 .
Cf .
Tables IV and V. In the third case the diet was 8 \#169 ; zs .
of solids and 8 ozs .
of liquids , distributed in the same proportion .
This by calculation from the preceding analysis should give about 5*6 grms. \#169 ; f nitrogen .
The analysis of the urine was made in the way described in the preceding paper .
The tables give the result of 17 determinations .
Comparing now the amount of nitrogen ingested in the food , with the amount obtained from the urine , - we find ( Table V ) :\#151 ; Nitrogen ingested .

[ May 27 In all the cases the amount in the urine is in slight excess of that in the food , so that we may fairly regard all the nitrogen here obtained as representing tissue waste , for there was no surplus in the food to increase the amount in the urine .
We obtain as the mean of these three cases 7'87 , or approximately 8 grms. , which we therefore are justified in regarding as the minimum amount of nitrogen a healthy adult man excretes per diem .
This is equivalent to 17 grms. , or 260 grains of urea .
The weights of the patients could not of course be determined , hut the first two weighed it is supposed about 140 lbs. , the third about 130 lbs. , at the time of the observations , which was in each case after the dieting had lasted already three or four weeks , the total durations of the treatment being about ten weeks .
It is interesting to compare with these observations the results obtained by the other methods of the investigation above referred to .
*1 .
Rank repeated upon man the experiments which Bischoff and Yoit had conducted upon the dog , and among them are two series of observations which illustrate the subject at present under consideration .
In the first no food at all was given , and the patients were kept at rest .
In one case 8 grms. of nitrogen were passed , in a second 10 , and in a third 8 " 6 .
In a fourth case the amount was as low as 6j\ And in another series of observations upon himself , Rank found the amount passed in two starvation days to be 8 and 8'6 grms. Nicholson made three estimations in the case of starving prisoners , and found as the mean of three days 8'6 grms J. Many other observers have noticed the rapid fall in the amount of nitrogen excreted during starvation .

) But the short duration of these experiments makes it probable that the minimum was not reached .
We have then 8 grms. as the mean of the only reliable determination at our command of the nitrogen excreted in the urine during starvation .

1 hi professor Playfair attacked the question from another side , by collecting from various sources the minimum diets upon which |man could live , and to which he gave the name of subsistence diets , and by calculation the amount of nitrogen contained in them .
This method gave him as a mean 9'2 grms. , but his patients were none of them at absolute rest , but were performing during the day a certain amount of work.f Edward Smith in the same way by calculation from the diets of the spinners during the cotton famine found a somewhat larger amount of nitrogen ( 12 grins .
) , J which agrees with the amount of nitrogen contained in Playfair s second class of small diets , but in all these cases the effect of muscular exertion is not eliminated .

Unruh gives a series of three observations upon hospital patients kept at rest , and placed upon a restricted diet .
Unfoi'tunately he gives little description of the diet , except that it was fever diet , and consisted of beef-tea or broth , with an egg or two .
In the first , a case of cancerous obstruction , the amount of nitrogen was 8 grms. ( 17*5 urea ) .
But this case is not altogether satisfactory from the amount of wasting accompanying this disease .
The other two were cases of syphilis placed upon fever diet , and kept at rest for the sake of the experiments ; the first passed 8 6 grms. ( 18'6 urea ) , the second 7'5 grms. ( 16*2 urea ) .
The mean of these three cases is 8 grms. ( 17*5 urea ) .
The general results of the various series of observations may be roughly tabulated thus :\#151 ; I. Starvation .
8 grms. II .
Non-nitrogenous food .
8 grms. III .
Subsistence diet .
9 grms. IY .
Insufficient diet .
8 grms. Y. Clinical equilibrium .
8 grms. A remarkable coincidence , considering the variety of the methods employed , and the different conditions under which the determinations were made .
We may therefore conclude that the minimum amount of nitrogen excreted by a healthy adult man is on the average 8 grms. in the 24 hours , this being equivalent to 17*5 grms. , or to 260 grains of urea .
