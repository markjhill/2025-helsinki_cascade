" A Meteorological Journal for 1840 , kept at Allenheads , Northumberland , with a few remarks on the Rain-gauge .
" By the Rev. W. Walton , F.R.S. The author shows that if the mouth of a rain-gauge be placed in any plane which is not perfectly horizontal , the results will be liable to inaccuracy , whatever may be the direction in which the rain falls .
He thinks that , on many occasions , the drops of rain diminish in their size during their descent on entering warmer regions of the atmosphere , so as finally to disappear .
