John Martyn M. D. F. R. S. &amp;c. to the President , concerning the same .
SIR , Chelsea , March 14 .
1749 .
IONCE more trouble you with the Mention of an Earthquake , which was felt here on Thursday the 8th instant , at about 5 half Read March 15 .
half an Hour after 5 in the Morning .
It was much stronger than that which happened in February ; two great Shocks being felt presently after each other .
Those who were out of Doors felt the Ground shake under them very sensibly ; whereas , in the former , few were sensible of the Shock , except those who were in Houses .
I do not hear of any Mischief done by it in this Neighbourhood ; neither can I learn that it extended farther Westward than the former .
I am very well assured , that it was strongly felt at Fulham , and at Turnham-Green .
Several were sensible of a smaller Shock about 3 the same Morning ; and some talk of unusual Appearances in the Air .
But this last Circumstance seems not very well attested .
For my own part , I looked out of my Chamber-Window to the S. W. at a Quarter after 5 , and only perceived it to be a grey Morning , such as usually predicts a fine Day .
I am , Sir , with the greatest Respect , Your most humble Servant , John Martyn .
