A paper , entitled , " On the Organic Tissues in the bony structure of the Corallidae .
" By J. S. Bowerbank , Esq. , F.G.S. , communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. F.R.S. , was resumed and concluded .
The author submitted small portions of nearly seventy species of bony corals to the action of diluted nitric acid , and thus obtained their animal tissue , freed from calcareous matter , and floating on the surface of the fluid in the form of a delicate flocculent mass .
By the aid of the microscope , this mass was found to be pervaded by a complex reticulated vascular tissue , presenting numerous ramifications and anastomoses , with lateral branches terminating in closed extremities .
There were also found , interspersed among these , another set of tubes , of larger diameter than the former , and provided , in many places , with valves ; the branches from these larger vessels occasionally terminate in ovoid bodies , having the appearance of gemmules or incipient polypes .
In other cases , masses of still larger size , of a more spherical shape , and of a brown colour , were observed attached to the membrane , and connected with each other by a beautiful network of moniliform fibres .
Numerous siliceous spicula , pointed at both extremities and exceed ?
ingly minute , were discovered in the membranous structure of several corals ; and also other spicula of larger size , terminated at one extremity in a point , and at the other in a spherical head ; a form bearing a striking resemblance to that of a common brass pin .
Besides these spicula , the author noticed in these membranous tissues a vast number of minute bodies , which he regards as identi ?
cal with the nuclei of Mr. Robert Brown , or the cytoblasts of Schleiden .
