" Experiments on the Vibration of the Pendulum .
" By W. J. Frodsham .
Communicated by Francis Beaufort , Capt. R.N. , F.R.S. The object of this paper is to show the advantages that may result from attaching to the top of the pendulum a brass tube , which the author terms " an isochronal piece , " about five inches in length , fitting the pendulum very nicely , and slit so as to form a spring for about an inch at the bottom , sliding rather stiffly on the rod , so that its position , and consequently its influence on the action of the pendulum , may be varied at pleasure ; and that unequal arcs of vibra ?
tion may be made to correspond to equal intervals of time .
