XII .
An Account of the Discovery of the Remains of a City under-ground , near Naples ; communicated to the ROYAL SOCIETY by William Sloane , Esq ; F. R. S. AT Resina , about four Miles from Naples , under the Mountain , within half a Mile of the Seaside , there is a Well in a poor Man 's Yard , down which about 30 Yards there is a Hole , which some People have the Curiosity to creep into , and may afterwards creep a good way under-ground , and with Lights find Foundations of Houses and Streets , which , by some it is said , was in the Time of the Romans a City called Aretina , others say Port Hercules , where the Romans usually embarked from for Africa .
I have seen the Well , which is deep , and a good Depth of Water at the Bottom , that I never cared to venture down , being heavy , and the Ropes bad .
This City , it is thought , was overwhelmed by an Eruption of the Mountain Vesuvius , not sunk by Earthquakes , as were Cuma , Baia , Trepergola , &amp;c. Naples , March 7 .
1731-2 .
Signed , William Hammond .
