The Cabeiron Thebes .
My observations taken in 1892 were confirmed , and consequently the doubt which a correspondent at Athens had thrown upon the orientation of that temple* may be dismissed .
Girgenti .
For the orientations of the temples at Girgenti , t I had relied on some observations taken in 1885 by means of the sun 's shadow and a plumb line , checked by data , given by various authorities .
This year , in the case of three of the temples , I was able to remeasure them by solar observation with a theodolite , and also to obtain correctly the altitude of the eastern horizon , as seen from each of the temples , with the following results , viz.:\#151 ; The orientation angle of the Temple of Juno should be 262 ' 36 ' instead of 264 ' , and the sun 's altitude when surmounting the eastern horizon should be 1 ' 45 ' instead of 0 ' 35 ' .
The elements as recomputed are as follows , viz.:\#151 ; Girgenti .

of the city 's prosperity .
If the sun 's depression had been taken at 11 ' , the date would have been about 440 B.C. and if at 12 ' about 540 .
The depression at 11 ' 30 ' seems to accord best with the practice used in temples of comparatively late foundation.* The Temple of Hercules .
I found that the orientation angle of this temple agreed very closely with that previously given , but that the eastern horizon was higher , namely , 2 ' instead of 0 ' 35 ' ; but if the solar depression be changed from 11 ' to 11 ' 54 ' , the result of the calculation will be the same , and the stellar elements and the date will remain unaltered .
The Olympieium .
I found that the orientation angle of the temple of Jupiter should be increased from 257 ' 35 ' to 258 ' 44 ' , whilst the altitude of the eastern horizon has to be increased from 0 ' 35 to 1 55 .
This will neutralize the effect of the alteration of the amplitude , and the stellar elements and the date ( 430 B.C. ) will remain unaltered .
I obtained one additional example from an ancient site in Greece , namely , the Temple of Neptune at Calauria in the Isle of Poros j the scene of the last days of Demosthenes , who had chosen it for his place of exile on account of its commanding a view of his much loved Athens from the lofty ridge on which the temple was built .

which the years of their foundation are at least approximately known historically , and which were shown to be conformable to the general rule , but required a deeper depression of the sun , than was sufficient for the distinct vision of the heliacal star .
Of five of these examples I had not given the elements , viz.:\#151 ; The Theseum , the later Erechtheum , the later Temples of Bacchus and Jupiter at Athens , and the great temple at Ephesus , as rebuilt after the fire .
As the cases of some of these are very interesting in an archaeological point of view , I here supply the elements in the same form as before .
With respect to the temple of Theseus at Athens , it appears to be possible , proceeding from the approximate date given by the orientation work , to arrive at a much closer determination of the probable exact year of the foundation ( or perhaps dedication ) of the temple , and at the same time to confirm the traditional name of the temple , which has been much disputed .
What I have called the traditional view is , that the temple was built under the influence of Cimon , who during his supremacy at Athens , in the year 469 or 468 B.C. , brought from the Isle of Scyros the supposed relics of Theseus .
The bones of the hero were then interred at Athens with great solemnity , and a temple or heroum was built over the grave and an annual celebration was appointed , under the name Thesea ; which lasted two or three days and commenced on the seventh day of the month named Pyane-psion , a month which on the whole agrees with our October , but ( owing to the practice at Athens of commencing the year with the new moon which occurred on or next after the summer solstice ) , when we compare the two calendars , and reckon the days of the month together , we find that they only agree together at intervals of 19 years\#151 ; the 374 On the Orientation of Greek Temples .
Metonic cycle , It is therefore necessary to consult lunar tables to see in what year or years 7 Pyanepsion would agree with October 6 , and the nearer to 470 b.c. this can be , the better it would also agree with the orientation date .
The first Attic month was Hecatombaion having thirty days , in general agreement with July .
Then Metageitnion having twenty-nine days , in .
general agreement with August .
Then Boedromion having thirty days , in general agreement with September .
After which Pyanepsion .
The first three months with seven days of Pyanepsion numbers ninety-six days .
Twenty-nine days of July with August , September and six of October also give ninety-six days .
It follows that when the first of Hecatombaion agrees with the third of July , the seventh of Pyanepsion will represent the sixth of October .
This would have happened in 466 B.c. and not again until 447 .
The year 466 , about three years subsequent to the recovery of the Theseian relics , would have given time for the building of the Naos of the temple , if not for its final completion ; so that it may well have been the year of its dedication .
On that year the astronomical combination would have been exact ( not but that on any year of the cycle the rising sun would have nearly answered the purpose of the Thesea celebration , though not quite so perfectly ) .
Of the two years above named which would have satisfied this condition , the earlier seems preferable , firstly on architectural grounds ( derived chiefly from the greater spread of the capital of the column , compared with that of the Parthenon , which was commenced about the later of the two dates ) , and secondly , there is no record of Pericles , who was at that time the guiding spirit in Athens , having built a great temple in the lower city .
If the earlier date be correct , the conclusion appears inevitable both from its combination with the Thesian relics in 469 , and from its connection with the Thesea year after year , that the temple has been rightly named by tradition .
The orientation of the new Erechtheum corresponds with two of the principal Attic festivals , and also offers a suggestion of the exact year of its foundation or dedication .
This is not drawn from the vernal sunrise , of which I have given elements in combination with a star ; but from the autumnal return of the sun to the same declination , heralded by a Pegasi , which took place , touching the northern edge of the eastern incolumnium on September 2 , and parallel with the axis on September 7 .
In the year 447 , when the 2nd of September would have agreed with the 2nd of Boedromion , and the 7th September with the 7th of the same month j the former date would have Determination of the Earth 's Horizontal Magnetic .
375 been that of the great feast of the Niceteria in honour of Minerva 's contest with Neptune for the protectorate of Athens , and the other , the annual celebration of the Marathon victory .
As respects the year 447 , which is one year earlier than the supposed commencement of the Parthenon , it seems appropriate because at that time Pericles would have been supreme , and it is likely that a temple of such sanctity as the Erechtheum would have called for his earliest attention .
It is true that the temple remained long unfinished , but of the causes of this delay we are ignorant .
The connection however of the orientation with the feasts above mentioned would have been exactly the same if the date had been 428 .
The apparent discrepance between the orientation date ( as respect the day of the month ) in the case of the Temples of Jupiter Olympius , and that which is supposed by Mommsen to have been the day of the celebration of the great feast to the supreme god ( namely Munychion 19 , the tenth month of the year , which in a general way corresponded with April ) , whereas the orientation dates give for the earlier temple March 30-31 , and for the later March 27 , is explained by the possibilities of the Metonic cycle , for when the Attic year began as it would in its course on July 11 , the 19th Munychion would agree with March 30 , or if July 8 with the 27th of March .
