" On the Algebraic Expression of the Number of Partitions of which a given number is susceptible .
" By Sir John F. W. Herschel , Bart. , K.H. , F.R.S. &amp;c. The object of this paper is to exemplify and extend the mode of analysis explained by the author in two former communications to the Royal Society " On the Development of Exponential Functions , " and " c On Circulating Functions , " to a case in the theory of numbers in which they afford remarkable facilities , viz. that of the partitions of which a given number is susceptible .
The separation of the symbols of operation from those of quantity , in the mode explained in the former of those communications , allows of the expression of the sums of certain series entering into this theory , under a form susceptible of resolution ( by a theorem here given ) into two portions , one of which , a rational function of the independent variable or number to be subdivided , expresses approximately , as a rational fraction , the number of partitions ; the other , a periodic or circulating function , expresses the fraction , less than unity , by which the other portion differs from an exact integer number , and which , applied with its proper sign to that former portion , reduces it to an integer .
In the mode of procedure here followed all subdivision into cases according to the numerical constitution of the number to be subdivided is avoided , and a uniform treatment is carried throughout .
