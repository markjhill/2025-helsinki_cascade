The authors having been led by perfectly distinct trains of reasoning to identical views bearing on the dissipation of energy , have had preliminary experiments made on the increase of radiation from a wooden disk on account of its velocity of rotation , both in the open air and in vacuo .
These experiments were made with a very delicate thermo-electric pile and galvanometer .
In the experiments in the open air the disk was of wood ; its diameter was 9 inches , and it was made to rotate with a velocity somewhat less than 100 revolutions in one second .
A sensible effect was produced upon the indicating galvanometer when the disk was made to rotate , and this effect appeared to be due to radiation , and not to currents of air impinging against the pile .
In amount it was found to be nearly the same as if the disk had increased in temperature 0 ?
'75 Fahr. In the experiments in vacuo the diameter of the wooden disk was over 12 inches ; its velocity of rotation was about 100 revolutions in one second , and the pile was nearer it than when in air .
Under these circumstances , with a vacuum of 0'6 in .
, an effect apparently due to radiant heat was obtained , amounting to nearly the same as if the disk had increased in temperature 1 ?
5 Fahr. Bearing in mind the increased diameter of the disk , the effect is probably equivalent to that obtained in air , and these preliminary experiments would tend to show that when a wooden disk is made to revolve rapidly at the surface of the earth , its radiation is increased to an extent depending on the velocity ; and it would appear that this effect is not materially less in a vacuum of 0'6 in .
than in the open air .
The authors intend to work out this and allied questions experimentally , and hope , if successful , to communicate the result to this Society .
