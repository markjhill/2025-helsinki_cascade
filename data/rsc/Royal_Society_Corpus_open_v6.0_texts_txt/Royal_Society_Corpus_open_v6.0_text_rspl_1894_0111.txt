[ June 21 , The general result is that there may he as many forms of solution as there are variables ( the differential equations being of the first order , to which they may always be reduced ) .
Each form is derived from the one before by the process of finding the envelope , and each contains fewer arbitrary constants by one than the form from which it is directly derived .
The general theory is given in S 2 for the case when the differential coefficients are given explicitly in terms of the variables .
In S 3 it is extended to the case when they are given implicitly , and in S 4 it is shown how the singular solutions are to be formed from the differential equations themselves .
In SS 5\#151 ; 9 the theory is connected with that of consecutive solutions belonging to the complete primitive .
SS 10\#151 ; 13 are taken up with geometrical interpretations relating to plane curves , and also to curves in space of n+1 dimensions , w + 1 being the number of variables .
In SS 14\#151 ; 16 the case is discussed in which a system of singular solutions is included in a former system or in the complete primitive .
The rest of the paper contains the application of the theory to certain examples .
The first example ( SS 17\#151 ; 21 ) is the case of the " lines in two osculating planes " of a twisted curve , and in particular of a twisted cubic .
The particular example is given by Mayer and Serret .
The second ( SS 22\#151 ; 26 ) is that of the congruency of common tangents to two quadric surfaces , and generally ( SS 27\#151 ; 38 ) of the bitangents to any surface .
The third ( SS 39\#151 ; 49)is that of the essentially different kind of congruency which consists of the inflexional tangents to a surface .
It seems natural to call these two kinds of congruency bitangentialand inflexional respectively .
The fourth example ( SS 50\#151 ; 52 ) is that of a system of conics touching six planes .
The fifth ( SS 53\#151 ; 60 ) is that of a doubly infinite system of parabolas in one plane , the differential equation being a case of an extension of Clairaut 's form y =p\amp ; +/ ( _\#163 ; \gt ; )\#187 ; which is explained in SS 53\#151 ; 55 .

" The Spectrum Changes in / 3 Lyrae .
Preliminary Note .
" By J. Norman Lookyer , C.B. , F.R.S. Received June 13 , 1894 .
The spectrum of this well known variable star was first investigated photographically by Professor Pickering , at Harvard College Observatory , and a preliminary account of the results was published in 1891.* Dark and bright lines were found to be associated in the spectrum , and further , the bright lines were found to change their positions with respect to the corresponding dark ones according to the interval of time which had elapsed since the preceding minimum .

1894.1 2 he Spectrum Changes in / 3 Lyroe .
It may be remarked that the period of the light-changes of the star is about twelve days twenty-two hours , and there are two approximately equal maxima of mag .
34 , a principal minimum of mag .
4*5 , and a secondary minimum of 3'9 , the period of variation stated being that which elapses between two successive principal minima .
Professor Pickering found that during the first half of the period\#151 ; that is , between principal and secondary minima\#151 ; the bright lines were on the less refrangible sides of the corresponding dark ones , while during the second half they were displaced to the more refrangible sides .
He further remarked that " the actual changes in the spectra , when studied in detail , are much more complicated than has been stated above , and show a variety of intermediate phases and changes in the dark as well as in the bright lines .
" At Professor Pickering 's request , I took up the work at Kensington in July , 1891 , the instrument employed being the 6-inch Henry object glass and prism of 7^ ' , which I have described in a previous communication.* Several photographs were taken with this instrument , but it was not until the new 6-inch prism of 45''f ' was employed in the research that any considerable advance was made .
With the higher dispersion of this instrument the spectrum is depicted in greater detail , and more minute changes can therefore be determined .
Since my work was commenced , accounts of the photographic spectrum of / 3 Lyrse have been published by Belopolsky , J Father Sidgreaves , S and Vogel , || and various suggestions have been made by them and others as to the conditions which bring about the variability .
On this account , although the reductions of the sixty-four photographs which I have obtained are not yet completed , I have thought it desirable to give a brief resume of the facts already acquired .
For the complete study of the problem more photographs will be required , and a considerable amount of time will be required for the discussion of them .
The present communication , therefore , is limited to a preliminary consideration of the variation in the spectrum as photographed at Kensington , and I have consequently in it omitted reference to the results obtained by other workers .
In a subsequent paper , however , a complete history of the subject will be given .

[ June 21 roughly one for each day of the period\#151 ; are given in Plate 1 .
These have been enlarged about three times from the original negatives.* As it is a matter of great difficulty to mount a series of such photographs showing the exact coincidences of the lines , in comparing the different spectra in the plates some allowance must be made for the slight differences in scale .
Further , it is right to add that probably some of the fainter lines shown in the photographs are artificially produced by the process of enlargement , but the real lines will be readily identified by their appearance in more than one spectrum ; the lines of particular interest are indicated in Plate 2 ( p. 283 ) .
The light curve which forms part of Plate 1 is constructed after Argelander 's drawing , f and the dotted lines drawn from the spectra to the period scale indicate the relation of each photograph to the light curve .
I proceed to state , step by step , the results of the preliminary examination of the photographs , and to indicate the spectral phenomena on which they are based .
1 .
The spectrum is constant at the same interval from principal minimum .
Apart from the slight differences which seem to be accounted for by differences in the atmospheric conditions and consequently in the quality of the negatives , the spectrum appears to be the same at the same interval from minimum .
The photographs reproduced in Plate 1 have been selected as being specially suitable for reproduction , but at most of the phases duplicates which are practically identical have been obtained .
2 .
The hinds of variation shown on the photographs are as follows :\#151 ; ( a. ) Periodical changes in the relative intensities of the lines .
( 6 .
) Periodical doublings of some of the dark lines .
( c. ) Periodical changes in the positions of the bright lines with respect to the dark ones .
3 .
There are two bodies involved giving dark line spectra .
On reference to Plate 1 it will be seen that at , and just before and after the second maximum , some of the dark lines are doubled .
This indicates two sources of light giving dark line spectra and moving relatively to each other in the direction of the line of sight .
When the relative movement in the line of sight is zero , none of the lines are doubled .
The latter condition occurs about the time of the two minima .
4 .
The maximum relative velocity of the two dark line components in the line of sight is about 156 miles per second .
* This plate is not given in the " Proceedings , " as it is very difficult to reproduce it on so small a scale .

281 The greatest separation of the dark lines oeenrs about the time of second maximum , and the relative velocity , as determined by measurements of three of the doubles in the photograph of August 24 , 1898 , is that stated above .
The individual measurements are as follows:\#151 ; H7 = 155 miles per second .
m = 154 " A 4025 = 158 " H 5 .
One of the dark line components hears a strong resemblance to Bigel and the other to Bellatrix .
The spectra of the two components can readily be separated , for the reason that only lines common to both will be doubled .
Among these are the lines of hydrogen .
Lines special to either component are always single , and they retain the same relative positions with respect to one group of hydrogen lines throughout the period .
In Plate 2 photographs are given to facilitate an analysis of the compound dark line spectrum .
At the bottom of the diagram is a reproduction of a photograph taken near the time of second maximum ( August 24 , 1893 ) , and the spectra of Rigel and Bellatrix are included in the same plate .
The compound character of the dark line spectrum of y3 Lyrse at this time is shown by the fact that one group of lines corresponds very closely with those which appear in the spectrum of Rigel , and when these are subtracted from the whole spectrum , a spectrum closely resembling that of Bellatrix remains , the latter spectrum being displaced in this photograph to the more refrangible side , as shown by the short lines drawn beneath the spectrum .
The resemblance of the two components to Rigel and Bellatrix respectively , the spectra of which I have described in a previous paper , * is further shown by the following tabular comparison , the two dark line components of / 3 Lyrse being called R and B respectively ( p. 282 ) .
It is not intended to suggest that the spectra of the two dark line components are quite identical with those of Rigel and Bellatrix .
These are simply the best known stars which they most closely resemble , and the similarity is pointed out as an indication that we have not to deal with bodies of an unfamiliar type .
Throughout the paper I shall refer to the two components as R and B respectively .
The conditions at first maximum , as shown in Plate 1 , are not so simple as those at second maximum , though there is evidence to show that at this point of the light curve the component B is receding with respect to R. As will be seen on reference to the photograph of March 13 , 1894 , the hydrogen lines are broadened , and the * ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1893 ( A ) , vol. 184 , p. 693 .

When the two bodies lie along the line of sight , partial eclipses occur .
This happens near the minima of the light curve .
The differences in the intensities of the dark lines special to R and B , near the two minima , indicate that near , the principal minimum R is partially eclipsed by B , while near secondary minimum B is partially eclipsed by R. These changes will be seen on Plate 1 , and again in Plate 2 .
In the latter we have comparisons of / 3 Lyras at the two minima with Bellatrix and Rigel .

[ June 21 the spectrum of ( 3 Lyrae greatly resembles that of Bellatrix , the component B in this case lying between us and component R. As the eclipse is not total , however , the lines special to R appear with reduced intensities ; the lines joining the spectrum of / 3 Lyrse to that of Bellatrix indicate the principal lines of component B. At the secondary minimum , on the other hand , component R lies in front of component B , and the spectrum consequently bears a greater resemblance to that of Rigel .
This is shown by the lines joining those of / 3 Lyrae to the spectrum of Rigel in Plate 2 .
The difference is especially noticeable in the case of the lines near X4471 , 4481 , 4388 , and in the group of four lines a little less refrangible than Ha .
It will be seen that near principal minimum 4471 is stronger than 4481 , as in Bellatrix , while about secondary minimum 4481 is stronger than 4471 .
If the eclipses were total , the variations of the spectrum might be expected to be still more striking .
7 .
In addition to dark lines there are several bright , which change their positions with respect to the dark ones .
The photographs show conspicuous bright lines about wave-lengths 4862(H^ ) , 4715 , 4471 , 4388 , 4340(Hy ) , 4101 ( Ha ) , 4025 , and 3887(H^- ) .
Other fainter ones also appear in some of the best photographs .
The line at 4471 ( Lorenzoni 's f ) is the well-known line which appears in the spectrum of the solar chromosphere , and those at 4025 and 4715 are amongst the brightest lines photographed with the prismatic camera during the total eclipse of the sun on April 16 , 1893 .
The displacements of the bright lines described by Pickering are confirmed in the main by the Kensington photographs .
In the first seven photographs in Plate I taken between principal and secondary minimum , the bright lines lie on the less refrangible sides of the dark ones , at secondary minimum the broad bright lines are almost bisected by dark ones ; while from secondary minimum to principal minimum the bright lines are more refrangible than the dark ones .
The investigation of the movements of the bright lines must , however , be now carried on in the light of the knowledge gained with regard to the existence of two sets of dark lines .
If we consider the displacements of the bright lines with reference to the dark lines of component R , we find that they are always in the same direction as those of component B with respect to R. Thus in the first half of the period , the bright lines , as well as the dark lines of component B , are less refrangible than those of component R , while during the second half they are more refrangible .
The bright lines , however , do not keep a constant position with respect to those of component B , although displaced in the same direction .
8 .
The bright lines are brightest soon after secondary minimum .
1894 .
] Photographic Spectrum of the Great Nebula in Orion .
285 If the brightness of the lines in reality remains constant , they will appear relatively brightest at the two minima , owing to the reduction of continuous spectrum which is associated with the increased brightness of the star at maximum , and for the same reason they should appear brighter at principal than at secondary minimum .
Estimates of the brightness of the lines in relation to the continuous spectrum hare been made independently by four of my assistants , and , although estimates of this kind are liable to error , the general agreement is sufficient to indicate that when all allowance is made fpr the vai'ying continuous spectrum , there is a maximum of brightness of the bright lines about half a day after secondary minimum .
The apparent increase of brightness near principal minimum seems to be due solely to the reduced intensity of the continuous spectrum .
I have to express my obligations to Messrs. Eowler , Baxandall , Shackleton , Butler , Wardale , Crabtree , and North , who , at different times , have assisted in taking the photographs .
