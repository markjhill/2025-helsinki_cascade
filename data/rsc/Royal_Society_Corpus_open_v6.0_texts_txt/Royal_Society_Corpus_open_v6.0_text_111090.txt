" On the Meteorology of the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmoreland , with a continuation of the results of experiments on the fall of Rain at various heights , up to 3166 feet above the Sea-Level .
" By J. F. Miller , Esq. , F.R.A.S. Communicated by Lieut.-Col. Sabine , R.A. , For .
Sec. R.S. In this communication are given the results of the observations of the quantity of rain which has fallen during the year 1849 at twenty stations in the valleys , and six mountain stations , varying in altitude above the sea from 500 feet to 3166 feet .
There is also given a table of the temperature at Seathwaite in Borrowdale during the year 1849 .
With reference to the mountain gauges , the author observes that , on the whole , the results are similar to those of the three preceding years , but , as might be looked for in a dry year like the past , the quantities of rain deposited at the various stations are more nearly equal than usual .
With respect to the temperature , he observes that the statement he made in his last communication , that " the inhabit .
ants of the Lake District valleys enjoyed a milder and more equable climate than the residents in the open country , and particularly in the winter months , " is confirmed by the thermometrical results of the present winter ( 1849-50 ) .
