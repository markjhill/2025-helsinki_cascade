A paper was then read , entitled , " An Account of a Concave Achro ?
matic Lens , adapted to the Wired Micrometer , which has been named Macro-micro , from its power to increase the primary image of a Te ?
lescope without increasing the diameter of the wires in the Micro ?
meter .
" By George Dollond , Esq. , F.R.S. The application of a concave achromatic lens to the wired micro ?
meter of a telescope , arose out of the series of trials that were made for the purpose of correcting the aberrations of the eye-glasses applied to the telescope constructed by the author for the Royal Society , with a fluid-correcting lens , on the plan suggested by Professor Barlow .
The concave lens , being interposed between the object-glass and the eye-glass , and being at the same time achromatic , combines the ad ?
vantages of doubling the magnifying power , without a corresponding diminution of light , and without altering the apparent distances of the threads of the micrometer .
The results of the trials made with telescopes to which this addition was made , are given in a letter to the author from the Rev. W. R. Dawes , of Ormskirk ; from which it appears that Mr. Dollond 's method was attended with complete suc ?
cess .
Mr. Dawes states , that , in order to put its illuminating power to a severe test , he had examined with this instrument the satellites of Saturn and the minute companion of k Geminorum , but could discover no decided difference in the apparent brightness of the former , allowance being made for the difference in the power employed ; and the latter star was seen quite as distinctly with a much smaller power .
Extracts are subjoined from a letter of Professor Barlow 's to the author , containing formulae for the construction of the lens .
