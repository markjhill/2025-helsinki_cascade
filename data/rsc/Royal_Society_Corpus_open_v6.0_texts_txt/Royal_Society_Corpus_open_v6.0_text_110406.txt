A paper was read , entitled , " On the Connexion between Re ?
fracted and Diffracted Light .
" By Paul Cooper , Esq. Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The purport of the present paper , as stated by the author , is to connect the phenomena of the dispersion of light arising from refraction , with that consequent upon diffraction , by showing , 1st , i( that white refracted light is formed by the superposition of fringes of colours , or rays of light .
uniformly refracted , which compensate each other in suc ?
cession ; 2nd , that diffracted white light is formed by the superposition of fringes which are not uniformly refracted , but which recede from it so gradually , as not to prevent the same mutual compensation , although it is distinguished by other appearances ; and 3rd , that the purity of the colour of the light , in both cases , depends upon its continuity , any interruption of which , although the different portions into which it may be separated are white at the moment the division takes place , produces colours in its further progress , because each portion carries with it the difference of direction required for their developement .
