" Notice of Remarkable Hailstones which fell at Headingley , near Leeds , on the 7th of May , 1862 .
" By THOMAS SUTCLIFFE , Esq. , in a letter to Dr. SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. Headingley , July 16th , 1862 .
DEAR SIR , -Allow me to offer you some memoranda , which I made at Headingley , near Leeds , on the 7th of May last , respecting a hailstorm which visited several parts of England on that day .
It appears that it arrived at Newark about 5 o'clock P.M. , and was succeeded by a tornado which did much damage ; then , pursuing a N.N.Westerly direction it reached Wakefield at 6.41 .
The hail continued to fall till about 6.58 .
The afternoon at Headingley had been remarkably hot and close , and the atmosphere densely charged with vapour ; at 6.45 the sky had become so overspread with dark clouds that it was impossible to see anything within doors without artificial light .
There were several peals of thunder and repeated flashes of rose-coloured lightning .
The storm visited the villages on the west of Leeds with especial violence , the hailstones knocking down several people , and breaking nearly all glass exposed to the W.S.w. The hailstones did not fall in a continuous shower , but in irregular clusters ; sometimes a field would be thickly strewed with them , whilst an adjoining one escaped with scarcely any ; one part of a greenhouse would be much broken , and the remainder , similarly exposed , escape uninjured .
The district over which hail fell was very narrow .
To illustrate the force of the falling stones , I may mention that circular holes were cut in glass without the sheet being otherwise injured .
I have the end of a pendulous branch of beech , 12 inches long and --ths of an inch in circumference , which was cut from the tree , also several larger branches from apple and lilac trees , which appeared to have been split from the adjoining boughs .
Some muslin curtains spread on the grass to dry were torn by the hail with numerous crucial rents .
The hailstones were of different forms and sizes .
I sketched about forty varieties ; but as many bear a certain resemblance to each other , I select four of them for illustration .
These were taken out of deep grass nearly half an hour after they had fallen .
Figures 1 to 4 represent them of the size and shape they had when I picked them up .
The heaviest I weighed was only 2 ozs .
, but other persons assert that they weighed some upwards of 5 ozs .
each .
No. 1 had a creamy white colour , with linear markings from the centre outwards ; this variety appeared to constitute the nucleus of most of the larger ones , around which transparent ice had accumulated in rounded continuous masses .
From the outside of some of the masses protruded icicles ; the remains of two may be seen attached to the side of No. 2 .
When the stones first fell , some of these icicles were 1 and 2 inches long , and grotesquely shaped .
It has been asserted that all the hailstones had the white nucleus , but this was not the case in our neighbourhood ; 35 per cent. of those I gathered were without it , and assumed something of the shape of No. 3 , which seemed an aggregate of crystals of clear ice .
I found one which was composed of five large masses of ice , quite clear , and in size like five nutmegs .
There were some which did not correspond with any of the above descriptions ; thus No. 4 has the round white radiated mass on the outside of the clear ice .
I annex meteorological reports for the day of the storm .
