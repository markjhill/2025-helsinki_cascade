( Communicated by Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received June 22 , 1909 .
) The spectrum of radium emanation was first measured visually by Sir William Ramsay and Prof. Collie in 1904* .
In 1908 a list of wave-lengths deduced from four photographs was published by Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Cameron , f together with an addendum in which the wave-lengths of a number of extra lines were given .
About the same time , measurements of 73 lines were published by Prof. Rutherford and Mr. Boyds , * many of these measurements being afterwards confirmed by Mr. Royds with the aid of a grating spectrograph.^ In the meantime , however , it was observed by Mr. Royds|| that the lines given by Cameron and Ramsay in the above-mentioned addendum appeared , with a few exceptions , to be due to xenon , the resemblance between the two spectra being too marked to be accidental .
At the same time the spectrum as given by Cameron and Ramsay was not very dissimilar to that of Rutherford and Royds , and so , although the values of the latter authors were afterwards fully confirmed by their grating measurements , yet it seemed advisable to have independent evidence on the subject .
Consequently , a number of additional photographs of the emanation spectrum have been taken and compared with Cameron and Ramsay 's original negatives with a view to accounting for the discrepancy between the results previously obtained , and the results of this investigation form the subject matter of the present communication .
Experimental .
The gas to be examined was kindly purified by Sir William Ramsay in his usual way , viz. , sparking in presence of fused potassium hydroxide , freezing in liquid air , and pumping off the excess of hydrogen .
After standing for some time in contact with lime , the gas was displaced by means of mercury and forced into a fine calibrated capillary glass tube with a platinum wire sealed in at the top .
The volume was first measured , and a current from a * 'Roy .

The Spectrum of Radium Emanation .
51 medium sized induction coil then passed through the gas , the mercury surface being made the cathode and the platinum wire the anode .
This form of tube was found to be very convenient , as the pressure could be increased when the emanation began to run out , and the tube could be heated without danger of cracking .
With a freshly filled tube the spectrum remained quite bright for about a quarter of an hour , and exposures of over one hour have been given without all the emanation being driven into the walls .
In some cases lead glass was used , but the discoloration was so rapid that the effective exposure was greatly curtailed .
Photographs were taken both with a prism spectrograph and with a grating , Wratten Panchromatic plates being used ; but as in each case a special method of calculating the wave-lengths was employed , the two will be described separately .
The prism spectrograph is of the direct vision type with three prisms .
The glass , however , is very opaque , and only transmits light as far as X 3800 .
The dispersions at X6000 , X 5000 , and X , 4000 are 143 , 70 , and 24 Angstrom units to the millimetre respectively , and the length of spectrum between X 5000 and X4000 is 2'4 cm .
This is considerably greater than the dispersion of the instrument used by Kutherford and Eoyds , but to judge from the reproduction of their photograph , the definition was not quite so good .
The determination of wave-lengths presented considerable difficulty owing to the smallness of the dispersion and to the fact that the photographs were taken primarily for qualitative purposes , and had no comparison spectrum immediately alongside .
The following method , however , was adopted .
A xenon spark spectrum* was photographed and measured .
The dispersion between each two consecutive lines was then calculated and plotted against the mean reading of the two lines .
A smooth curve was drawn through these points giving the dispersion at each millimetre , and from this a table was drawn up showing the wave-length corresponding to the reading each millimetre .
By means of a difference table of dispersions , the mean dispersion between any given reading and the nearest whole millimetre could be readily seen , and since for very small differences the difference in wave length is equal to the mean dispersion multiplied by the difference in scale reading , the wave-length corresponding to any particular reading may be at once calculated .
* The term " spark spectrum " in the present paper is used to denote the spectrum obtained by introducing a Leyden jar in parallel , and an air gap in series with the tube containing the gas .

The mean dispersion between 9*9000 and 9*9321 is 25*35 \#151 ; J x 0*90 x 0*321 = 25*20 .
Therefore the wave-length is 4027*7 \#151 ; 0*321x25*2 = 4019*6 .
The calculation of the dispersion may be performed mentally , and the other multiplication by means of a slide rule , so that when once a table is obtained , the calculations are very simple .
The drawing up of the table , however , is not as easy as it might appear to be at first sight .
In the present case the first table drawn up was very inaccurate , and this could at once be seen by examining the differences of the dispersions , which did not decrease at all regularly .
A fresh table was then , so to speak , synthesised from a steadily decreasing series of dispersion differences , the first wave-length values merely being used as a guide , A more satisfactory table was thus obtained , but a further correction was necessary owing to slight irregularities in the dispersion and the screw of the measuring instrument , though the variation due to the last cause was probably negligible .
The table in its final form was obtained by recalculating the wave-lengths of the standard lines used in its construction , and drawing a smooth curve through the differences from their known wave-lengths plotted against scale readings .
The wave-lengths of the emanation lines calculated from this table were again corrected graphically , making use of the values deduced by the aid of the grating , and were finally checked by means of the mercury lines which appeared in the spectrum .
It might appear at first sight that the above method is complicated , and leads to no more accurate results than the methods commonly used .
This however , is not the case , for the only step which causes difficulty is the synthesis of the table , i.e. the second stage , but this merely requires patience , and an examination of the dispersion differences shows at once 1909 .

the correctness of the results .
The subsequent calculations are most simple , and no logarithms are required , thereby minimising chances of error .
A graphical method with the same accuracy would be quite unmanageable unless about a thousand reference lines were used , and the method of interpolation between lines of known wave-length is open to the objection that the measurements of the standard lines may themselves be wrong , especially if they vary greatly in intensity , thereby introducing an unnecessary source of error ; the calculations are , moreover , tedious .
The method adopted in the present investigation , in which it is necessary to make use of the most refined calculations in order to obtain wave-lengths from the original measurements with the highest possible ' degree of accuracy , is really a modification of the interpolation method , but the standard values are smoothed before use , and the calculations are simplified .
It is difficult to say what is the accuracy of the results .
Measurements of the same line did not differ by more than 0'0005 cm .
, corresponding to 0'7 A.U. at X 6000 and to 0T2 A.U. at X4000 , and these figures should give the approximate errors , but I have found by considerable experience that the actual errors are quite liable to be from two to three times as great as values obtained in this way , and a fair estimate is about 0-5 A.U. in the middle of the spectrum , this not being exceeded in any of the values calculated for the wave-lengths of the standard lines .
The same limit of error is also assumed by Eutherford and Eoyds , and is probably correct , for the dispersion of their instrument was less than that of mine , but their lines were sharper .
Moreover , our values seldom differ by more than one unit . .
Wave-lengths greater than X6000 were not calculated by the method given above , as the error could not reasonably be expected to be less than one unit , and a large scale dispersion curve standardised by means of neon lines was used instead .
The grating spectrograph with which the other photographs were taken was very kindly lent by Messrs. Hilger .
It was fitted with a plane reflection grating , the ruled surface of which was 474 x 34 mm. , the number of lines to the inch being 14,438 .
The dispersion was about 25 units to the millimetre , and the whole instrument was very rigid and well adapted for accurate work .
For the determination of wave-lengths a comparison xenon spark spectrum was taken on the top of each emanation photograph , the slit being shortened for the purpose .
The spectrum obtained was by no means normal , and the wave-lengths were deduced by a method of successive approximations .
The micrometer readings of the xenon lines were first multiplied by 255 , and the Mr. H. E. Watson .
[ June 22 , result subtracted from a constant number .
The wave-lengths obtained in this way were about 50 xmits too low at one end of the plate , and 11 at the other , but over the middle , where most of the lines occurred , they were fairly correct .
On plotting these differences against scale readings , an approximate parabola was obtained , and assuming that the curve actually was a parabola , a fresh series of wave-lengths was calculated , in which the error of individual lines was never more than two units wrong .
The final correction to take into account deviations of the true correction curve from the parabolic form , and any small irregularities , was a graphical one , as must needs be the case in all calculations of this nature , although , of course , small errors are apt to be introduced by its use .
All the lines seen were exceedingly sharp and well defined , and the measurements were probably accurate to 0'0002 cm .
, corresponding to 005 I.U. , and it was found in the case of the standard xenon lines that the error was rarely greater than 0'2 A.U. , and was usually less than 01 A.U. It will be seen , however , that Royds ' measurements and mine differ in a few cases by as much as 0'4 A.U. , and the question arises as to which series is the more accurate .
Boyds places his limit of error at 01 A.U. , but gives no details of the method of calculation at all .
The dispersion in his case was considerably greater than in mine , and the hydrogen lines appearing in his spectrum were doubtless invaluable as standards .
As , however , the measurements of two of these lines differ from standard values by 0T7 and 024 uuit respectively , it seems more reasonable to suppose that it is the mean error which is less than OT A.U. and not the maximum error .
Notwithstanding , it appears probable that Boyds ' values are rather more accurate than mine .
Six photographs were taken with the prism spectrograph and six with the grating , two in each case being spark spectra .
One of the former set taken with quite fresh emanation showed as many as 111 lines , of which five were due to mercury , but these were not very intense , as the mercury was cooled in carbon dioxide and alcohol during the greater portion of the experiment .
Only one other line arising from impurity could be detected , and this was the hydrogen C line , which was barely visible .
Its faintness alone was quite sufficient to preclude the possibility of any other hydrogen lines being seen in the spectrum , but notwithstanding , a careful search was made for secondary hydrogen lines , none of which could be detected .
It may therefore be assumed with a high degree of probability that all the lines on this plate with the exception of those mentioned above are due to the emanation or possibly to one or more of its decomposition products.* These lines are * A preliminary photograph of this emanation was taken at comparatively high 1909 .

55 given in the first column of the table at the end of the paper .
There are , doubtless , many more lines in the spectrum of the emanation , but at present there seems very little probability of being able to detect them , especially when the great difficulty of photographing the weaker lines in the spectra of the inactive gases is borne in mind .
The spark spectrum of the emanation does not appear to differ from the one usually seen , although a change might be expected by analogy with xenon .
It is difficult to be quite certain on this point , however , because the introduction of a spark gap and Leyden jar into the circuit makes visible the most minute traces of impurity , which ordinarily do not appear .
A number of additional lines were seen in the spark spectra , but as far as could be judged they were due solely to mercury , oxygen , and a very small quantity of carbon dioxide .
The presence of oxygen was specially noticeable in the grating photographs , and it seems difficult to explain its presence except on the assumption that the lead glass walls of the tube were decomposed by the emanation , one of the products being oxygen , and support is lent to this hypothesis by the fact that after standing for some days the quantity of oxygen appeared to have increased .
In the case of a soda glass tube only a very small quantity of oxygen appeared to be present .
There were , however , four lines which appeared in one of the grating photographs after the emanation had been standing for two days , their wave-lengths and intensities being :\#151 ; 4818*8 , 0 ; 4810*0 , 0 ; 4795*6 , 3 ; and 4686*6 , 2 .
The error in measurement should certainly not exceed 0*5 A.U. , and I have been unable to identify any of them .
The following table gives a summary of all the results so far obtained by different observers .
Ten of Collie and Ramsay 's lines are certainly due to the emanation , but it seems probable that the remainder were really mercury lines .
The case of Cameron and Ramsay 's spectrum is more complex , because a considerable quantity of hydrogen was present with their gas , and it was difficult to distinguish emanation and secondary hydrogen lines .
Moreover , since the wave-lengths were merely obtained by means of a dispersion curve , the error is apt to be as much as three or four units .
These authors have , however , kindly placed at my disposal their orginal plates and measurements , and by comparing these with my own values I have been able to tell pressure .
This showed a trace of carbon dioxide , but after running for about four minutes the spectrum cleared completely .
The second photograph was taken at a lower pressure , and not the least indication of the presence of a trace of carbon dioxide could be detected .
Mr. H. E. Watson .
[ June 22 , which of the lines are common to the two photographs .
Column 5 below shows the lines which were visible in one or more of their first four experiments , giving not only the 35 lines already published by them , but also 15 others which appeared on their plates , and which they attributed to hydrogen .
It will be seen that the majority of lines on this list really belong to the emanation , although the measurements are not very accurate .
The next column shows the lines obtained in their last experiment .
As mentioned before , it has been pointed out by Eoyds that this spectrum is very similar to that of xenon , and a careful comparison of the original negative with a spectrum of xenon taken with a small spark-gap in series leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this assumption , the two spectra being almost identical .
The only difference is that Cameron and Ramsay s spectrum contains 18 of the stronger emanation lines .
This exceedingly interesting fact is attributed by Royds to accidental contamination with xenon , but such an explanation is entirely untenable , because the experiment in question was carried out in Sir William Ramsay 's private laboratory , into which no xenon had ever been introduced , and the vacuum tube was new .
The possibility of the introduction of xenon owing to a leak of air would not account for the observed facts , because if such a leak had occurred , krypton lines would certainly have been seen in the spectrum as well as those of xenon .
There seems to be only one explanation left , viz. , that the emanation under certain conditions has broken down into xenon .
If so , what are these conditions ?
In the experiment under discussion copper electrodes were used , but this metal has not been present in the tubes on any other occasion , and on no other occasion has the xenon spectrum been observed .
If , therefore , this is a case of transformation , it would Beem that copper is the transforming agent , though without further evidence it would be very unwise to make such an assumption .
The undoubted fact remains , however , that for no apparent reason the spectrum of xenon has made its appearance with that of the emanation , and no explanation save that of transformation seems at present capable of throwing light on the phenomenon .
With regard to the spectrum of Rutherford and Royds , and the one measured in the present work , there is little to be said except that the two fully confirm each other .
On examining the grating spectrum of Royds , I observed at once that the author was evidently unacquainted with a paper by Frost* on the secondary spectrum of hydrogen , since he included in his list four secondary hydrogen lines , which , although not given by Ames , t are * ' Astrophys .

57 some of the strongest in this spectrum .
Except for these four lines , however , there seems very little doubt that the spectrum , as given by Eutherford and Eoyds , is really that of the emanation .
A short time ago Prof. Frost kindly wrote to me , pointing out that the measurements of a number of Eutherford and Eoyds ' lines agreed very closely with those of secondary hydrogen lines previously mapped by him , and suggesting that there might be still more resemblances if the whole hydrogen spectrum which I recently measured* could be compared with this emanation spectrum .
It is true that the agreement in wave-length is in many cases remarkable , but a careful comparison of the intensities shows that the identity of the two spectra is only apparent , and this is fully confirmed by the fact that no secondary hydrogen lines at all were visible in my spectrum , which is in turn practically the same as that of Eutherford and Eoyds .
Another interesting feature of the emanation spectrum is to be found in the considerable differences which are observed in the relative intensities of the lines .
In the region of the spectrum for which glass is transparent , Eoyds observed 30 lines , and the same number occurred on my grating-plates , but of these , 22 only were the same .
For example , the line X 4577 is given by Eoyds in his grating spectrum as being of intensity 8 , whereas it did not appear on my grating plates at all , and only on one of the prism photographs , where , however , it was very bright .
This line , therefore , though of considerable intensity , appears to " run out " very quickly .
The lines X 4460 and X 4307 behave in a similar way .
On the other hand , many .quite weak lines are very persistent , and appeared even when the emanation had been standing for two or three days .
At first sight it might appear that the fugitive lines are due to the emanation , and the persistent ones to one of its products , but the evidence is not in any way sufficient to prove this assumption .
The most likely explanation is that the relative intensity of the lines varies greatly with pressure , as is the case with xenon , and consequently , as the gas gets driven into the walls of the tube and the pressure thereby grows less , some lines .fade out more rapidly than others .
I have endeavoured to give some indication of the persistence of the lines which I observed by adding a Greek letter after the figure denoting the intensity .
The most persistent line is denoted by a , the next by / 3 , and so on up to 7r , while the lines without a letter attached were seen on only one plate .
It must be remembered , however , that these letters really denote a combination of true persistence with intensity , for if two equally persistent lines are photographed on several successive days , it is evident * 'Roy .

[ June 22 , that the brighter one will appear in more cases than the other .
Nevertheless , by observing the intensity of the line and noting the letter appended to it , some idea of the true persistence can be obtained .
In the table , lines which were measured by means of a grating may be distinguished by the fact that their wave-lengths are given to two places of Wave- length .

61 decimals , though little significance can be attached to the last figure .
Lines which are apparently diffuse are characterised by the letter cl. In conclusion , I should like to express my great indebtedness to Sir William Eamsay for allowing me the use of the emanation , and for purifying it on all occasions .
My best thanks are also due to Dr. Gray for assisting in the purification of the emanation and the subsequent manipulation , and to Mr. Cameron for placing at my disposal all his original measurements .
On the Perception of the Direction of Sound .
By Lord Rayleigh , O.M. , F.R.S. ( Received July 1 , 1909 .
) The nature of the clue by which we are able to pronounce whether a sound of low pitch reaches us from the right or from the left was long a mystery , seeing that in such cases the difference of intensities at the two ears , used singly , is inappreciable .
By some special laboratory experiments conducted about three years ago , * I was able to show that the discrimination depends upon the p^ase-difference at the two ears , and that the sound is judged to be on that side where the phase is in advance .
When the pitch is higher ( much above g ' ) no distinct lateral effect accompanies a phase-difference , and the discrimination of right and left in ordinary hearing undoubtedly depends upon intensities .
Commenting on these results , I remarked ( p. 224 ) : " The conclusion , no longer to be resisted , that when a sound of low pitch reaches the two ears with approximately equal intensities , but with a phase-difference of a quarter of a period , we are able so easily to distinguish at which ear the phase is in advance , must have far-reaching consequences in the theory of audition .
It seems no longer possible to hold that the vibratory character of sound terminates at the outer ends of the nerves along which the communication with the brain is established .
On the contrary , the processes in the nerve must themselves be vibratory , not , of course , in the gross mechanical sense , but with preservation of the period and retaining the characteristic of phase\#151 ; a view advocated by Rutherford , in opposition to Helmholtz , as long ago as 1886 .
