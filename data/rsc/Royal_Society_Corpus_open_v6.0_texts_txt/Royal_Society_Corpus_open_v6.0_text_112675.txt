" On the Curves which satisfy given conditions .
" By Prof. CAYLEY , F.R.S. Received April 18 , 1867 , ( Abstract .
) The present memoir relates to portions only of the subject of the curves which satisfy given conditions ; but any other title would be too narrow : the question chiefly considered is that of finding the number of the curves which satisfy given conditions ; the curves are either curves of a determinate order r ( and in this case the conditions chiefly considered are conditions of contact with a given curve ) , or else the curves are conics ; and here ( although the conditions chiefly considered are conditions of contact with a given curve or curves ) it is necessary to consider more than in the former case the theory of conditions of any kind whatever .
As regards the theory of conics , the memoir is based upon the researches of Chasles and Zeuthen , as regards that of the curves of the order r , upon the researches of De Jonquieres : the notion of the quasi-geometrical representation of conditions by means of loci in hyper-space is employed by Salmon in his researches relating to the quadric surfaces which satisfy given conditions .
The papers containing the researches referred to are included in a list subjoined .
I reserve for a separate second memoir the application to the present question , of the Principle of Correspondence .
