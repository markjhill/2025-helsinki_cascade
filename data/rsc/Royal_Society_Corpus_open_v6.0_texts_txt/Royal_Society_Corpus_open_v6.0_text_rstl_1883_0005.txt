[ 269 ] Y. On the Normal Paraffins.\#151 ; Part IV .
By C. Schorlemmer , F.R.S. , and T. E. Thorpe , F.R.S. Received December 5 , \#151 ; Read December 21 , 1882 .
In the last communication made by one of us on this subject ( Phil. Trans. , 1880 , p. 451 ) , it was stated that we contemplated making a joint investigation on the heptane from Finns Sabiniana .
A large quantity of the pure heptane was treated with chlorine in the manner described in this series of communications ( Phil. Trans. , 1872 , p. Ill ) , and the chlorides boiling between 143 ' and 157''5 were converted into the alcohols in the ordinary way .
The primary alcohol boiled between 165'\#151 ; 170 ' , whilst the secondary alcohol distilled over , for the most part , between 156'\#151 ; 15 8 ' .
The alcohols were then oxidised in the manner described in Phil. Trans. , 1872 , p. 121 .
The ketone obtained from the secondary alcohol was further oxidised by being heated with the chromic acid solution in sealed tubes at 100 ' .
The liquid was then neutralised and the unattacked ketone was separated by* distillation .
In order to isolate the acids contained in the residue small quantities of sulphuric acid were added , and the acid which separated out ( pentoic acid ) was distilled off in a current of steam\#151 ; the operation being repeated until the pentoic acid was no longer recognisable by its smell .
The acetic acid contained in the residue was then separated by a further addition of sulphuric acid and distilled off by direct heating .
The respective silver salts of the two acids were then prepared from the several fractions in the ordinary way .
Analysis showed that the separation of the acids was complete .
I. Silver salt from the normal alcohol .
( a ) 0*4035 grm. salt gave 0*1842 grm. Ag=45*6 per cent. ( b ) 0*210 " " 0*0953 " =45*4 Calculated for silver heptoate 45*5 per cent. II .
Silver salts from ketone from secondary alcohol .
0*2022 grm. salt A gave 0*1050 grm. Ag=51*9 per cent. 0*1491 " " 0*0771 " =51*7 Silver pentoate =51*6 Ag .
0*235 grm. salt B. gave 0*1518 grm. Ag=64*59 per cent. Silver acetate =64*67 per cent. The results of the oxidation show therefore that primary heptyl alcohol and methyl-pentyl-carbinol had been formed , as in the case of heptane from petroleum .
Another portion of the mixture of the monochlorides was then heated to 100 ' with alcoholic solution of potash , whereby in addition to heptylene a mixture of the ethyl heptyl ethers was obtained .
The heptylene , purified by repeated rectification over sodium , boiled constantly at 98'*5 .
It was placed in contact with an excess of fuming hydrochloric acid in the dark and in a well-closed bottle for six weeks .
Heptylene from petroleum heptane was similarly treated .
Now it is remarkable that whilst hexylene from mannite combines completely with hydrochloric acid under these circumstances forming secondary hexyl chloride ( Phil. Trans. , 1880 , p. 457 ) , the greater part of the heptylene from Pinus heptane was found to be unattacked , not more than 10 per cent , of heptyl chloride having been formed .
On the other hand , about one-half of the heptylene from petroleum had been converted into the chloride in accordance with the former observations made by one of us on this point .
The uncombined portions of both specimens of heptylene were again placed in contact with the fuming acid , and ( the research being interrupted by other work ) they were allowed so to remain for many months .
At the expiration of this time it was found that the Pinus heptylene had united almost completely with the acid , whilst an additional quantity of the heptylene from petroleum had likewise entered into combination .
It follows from this that , contrary to expectation , hydrochloric acid acting in the cold is not capable of effecting the separation of isomeric paraffins ( Phil. Trans. , 1880 , p. 451 ) .
It is remarkable that the Pinus heptylene should require so long a time to bring about its union with hydrochloric acid , since , as will be shown immediately , its constitution is exactly analogous to that of the hexylene from mannite or propyl-methyl ethylene , C3H7.CH==CH .
CH3 , which so easily goes into combination .
In order to establish the constitution of the heptylene from Pinus it was oxidised by means of a solution of potassium dichromate in dilute sulphuric acid in the manner adopted by Hecht in the oxidation of hexylene from mannite ( Ber .

The acids so formed were converted into the silver salts and analysed with the following results :\#151 ; Fraction .

The first five fractions consisted of a fine crystalline powder , the last three were glistening needles .
These observations clearly indicate that only pentoie and acetic acids had been formed by the oxidation , and therefore that the heptylene is pure butylmethyl-ethylene , C4H9.CH = CH .
CH3 , which had been formed from the secondary heptyl chloride , C4H9-CH , -CHC1.CH3 .
These results , taken in conjunction with those of former investigations , leave no doubt , therefore , that by the action of chlorine upon a normal paraffin not all the chlorides indicated by theory are formed , but only the primary and a secondary chloride which contains the group \#151 ; CHC1.CH3 .
One of us has formerly shown that by the action of bromine upon normal paraffins from petroleum only secondary bromides corresponding to chlorides are formed ( Phil. Trans. , 1878 , Part I. , p. 49 ) .
Venable has since shown that Pinus heptane is acted upon in the same way ( Ber .
