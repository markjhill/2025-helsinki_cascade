An Account of Experiments on the Reflecting Telescope .
By the Right Hon. Lord Oxmantown , F.R.S. This paper enters minutely into the details of the experiments , of the precautions requisite to ensure success , and of the manipulations ultimately adopted in forming a speculum three feet in diameter , subsequently applied to a telescope , mounted in a manner very si ?
milar to that of Sir John Herschel .
The author states , as the results he arrived at , that specula can be made to act effectively , when east of the finest speculum metal , in separate portions , and retained in their positions by an alloy of zinc and copper , as easily wrought as common brass , and that they can be executed in this manner of any required size ; that castings of the finest speculum metal can be ex ?
ecuted of large dimensions , perfect , and not very liable to break ; that machinery can be employed with the greatest advantage in grinding and polishing specula ; that to obtain the finest polish , it is not necessary that the speculum should become warm , and that any temperature may be fixed upon , and preserved uniform during the whole process ; and that large specula can be polished as accurately as small ones , and be supported so as to be secured from flexure .
