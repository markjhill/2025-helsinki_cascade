Spectroscopic Observations of the Sun .
By J. Norman Lockyer , F.B.S. , and G. M. Seabroke , F.R.A.S. Received February 2 , \#151 ; Read March 19 , 1874 .
We have the honour to communicate to the Royal Society the accompanying Spectroscopic Observations of the Chromosphere and of the Sun generally , made during the period between the 1st October , 1872 , and the 31st December , 1873 .
The London observations have been made in Alexandra Load , Finchley Road , N.W. ; the Rugby observations in the Temple Observatory at that place .
The following details are given of the instruments and methods of observation employed .
LONDON OBSERVATIONS .
A 6^-inch refracting telescope by Cooke , of York , mounted equatorially , was employed , to which is attached the 7-prism spectroscope by Browning , of London , already described .
A position-circle , made by Cooke , of York , was used for obtaining the position-angle of the prominences and of the various details of the chromosphere .
On the side towards the spectroscope the circle is provided with a pinion , which , acting on a circular rack , causes the graduated half of the circle to rotate , the vernier being on the fixed half attached to the telescope-body .
On the 16th of September , 1873 , the prisms spectroscope was replaced by a diffraction-grating of speculum-metal containing 6121 lines to the inch , made by Mr. L. M. Ruther-furd , of New York , by whom it was generously placed at Mr. Lockyer 's disposal ; the whole apparatus is only 15 inches in length , and weighs 3 lbs. , while the 7-prism spectroscope , with its mounting , is 24 inches long , and weighs lOf lbs. , the principal weight , moreover , being 18 inches from the end of the telescope .
In dispersive power the 2nd order spectrum of the grating is equal to 7 prisms , while with equal dispersive power the grating gives much more light .
The positions of the prominences have been determined as follows:\#151 ; Standing with the back to the sun , and looking at the sun 's image on the slit plate , the bottom of the image , being the image of the real North of the sun , is called North , the left-hand side of the image East , the right hand West , and the top South .
The degrees are reckoned from North as zero through East to North again in the same direction as the hands of a watch , N. , E. , S. , W. of the image on the plate being of course in the contrary direction to N. , E. , S. , W. as seen directly on the sun .
If , then , the ring of chromosphere , as seen on the slit plate , be cut at North or 0 ' and straightened , we obtain a line with N. or 0 ' on the left hand , and extending to the right from N. 0 ' through E. 90 ' , S. 180 ' , West 270 ' , to N. 360 ' .
The adjustments for recording the positions of various parts of the chromosphere as observed with either the radial or tangential slit having been made , the telescope is clamped in R.A. , the clock set going , and the spectroscope focused for the C line .
Should a prominence be observed , the telescope is moved in R.A. or Declination , until it appears in the middle of the field of the spectroscope , and the position-circle is then moved until the slit is either tangential or radial to the part of the limb where the prominence appears ; this is determined , in the case of the tangential slit , by the narrow strip of continuous spectrum which flashes in the moment the limb of the sun overlaps the slit exactly .
In the drawings executed in London , which accompany this paper , the positions of the prominences have been determined as follows , viz. the smaller ones , those from 2 ' to 3 ' wide , have had the central point of their base taken for the position , those wider than this have , in every case where possible , had the position-angle of each side determined , and very complicated groups have had , as far as possible , their principal components determined .
The height has been obtained by causing the slit to travel up the prominence , and estimating how many slits high above the limb it was\#151 ; a process which is easy , as there are nearly always in the prominence details of structure which can be used as points for measurement .
The height of each prominence is set down in slits , and the width of the slit is measured at the end of the operation , and the true height in seconds calculated from the measurement .
The London observations and drawings have almost entirely been made by Mr. R. J. Friswell , Mr. Lockyer 's assistant , to whom great credit is due for the zealous and intelligent manner in which he has taken up this branch of the research .
ETJGBY OBSEEVATIONS .
The 8^-inch equatorial by Alvan Clark , to which is attached the ring-slit arrangement , producing a virtual eclipse of the sun , described by us before this Society in January 1873 , has been used for these observations .
The spectroscope attached is constructed on the return principle , giving a dispersion of 8 prisms of 60 ' .
The position of the prominences has been determined as follows:\#151 ; Arranged radially round the disk , which cuts off the light from the body of the sun , are fine platinum wires at a distance of 10 ' from each other , and these being seen together with the ring of chromosphere serve to fix the position of the prominences , the shape and position-angle of which can be then easily drawn .
There are four wires crossing the annulus 90 ' from each other that are rather thicker than the others , and these are made to coincide with the N. , S. , E. , and W. points of the sun respectively by causing the upper or lower SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN .
limb of the sun 's image to traverse the disk , and then turning the instrument round until the limb exactly passes from one wire to the opposite one ; then , on bringing the sun 's image concentric with the disk , the left-hand wire , as seen by looking on the disk with the back to the sun , corresponds to the East side of the sun as looked at directly , and is therefore at the position of 90 ' , and the right-hand one corresponds to the W. of the sun 270 ' ; the lowest wire will then correspond to the North or 0 ' , and the upper to the South or 180 ' .
The direction of reckoning the degrees is as usual N. , E. , S. , W. , or as looking directly at the sun in the contrary direction to the hands of a clock ; but as looking on the disk with the back to the sun N. , E. , S. , W. will be in the same way as the hands of a clock ; and if the ring of chromosphere , as it would appear to an observer looking at it in the annulus with the back to the sun , be cut at N. or 0 ' and straightened , the appearance would be that shown in the drawings ; although the annulus of chromosphere is looked at with the spectroscope from the opposite side to that of the sun , the image is half inverted by a diagonal reflecting prism in the telescope of the spectroscope , so that its appearance is the same as if looked at in the annulus from the same side as the sun .
The width of the annulus through which the light from the chromosphere passes is such that a prominence 100 " in height reaches across the annulus , so that the height of the prominences can be judged of with fair accuracy .
We have purposely refrained from any reduction of these observations , as we are of opinion that such reduction will be most usefully made when the observations of the Italian and other observers have been published , as it is hoped that the English and foreign observations may be in some cases so complementary of each other that long gaps may be avoided .
Notes to accompany the Maps .

) ( LONDON OBSERVATIONS* .
) December 6th , 1872.\#151 ; Chromosphere generally 10 " high .
January 1st , 1873.\#151 ; Chromosphere about the usual height , except 150'-170 ' , where it was low .
March 8th , 1873.\#151 ; Chromosphere very hair-like in its outline , about 12 " high .
Between 3.30 and 4.0 p.m. a large spot was observed between 240 ' and 250 ' , and close to the limb .
Violent action was going on .
C was intensely black over the spot , and , I think , slightly thickened ; D was very thick , and bent towards the red .
The magnesium lines did not seem to be affected ; but the two lines of 5166'5|p\amp ; and * A\ ith these are included , in order of date , nine woodcuts of the more remarkable prominences , of the size of the original drawings , which were made , some at London by Mr. Fkiswell , some at Rugby by Mr. Seabroke .
The locality , date , and position-angle , which are given in each case , will enable the reader to find the places of these prominences in the Maps .
4 n 2 5168*5 violently bent towards the red .
4859*1 Fe intensely black and thick .
F very black , and bent in all directions over the region between the spots on the limb ; it was perhaps rather thickened , but I could not be certain of this .
C and F presented the above appearance on the limb near the spot .
Once the bright part of F filled up the space between 4859*1 Fe and the dark F line .
This was probably only half the bright part , but I did not see it on the other side .
Another spot was close to the one in question , a little to the N. and E. of it .
London .
March 8,1873 .
80 ' 90 ' 100 ' 110 ' March 12th.\#151 ; The bright line on the most refrangible side of in the ordinary solar spectrum scarcely affected by the spot ; b not thickened .
C gone on the edge of the spot ; F like this :\#151 ; March 17th.\#151 ; A group of spots , probably those seen on the limb on the 8th and on the sun on the 12th ; the magnesium lines were not thickened .
D is very thick , and C very black ; but it is doubtful if it is thickened .
The continuous absorption of the spot on either side of C is very small .
March 24th.\#151 ; The prominence at 230 ' changed a good deal in form and brilliancy .
Two spots were seen , but no satisfactory observations were obtained .
One of them seemed to give a continuous absorption only .

July 28th.\#151 ; Only the N.W. and N.E. quadrants were observed .
In the former the chromosphere was hairy , and the hairs inclined to N. slightly , except at 330 ' , where they were divergent .
In the N.E. quadrant the hairs were generally straight up from 90 ' to 20 ' , where they were slightly inclined to W. From 10 ' to 0 ' they were straight again .

The Ca lines near D were slightly thicker .
The spot is rather faint ; and as the general darkening of the spectrum is considerable and the selective absorption almost nil , a cooling only would seem to be indicated .

It has been noted at Rugby that all the cyclones observed from the beginning of 1872 have , with one exception , had a motion of rotation , direct when in the northern hemisphere , and indirect when in the southern , corresponding , therefore , to our terrestrial cyclones .
In the Plates accompanying this paper the horizontal lines represent each one minute .
