By Morris W. Travers , D.Sc .
, F.E.S. , Director , Indian Institute of Science , In 1881 Jones and Taylor* demonstrated the existence of a compound of boron and hydrogen , and 20 years later Eamsay and Hatfieldf published a preliminary account of a research on the hydrides of boron , describing experiments which , even if they cannot be regarded as conclusive , opened up a field of investigation well worthy of attention .
They found that on passing the gas evolved by the action of dilute acids on magnesium boride through a bulb cooled in liquid air , a solid substance was deposited which , on warming the bulb , volatilised and could be collected as a gas .
From the results of the analysis of the gas , and its density , its formula appeared to be B3H3 ; but it appeared to consist of two isomeric substances , one stable , and the other unstable and readily decomposed by reagents .
The gas which was not condensed by liquid air appeared to consist mainly of hydrogen , but to contain a hydride or hydrides of boron .
Assuming the trivalency of boron , it is possible , as Eamsay and Hatfield point out , that a very large number of " hydroborons " may exist .
The simpler of these may be represented by the formulae:\#151 ; Borohydrates.\#151 ; Part I. Bangalore , and Eames Chandra Eay , M.Sc .

[ May 20 , They suggest that formulae e and / represent the " hydroborons " which are non-volatile at the temperature of liquid air , and that the volatile hydroboron is probably represented by formula a. The results of certain other experiments have been taken as evidence of the existence of solid hydroborons , but from the result of our own experiments it appears that the substances taking part in the reactions referred to may be more properly classed as " borohydrates , " as from our own investigation they appear to contain boron , hydrogen , and oxygen .
The experiments are of a purely qualitative character .
Reinitzer* investigated the yellow solution obtained by washing the product of the action of heat upon mixtures of potassium and boric acid with water .
The solution was concentrated and a solution of calcium chloride was added , when a greenish brown , slimy precipitate separated .
This , when dried in a desiccator over sulphuric acid , was found to contain 2-67 per cent , of hydrogen , and when heated in a tube it glowed , giving off a gas which burned with a green flame .
Ramsay and Hatfieldf observed that the residue obtained by treating magnesium boride with acid , when washed and dried , gave off torrents of hydrogen on heating .
It would serve no useful purpose to write the formulae for the various hydroxy derivatives , the borohydrates , which might be produced by replacing hydrogen by hydroxyl or oxygen in the hypothetical compounds of which the formulae are set down above .
Suffice it to point out that the types of groupings of atoms which can exist are not so numerous as in the case of carbon compounds , being limited to\#151 ; \#151 ; BHOH , \#151 ; B(OH)2 , \#151 ; BO , and =BOH .
If , however , hydroborons and borohydrates exist in which the boron is pentavalent , and from our experiments this appears to be possible , the problem becomes a much more complicated one , and one upon which it is unprofitable to speculate without first considering the facts .
Experimental Part .
( a ) Qualitative Experiments.\#151 ; When a mixture of two parts by weight of magnesium powder and one part by weight of anhydrous boric acid is heated to a bright red heat in an atmosphere of hydrogen , a grey mass is obtained which has .
generally been assumed to consist of a mixture of magnesium oxide with magnesium boride , BsMg3 , and free amorphous boron .
If the mass is reduced to powder and mixed with water the mixture becomes warm , gas is slowly evolved , and a solution is formed which is usually yellow in colour , and possesses certain properties which will be dealt with in this paper .

] Reference has already been made to the action of acid on the boride .
The acid liquid appears to behave towards many reagents in a manner similar to the solution obtained by the action of water alone , but its properties have not been fully studied .
The solution is slightly alkaline towards litmus .
On warming it deposits a slight gelatinous precipitate , and if boiled it gives off hydrogen gas .
It invariably possesses a peculiar odour , which is probably due to the presence of hydrides of boron .
On addition of dilute acids to the solution a considerable volume of gas is immediately evolved .
Though this gas possesses the characteristic odour of the liquid , and on explosion with oxygen burns with a green flame , repeated analyses have shown that it consists of hydrogen with not more than a trace of some boron compound .
Both the original solution and the solution to which acid has been added are powerful reducing agents .
The solutions absorb iodine , and precipitate the heavy metals from solutions of their salts .
A solution of silver nitrate gives an immediate black precipitate .
From a solution of mercuric chloride , mercurous chloride is first of all precipitated , and this turns grey in presence of excess of the reducing solution .
On addition of a small quantity of copper sulphate solution to the reducing solution , the latter first turns yellow , and on warming or standing precipitates what appears to be either a boride or amorphous boron as a dark browrn precipitate .
If a larger quantity of copper sulphate is used , and the solution is warmed , a red precipitate , which dissolves in a solution of potassium cyanide with evolution of gas , is thrown down .
This precipitate appears to be cuprous hydride , which can also be obtained by the action of a solution of a hypophosphite on a copper salt .
It appears to be most readily produced by the action of the copper sulphate on the acid solution of the boron derivative , the alkaline solution tending to precipitate amorphous boron .
The significance of this fact will be pointed out later .
A solution of a lead salt gives a yellowish white precipitate with the boron derivative , and this on standing or on warming turns black , forming metallic lead .
Other reactions , such as the reduction of ferrous to ferric salts , have also been studied .
Before passing on to describe the quantitative experiments which we have carried out , it will be well to point out that the yellow colour does not appear to be an intrinsic property of any compound present in the solutions , but to be due to colloidal boron .
The intensity of the colour does not appear to be in any way connected with the concentration or other property of any particular solution , and can be produced in any solution by the addition of a small quantity of a reducing agent .
If the solution is Dr. M. W. Travers and Mr. R. C. Ray .
[ May 20 , allowed to stand exposed to air the colour disappears , the solution remaining clear ; but if it is allowed to stand in vacuo it becomes colourless , and a slight brown precipitate is produced .
( b ) Preparation of Magnesium Boride.\#151 ; A mixture of one part by weight of anhydrous boric acid and two and a quarter parts by weight of magnesium powder was placed in a small graphite crucible , fitted with a lid through which passed an iron pipe connected with a hydrogen generator .
The crucible was heated in a gas injector furnace for about three quarters of an hour to a bright red heat , and was then allowed to cool down , hydrogen gas being passed into the crucible throughout the whole experiment .
When the crucible was cold it was found to contain a dark grey friable mass , which could be removed without difficulty and powdered in a porcelain mortar .
To remove excess of boric acid and to decompose traces of magnesium nitride the powdered boride was placed in a round-bottomed flask , fitted with a reflux condenser , and treated with methyl alcohol .
In the case of some samples of the boride a fairly violent reaction took place , and it was then necessary to cool the flask with water .
When , however , the reaction had subsided , the flask was heated on a water bath for some time , and then allowed to cool , and the methyl alcohol poured off and replaced by fresh methyl alcohol .
This operation was repeated several times .
It may be remarked that the methyl alcohol with which the boride had been treated possessed none of the properties of the solution obtained by treating the boride with water .
The boride was finally washed with methyl alcohol , and dried either in a desiccator or in an air bath .
( c ) Preparation of the Solution.\#151 ; When the powdered boride , prepared in the manner described in the last section , was mixed with water the mixture became warm , and the powder appeared to increase in bulk .
Gas was evolved , slowly at first , and more rapidly after the lapse of an hour or two .
In some experiments , which will be described later , the quantity of gas given off when the boride reacted with water , and the amount of the soluble boron compound produced at the same time were measured .
Altogether a large number of experiments were carried out , and , as the methods of preparation of the solutions differed considerably in points of detail , we have thought it advisable to catalogue them for future reference .

[ May 20 , ( d ) Analysis of the Solution.\#151 ; Qualitative examination of the solution obtained by treating the boride with water showed that it evolved hydrogen when treated with acids , and that both the original solution and the solution to which acid had been added absorbed iodine .
Beyond the elements of water the solution appeared to contain only boron and magnesium .
As the solution was most unstable it was necessary to carry out the various operations involved in the determination of the composition and properties of any particular sample simultaneously and as rapidly as possible .
It may here be pointed out that on account of the instability of the substances present in the solution , and of the complicated character of the changes which they appeared to undergo , no high degree of experimental accuracy was expected or looked for .
The reactions which have been studied are , however , of so marked a character as to make it difficult to misinterpret them , even when the experimental errors are obviously very large .
The following is a brief description of the experimental methods employed .
The solutions obtained by the methods described in the preceding section of the paper were diluted so that 5 or 10 c.c. of the liquid was available for each of the experiments which it was proposed to carry out .
The results are expressed in terms of the number of gramme-atoms of gas evolved , iodine absorbed , etc. , per 100 c.c. of the solution .
For the determination of the quantity of gas given off from the solution on the addition of dilute acid , a quantity of the solution was introduced by means of a pipette into a small distilling flask , which was fitted with a rubber stopper and tap-funnel , and connected with a Topler pump .
When the flask was exhausted dilute sulphuric acid was run into it through the tap-funnel , and the gas which was given off was collected through the pump and measured over mercury in a gas burette .
In many cases the gas was analysed by explosion with a measured quantity of oxygen , the excess of oxygen being afterwards absorbed by means of hot phosphorus .
In every case it was found that , though the gas burned with a green flame , the quantity of boron in it was extremely small .
The quantity of hydrogen evolved on the addition of acid to the solution , expressed in gramme-atoms per 100 c.c. of the solution , will hereafter be referred to as the " hydrogen equivalent " of the solution .
A decinormal solution of iodine in potassium iodide was used to determine the quantity of iodine absorbed by the solution .
As in the case of strong solutions of the boron compound hydrogen was evolved in small quantity on addition of the iodine , the experiment was always performed in the manner described in the last paragraph , the iodine solution being introduced from a pipette into the tap-funnel and allowed to flow thence into the flask .

] gas evolved was collected and measured .
As the reaction between the iodine and either the original solution or the solution to which acid had been added did not become complete till after some hours , the liquid was washed out of the flask and tap-funnel into a stoppered bottle which was placed in a dark cupboard .
After 24 hours the excess of iodine was determined by titration with a solution of sodium thiosulphate .
The quantity of iodine absorbed by the acid solution , expressed in gramme-atoms of iodine per 100 c.c. of solution , will hereafter be referred to as the " iodine equivalent " of the solution .
For the determination of the boron 5 or 10 c.c. of the solution was placed in a tube about 15 mm. in diameter and 300 mm. in length , sealed at one end .
A small test-tube , with a thin glass rod sealed to the closed end , and containing 2 to 3 c.c. of strong nitric acid , was also placed in the tube , which was afterwards sealed and heated for a day in a water-bath , or for a shorter period to 150 ' .
In the meantime a quantity of lime , about three times as much as would be required to absorb the whole of the nitric acid and the boric acid present in the solution in the tube , was ignited to constant weight in a platinum crucible .
Water was first added to the lime in the crucible , and afterwards the contents of the tube .
The liquid was evaporated by placing the crucible in an air bath and raising the temperature slowly to 170 ' .
The crucible was then again ignited to constant weight , the increase in weight giving the weight of the boric acid and magnesium oxide derived from the solution .
In some cases it was necessary to concentrate the solution obtained by washing out the tube , and it was found that this could be effected without loss of boric acid by allowing the liquid to stand overnight in a basin in an exhausted desiccator containing solid caustic potash .
For the determination of the magnesium a measured quantity of the solution was evaporated to dryness with hydrochloric acid and a few drops of nitric acid or bromine .
The residue was then transferred to a flask , methyl alcohol and a little strong hydrochloric acid were added , and the liquid distilled off .
This operation was repeated several times ; the residue was then transferred to a beaker , and the magnesium was precipitated in the usual manner and finally weighed as magnesium pyrophosphate .

] ( e ) Discussion of the Results of the foregoing Experiments.\#151 ; From the foregoing experiments it is obvious that the hydrogen and iodine equivalents lie between very sharply defined limits , being either as 1 is to 1 or as 2 is to 1 , and generally approach to one value or to the other .
It also appears that the solutions contain one atom of boron for every atom of hydrogen given off on the addition of acid .
Supposing , therefore , that by the action of the iodine the boron in the solution is completely oxidised to boric acid , it would be possible to represent the changes taking place in the solution by means of the equations:\#151 ; Action of acid Action of iodine . .
B402 + 2H20 = B404 + 2H2 , B4O3 + 2H20 = B405 + 2H2 .
B4O4 + 2I2 4- 2H20 B4O6 -f- 4:111 , .B4O5+ I2+ H20 = B4O6 + 2HI .
'It appeared , at first sight , that these equations would fully explain the behaviour of the solutions .
Further experiments , which will now be described , prove , however , that such explanation is altogether inadequate .
( f ) Further Experiments with the Solution.\#151 ; The following experiments were undertaken with a view to determining whether it would be possible to obtain the boron derivative , or derivatives , free from water .
A measured quantity of the solution was introduced into a density bulb A ( fig. 1 ) , Fig. 1 .
which had previously been exhausted and weighed against a counterpoise in the usual manner .
The bulb was connected with the vessel B , which in the earlier experiments contained calcium chloride , and was cooled with water , but in the later experiments was empty , and was immersed in liquid air .
The apparatus was connected with a Topler pump through the stopcock b , and during the process of exhaustion the stopcocks a and b were opened alternately , so that any liquid evaporating from A was condensed in B. Dr. M. W. Travers and Mr. R. C. Ray .
[ May 20 , When liquid air was used to cool the vessel B the evaporation of the liquid in A proceeded very rapidly , and it was necessary to place the bulb in a basin of water at about 25 ' to prevent the liquid in it from freezing .
It was possible to evaporate about 15 c.c. of liquid in less than three quarters of an hour .
During the evaporation little or no gas was evolved , nor did any solid separate out from the solution , but as the liquid disappeared a viscous substance formed in the bottom of the bulb .
The latter observation points to the conclusion that the solutions contained little or no free boric acid .
At the moment at which the last trace of liquid disappeared the viscous residue began to evolve gas rapidly , the evolution of gas continuing till the viscous material had set to a semi-crystalline or glassy solid .
At this point the rate of the evolution of gas became very slow , and when the gas was removed from the apparatus and measured it was found that volume was equal to one-half the volume of the gas given off on addition of acid to the original solution .
Though when the evaporation of the liquid was carried out rapidly in the manner described above practically no gas was evolved till the residue became viscous , if the liquid was allowed to remain in an exhausted vessel for some time it gave off hydrogen .

0*0004 If the bulb containing the solid residue was allowed to remain in connection with the pump , gas continued to be evolved slowly , but after a time the evolution of gas ceased altogether .
If this gas was collected and measured it was found that its volume was equal to the volume of gas evolved at the moment that the liquid disappeared .
The rate at which the second quantity of hydrogen was evolved depended upon the degree of dryness of the residue in the bulb , and was much more rapid if calcium chloride was used as a dehydrating agent than if the bulb was connected to the pump through a tube containing pentoxide of phosphorus , or through one immersed in liquid air .
The addition of water to the contents of the bulb and re-evaporation of the liquid resulted in the immediate evolution of a considerable volume of gas , thus:\#151 ; No. of Solution , 16 .

] The addition of dilute acid to the contents of the bulb after evaporation of the liquid produced the same result , the quantity of gas given off , together with the gas evolved on evaporation of the liquid , being equal to the quantity of gas evolved on addition of acid to the original solution .
If when the bulb had been allowed to remain in connection with the pump till the evolution of gas had ceased it was gently heated with a Bunsen burner , a further quantity of gas sensibly equal to the quantity evolved on , or subsequently on standing , was given off .
If the ratio of the hydrogen and iodine equivalents of the original solution was as 1 is to 1 the contents of the bulb after heating absorbed a quantity of iodine approximately equivalent to the quantity of hydrogen evolved at either of the three stages already described .
If , on the other hand , the ratio of the equivalents was as 2 is to 1 the residue did not absorb iodine .
The results of these experiments may be expressed thus :\#151 ; Ratio of hydrogen to iodine equivalents in original solution ... ... . .
1/ 1 2/ 1 Hydrogen evolved on addition of acid to the original solution ... ... . .
2 2 Iodine absorbed by acid solution ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
2 1 Hydrogen evolved on evaporation ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 1 Hydrogen evolved on standing or on addition of acid to the residue ... 1 1 Hydrogen evolved on heating ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 1 Iodine absorbed by r esidue ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
1 0 If , when the residue in it had become solid , the bulb was weighed , and if it was again weighed after standing for some time or even after being heated , it was found that the loss of weight was equal to the weight of the hydrogen evolved .
It appears , therefore , that the loss of hydrogen is not accompanied by the loss of water or of any boron compound in appreciable quantity .
From the original weight of the exhausted bulb , and the weight of the exhausted bulb containing the residue , the weight of the latter could be directly determined .
From the quantity of iodine absorbed by the residue it was possible to calculate the quantity of oxygen required to oxidise it to B2O3 , and knowing the quantity of magnesium oxide present in the solution , the quantity of boron in the residue could be obtained by difference .
In every experiment it was found that while Ratio of number of atoms of H evolved on addition of acid to original solution to number of atoms of B in solution =1/ 1 , Ratio of number of atoms of H evolved on addition of acid to original solution to number of atoms of B in residue = 2/ 1 .
It appears , therefore , that during the process of evaporation one-half the boron evaporates with the liquid .
It has been proved conclusively that it Dr. M. W. Travers and Mr. R. C. Ray .
[ May 20 , is not given off as a gas and collected with the hydrogen , and further , that it passes into the distillate before even the whole of the first fraction of hydrogen has been evolved .
It must , therefore , remain in the distillate , which , it may be remarked , gives off no gas when warmed to the air temperature in vacuo , but in what form has not been fully determined .
It has been observed that , except in one experiment in which the solution was very dilute , the distillate absorbed only a very small quantity of iodine , indeed , not more than could be fully accounted for by the fact that in the second formula set down above the ratio is always somewhat greater than 2 to 1 , indicating that some slight secondary reaction takes place , or that a small quantity of the non-volatile boron derivative , which is a powerful reducing agent , is invariably carried over with the distillate .
If this is the case the boron compound which distils over must be fully oxidised , and must have the formula ( B203)n .
That it is not boric acid is proved by the following experiments .
In the first place , supposing that it might be boric acid , an attempt was made to estimate it by the lime method already described .
It was found that the lime did not increase in weight .
It may be added that the sample of the distillate had stood for some days in a closed tube containing air , a condition under which a lower boron derivative would probably have been at least partially oxidised to boric acid .
Further , it was proved that under similar conditions boric acid is practically non-volatile with water vapour , so that any boric acid present in the original solution must ultimately be found in the residue in the bulb and not in the distillate .
It appears to us that it is necessary to assume that there exists a substance of the formula '(B203)n which is not an acid .
In the case of a carbon compound such an assumption would require but little justification ; and it finds support in the work of Bamsay and Hatfield , which points to the existence of isomeric compounds amongst the hydrides of boron .

[ May 20 , ( g ) Further Discussion of the Experimental Results.\#151 ; Assuming that the distillate contains a compound isomeric with boric acid it is now possible to explain the whole of the reactions which we have studied .
If , as was suggested before , the substances first formed in the original solution are hydrated derivatives of the oxides B4O2 and B403 these compounds must spontaneously undergo changes such as are represented by the equations:\#151 ; B4O2 + 3H2O = ( B2O3 ) + B202H6 , and B403 + 3H20 = ( B203 ) + B203H6 , the symbol ( B203 ) representing the non-acid and volatile isomer of boric acid .
The changes which take place on addition of acid to the original solution are represented by\#151 ; B2O2H6 = B2O2H2+ 2H2 , and B203H6 \#151 ; B303H2 4* 2H2 .
On evaporation of the original solution\#151 ; B2O2H6 \#151 ; B2O2H4 4 " H2 , B203He \#151 ; B203H4 4HaOn standing\#151 ; B2O2H4 = B2O2H2 + H2 , B203H4 = B203H2 + H2 .
On heating the residue\#151 ; B2O2H2 \#151 ; B202+H^ B203H2 = B203 -f- H2 .
Finally , if the ratio of the hydrogen to the iodine equivalent in the original solution had been as 2 :1 , the residue , after heating , would absorb no iodine , otherwise it would absorb iodine in accordance with the equation B202 4- H20 4- 21 = Ba03+2HL Until more concentrated solutions have been obtained and the molecular weights of the substances in solution have been determined , it is impossible to express a very definite opinion as to their constitution .
The compound of which the formula has been written B202H6 might , indeed , have been assigned the simpler formula BOH3 , or BH2OH , but if this formula is accepted it is not easy to explain the changes which the compound undergoes when treated with acid or when its solution is evaporated .
It is much more likely that the compound is a polymer of BOH3 containing pentavalent boron .
Before leaving the subject we wish to call attention to the close analogy which exists between the properties of the solutions of the borohydrates and solutions of hypophosphites on the one hand and of hydroxylamine salts on Borohydrates .
1912 .
] the other .
The fact that the solution of the borohydrates gives with copper sulphate solution a precipitate which closely resembles " copper hydride " may be taken as evidence that hypoborous acid is one of the decomposition products , a view which is supported by the fact that one of these products , viz. , B202H2 , may be looked upon as a derivative of B20 and H20 , just as hypophosphorous acid may be regarded as a product of P20 and 3H20 .
However , it is much more likely that the similarity is due to the presence of the group ^XHOH .
Generally speaking , the solution of the boron compounds exhibits marked similarity in its properties to a solution of hydroxyl-amine , as will be apparent if the properties of the latter are compared with those described on p. 165 .
( h ) The Reaction between the Boride and Water.\#151 ; In describing the method of preparation of the solutions used in these experiments it has been noted that in some cases the boride was allowed to react with water vacuo .
In these cases the gas which was evolved was collected through the pump and its volume was measured .
At the end of the experiment the flask containing the mixture was detached from the pump , the contents were rapidly filtered by means of a water pump , and the filtrate was made up to 100 c.c. for analysis .
The following results were obtained:\#151 ; Table III .

For every atom of boron passing into solution four atoms of hydrogen would be evolved , and the solution when treated with dilute acid would evolve one atom of hydrogen .
According to the experiments which we have carried out the quantity of hydrogen evolved is almost exactly one-half of that required by the equation .
These experimental results , and the fact that a large quantity of boride gives but a very small yield of soluble boron derivative , led us to the Borohydrates .
conclusion that there must exist compounds of boron and magnesium other than the compound B2Mg3 .
The existence of a compound B4Mg2 would fully account for the formation of the soluble boron derivatives thus:\#151 ; B4Mg2 -|- 6H20 = 2Mg(OH)2 -f- B402 -t- 4H2 .
It is also possible that the solution may result from the interaction of water with an oxy-derivative of boron and magnesium present in the mixture , obtained by heating boric acid and magnesium powder .
This matter requires further investigation , but we think it worth while to record the results of two other experiments which we have carried out .
In the first experiment a small quantity of boric acid was heated with three times its weight of magnesium powder in a silica tube , and allowed to cool down in a current of hydrogen .
The contents of the tube were then transferred to a clean silica tube , and heated in vacuo for half an hour , when the whole of the free magnesium volatilised and condensed in the cool part of the tube .
On cooling , it was found that the lower end of the tube contained a grey friable mass , which dissolved readily in 20-per-cent , nitric acid on warming on a water-bath , leaving only 4'5 per cent , of insoluble residue .
On analysis it was found that the substance contained only 36 per cent , of magnesium instead of 67 per cent. , which should have been present if the product of the reaction were B2Mg3 and MgO .
In a second experiment a mixture of 8 grm. of boric acid and 24 grm. of magnesium powder was heated in a silica flask for half an hour , and allowed to cool down in an atmosphere of hydrogen .
The product of the reaction , which contained a large excess of magnesium , was crushed in a mortar and placed in a flask , and about 60 c.c. of water was added , the flask being cooled with water .
After four hours , about 50 c.c. of liquid , which was of a deep yellow colour , was filtered off by means of a water pump .
The following is the result of the analysis of the liquid :\#151 ; Hydrogen equivalent ... ... 0'00654 Iodine equivalent ... ... ... 0-01184 Magnesium ... ... ... ... ... .
0D154 Boron ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
0T220 It will be noticed that the iodine equivalent is twice the value of the hydrogen equivalent , and that the quantities of boron and magnesium in the solution are very much greater than in any of the solutions previously investigated .
The solution coagulated on warming , forming a translucent jelly .
This experiment was repeated , and the results , so far as the determination of the hydrogen and iodine equivalents and the behaviour of the solution on heating are concerned , were confirmed .
The residue , on further A Chemically Active Modification 179 treatment with water for successive periods , gave decreasing values'for the ratio of the iodine to the hydrogen equivalent .
The results of these experiments , though in themselves somewhat inconclusive , are worth recording , since they indicate that the reactions between boric acid and magnesium are by no means simple ones , and that further study of them may lead to the discovery of new compounds of magnesium and boron , of magnesium , boron , and oxygen , and also of new compounds of boron , oxygen , and hydrogen .
This is a field of research which has not yet been explored , and we propose to continue our investigations upon the earliest opportunity .

General .
The properties of active nitrogen have been described throughout on the assumption that it is to be classed with other chemical substances , and that its reversion to ordinary nitrogen is to be regarded simply as a chemical reaction , as one would regard the change of ozone to oxygen , or of red to ordinary phosphorus .
I see no reason to abandon this position .
There are , however , some circumstances not at first sight falling in very naturally with it .
One of these is the acceleration of the change by cooling , f a phenomenon without parallel in any recognised reaction .
Another is the development of many of the bands of the nitrogen spectrum . !
This spectrum has never been produced by any other purely chemical process , but ( apart from active nitrogen ) is only observed when an electric current is actually passing through the gas at the moment of observation .
Lastly , the ionisation associated with a stream of glowing nitrogen has suggested serious doubts whether its chemical peculiarities are really due to the presence of a definite chemical substance in the ordinary sense , or to some unexplained survival of * I , 'ltoy .
