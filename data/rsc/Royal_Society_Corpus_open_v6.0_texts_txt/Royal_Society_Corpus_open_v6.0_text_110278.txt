A paper was read , entitled , " Experiments on the Length of the Seconds ' Pendulum ; made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich .
" By Captain Edward Sabine , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R.S. The experiments described in this paper were made with the original convertible pendulum constructed by Capt. Kater , and employed by the author inPortland Place , in the year 1817 ; except that the tail pieces were removed , and the moveable weight dispensed with : and they were made on the vacuum apparatus established in the south-west angle of the Pendulum-room , the place assigned for it by the Astronomer Royal .
Having had reason to suspect that the retardation of the vibrations of the pendulum performed in circular arcs , when the weight was above , was greater than that assigned by the formula commonly employed , the author first investigates the correction necessary to be applied from this cause .
He next ascertains the reduction to a vacuum for the small residue of air which the apparatus still contained , or for the small portion which may have introduced itself by leakage .
The alteration of rate for each degree of Fahrenheit is then determined to be 0.441 , a quantity almost exactly the same as that which was deduced from a former inquiry .
The result of the present inquiry is , that the vibra ?
tions of Captain Kater 's pendulum , which at 57 ?
were found to be 86069.1 are at 62 ?
, 86066.9 .
At this latter temperature , the length of the seconds pendulum , in vacuo , would be 39.13734 inches .
Tabular details of the experiments accompany the paper .
