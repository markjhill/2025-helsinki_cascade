Magnetic Work.\#151 ; No change has been made in the Magnetographs , which have worked continuously during the year .
The curves obtained have been , as a rule , devoid of interest , no disturbance of note having been registered for some time .
Owing to wear , the vertical force cylinder bearing has become loose in its seat , and it will be necessary shortly to make a new fitting for it .
In consequence of the illness of some of the members of the Sub-Committee mentioned in the last report , as appointed to consider the best means of utilising the accumulate^ records of the Magnetographs , no decision has yet been arrived at in the matter .
At the request of Professor Balfour Stewart the absolute diurnal range of the declination needle has been determined for every day for the period 1858 to 1873 .
The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined in January , in accordance with the usual practice .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been made regularly by Mr. Figg , and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix I of this report .
The magnetic instruments have been studied and a knowledge of | their manipulation obtained by Mr. D. Gill , the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope , and Mr. H. I. Bell , the recently appointed | Assistant to the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius .
Report of the Ke Committee .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various data have been supplied to the Hydrographic Office , Dr. B. Van Ryckevorsel , Dr. Atkinson , Dr. Thorpe , Mr. Elliott , Mr. Fleming , and Mr. Gordon .
To the last-named gentleman the Committee also lent illustrations of the magnetographs and other magnetic instruments employed at Kew for use in a work he has in preparation upon Electricity and Magnetism .
The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations made during the year:\#151 ; \#187 ; Determinations of Horizontal Intensity ... ... ... ... 29 " Dip ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 123 " Absolute Declination ... ... ... ... 26 Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of atmospheric pressure , tem-.perature , humidity , wind ( direction and velocity ) , and rain have been maintained in regular operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by Mr. J. Hillier .
The standard thermometer ( Ho. 379 ) for eye observations of the temperature of evaporation was accidentally broken in September whilst re-covering the thermograph tube with new muslin .
A spare thermometer ( No. 473 ) of the same construction was at once set up in its place , so that no loss took place in the registrations .
The standard eye observations made five times daily , for the control \#166 ; of the automatic records , have been duly registered through the year , together with the daily observations at Oh .
45m .
p.m. in connexion with the Washington synchronous system .
An additional daily observation has been made since July 1st at 6 h. 45 m. p.m. , to be used in a second synchronous system organised by ML Mascart , Directeur du Bureau Central Meteorologique , Paris .
The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly carried on by Mr. Hawkesworth , and copies of these , as well as of the eye observations , with notes of weather and cloud , have been transmitted weekly to the Meteorological Office .

In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council to the Kew Committee , the Observatories at Aberdeen , Armagh , Falmouth , Glasgow , Stonyhurst , and Valencia , have been visited and their instruments inspected by Mr. Whipple during his vacation .
Mr. Baker , also in consequence of a request of the Meteorological Council , visited Stonyhurst Observatory in January last , and readjusted the thermograph , which had accidentally been deranged during the frost .
With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to and published by the " Times , " * " Illustrated London News , " " Mid-Surrey Times , " and " Torquay Directory , " and meteorological data have been supplied amongst others to the editor of " Symons ' Monthly Meteorological Magazine , " Professor B. Stewart , Dr. Rowland , Mr. Greaves , C.E. , and the Institute of Mining Engineers .
Copies of selected photographic curves have been fnade and supplied to M. Mascart .
Electrograph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in continuous action through the year under the care of Mr. Constable .
It was found necessary in August to dismount and clean the instrument in order to restore its power of keeping a full charge of electricity , which had become somewhat impaired .
On consideration it was deemed inadvisable to alter the bifilar suspension as suggested in last year 's report , but the Mascart insulating stands were fixed for the support of the water-dropping cistern , and the action of the instrument has been greatly improved by their adoption , so that strong charges of electricity are now registered even in the dampest weather .
Some trouble was experienced in maintaining a constant flow of water from the jet during the severe frosts of last winter , but it was not considered necessary to make special arrangements for heating the * A detailed investigation was made in the month of January into the accuracy of the weekly meteorological records published in " The Times .
" The result on the whole was very favourable , the principal difference being found in the rainfall , which is usually given in excess of the true amount .
Report of the Kew .
water in the cistern , a spare jet kept in readiness being screwed on when the other was observed to be frozen .
Photo-heliograph.\#151 ; The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures , as noticed in the last report , was completed in January , and the preliminary reductions of have been steadily carried on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. McLaughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose .
It is expected that the above reductions will be completed by the end of the present year , or early in 1880 .
Mr. Marth is still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric elements of the pictures from January , 1864 , to April , 1870 , inclusive .
All these operations have been conducted under the direction and at the expense of Mr. De La Rue .
The eye observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , as described in the report for 1872 , have been made on 151 days , in order to maintain for the present the continuity of the Kew records of sun-spots .
The sun 's surface was observed to be free from spots on 113 of those days .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; Seventy-eight observations have been made of sun-transits for the purpose of obtaining correct local time at the Observatory .
Eighty-six clock and chronometer comparisons have also been made .
This work is performed by Mr. Constable .
Extra Observations.\#151 ; The four solar-radiation thermometers and one terrestrial-radiation were observed daily until the 3rd of August , when all , with the exception of one bla ck bulb thermometer , were completely destroyed by the great hailstorm which occurred on that date .
Since then only one , the remaining black bulb , and a new terrestrial radiation thermometer have been daily observed .
The Campbell sunshine recorder , described in the Report for 1875 , continues in action , and the improved form of the instrument , giving a separate record for every day of the duration of sunshine , has been regularly worked throughout the year , and its curves tabulated .
Two papers based upon these records have been read by the Superintendent before the Meteorological Society , and published in their Quarterly Journal .
The first , " On the Relation between the Duration of Sunshine , the amount of Solar Radiation , and the Temperature indicated by the Black Bulb Thermometer , " printed in vol. v , p. 142 , shows that these three phenomena are intimately connected with each other , the curves resulting from the plotting down of the daily values given by the three instruments rising and falling together almost all through the year .
The second paper , published in vol. v , p. 213 , on " The Duration of bunshine , Extent of Sky clouded , and the Height of the Barometer , " proves that at the Kew Observatory the amount of cloud varies Report of the K Committee .
inversely as the barometric pressure between the limits of 29*0 and 30'3 inches , the variation being most rapid between 29 8 and 30*1 inches .
Also that above 30'3 inches cloud increases with increasing pressure , attaining the mean about 30-5 inches , and rising above it at 30'6 inches .
' Various experiments have been made with the sunshine-recorder from time to time with the view of improving its efficiency , and new instruments with certain modifications of the Kew pattern have been submitted for approval by Messrs. Beck and Mr. Casella .
Wind Component Integrator.\#151 ; The numerous adjustments and electrical contacts , altogether 190 in number , of this instrument , render it particularly subject to derangement in this country , the damp atmosphere causing frequent failures in the electrical actions , and the high winds constantly shaking the screws loose .
The continual necessity for readjustment causing a greater demand upon the time of the Observatory staff than the Committee feel themselves justified in bestowing upon it , they have reluctantly decided upon dismounting it , and it will shortly be returned to South Kensington , to be again set up in the Loan Collection of scientific apparatus .
Photo-nephoscope.\#151 ; At the request of the Meteorological Council this instrument , which was mentioned in the last Report , was , in March , placed in the hands of Captain Abney , R.E. , F.R.S. , that gentleman having kindly offered to make some experiments with it .
Exposure of Thermometers.\#151 ; Experiments have been for some time in progress at the Observatory with the view of determining the relative merits of different patterns of thermometer screens .
For this purpose there have been erected on the lawn a Stevenson 's screen , of the ordinary English pattern , and a large wooden cage , containing a Wild 's screen , of the pattern employed in Russia .
Each of these screens contains a dry and wet bulb thermometer , and a maximum and minimum , all of which are read daily at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. , their indications being compared with those of the thermogi$ph at the same hours .
A third portable metal screen , designed by Mr. De La Rue for use on shipboard , which contains a dry bulb thermometer only , is also carried out by the observer , and read at the same time as the fixed instruments .
The cost of these experiments is borne by the Meteorological Council .
Glycerine Barometer.\#151 ; Mr. J. Jordan , having obtained a grant from the Government Fund of the Royal Society for the construction of a glycerine barometer , applied to the Committee for permission to erect it in the Observatory .
This they willingly granted , and they also undertook to read it regularly for one year .
It has accordingly been set up in the building , but owing to its great length , thirty feet , some difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable situation for it .
Eventually it was decided to fix the cistern ( which was first ascertained to be constructed of non-magnetic materials ) , in the magnetoReport of the Ke Committee .
graph room , to lead the tube of composition metal up through the entrance hall , and to put up the upper part of glass , with the verniers and divided scales , in the north library in a convenient position for reading .
It was successfully filled , by Mr. Jordan , with glycerine ( coloured red ) , and has since its erection been read five times daily , simultaneously with the standard mercurial barometer .
Bogen 's Barometers.\#151 ; Mr. E. Bogen has deposited two of the patent standard cistern siphon barometers , described by him in the " Quarterly Journal Met .
Soc. , " vol. v , p. 137 , in the Observatory , with the request that comparisons might be made between the disk reading and the ordinary method of reading barometers .
Mr. Bogen visited the Observatory , on several occasions , to give instructions as to the proper method of filling , setting up , and reading his instruments .
Mr. Bogen has also submitted for trial an improved Artificial Horizon .
The Be La Rue Evaporation Gauge.\#151 ; The Vice-Chairman of the Committee has devised a small evaporation gauge , by means of which the water given off from a continually-wetted sheet of vegetable parchment is measured daily .
Two of these instruments , constructed by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra , are now at Kew , and their indications have been noted every day , at 10 A.M. , for the past six weeks .
The Be La Rue Anemograph.-\#151 ; The Meteorological Council , having now in use Thomson 's Harmonic Analyser , instructed the Superintendent to again test the anemograph designed by Mr. De La Rue , for the purpose of indicating at once , without replotting , the horizontal movement of the wind from hour to hour .
The instrument , when tried at the Observatory in 1872 , was found to be somewhat defective in its working , as , owing to the mechanical arrangements for returning the pencil to zero , its indications were left unrecorded for intervals varying from three to four minutes every hour .
An electrical attachment has now been substituted for part of the mechanism , so as to reduce the time lost to about twenty seconds hourly , and the instrument is at present working in thb experimental house .
The spare Barograph , belonging to the Meteorological Office , is also erected in the experimental house , for the purpose of trying various photographic processes suggested from time to time as desirable substitutes for those now employed in the preparation of the eurves for the registering instruments .
At the request of Professor Stokes , a series of comparisons has been made between a Hodgkinson 's Actinometer , returned to England for repair by Mr. Hennessey of Calcutta , and the three standard instruments retained in this country for reference .
Pendulum Observations.\#151 ; The Committee have had their attention directed to an ambiguity in a paper by Messrs. B. Stewart and Loewy , Report of the Kew Committee .
on the corrections to be applied to Pendulum Observations printed in the " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. xvii , p. 488 .
It is there stated , on p. 489 , that the observations were made with a reversible pendulum , and on p. 497 , with Kater 's invariable pendulum .
After a careful investigation the Committee find that only , one pendulum was employed throughout the whole series of experiments , and that pendulum was Kater 's convertible pendulum , designated in the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Apparatus as " the basis of the present system of British Weights and Measures .
" The original observations stated in the paper to be preserved at the Kew Observatory cannot at present be found , and the authors are unable to afford the Committee any information as to what has become of them .
Verifications.\#151 ; The following magnetic instruments have been verified , and their constants have been determined:\#151 ; A Dip-circle , by Barrow and Co. , for the Austro-Hungarian Government .
A Dip-circle , by J. Dover , for Dr. Guido Schenzl , Budapest .
A pair of Dipping-needles for Professor Smirnow , Kasan .
There have also been purchased on commission and verified:\#151 ; A Unifilar , Dip-circle , and Pox Circle , together with the apparatus for the determination of temperature and induction co-efficients of Magnets , for Professor Greene , Bureau of Navigation , Washington .
A Unifilar for Professor Houzeau , Brussels Observatory .
A Unifilar and Dip-circle for Professor Young , Princetown , United States .
A Unifilar for Senhor Capello , Lisbon Observatory .
A Bifilar for Captain Will , Norwegian Navy .
A Dip-circle for Lieutenant van Hasselt , Utrecht .
A pair of Dipping-needles for ^Professor Ferrari , Rome .
And a Tabulator for Don Cecilio Pujazon , San Fernando .
There are at present undergoing verification a Dip-circle for Dr. Mielberg of Tiflis , and a Dip-circle for Mr. Casella .
Although there has been a slight falling off in the total number of barometers verified as compared with last year , yet as regards thermometers the result is highly satisfactory , the number of these instruments having considerably increased .
This is due to the great demand for verified clinical thermometers .
The branch still continues under the charge of Mr. T. W. Baker , who is assisted by Messrs. J. Foster , T. Gunter , and C. Taylor .
The following are the numbers of instruments examined : Report of the Kew Committee .

4828 Besides these 53 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested , the greater number of which were sobjected in the hydraulic press , without injury , to strains exceeding three and a-half tons on the square inch .
8 Thermometers have been compared at the freezing point of mercury .
Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 54 cases .
12 Standard Thermometers have been calibrated and divided , a set of three being specially constructed for the experiments on Air Thermometers now in progress under Dr. Thorpe at Leeds .
2 Thermograph Tubes were examined for the Zi-Ka-Wei Observatory , Shanghai .
A pair of special Thermometers have been selected , verified , and forwarded to the .Royal Observatory , Naples .
The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified:\#151 ; Hydrometers ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

4 Theodolites ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 5 There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , 26 Barometers , 400 Thermometers , and 4 Rain Gauges .
The comparison of Messrs. Hottinger 's Aneroids being completed , the Superintendent drew up an account of the instruments and their performance , which he read before the Meteorological Society .
The paper was published in the " Quarterly Journal , " vol. v , p. 189 , and the Aneroids were transferred to the care of Mr. Hicks , whom Messrs. Hottinger have appointed their agent in this country .
Several attempts made to verify Thermometers at high temperatures having failed , it is intended to construct a special apparatus Report of the Kew Committee .
453 when its pattern shall have been definitely decided upon .
Experiments for this purpose are still in progress .
The Committee finding that the " Hall Mark " for Thermometers was not adopted by opticians , owing to the fact that a charge was made for engraving it , decided , in December , to mark all Thermometers verified at the Observatory free of cost .
This resolution having been advertised in the leading scientific journals , and a special assistant , H. Clements , having been engaged for the purpose , the K. O. monogram and register number have been etched upon every Thermometer tested since the beginning of the present year .
As the " Hall Mark " advertisements caused numerous inquiries to be made respecting the verification of instruments , the Committee took advantage of the opportunity to issue a new and revised scale of fees chargeable for this service .
Air Thermometer.\#151 ; The construction of the Standard Air Thermometer has been delayed , in order that the Committee might be enabled to adopt certain improvements which have been suggested by Professors Thorpe and Rucker , who are at present engaged in making an elaborate and accurate comparison between the mercurial and air thermometers .
At the invitation of Professor Thorpe , Mr. Whipple recently visited the Yorkshire College of Science , Leeds , in order to witness the experiments in progress . .
The difference between the old Royal Society Standard Barometer and the Kew standards having been well determined , the daily comparisons were brought to a close in March last .
The former instrument is to be shortly returned to Burlington House , and again set up in the apartments of the Royal Society .
Owing to an accident to the Gal ton Thermometer-testing apparatus , and the increased risk incurred in marking the Thermometers , the breakage of Thermometers has been slightly larger than usual during the past year , but it has only amounted to about one-half per cent , of the total number verified .
Some very old Standard Thermometers having been recently tested , the Superintendent has been instructed to draw up an account of the changes in their indications , for presentation to the Royal Society .
A new form of thermometer has been designed by Mr. Whipple , and constructed by Mr. Hicks , for the purposes of conveying indication of temperature to a distance by means of electricity without the necessity of employing intervening clockwork .
Professor W. G. Adams has kindly consented to make a set of experiments with this apparatus in the laboratory of King 's College .
Waxed Paper , fyc .
, supplied.\#151 ; Waxed paper has been supplied to the following Observatories :\#151 ; Report of the Kew Committee .
Bombay , Mauritius , Montsouris , San Fernando , and four Observatories of the Meteorological Council .
Anemograph sheets have also been sent to the Mauritius Observatory , and blank forms for the entry of magnetic observations to the Horton Observatory , the Bureau of Navigation , Washington , and the Owens College .
Loan Exhibition.\#151 ; With the exception of the Hodgkinson 's Actino-meter and the three instruments mentioned in last year 's report , the instruments specified in the Report for 1876 still remain in charge of the Science and Art Department , South Kensington .
Anemometer Testing.\#151 ; The Committee have had before them the question of the desirability of erecting a suitable apparatus for the testing of Anemometers and Air-meters ; but in the opinion of Dr. Robinson it will be better to postpone its erection for a time .
Mauritius Observatory.\#151 ; The Earl of Carnarvon , Secretary of State for the Colonies , having requested the Committee to nominate a suitable person to the appointment of First Assistant at the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , they eventually selected Mr. Herbert Irving Bell , Laureate of the Royal College of Mauritius in 1875 , from amongst a number of candidates .
The Crown Agents having approved of their choice , Mr. Bell went through a course of training in observatory work , both at the Kew Observatory and at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , before he sailed for Mauritius on October 6th .
WorksJiop .
\#151 ; The several pieces of Mechanical Apparatus , such as the Whitworth Lathe and Planing Machine , procured by Grants from either the Government Grant Funds or.the Donation Fund for the use of the Kew Observatory , have been kept in thorough order , and many of them are in constant , and others in occasional , use at the Observatory , but the funds of the Committee do not at present allow of the employment of a mechanical assistant , although one is much needed .
Library.\#151 ; During the year the Library has received , as presents , the publications of 11 English Scientific Societies and Institutions , 46 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Societies and Institutions .
A large number of scientific works have also been presented to the Library by General Sir E. Sabine , and duplicate copies of works already in the Observatory have been presented to Dr. Hinrichs .

APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , hat .
51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. , hong .
Oh lm 1581 W. , for the year October 1878 to September 1879 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 046108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.Gr .
S. measure are also given .
The value of log w3K employed in the reduction is 1'64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient p is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0*0001194(\#163 ; o\#151 ; 35 ) + 0*000,000,213(*0- 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , * corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently ?
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction f=5'(1-|\gt ; 19 In each , observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected about a quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F. G* .
