" Experiments undertaken during the Summer , 1880 , at Yvoire ( 1,280 feet ) , Courmayeur ( 3,945 feet ) , and the ' Col de G\#163 ; ant ' ( 11,030 feet ) , on the Influence of Altitude on Respiration .
" By William Maroet , M.D. , F.R.S. Received January 24 , 1881 .
Former communications on the influence of altitude on respiration have appeared in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society " for 1878 and 1879 .
I have continued the inquiry ; and my present object is to give an account of my latest investigations on that subject .
I must beg leave to premise that a work of this kind is not free from difficulties ; some of these are of a physiological nature , and refer to the task of taking into account the different circumstances bearing on the state of the body at the time of the experiment ; respiration is , if I may so express it , so delicately balanced in its relations with the other functions , that any one of them becoming either quiescent or in a state of activity reacts immediately upon it .
Then the capacity of the bags for collecting the air expired gave some little trouble to determine accurately ; and , moreover , the manipulations , which would require both care and practice to be carried on satisfactorily in a laboratory where all that can be wanted is at hand , were found much less easy to perform in the open air , at the summit of some high mountain , in a cold cutting wind , and where the omission of a trifling article , such as a cork or a piece of string , might render much labour useless .
There is also a circumstance in a work of this kind having a tendency to detract from the value of its results , inasmuch as what is observed with one person may not apply to another .
It is not easy to find many people ready to submit to a stay of several days in the Alps , at altitudes ranging up to 10,000 feet and above ; and I know by experience that the increased length of time required to repeat the experiments on different persons may prove very inconvenient .
This last summer , however , I was most fortunate in obtaining the company and help of a young gentleman from Geneva , M. Elie David , the assistant of the Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of that town , Professor Wart-mann .
M. David submitted to experiment with great patience and much intelligence , and the results obtained on both of us may be accepted as perfectly trustworthy .
My method of investigation has been much improved since my last paper was communicated to the Royal Society , and the substitution of the vacuum process for the aspiration with water , in order to transfer air from the bag into the cylinder for analysis , has added not a little to the accuracy of the results .
New and larger india-rubber bags than those used at first have been made , of improved material , and 1881 .
] On the Influence of Altitude upon Respiration .
419 their capacity has been determined with the greatest care by means of a gas-holder or bell-jar , having a scale of cubic feet divided into hundredths and tested as to correctness .
I must beg to take this opportunity of returning my best thanks to Mr. Henry Sporne , Inspector of Gras Meters for the city of London , for his kindness in determining in my presence the capacity of the bag used in these experiments , by means of one of his beautifully graduated gas-holders , made for testing the delivery of gas meters .
The capacity of others of my experimental bags was ascertained by the same means .
The bulk of air held by the bag employed in all the experiments referred to in the present communication was determined as follows :\#151 ; The gas-holder having been filled with air , and the pressure of the instrument regulated to one inch of water , it was placed in communication with the bag laying flat and quite empty on a table .
This bag was also connected through one of its necks and india-rubber tubing with another water-gauge .
All these connexions being perfectly air-tight , the height of the air-holder was read off , and the air admitted into the bag from the holder .
After some minutes the bag became fully distended , and the water began rising in the gauge connected directly with it .
As soon as a pressure of one inch in the bag was attained the delivery from the air-holder was read off ; it had by that time all but done falling , moving downward very slowly , to the extent of a delivery of about one-hundredth of a cubic foot and then stopped ; if the bag was then handled , one or two more hundredths of a cubic foot might be given out from the holder .
One experiment gave a delivery of from 4 to 7'18 on the index = 3'18 cubic feet , read off as soon as the water in the gauge connected with the bag showed a pressure of one inch ; on waiting two or three minutes , 3*19 cubic feet were read off ; and , after handling the bag , the volume of air delivered into it rose to 3*22 cubic feet .
In another experiment the reading on the holder was made to commence at 6 , and when the bag was full it had fallen to 9*19 , giving a bulk of 3*19 cubic feet of air delivered into the bag ; after handling the bag , the air given out rose to 3*22 cubic feet .
I have therefore taken 3*20 cubic feet , or 90*6 litres , as the correct estimation of the air contained in the bag under the pressure of one inch of water .
In this last experiment the temperature of the air in the bag was ascertained to be the same as that of the room , and , moreover , the holder had been filled with air for some hours previously , so that it is very unlikely that its temperature should have been different from that of the external atmosphere ; the temperature of the \#166 ; water in the gas-holder was a trifle below that of the room .
I proposed this last summer to make the Col du Geant ( altitude 11,030 feet ) my highest experimental station , as this spot was easy to reach with the necessary instruments , and a small wooden hut had been lately erected at the summit of the pass , where we could make 420 Dr. W. Marcet .
[ Feb. 10 our residence during our stay at that place .
The experiments were repeated at Yvoire near the Lake of Geneva ( altitude 1,230 feet ) , and at Oourmayeur ( 3,945 feet ) at the foot of the Col du Geant on the Italian side .
Hence , there were three series of data obtained in the course of about three months on two persons in good health , though very different in age , weight , and other respects .
Two sets of experiments were made at Courmayeur , the first before ascending to the Col du Geant , and the second on our return ; the object being to ascertain whether the influence of the sojourn at the higher station showed itself on our breathing for some time after we had left it .
The experiments were invariably made in the sitting posture , and in the open air , away from every possible source of contamination with carbonic acid , and care was taken to remain perfectly quiet for a short time before collecting the air expired .
With the object of determining the amount of air expired within a given time , and the carbonic acid it contained , breathing was carried on through a face-piece connected with the india-rubber bag , and adapting itself perfectly over the mouth and nose ; the face-piece was supplied with valves , so that fresh air was taken in at each inspiration , while the expired air was collected in the bag .
A water gauge , communicating with the bag by india-rubber tubing , showed the pressure of the air it contained , and the bag was taken as full when the gauge exhibited a pressure of one inch .
By means of a stop-watch registering minutes and seconds only , the time for filling the bag , and , therefore , for expiring 3'20 cubic feet or 90'6 litres of air , was accurately measured .
Immediately after the bag had been filled with air from the lungs , it was joined by india-rubber tubing with a cylinder made of very thick glass , and holding exactly two litres , which was placed in an upright position on a tripod stand .
After exhausting the cylinder with an air pump , air was let into it from the bag , the operation being repeated , thereby ensuring that two litres of air had been withdrawn into the cylinder for analysis .
Before closing the stop-cock and severing the connexion between the bag and cylinder a minute or two were allowed to elapse , and then the temperature of the air in the bag and in the cylinder was read off and noted .
Care was taken to observe these temperatures while the bag and cylinder were communicating freely with each other , so as to allow of the equilibrium of pressure being established , should there be any difference between the temperature of the air in the bag and in the cylinder ; sometimes the temperature was the same , but it frequently happened that the readings differed by 1 ' or 2 ' , the difference very seldom reaching 3 ' or 4 ' .
A titered solution of baric hydrate was then introduced into the cylinder by a process described in a communication to the Chemical Society j* * " Journal of the Chemical Society , " July , 1880 .
1881.1 On the Influence of Altitude upon Respiration .
421 finally , the combination of the carbonic acid was completely effected fiy moving about the cylinder , so as to make the alkaline solution run lip and down the inside of the glass for a period of ten minutes , this lapse of time having been ascertained experimentally to be amply sufficient .
The milky fluid was withdrawn into a small bottle , jcarefully labelled , holding about 100 cub. centims. , the bottle was well corked , and the cork secured with paraffin wax so as to prevent effectually the admission of air .
I analysed the contents of the bottle on my return to Yvoire .
The experiments , numbering eighty , have been disposed in a tabular form ; they are distributed as follows :\#151 ; i Fourteen were made on myself at Yvoire , and ten on M. David ; eight on myself at Courmayeur before ascending the Col du Geant , and eight on returning to Courmayeur , nine on M. David at Courmayeur before ascending the mountain , and seven on his return to Courmayeur .
Twelve on myself at the summit of the Col du Geant , and also twelve on M. David at the same station .
I shall beg to commence by inquiring into the influence of food and j temperature upon our breathing .
Influence of Food.\#151 ; In my former investigations , the direct influence of meals as increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired was , as a rule , well marked .
The limited range of time that elapsed after a meal previous to an experiment , and the small number of experiments at each station in the present inquiry , preclude any but comparatively wide results being arrived at as to the direct influence food exerted on the formation of carbonic acid .
Dr. Edward Smith* concludes that the greatest quantity of carbonic acid is expired from one and a half to two and a half hours after a meal ; in the present experiments , the ingestion of food showed a direct influence in my case towards increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired , although we cannot find any definite tendency of the kind with M , David .
At Yvoire , I { expired the smallest quantity of carbonic acid between breakfast and luncheon , when the mean of four experiments undertaken during that period yielded 0'479 grm. The carbonic acid rose under the influence of a full luncheon , and attained a maximum of 0*572 grm. 1 h. 45 m. after that meal in the first series of experiments , and of 0*638 grm. 3 h. 2 m. in the second series .
At Courmayeur , before ascending the Col , my minimum carbonic acid ( 0'449 ) was expired 4 h. 35 m. after breakfast , and the maximum ( 0*554 ) 2 h. 40 m. after luncheon .
On our return to that station , my minimum ( 0*434 grm. ) is expired at the latest experiment after breakfast , and my maximum ( 0*561 grm. ) 3 h. 35 m. after luncheon .
So far the results agree tolerably , for such a small number of experiments , with the influence food is usually found to exert on the formation and expiration of carbonic acid .

422 Dr. W. Mareet .
[ Feb. 10 In M. David 's case so much irregularity is observed as to the !
amount of carbonic acid expired in connexion with the food taken that it is not possible to draw any inference as to the direct influence food exerted in this respect .
He informs me he considers his digestion so slow that he does not bathe ( in the Lake of Geneva ) till three and a half or four hours have elapsed after a meal .
Influence of the Temperature of the Atmosphere on the Amount of Carbonic Acid Expired.\#151 ; This influence was sharply defined , even for small differences in the temperature of the air , and it was found that at the same station as the atmosphere became warmer , the amount of carbonic acid expired fell precisely in an equal proportion .
The first series of experiments on myself at Yvoire were made on the 27th and 28th of August ; the temperature of the air was still high , and the mean reading of the thermometer in the shade during the experiment was 690,9 F. On that occasion , a mean of 504 mgrms .
carbonic acid was found to be expired by myself per minute , at a mean period of 2 h. 46 m. after a meal .
A second series of experiments upon myself at that same station was undertaken on the 20th , 21st , and 22nd October , yielding a mean of 572 mgrms .
carbonic acid expired per minute ; autumn was setting in , and the atmospheric temperature had fallen to a mean of 60 ' '3 at the time of the experiments ; these were made at a mean period of 2 h. 35 m. after a meal , or nearly the same as in the first series .
The circumstances attending the two series of experiments were therefore similar , with the exception of the atmospheric temperature , which was lower by 90-6 on the second than on the first occasion .
It is very interesting to observe , that the carbonic acid in the second series is just what might have been expected , if in an inverse proportion to the temperatures , these proportions being calculated would yield 0'493 grm. , which is very nearly 0'504 , or 0-584 mgrm .
, which is very nearly 0'573 .
If we now consider the experiments made on myself at Courmayeur , before ascending to the Col , they will be found to yield 494 mgrms .
of carbonic acid with an atmospheric temperature of 76'T , while the second series , undertaken on returning to Courmayeur , after our stay on the Col du Geant , gave 492 mgrms .
at a mean temperature of 77 ' , the mean time the experiments were made after food being 2 h , 43 m. in one case , and 2 h. 29 m. in the other .
In this instance , the mean temperature varies by less than 1 ' , and the carbonic acid expired is also as near as possible the same .
M. David 's two series of experiments at Courmayeur , at a mean time of 2 h. 58 m. and 3 h. 34 m. respectively after a meal , gave for the first 727 mgrms .
carbonic acid , with a mean atmospheric temperature of 71''2 , and for the second , after our return to Courmayeur again , 727 mgrms .
carbonic acid , with a mean temperature of 720,2 , these figures harmonising in a remarkable degree .

] On the Influence of Altitude upon Respiration .
423 If altitude , or a fall of atmospheric pressure , with which I couple increased dryness of the atmosphere , exerted no influence on the amount of carbonic acid expired , independently of temperature , the combustion within the body would be regulated by the temperature of the air only , all other circumstances supposed to be similar ; * in that case the weight of carbonic acid at Yvoire and at Courmayeur , reduced to equal temperatures , would have been the same .
We find , however , that such is not the case , and that , after reducing the carbonic acid for Yvoire to the temperature corresponding to that of Courmayeur , a marked excess of carbonic acid is expired at Courmayeur , and that this applies to both of us , as is clearly seen in the following table:\#151 ; Table showing the theoretical excess of C02 expired at Courmayeur over that expired at Yvoire ( difference of altitude , 2,715 feet ) for ' equal temperatures .

[ Feb. 10 , This table shows , in my own case , a theoretical excess of 8'3 per : cent , and 8'9 per cent , of carbonic acid expired for the first and second series at Conrmayeur respectively over my second series at Yvoire , assuming the temperatures to be the same at both stations .
In M. David 's case , the theoretical excess of carbonic acid expired at Courmayeur over that expired at Yvoire , for similar temperatures , was found to be 7'7 per cent , and 8'9 per cent , for the two Courmayeur series respectively .
It follows that , for equal mean temperatures , even such a small difference of altitude as 2,715 feet would have given in these experiments a mean increase of carbonic acid of 8'6 per cent , in my case and 8'3 per cent , with M. David .
M. Mermod , * who experimented with equal mean temperatures at a difference of altitude of 3,143 feet ( from 142 metres to 1,100 metres ) obtained an increase of carbonic acid expired by 6'7 per cent , at his highest station , which is very near to my result although slightly lower .
His experiments were all made fasting , between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning , and it is not unlikely that his comparatively low increase of carbonic acid at the highest station was due in some measure to his being in want of food at the time , and unable to generate exactly the increased amount of carbonic acid required to make up for the altitude .
It may be asked , why should the body make more carbonic acid at increasing altitudes , and under similar atmospheric temperatures ?
The reply is , that the evaporation from the skin aDd lungs must be greater under a lower pressure and drier atmosphere , giving rise to a production of cold .
The air was exceedingly dry while we were at Courmayeur ; on July 21st , at 12.30 p.m. , the readings of dry and wet bulb thermometers were 78 ' and 62 ' respectively , giving a relative atmospheric humidity of 39 per cent. ; the same day , at 2.15 p.m. , the readings were 78 ' and 59 ' , corresponding to 32 per cent , of relative atmospheric humidity .
Under such a dry air there must have been a considerable evaporation from the skin and lungs , cooling the body and thereby more than making up apparently for the absorption of heat , the result being an excess of carbonic acid expired .
The twelve experiments for each of us on the summit of the Col cannot be viewed in the same light as the others , because although the cold we were subjected to under such a low atmospheric pressure was comparatively great , and , indeed , keenly felt , still we both gave out less carbonic acid than at Courmayeur instead of more .
This circumstance will find presently a ready explanation ; in the meantime I shall propose to divide the twelve experiments on the Col into two groups of six for each of us respectively , one group corresponding to the lowest and the other to the highest atmospheric temperatures .

425 mean temperature and corresponding mean weight of carbonic acid expired will be as follows:\#151 ; grin .

J COa expired 0 -60S \ C03 expired 0 '614 mean temperature 39 " 8 mean temperature 43 '5 mean temperature 40 * 9 mean temperature 45 '8 so that rather less carbonic acid was expired at the lower temperatures .
Consequently , not only the total mean carbonic acid expired at the Col was found to be lower than the total mean either at Courmayeur or at Yvoire , but moreover during our stay on the Col the coldest weather was attended with the least formation of carbonic , acid for both of us , which is quite in opposition to what might have been expected .
This circumstance , however , is easily accounted for .
After spending two or three days at Courmayeur were the sun was very hot , the thermometer ( sheltered from the sun under or inside a bush ) rising to 80 ' , we started for the summit of the Col without having in any way prepared our functions to the sudden change of climate to which they were going to be subjected .
We were indeed fresh from the plains in the hottest time of the year , and it was as taking a leap from the middle of summer into the midst of winter .
We left Courmayeur one afternoon , and slept at the inn about 3,000 feet higher ; next morning an early start brought us in good time to the hut at the summit of the Col , in the midst of snow slopes and glaciers .
The floor of the hut was found covered in a great measure with ice and snow , which had to be removed with axes , while the small stove in one corner was nearly buried in snow , and so imbedded in ice that it took us some time before we could get it free .
People who cross this pass , one of the most beautiful in the Alps , spend an hour at the hut and often less ; few travellers sleep in it , but this was to be our home for at least three days .
The wind was cold and cutting , and a thick greatcoat proved quite insufficient .
M. David had taken with him a coat lined with fur , but even that was not equal to keeping up a comfortable warmth .
The air was very dry ; on the 19th July at 10 a.m. the readings of the dry and wet bulb thermometers were 42 ' and 33 ' , giving a relative humidity of 44 per cent. ( Glaisher 's tables ) , so that the atmosphere possessed a great capacity for moisture , and therefore an increased power of cooling down the body .
The experiments were to be made out of the welcome sun 's rays , and , with this object in view , I had brought up a wooden shed which had already done useful work on an expedition to the Peak of Teneriffe ; this shed or roof was erected on four poles , kept in their places by tent ropes and pegs .
It may be readily understood that sitting under the shed with the back resting against a rock and facing the beautiful glacier which descends directly from the Col , was 2 h 2 Dr. W. Marcet .
[ Feb. 10 , not conducive to warmth .
Pood , good , abundant and substantial , would have offered the best means to counteract the cold , but our supply was scanty , as we had been disappointed in the expectation of obtaining provisions at the half way house , the Pavilion du Mont Frety , and even had food been abundant , want of appetite and inability to digest with both of us would have prevented our taking advantage of it .
As it was , we lived mostly on soup made with extract of beef and preserved julienne , bread and cheese , coffee and tea with condensed milk , some ch.ocoJ.ate , and a small quantity of meat from tins .
The nights we felt bitterly cold and uncomfortable , and we could get but very little sleep .
No wonder that under such depressing circumstances we were unable to make in our bodies the amount of heat required to meet the occasion ; the result , in fact , was , as I have already stated , a diminished combustion in both of us.* I now wish to offer a few remarks on the difference in the weight of carbonic acid expired by myself and M. David respectively at the several stations .
M. David is 25 years of age , weighs 11 stone 7 pounds ( 73 kilos .
) , and measures round the chest 37'6 inches , while I am 52 years of age , weigh nearly 10 stone 8 pounds , and measure 34'5 inches round the chest .
M. David expired more carbonic acid than I did , though not in proportion with the excess of weight of his body .
If the figures showing the carbonic acid expired by each of us be reduced to the same temperature for each station , the fixity of the excess of carbonic acid expired by M. David , not only at the different stations respectively , but also throughout the whole of the present inquiry , becomes quite obvious .
* At Yvoire my first series of experiments yield 0'504 C03 at 69''9 ; and M. David 's only series , 0'776 C02 at 61''6 , the reduction to the same temperature giving an excess of 26'3 per cent , for M. David .
My second series of experiments at Yvoire , compared with M. David 's single set of experiments at that station , shows a difference of atmospheric temperature from 60o,3 to 61''6 ; after applying the reduction , the excess of carbonic acid expired by this gentleman will be found to amount to 27'9 per cent. , or within narrow limits of the percentage first obtained .
At Courmayeur , for the first series of experiments , after applying the correction for temperature , the excess of carbonic acid expired by M. David was found to be 27'4 per cent. The second series at Courmayeur showed an excess of carbonic acid expired ( duly corrected ) by M. David amounting to 27'9 per cent. , or very nearly the same as in * My experimental baggage consisted of a trunk weighing 40 kilos .
( 88 lbs. ) , a basket weighing 35 kilos .
( 77 lbs. ) , and the wooden shed ; three porters from Courmayeur carried up the whole of this baggage from the Pavilion du Mont Frety ; I engaged a fourth for taking the baggage down .
The work of these porters was a remarkable feat of bodily strength and mountaineering .

It is impossible to apply any correction for temperature in the experiments made on the Col du Geant .
The mean temperature for each of us is not very dissimilar , being 41'*7 in \#174 ; no case and 43''4 in the other .
The excess of carbonic acid expired at that station by M. David amounted to 28 6 per cent. These various percentages were alike in a remarkable degree , as will be seen by placing them in a tabular form:\#151 ; Excess of Carbonic Acid expired by M. David ( after reduction for Temperature .

[ Feb. 10 It will be observed , first of all , on considering these figures , that both in my case and M. David 's much less air , reduced , or a smaller weight of air , was expired per minute , and consequently breathed at 11,030 feet above the sea than at 1,230 feet ; this difference was in my case by 29'2 for 100 expired at 1,230 feet , and withM .
David 's by 28'0 per cent. ; and it is not a little remarkable that the difference per cent , in both cases should be all but the same .
There is also a falling off of the volume of air ( reduced ) I exhaled at Courmayeur , but M. David expired much the same amount at both stations .
In my former experiments at Teneriffe and in the Alps I also observed a reduction in the volume of air expired ( reduced ) at high altitudes , so that there can be no doubt that , although the actual volume of air breathed is greater because of its being rarefied , still a smaller weight of air is breathed within a given time in the mountains than in the plains .
I shall now beg to consider the volume of air expired for 1 grin , of carbonic acid at our various stations\#151 ; a subject interesting both in a physiological and medical point of view .
In my case , the proportion of air breathed for I grm. C02 expired falls steadily from our lower to our higher station ; or , in other words , at Courmayeur I required a weight of 8-6 per cent , less air to make 1 grm. of carbonic acid than at Yvoire ; and at the summit of the pass I inhaled a weight of air as much as 140 per cent , smaller to produce 1 grm. of carbonic acid than at the lowest station .
In M. David 's case there is a decrease of 8 per cent , in the weight of air expired at the summit of the Col for 1 grm. C02 -compared with that expired near the Lake of Geneva .
At the intermediate station ( 3,945 feet ) , however , there is a slight increase ; the rule remains , nevertheless , I consider , as well proved , that at certain altitudes , which may vary with different persons , a smaller weight of air is required to yield the necessary oxygen for producing in the body the same weight of carbonic acid ; this law also held good on my former experimental stations .
It accounts , in my mind , for the immunity against consumption met with amongst the inhabitants of towns and villages at elevations beyond 4,000 or 5,000 feet above the sea , and for the beneficial influence exercised in some cases on the progress of phthisis by such high places as Davos in Switzerland .
At these stations a smaller weight of air is required for the production of carbonic acid than in the plains , which means that the air breathed passes through the substance of the lungs into the blood more readily at certain altitudes than it does nearer the sea-level ; and , consequently , where the pulmonary organ is unequal to a free diffusion of air through its tissue , as is the case in consumption , and probably in old-standing bronchitis , such an influence of altitude on respiration is likely to produce a favourable change .
M. Mermod , whose interesting inquiries on the effects of altitude upon respiration I 1881.1 On the Influence of Altitude upon Respiration .
429 have previously quoted , found that a smaller weight of air and more carbonic acid were expired at his higher than his lower station , showing , as I have done from my experiments , that at increasing altitudes 5 carbonic acid requires the inspiration of a smaller weight of air to be formed in the body than nearer to the sea level .
A few remarks only are left to be made on the rate of breathing | and volume of air taken into the lungs per respiration at the various stations .
The expirations were counted during three minutes , as each experiment was being commenced : the person submitting to experiment breathing freely in the open air and in the sitting posture .
The mean rate of breathing was much the same for M. David and myself at Yvoire and at Courmayeur , before ascending to the Col , there was consequently no appreciable difference for a rise in altitude of 2,265 feet .
The influence of our stay on the Col , where M. David 's respiration increased in frequency , apparently showed itself on this gentleman on our return to Courmayeur , as a reaction appeared to set in at the time , and the number of expirations fell from 20'6 per minute on the Col to 8*5 , 7*5 , 9'5 , and 9'7 per minute , rising afterwards to 10 , 12'7 , and 15'3 .
The cause of this change was apparently the fatigue of the increased rate of breathing during the three days we spent on the pass , requiring rest of the muscles of respiration .
In my case there was also an increase , though not so great as in the former ( 11*6 to 15'6 per minute ) , in the frequency of breathing on the summit , which appeared to give rise to no reaction beyond a slight irregularity in the respiration on our return to Courmayeur .
We arrived at that place from the Col on the 19th July , in the evening ; M. David 's experiments were begun on the 20th July , at noon , and ' continued that day , one only being made on the 21st .
Two of my experiments were undertaken on the 20th and the remaining on the 21st , so that a longer time had elapsed in my cases since we had returned from the Col : this circumstance may explain the apparent absence of reaction in my own breathing .
I do not ascribe , however , much physiological importance to these figures , but we were much struck with M. David 's slow respiration at the time .
The mean volume of air per respiration ( not reduced ) was in my case as near as possible the same at the intermediate as at the lower station ( 1 litre Yvoire and 0'98 Courmayeur ) , but it became much smaller at the summit of the pass , where it fell to 0'64 litre .
M. David expired a mean of 0*71 litre of air per expiration at the lower station , of DO litre at the intermediate one , and 0*48 litre on the summit of the pass .
Conclusions .
1 .
The direct influence of food as increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired was obvious in my case in a general way , although 430 Dr. W. Marcet .
[ Feb. 10 not in that of M. David .
This result in M. David 's case in no way invalidates the well-known influence of the ingestion of food as increasing the amount of carbonic acid expired , but is apparently due in a great measure to the comparatively small number of experiments and to circumstances connected with a slow rate of digestion .
2 .
The influence of the temperature of the atmosphere on the amount of carbonic acid expired was well marked in both cases ; the mean weights of carbonic acid expired ait Courmayeur ( 3,945 feet ) by both of us being the same respectively at the mean temperatures observed , which were equal in both series ; but it was found that the amount of carbonic acid expired at the same station varied inversely with the change of temperature ; the readings observed ranged from 60''3 to 77'(Col du Greant not included ) .
3 .
For a difference of altitude of 2,715 feet between 1,230 feet and 3,945 feet , and a relative atmospheric humidity lower by about 31 per cent , for the higher station ( 70 per cent , at Yvoire ) , the mean weight of carbonic acid expired by each of us , reduced to the same temperature was found to be in excess at the higher over the lower station by 8'6 per cent , in my case and 8'3 per cent , in M. David 's .
This shows clearly the influence of altitude coupled with increased atmospheric dryness towards promoting combustion in the body .
4 .
The sudden change from a lower and very warm place to a very high and cold station , with a barely adequate diet and insuflicient training , was productive on the present occasion of a decreased formation of carbonic acid in both of us , and a feeling of want of power to ^ react against the external cold .
5 .
The amount of carbonic acid expired by each of us was not the same .
M. David , a younger man than I am , gave out a total mean of 27'6 per cent , more carbonic acid than I did , calculating this excess from the carbonic acid we expired per minute reduced to equal temperatures ; and moreover the excess exhibited much regularity at each station respectively .
The mean surplus , without reduction for temperature , would have amounted to 30'9 per cent. 6 .
A smaller weight ( volume reduced ) of air is breathed within a given time in the mountains , at altitudes which may vary with different persons , than in the plains or low valleys , although the actual volume of air expired be larger under a lower barometrical pressure ; and , moreover , a smaller weight of air is required by the body to produce within it a given weight of carbonic acid at certain elevations than near the sea level ; this confirming my results obtained on former occasions .
7 .
At an elevation of 11,030 feet above the sea , and a mean temperature of 41''7 and 43''4 for each of us respectively , the rate of breathing was accelerated in both our cases , though rather less in mine 1881 .

431 than in M. David 's .
His increase was by 39'5 per cent. , and mine by 25-6 per cent. I had occasion to remark , in a paper published last year , * that my observations showed no increase in the frequency of respiration in the Alps , while in the sitting posture , between the altitudes of 1,230 feet ( Lake of Geneva ) and 8,115 ( St. Bernard ) ; but between 8,115 feet and 13,685 feet ( summit of the Breithorn ) the increase was in the following ratio:\#151 ; To 8,428 feet , 20*4 per cent. ; from thence to 10,899 feet , 12*7 per cent , beyond the latter* ; from that elevation to 13,685 feet , 6*3 per cent , more ; altogether 39 per cent. The rate of breathing was not observed at that time quite in the same way as on the present occasion , as it was then reckoned while expiring into the bag , and not into the open air .
1 cannot anticipate , however , any actual difference in the results , as there is no reason why the rate of expiration into the bag should not be proportional at various altitudes to the rate of expiration into* the open air at these same altitudes respectively .
I feel called upon to remark that the figures for the carbonic acid I expired in the experiments which form the subject of the present paper are higher than those reported in my earlier experiments , while the volume of air expired is rather largely increased in this last inquiry , which I am hardly prepared at present to account for .
A series of experiments made on myself at Yvoire in autumn , 1879 , yielded weights of carbonic acid much nearer to those last obtained .
The weight of air expired for one gramme of carbonic acid , which had been somewhat smaller in the earlier experiments , rose in those of 1879 at Yvoire to a figure but slightly inferior to that obtained in the experiments of 1880 .
