Experiments for ascertaining the Velocity of Sound , at Madras in the East Indies .
By JOHN GOLDINGHAM , Esq. F.R.S. Read February 20 , 1823 .
THE manner in which sound is conveyed , and the theory of its velocity , are too well known , and are to be found in too many scientific works , to need detailed repetition here .
The actual rate of its motion , particularly in different states of the atmosphere , does not appear , however , to have been so well agreed upon by Philosophers .
A scientific writer* in a standard work , states " That some of the most eminent philosophers , judging that the knowledge of the flight of sound might be of use on various occasions , have been at extraordinary pains and expense to measure the rate at which it moved ; and the result of their experiments , particularly of those which were best conducted , is as follows : 1 .
" That the velocity of sound is the same , whether by sea or by land , in dry or in rainy weather , by day or by night , in winter or summer .
2 .
" That sound , whether more or less strong , flies with the same swiftness .
For , by experiments , a cannon fired with a half-pound charge of powder was heard at about the distance of seventeen miles and a half in the same time after the flash was seen , as it was when fired with a charge of 6lbs .
3 .
" That the times in which sound is heard are proportional to the distance ; that is , at a double distance it is heard in twice the time ; at a triple distance in thrice the time , " &amp;c. This , however , is not supported in all points by the experiments I am about to detail ; nor indeed could we expect it would be , from the manner in which sound is conveyed ; as this leads us to the conclusion , that the more dense , and the less elastic , the atmosphere , the slower sound would travel .
The velocity of sound has been variously given by different philosophers , as the following table , * originally from the Philosophical Transactions , will tend to show .

In Chili the thermometer 73,5 , barometer 27,44 in .
sound was found to travel 1227 feet in a second .
By Mr. MILLINGTON 1130 feet .
Mr. RICHARD VAN REES has shown theoretically that the velocity of sound in common air is 341,5 metres in a second .
Mr. BENGENBERG at Dusseldorf , by experiment , 333,7 metres , about 2 feet and a half more , it is stated , than the velocity obtained at Paris by experiment .
A metre , according to the accurate investigations lately made in England , contains 39,37079 English inches , and therefore 341,54 metres will be equal to 1120 , and 333,7 to 1094,8 English feet .
" Some curious experiments were made relative to sound by Messrs. DE THURY , MARALDI , and DE LA CAILLE , upon a line 14636 fathoms in length , having the tower of Mount Lheri at one end , and the pyramid of Montmartre at the other extremity , their Observatory was placed between the two objects .
The result of their observations was , that sound moves 173 French* fathoms in a second when the air is calm .
2 .
That sound moves with the same degree of swiftness whether it is strong or , weak , an explosion of half a pound of powder discharged in a box , having been heard in the same space of time , as the report of a great gun charged with nearly six pounds of powder .
3 .
That the motion of sound is uniform , its velocity neither accelerating nor diminishing through the whole course of its progress .
4 .
That sound travelled at the same rate , whether the gun be pointed perpendicular to the horizon , or towards the person who hears the report , or from him-by other experiments however , the progress of sound appeared to be impeded by a strong wind .
" Dr. G. GREGORY , Econ , of Not .
The velocity in the foregoing table , stated to be Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S , does not agree with that given by himself , which is 979 feet ; this however is not deduced from experiment , but from the theory , no regard being had to the thickness of the solid particles of air , through which sound is propagated .
This being allowed for , according to the formula , brings out the velocity of sound greater in the proportion of ten to nine , or o09 feet more , making the velocity lo88 feet ; besides , vapours are dispersed through the air , which being of a different tone and elasticity , do not partake of the motion of the true air , by which sound is propagated ; and it is also demonstrated , that the motion of sound will be quicker in such an atmosphere than in an atmosphere of true air , in the ratio of twenty-one to twenty ; then the velocity last found being augmented in that proportion , we shall have 1142 feet for the velocity of sound in a second , according to Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S theory .
LA PLACE , using the Newtonian formula , which he considers correct , and a theorem which he gives , makes the velocity of sound in a second 345,35 metres ( or 1133,06 feet English ) the temperature being 430 .
The French Academicians , as before mentioned , found the velocity 337,18 metres , or 11o6 ?
I feet English .
By experiments of LACAILLE the velocity was 344,42 metres , 1130,1 feet English , but the temperature is not mentioned .
In the above enumeration of the velocity of sound , given by different philosophers , very considerable discordances are observable ; the actual reason of which cannot , I imagine , be discovered without the details of the experiments , and these are not in my possession ; but probably , a particular examination of the experiments I am about to submit , may furnish a clue for the discovery of the cause of these differences .
HALLEY and FLAMSTEED are the only two , whose results agree with the theory ; but I am not quite certain whether their results were deduced from theory or experiment .
Be this as it may , the conclusion drawn from the experiments 99 made here agrees , in a very satisfactory manner , with that given by Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S theory , and by the two other celebrated men just named .
Between the years 1793 and 1796 a considerable number of observations were taken by myself , and under my superintendence , at the Observatory , with the view of ascertaining the velocity of sound .
Not having the exact distances of the guns from the station when I returned to England , I wrote for farther information upon the subject-which I had not obtained when I quitted Europe again .
I therefore did not bring these experiments forward at the time ; and having a more elevated station to observe from , by the erection of a new building , and the advantage of corroborating distances , by the trigonometrical survey carrying on under the superintendence of Colonel LAMBTON , I entered upon the course of experiments about to be detailed .
The former experiments ( those of 1793 and 1796 ) were made with ARNOLD'S chronometers , as were these now given .
In examining works obtained from libraries here , since I closed these experiments , for information relative to the results of like experiments by other observers , I found a letter from Colonel BEAUFOY , in the Annals of Philosophy , addressed a few years ago to Dir .
THOMSON ; and recommending to be done in England , what , in all the essential points , has been performed here , as will appear by the following extract : ( " It has frequently excited my surprise , as well as regret , and in which I am no wise singular , that use has not been made of the admirable Trigonometrical Survey , begun by the late General Roy , and continued with so much ability and attention by Colonel MUDGE and Professor DALBY , to 100 make experiments on the velocity of sound ; and however experiments of this kind may have been neglected , it is hoped that the present Master General of the Ordnance , a near relation of the late scientific Captain PHIPPS , ( afterwards Lord MULGRAVE ) will , for the purpose of perfecting a branch of science , no less curious than useful , order a series of experiments of this nature to be undertaken , not only in the inland parts of the kingdom , but also on different parts of the Coast .
" He then mentions that the experiments should be made under different circumstances of the wind and weather , and at different times of the 24 hours , and proceeds to enumerate the stations where the experiments should be made .
He recommends that pocket chronometers should be used , " which generally making five beats in two seconds , the velocity of sound could be determined to the fraction of a second ; " and concludes by saying , " he has no doubt scientific foreigners would assist our countrymen in finding the time sound is travelling across that part of the Channel , where the shores are visible from each other .
" At Fort St. George ( Madras ) a morning and an evening gun are fired from the ramparts , as is customary in fortified places , the former at day light , and the latter at eight o'clock in the evening .
At St. Thomas 's Mount , the artillery cantonment , morning and evening guns are also fired , one at day light , and the other at sun set .
The Madras Observatory , in latitude 13 ?
'4 8 " north , is situated between these ; the distance of it from the Fort , about half its distance from the Mount , the Fort being to the N. E. of the Observatory , and the Mount to the S.W. In former years , as I have mentioned before , experiments were made by me for ascertaining 101 the velocity of sound , but were not brouglit forward .
And a new building , * elevated so as to give a commanding view of the country , particularly of the Mountt and Fortt , having been erected , I commenced a new series with the morning and evening guns of both places .
The experiments with the Mount gun , it will be seen , comprise an interval , which embraces all the varieties of the wind and weather during the revolution of the sun ; the interval with the Fort gun is less , in consequence of the morning and evening guns having been fired from different parts of the ramparts , after the date at which the Fort experiments close .
All the experiments were made with chronometers , which had ioo beats in 40 seconds , sometimes by three observers , myself and two of the Observatory Bramin assistants , but generally by two : the observers having repaired to the station at the top of the Observatory building , a little before the expected time , and each holding his chronometer so that he could distinctly hear the beats , began to count the instant he saw the flash , and continued counting until he heard the report ; the number of beats between the flash and report was then immediately put down upon a slip of paper , by each observer , without communication with the others , and the papers delivered to me for their contents to be registered ; the height of the thermometer , barometer , and hygrometer , with the direction of the wind and state of the weather , were also observed at the time , and registered ; and in this manner the whole of the experiments were made .
The situations of the guns with respect to the station from which the observations were taken , was very favourable , being in the direction , one of N. E. and the other of the S.W. monsoons-with the southerly wind and sea breeze , ( both which prevail at certain seasons of the year , ) blowing between the two .
The guns used were 24 pounders , charged with 8lbs .
of powder , and both pointed , not exactly towards the station , but in a direction not far from it .
The distances were ascertained with great care : first , by a survey made for the purpose , a base having been measured , and the angles taken with a grand circular instrument , similar to that used on the trigonometrical surveys.* Secondly , by using two or three of Colonel LAMBTON'S distances and bearings found by the trigonometrical survey .
The results were thus deduced , and verified in different ways ; and I have reason to think that the distances of the guns from the Observatory station are very accurately given .
The mean of 12 results made the distance of the Mount Gun from the station 29547 feet ; and the mean of 6 results , gave the distance of the Fort Gun from the station 13932,3 feet .
The mapt will show the exact relative positions and distances of the points , and the face of the country over which the sound travelled .
We see , as I before remarked , that the distance of one gun from the station is nearly double that of the other , and this will be found an advantage , in showing whether sound travels equally during its progress .
The experiments are given in the subjoined Tables .
Table I. Contains the experiments of each day with the Mount gun , together with the state of the atmosphere and the direction of the wind at the time of observation : the titles at the heads of the columns render a particular explanation unnecessary the number of observers is stated in the third column , and the mean of their observations in the ninth .

Table XI .
Shows the mean motion of sound for each month at the Madras Observatory , as found by the experiments , at the mean height of the thermometer , barometer , and hygrometer , given in the table .
Upon a cursory inspection of Tables I. and IV .
, it will be seen that the motion of sound varies under different states of 104 the atmosphere and weather : that according to the first table , sound at one time has been as long as 27,6 seconds in travelling from the Mount to the Observatory station ; and at another time only 24,8 seconds ; the distance being 29547 feet .
In the first case , therefore , the velocity of sound was only about 1078 feet in a second ; while in the other , its velocity was nearly 1191k feet .
The extremes in Table VI .
, show a still greater difference .
This proves the necessity for making experiments during a long interval , in order to obtain an accurate general result .
In Tables II .
and VII .
we find , as the thermometer rose , the atmosphere at the same time decreasing in density and increasing in its elasticity , that the sound moved with greater rapidity .
That with the wind in the SE .
quarter the velocity was considerably increased , both from the Mount and Fort ; more , however , in proportion , as might be expected , from the former than the latter .
That with the wind at NO .
the sound from the Fort gun travelled with a greater , and from the Mount gun with a less velocity , than when the wind was in any other direction ; that wind being favourable for increasing the velocity from the Fort , and unfavourable from the Mount : the full effect of the wind , however , is not to be ascertained by this table alone , as the thermometer during the time the NO .
wind prevails is comparatively low , and the barometer high ; both which , as will have been seen by inspection of the tables , occasion the sound to travel slower than ordinary .
The wind SW. W. and NW. the velocity from the Mount was accelerated , and that from the Fort retarded ; but not in the degree that would have taken place had the thermometer , barometer , and hygrometer , remained the same as in the NO .
monsoon ; but having been different , the velocity was accelerated from both guns on this account , in like manner as it was retarded in the NO .

The interval wanting is between the 28th of March and the 16th of July .
Had this interval been wanting in the experiments with the Mount gun , there would have been a difference of 0,237 seconds in the mean result ; for the mean of the experiments in this 1o6 interval is 25",632 , and the mean of the whole 25",869 , making the difference just mentioned .
Now 25",869g+o",23726",1o6 , which would have been the mean number of seconds had the observations with the Mount gun been continued during the same interval only as the experiments with the Fort gun .

Now 12 , " ,306-0o " , 12=12/ " ,194 , which would have been the general mean of the experiments with the Fort gun , had the same been continued as long as the experiments with the Mount gun .
Then the distance 13932,3 feet , divided by 12,194 , will give 1142,5 for the motion of sound by the experiments with the Fort gun thus brought on ; and this also agrees , within a fraction of a foot , with the velocity according to Sir ISAAC NEWTON ; and with the results by the two other celebrated philosophers before named .
Feet We then have by the Mount gun 1142,18 for the velocity .
And by the Fort gun 142 , 5 .
The mean is 1142,34 , or very nearly the velocity above alluded to .
Nothing could be more satisfactory than this general result ; and it may be presumed , that the other results in different states of the atmosphere are equally to be depended upon .
The velocity also by the Fort gun , which , it will be recollected , is little more than half the distance of the Mount gun from the station , shows that sound travels equally during its progress .
In the N E. monsoon , the sound was very indistinct at times ; this however does not appear to have sensibly affected * The results by the Mount gun may however be taken as the standard .

The French academicians indeed proved , as I have mentioned before , that this made no difference in the velocity .

A particular examination of the Tables and results , will show the difficulty of ascertaining what proportion of the differences should be allowed to each of the instruments used for finding the state of atmosphere , exclusive of the effects of the wind .
During the calms , we might expect that the proportional parts to be allowed for the difference in the thermometer , barometer , and hygrometer , might be found with some degree of accuracy ; the discrepances , however , are very considerable .
Comparing the results of Tables II .
and VII .
we find the barometer o,121 lower , the thermometer 4 ?
,6 higher , and the air about 8 more dry by the former Table than by the latter , while the velocity in a second is only 17,7 feet greater by one Table than the other .
We give however in addition the following results taken from the Tables of calms , and arranged according to the different heights of the thermometer and barometer .
These results may assist us in coming to some conclusion upon this part of the subject .
* For example , a difference of about twenty-six feet in the distance , between the Observatory station and the Mount gun , would make only about a foot difference in the velocity in a second .

Now , by numerous combinations of the observations just given , when the air was calm , we are led to conclude : first , * These are deduced from Ioo observations .
110o that for each degree of the thermometer 1 , i feet may be allowed in the velocity of sound for a second ; for each degree of the hygrometer 1,4 ; and for one-tenth of an inch of the barometer* 9,2 feet .
Then taking these numbers as the basis of the comparison , we find the mean difference of the velocity between a calm , and in a moderate breeze of wind , to be nearly io feet in a second .
And by comparing other results together , a difference of about 21L feet in a second , or 1275 in a minute is found between , the wind being in the direction of the motion of sound , or opposed to it .
Before I conclude these introductory observations , and explanations of the experiments , it may be proper to refer more particularly to Table XI .
, containing the mean motion of sound for each month of the year , by the experiments with the Mount gun , according to the state of the atmosphere indicated by the different instruments ; and to the prevailing monsoons , which may be considered to be the same , during the same months , every year ; full information respecting which is given in the former Tables .
On examining this Table , it is rather curious to observe how regularly the mean velocity proceeds to a maximum about the middle of the year , and afterwards retraces its steps ; giving us a velocity in one case 1164 feet in a second , and in the other of only 1099 feet .
This regularity would , no doubt , be still greater with the mean of the observations of several years .
