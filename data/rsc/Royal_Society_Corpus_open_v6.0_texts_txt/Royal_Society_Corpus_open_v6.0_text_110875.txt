" Additional Remarks respecting the Condensation of Gases .
" By Michael Faraday , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. The author , suspecting the presence of nitrogen in the nitrous oxide on which he had operated , repeated his experiments with this gas , very carefully prepared from pure nitrate of ammonia , but the results still indicated the presence , of a more volatile gas mixed with another less volatile .
He found that olefiant gas is readily soluble in strong alcohol , ethler , oil of turpentine , and other bodies of the same kind ; and that , like the former gas , it seems to be of a compound nature .
His experiments confirm the prevalence of the law that the force of vapour increases in a geometrical ratio for equal increments of heat , commencing at a given amount of pressure .
The more volatile a body is , the more rapidly does the force of its vapour increase by an augmentation of temperature , the increase of elasticity being directly as the volatility of the substance .
By further and more accurate investigation , a general law may be established for deducing , from only a single observation of the force of any given vapour in contact with its fluid , its elasticity at any other temperature .
Postscript to the Paper by Sir John F.W. Herschel , Bart. , F.R.S. , read at the last meeting .
The author found that neither cinchonine nor salicine , in a state of great purity , possessed , in the smallest appreciable degree , the optical property which he has shown to belong to quinine .
