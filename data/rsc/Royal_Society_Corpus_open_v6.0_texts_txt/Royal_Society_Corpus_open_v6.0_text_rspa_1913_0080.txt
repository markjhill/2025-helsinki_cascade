Temperature Coefficient of a Kew Collimator Magnet .
231 such handling may give rise to a subpermanent change of moment which will not immediately disappear .
It is , moreover , necessary to take precautions to secure that the temperature of the magnet is known , especially as , in the ordinary use of a Kew magnetometer , an error of even half a degree in the estimate of the temperature is by no means impossible .
( 5 ) For differences of field of the order of +H the temperature coefficient is not sensibly affected by the field .
In conclusion , I wish to thank my assistant , Mr. E. Simpson , for help in construction and adjustment of apparatus throughout the work .
Note.\#151 ; The principle of the compensating magnetometer may be applied to needle galvanometers , and I have constructed an instrument consisting of two galvanometers to test the utility of such an application .
I have not yet had an opportunity of fully investigating its possibilities , but it seems likely that a high degree of sensitiveness may be attained with a fair immunity from effects of small local magnetic disturbances .
Moreover , for a given resistance , two galvanometers with this arrangement can be made more efficient than one .
