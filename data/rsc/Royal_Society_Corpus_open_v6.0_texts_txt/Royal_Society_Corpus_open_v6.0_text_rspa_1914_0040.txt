Ill of potential electrolytes which attends their dissolution in water , there is no particular difficulty in placing a rational interpretation upon the facts , though the complexities of the problem are such that it is impossible to offer a complete solution .
The compounds formed by the " distribution " of the two components of the electrolyte ( " salt " and solute ) against one another which are postulated by our association hypothesis are the ions postulated by the dissociationists ; but , in addition , our view takes into account the activation of nonelectrolytes and changes in the solvent : indeed , we regard both of these as necessary parts of the process of chemical change in solution and as equal in importance to and strictly correlative with the changes which are involved in the passage of the salt from the state of potential into that of actual activity as an electrolyte .

) The systematic crystallographic inquiry discussed in the present communication was commenced , about fifteen years ago , in the hope that it would be possible , by determining the morphological characters of a considerable number of benzene derivatives of simple constitution , to discover relationships from which definite deductions could be drawn as to the precise manner in which crystalline form is affected by particular alterations in molecular configuration\#151 ; the ultimate object in view being to correlate internal structure with external form .
In planning the work , in order to determine the effect of all the possible variations of the position in the molecule of chlorine and bromine , it was decided to study , in the first instance , as many as could be procured of the di-substituted compounds of the form C6H3R1R2.SO2X containing either chlorine or bromine in place of R1 ?
Ra and X. 112 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Rod .
The dichloro- , dibromo- and chlorobromobenzenes exist in three isomeric forms , ortho- , meta- and para- : each of these forms gives rise to several isomeric sulphonic acids\#151 ; the para- to 4 , the ortho- to 8 , the meta- to 11 : moreover X in the radicle SO2X may be either Cl or Br : the number of possible compounds in the group selected for study was therefore 46 .
The manner in which the position of the radicles may be varied , in such a series of compounds as that chosen , when only one halogen is present , is as follows:\#151 ; Further variation is possible , if two halogens are used : for example , in the case of the para- series\#151 ; It has not yet been possible to devise methods of producing all the variants indicated but a large proportion have been prepared .
Unfortunately , however , in some cases difficulty has been experienced in obtaining crystals fit for measurement.* In the para- series , the relationships discovered are simple , as the various chloro- and bromo-compounds examined are all strictly isomorphous : later on , however , when the iodo-derivatives and more complex compounds of the sulphonamide type were examined , numerous cases of dimorphism were met with in the series .
In the meta- and ortho- series , the tendency to crystallise in several forms was apparent from the outset , particularly in the former , the 1:3:4 derivatives forming a trimorphous and the 1:3:5 a tetramorphous series.^ But although close relationships* were thus established within each group * The fact that such difficulties are met with is in itself significant .
There are , however , many deficiencies in our crystallographic technique which need to be overcome ; probably , much will be accomplished in the future , by wise choice of solvent and particularly by regulating the rate of evaporation and by the discovery of temperatures at which crystallisation may be more satisfactorily effected than by allowing the growth to take place merely under atmospheric conditions .

11\amp ; no direct connexion between the members of the 1:4 , 1:3 and 1:2 series was discovered .
The Barlow-Pope Theory.\#151 ; The publication by Barlow and Pope in 190d of their remarkable generalisation connecting crystalline form with internal molecular structure , especially in the case of derivatives of benzene , necessarily at once affected the present inquiry .
The theory involves the assumption that the atoms have individual existence and are closely packed in the molecules , these latter , in turar forming the closely packed structures which constitute the crystal .
Further\#151 ; and the conception is a most important and novel one\#151 ; they have contended that the influence of the atoms is exercised within spheres which are approximately proportional in volume to the fundamental valencies of the atoms and that the valency volumes are relatively constant in all cases : thus , regarding the valency volume of hydrogen as unity , that of carbon is taken as 4 , that of nitrogen as 3 , that of oxygen and sulphur as 2 , the halogens all ranking with hydrogen as of unit volume .
In this respect , the theory is entirely at variance with the views held previously that elements of the same valency differ in atomic volume , a doctrine dating back to the time of Kopp , as it involves the assumption that , whilst they retain their relative spheres of influence , the atoms-alter in " volume " according to the conditions under which they are placed .
The structure of benzene arrived at by Barlow and Pope is represented in perspective in fig. 1 \#174 ; and in plan and elevation in figs. 2a and 2b .
It Fig. 1 .
will be noticed that in fig. 2a only those atoms of carbon which are supposed to be in combination are shown as in contact : in the final arrangement in the crystal of closely packed units , the atoms are brought together , it is supposed , in the manner represented in the projection given in fig. 3 : two of the atoms in the upper and also two in the lower plane , shown in plan in fig. 2a , thus become approximated and as a consequence of this distortion the symmetry of arrangement is slightly disturbed .
Equivalence Parameters of Benzene.\#151 ; The great advance made by Barlow and Pope in discussing crystallographic data depends on their use of equivalence parameters in place of axial ratios .
These latter represent only the relative dimensions of the structure in three directions , without reference to any unit of size : by introducing such a factor , namely the volume of the 114 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Podd .
molecular unit\#151 ; the valency volume\#151 ; and calculating three dimensions , proportional to the axial ratios , the product of which is equal to this valency volume , three values are obtained which represent the dimensions of the cell within which the crystal units can be closely packed .
These Fig. 3 .
three dimensions , termed equivalence pand are calculated in the following manner from the axial ratios a:b:c and the valency volume W:\#151 ; x = \lt ; / q2W c sin ft z = cy .

115 The equivalence parameters of orthorhombic benzene are : x:y:z = 3*101 : 3*480 : 2*780 The directions x , y , z , are indicated in tigs .
2b and 3 .
It will be noticed that z ( fig. 2b ) , the thickness of a single layer of benzene molecules , is rather less than the sum of the diameters of a carbon and of a hydrogen sphere , owing to the interpenetration of the layers ; , on the other hand , is equal to twice the diameter of a carbon sphere ; x , the dimension at right angles to y , is of less value : why this is the case will be seen on reference to fig. 3 , which indicates the manner of packing the several units .
Equivalence , Parameters of the Derivatives of Benzene.\#151 ; In their first communication in which they discussed the crystallography of quinol , resorcinol , catechol , triphenylcarbinol , triphenylacetic acid and triphenylamine , Barlow and Pope were able to show that whilst the z value remained practically constant the two other dimensions were modified in accordance with the alterations made in the structure by the radicles which were introduced .
In two later communications , dealing with trinitro-derivatives of benzene , only the z value was taken into account and shown to be in fair agreement with that of orthorhombic benzene ( 2*78 ) , excepting that in a few cases a lower value , approximately 2*6 , was met with .
Successive layers of benzene molecules may conceivably be arranged in the " two different ways shown in figs. 4 and 5 , the one representing an ortho- Fig. 4 .
Fig. 5 .
rhombic and the other a rhombohedral arrangement : in the former , the successive layers are directly superposed , molecule falling upon molecule , whilst in the latter they are so shifted laterally that each molecule in the upper layer is in contact with three molecules in .
the layer below .
In consequence of this shifting , the thickness of the layers is diminished to some slight but unknown extent .
The two types of arrangement are termed by Barlow and Pope the hexagonal and the rhombohedral marshallings : it has 116 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Eodd .
been supposed by them that the latter form prevails in cases in which a \#171 ; value markedly lower than 2*78 is met with .
Since the rhombohedral type of marshalling can be derived , in a simple manner , from a cubic closely packed arrangement of equal spheres , it is conceivable that , in derivatives possessing this marshalling , an approximation to cubic symmetry may be revealed in the crystalline form\#151 ; and as a matter of fact , not a few of the compounds to be described are pseudocubic in form .
In discussing the crystalline form of certain picryl derivatives , Jerusalem and Pope* in 1908 and Jerusalem*}- in 1909 came to the conclusion that the majority of the substances considered were of orthorhombic type ( hexagonal marshalling ) : in a few cases , however , on account either of the low value of the z parameter or of the pseudocubic character of the crystals , they supposed that the rhombohedral marshalling prevailed .
In 1910 , in the first and second of these Studies , | in dealing with 29 compounds of the para- series of the form C6H3R1R2SO2X , the conclusion arrived at , stated in general terms , was that a " benzene framework " was traceable in all cases .
This was based mainly on the occurrence either of \#163 ; values corresponding to one or other of the two types of marshalling referred to above or of pseudocubic structure ; but in the majority of cases , the marshalling was considered to be of rhombohedral type , mainly on account of the frequent occurrence of pseudotrigonal ratios .
No definite conclusion was reached either by Jerusalem and Pope or by ourselves with regard to the significance of the x and y values that were deduced : it was clear that the increase due to the introduction of the sulphonic radicle affected mainly the x parameter but the y value bore no obvious relation to that of benzene and was conspicuously low : both x and y varied considerably in value .
At this time , no special use had been made of models and we were mainly concerned in proving a direct relationship in crystalline form between benzene and the derivatives considered .
In extending the inquiry , the experience gained in examining the various sulphonates referred to in Nos. Ill and IY of these StudiesS has been of material assistance , as , in discussing their properties , it was found to be possible to give a rational interpretation of the crystallographic measurements in terms of the Barlow-Pope theory in complete accordance with the expectations to which chemical considerations give rise .

11 advance made at this stage was the explanation given of the manner in which water of crystallisation is included in the structure .
It is noteworthy that in the case of all the salts considered ( various substituted benzenesulphona tes and several toluenesulphonates ) , excepting silver tolueneparasulphonate , the z value deduced was low ( from 2'64 to 2*68 , that of the silver salt alone being 2'795 ) ; on this account , it was supposed that the units , were disposed in rhombohedral marshalling .
The Influence on Crystalline Form of simple Radicles of the same Valency Volume as Hydrogen .
Effect on the x Parameter of the Radicle S02C1 .
We have now to consider the results obtained on further discussion of the data presented in 1910 in Parts I and II of these Studies relating to compounds of the para-series and also of numerous unpublished observations relating to the isomeric compounds of the 1:3 and 1:2 series .
In the course of the work , much use has been made of solid models and we aseribe our success largely to their introduction ; indeed , without such models , it is almost impossible to visualise the changes in form corresponding to known variations in chemical composition when these are of any degree of complexity .
As , by hypothesis , the atoms of the halogens occupy approximately the same volume as hydrogen atoms , in discussing the data relating to compounds of the form C\#171 ; H3R1R2.SO2X , it is sufficient to consider the probable structure or structures of benzenesulphochloride , C6H5.S02C1 .
The form of structure of a unit of this substance obtained by substituting one hydrogen atom in the benzene complex by the group ( S02C1 ) is shown in the photograph fig. 6 .
The sulphur atom takes the place of the hydrogen 118 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Podd .
atom and is in contact with three Carbon atoms : two oxygen atoms are in contact and presumably combined with the sulphur atom but in a slightly lower plane and are also each in proximity to two carbon atoms : the sulphonic halogen atom which is in contact with both the sulphur atom and with the carbon atom to which the latter is attached lies between the two oxygen atoms : it is open to question whether this atom be not in connexion with these oxygen atoms rather than with the sulphur atom .
Units of this kind , packed together in the manner shown in the diagram fig. 7 , form an assemblage of dimensions corresponding to the crystalloA Fig. 7 .
graphic data of most of the substituted sulphochlorides which we have examined .
The diagram shows one layer of units in plan , the dotted and full line circles being the projections respectively of the lower and of the upper layers of spheres comprised in the units .
The units are all similarly directed and the structure is very closely related to that of benzene ; it may be regarded as derived from that of benzene ( fig. 3 ) by the removal of one hydrogen sphere from the corresponding position in each Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
119 benzene unit and the introduction of the group ( SOaCl ) into its place .
The result of this displacement is to open out the structure in the direction of Successive layers air packed so that the centres of units lie vertically over one another ( i.e.in hexagonal marshalling ) but in alternate layers each unit is rotated through 180 ' about an axis represented as BB ' in the diagram : this then becomes adigonal axis of symmetry : the symmetry of the structure is therefore monosymmetric .
The diagram is drawn from a model of the assemblage and the radii of the spheres are made proportional to the cube roots of the valency volumes of the atoms they represent .
Assuming that the dimension of the structure perpendicular to the plane of the paper is the same as that of benzene , i.e. 2-780 , the translations in the directions of the edges of the drawing marked x and y are found to be 3*82 : 3*38 .
These figures agree remarkably well with the equivalence parameters of paradibromobenzenesulphochloride .
This compound crystallises in the monosymmetric system , 2*476 : 1 : 1-144 .
/ 3 = 95 ' 26 ' ; taking a/ S and interchanging a and c , the equivalence parameters become x : y : z= 3*856 : 3*371 : 2*782 ; the agreement is rendered even closer if allowance be made for the slight distortion which has changed the angle 13 from 90 ' to 95 ' 26 ' , as '3-856 xsin_ 95 ' 26'= 3-838 .
The structure depicted is therefore in complete accordance with that of the actual .
crystal .
The photograph ( fig. 8 ) gives a good idea of the appearance of a structure composed of models of benzenesulphochloride packed together in the manner described .
The values thus found in the case of dibromobenzenesulphocliloride are in marked contrast with those deduced previously , viz.:\#151 ; x : y : z .Former values ... 5*787 : 2-337 : 2*674 Present values ... 3-856 : 3 371 : 2*782 The difference is due to the fact that formerly the dimensions of the x and y parameters were not specially considered and that , in recalculating these parameters , the axial ratio a : b has been divided by 3 , this factor being that found by trial to give values in accordance with the projection of the model of the crystalline structure .
In consequence of this change , the z Fig. 8 .

value is transferred from the c to the a axis\#151 ; hence the alteration / in this value also .
Applying the method in the manner explained to the data in our possession for 31 compounds of the type C6H3RiB2.S02X , we obtain the results embodied in Table I , which includes 14 examples of disubstituted sulphochlorides and bromides of the para-series : 6 of the meta- and 8 of the ortho-series , together with 3 monosubstituted sulphochlorides , all being of one valency volume\#151 ; 36 .
The mean values are as follows:\#151 ; - x : y : z 3-904 : 3-360 : 2*772 4he extremes being 3-806 : 3-222 : 2-680 4*040 : 3-419 : 2*865 The values assigned by Barlow and Pope to benzene itself are 3-101 : 3-480 : 2*780 lit may be noted that these are deduced from observations which , it is probable , are open to improvement .
The results thus arrived at are not only remarkable by reason of the proof they afford of a definite relationship between all the various simple sulphonic derivatives considered but especially as a verification of the Barlow-Pope generalisation .
Taking into account the fact that the position occupied by chlorine , bromine and iodine in the molecule has been varied almost in every possible way , the proof obtained that these elements and hydrogen have the same relative valency volume is little short of absolute .
Attention may also be directed to the fact that not only is the z value that of benzene but , in all cases , that which corresponds to the orthorhombic arrangement or hexagonal form of marshalling .
The y value , in like manner , is in agreement with that of the benzene itself .
With regard to the third or x parameter , the one direction in which , presumably , an elongation of the structure is effected by the addition of the S02C1 complex , the difference between the a ; value , of benzene and that found , 3-904\#151 ; 3-101 = 0*803 , may be regarded as the value of the increment ?
due to the introduction of the group S02Cl(Br ) in place of an atom of hydrogen .
The value deduced from the projection is 0'78 .
At this point , advantage may be taken of the opportunity to justify the method adopted in arriving at the above important series of conclusions , as it is one that involves a modification of the observed axial ratios in the manner $ Table Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .

4 shown in the column " Fractions used " and it may well be asked : " if such a series of compounds as those under discussion are simply related and similar in structure , why is the similarity not at once apparent in the axial ratios as it is in an obviously isomorphous series ?
" The fact that the axial ratios may be reduced to those of one form\#151 ; that of Nos. 13 and 14 , from which the parameters have been deduced without modification\#151 ; is in .
itself proof of the close relationship in which the various compounds stand .
It is a well-known fact that slight changes in the conditions under which it is deposited will sometimes determine profound alterations in the external habit of a crystalline substance .
The development of different sets of planes in the structure as bounding surfaces or faces of the crystal always involves such variations in habit and on account of these variations or even because they look at it merely from a different point of view , different observers often assign different axial ratios to one and the same crystal .
There is , however , always a simple numerical relationship between the different sets of constants so derived .
The following explanation may serve to make this more evident .
In fig. 9 let OA and OB be the directions of the axes a and \amp ; of a crystal and let each small rectangle represent the elevation of one side of a parallelepipedal cell , the lengths 0 a , Ob being proportional to the parameters x and y. The straight lines BA , BA ' then represent important planes in Fig. 9 .
0 Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
123 the structure which may develop as faces of the crystal .
If the plane AB were developed , the observer would give the ratio = OA : OB ; but if A'B were developed , then the ratio a : would be given as OA ' : OB , which is but half as great as the former ratio .
In a similar manner , other planes might develop as faces and other values would then be assigned to the ratio a : b. As mere changes in conditions of crystallisation can thus affect the habit of \amp ; crystal , it is more than probable that the introduction of halogen atoms into different positions in the benzene unit will also modify the crystalline habit .
Such being the case , it is to be expected that the axial ratios of the members of one isomorphous series would differ from those of the members of another series much as they are seen to do in the table , all being reducible to a common form , however , by multiplication or division by some simple whole number .
The method introduced by Barlow and Pope is , in effect , one which makes it possible to recognise and allow for such departures as have been referred to , so that ultimately proper axial ratios can be deduced in eases in which the compounds examined are directly related , though not always obviously .
As all the compounds included in the table can be referred to axial ratios of a similar character , it is clear that their structures can all be partitioned by three sets of parallel planes into parallelepipedal cells of similar shape : these cells , however , cannot always be of the same absolute volume , as the introduction of halogen atoms into the molecule is known to change the molecular volume .
It is to be supposed that such substitutions affect each sphere of influence uniformly , so that the relative volumes of the atoms remain the same : the equivalence parameters remaining unchanged because , whilst the cell undergoes enlargement , the value of the unit valency-volume in terms of which measurement is made is correspondingly irtcreased .
The Influence of Compound Radicles of like Valency Volume ( 7 ) , SO2CI , NO2 , OH3 , CN , on the x Parameter .
In the previous section it is shown that the introduction of an atom of chlorine , bromine or iodine , in place of an atom of hydrogen has but a slight effect on the values of the three equivalence parameters and that the parameter is elongated from 3-101 to 3-904 = 0 803 by the introduction of the group SO2CI in place of an atom of hydrogen ; we have now to consider the effect produced by other radicles of like valency-volume ( 7 ) , viz. N02 , CH3\gt ; CN , on this parameter .
Nitro-derivatives.\#151 ; In the case of the nitro-compounds , the argument is the same as that adopted in the previous section but the material at disposal is limited to the isomorphous metachloro- and bromonitrobenzenes and 3:5 124 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Rod .
dibromonitrobenzene .
The dinitrobenzenes crystallise in forms which cannot at present be interpreted.* The parameter values are in close agreement with those deduced from the sulphonic derivatives , the value of the increment on the parameter due to the introduction of the group NO2 falling well within the limits observed in that series , 0*705\#151 ; 0*939 .
m-Bromonitrobenzene is described by Bodewigt as orthorhombic , : = 0*4957 : 1 : 0*5549 .
The same observer has described 3:5-dibromonitrobenzene as monosymmetric , a : b : c \#151 ; 0*5795 : 1 : 0*2839 , / 3 = 56 ' 12 ' .
Changing { 001 } to { 101 } in this latter compound and multiplying c by 2 , the axial ratios become a :b : c =0*4836 :1 : 0*5675 , / 3 = 94 ' 35 ' : a close morphological relationship is thus revealed between the mono- and dibromo- derivatives .
On calculating the equivalence parameters for these compounds , taking 2c/ 5 , the values obtained are- those given in the following table , including m-chloro-nitrobenzene , which is isomorphous with the bromo-compound ( a : b : c = 0*4975 : 1 : 0*5608 ) .

3*8630 : 3*3885 : 2*7535 Methyl-derivatives.\#151 ; Tolueneparasulphonic-chloride unfortunately crystallises in the anorthic system but paranitrotoluenej is orthorhombic , a : b : c \#151 ; 0*9074 : 1 : 1*0965 .
Taking 35/ 2 , the valency volume being 42 , the parameters are found to be \#151 ; Paranitrotoluene x : y : 4*5622 : 3*3350 : 2*7597 It is clear , on comparing these parameters with those given above , that the introduction of the methyl group into the para-position produces an extension of the structure only in the direction of x , as is to be expected .
The elongation produced by the group can be calculated as ( 4*5622 \#151 ; 3*101)/ 2 = 0*730 , a value in close correspondence with the extension produced by SO2CI and NO2 .
Another compound which may be considered is paraxylylene bromide , C6H4(CH2Br)2 , which crystallises in the monosymmetric systemS a : b : c x : y : z 2*3262 : 1 : 1*8851 / 3 = 81 ' 4 ' 36/ 2 4*333 : 3*5115 : 2*7942 * * * S * Bodewig , ' Jahresb .

125 It will be noticed that the a ?
value is slightly less and the y value slightly greater than are the corresponding values of paranitrotoluene .
Benzeneparadisulphonic-derivatives.\#151 ; If in the diagram of benzenesulpho-chloride ( fig. 7 ) , we suppose the hydrogen atom in the para-position to the sulphochloride group to be displaced by a second such group , a structure is obtained corresponding to benzeneparadisulphochloride .
If the original axial directions be preserved in this derived structure , it can be seen that the result of the substitution will be to extend still more the translation a ?
, the y direction being practically unaffected .
The equivalence parameters of benzeneparadisulphochloride ( a ?
: y : z = 4*4082 : 3*6033 : 2*7516 ) are in substantial agreement with .
this conclusion .
The extension produced by the two S02C1 groups ( 4*408\#151 ; 3*101 = 2 x 0*650 ) is slightly less than double the effect of a single such group .
Both benzeneparadisulphochloride and the corresponding bromide are dimorphous and probably isodimorphous , although the stable forms of the two do not correspond crystallographically .
The disulphobromide is orthorhombic ( the disulphochloride being monosymmetric ) : the equivalence parameters are x:y:z =4*4706 : 3*4326 : 2*7370 .
There is a very close resemblance between the two sets of parameters .
The cause of the dimorphism will be considered at a later stage .
" Paracyanobenzenesulphochloride.\#151 ; This compound crystallises in the orthorhombic system : a:b:c \#151 ; 1*139 :1 : 1*709 ( Mummery ) .
Taking 35/ 2 , the equivalence parameters , x:y :z = 4*156 : 3*649 :2*770 , are obtained .
These parameters are very similar to those of orthorhombic benzenepara- .
disulphobromide : the cyanosulphochloride thus affords another base of the substitution of one group for another of equal valency volume producing but a slight modification of crystal structure .
The Influence of Complex Radicles relatively in Ortho- and Meta-positions on thex and y Parameters.\#151 ; In the case of di-derivatives other than those of the para-series , it is to be expected that both the x and y dimensions will differ to a not inconsiderable extent from those of benzene and that the z value alone will vary within narrow limits .
Benzeneorthodisulphochloride may be taken as illustrative of the changes effected by the introduction of two complex radicles in the ortho-position .
This compound crystallises in the monosymmetric system , 1*5066 :1 : 0*9061 , / 3 = 90 ' 6 ' : but it is obvious from the magnitude of ft and from the general character of the crystals { cf. fig. 27 , p. 158 ) that the symmetry of the structure is but-slightly distorted from orthorhombic .
By removing two hydrogen spheres in the ortho-position from the benzene 126 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Podd .
model and introducing into their place two ( SO2CI ) groups , a model is obtained of which fig. 10 is a photograph .
Models of this kind can be packed together in a plane layer after the manner shown in the diagram , fig. 11 .
All the units in this assemblage are similarly orientated : the units in adjacent horizontal rows , however , are not identical but enantiomorphous .
Successive layers of the structure are identical , the benzene units being stacked one upon the other according to the hexagonal type of marshalling .
The structure possesses orthorhombic symmetry , having a digonal axis at BB ' and digonal screw axes at AA ' emerging perpendicularly from the paper at points marked C. It is easy to conceive that some slight distortion during the process of adjustment to bring about closer packing would lower the symmetry from orthorhombic to monosymmetric .

Meta-derivatives .
Benzenemetadisulphochloride.\#151 ; An examination of a structure derived from orthorhombic benzene by the substitution of two hydrogen atoms in the meta-position by sulphonic radicles reveals the fact that such a substitution would involve substantial increase in the y translation and a smaller elongation of x , much as in the case of the corresponding ortho-diderivatives .
The equivalence parameters of benzenemetadisulphochloride are in agreement with this conclusion:\#151 ; S02C1 |/ \ S02C1 W x : : 42 3 *2226 : 4 *7516 : 2 *7493 Benzenemetadisulphonamide , CeH^SC^-NHa^.\#151 ; This compound may be referred to here as one of the rare cases in which " the amide occurs in a measureable form and is neither pseudocubic nor pseudotetragonal .
It will be obvious that the increase in the x and y values is such as may be expected from the increase in the valency volume from 42 in the chloride to 50 :\#151 ; a b i e : : 2*5086 : 1 : 0*9787 0 = 90 ' O ' a/ 2 , 2 3*4252 : 5*3452 : 2*7308 Metanitrobenzenesulphochloride.\#151 ; If the equivalence parameters of this compound be calculated from the axial ratios : =1*1989 : 1 : 0*4269 , \#163 ; = 89 ' 23 ' , taking 4c , we get x:y:z = 3*2811 : 4*6775 : 2*7368 .
These are practically identical with those of benzenemetadisulphochloride : moreover , both compounds are monosymmetric , the interaxial angle / 3 being very close to 90 : in each case , the direction of the parameter corresponding to the thickness of one layer of benzene units is that of the axis of * Muthmann , * Zeit .

symmetry .
It is clear , therefore , that in the case of meta-compounds , the substitution of the group ( S02C1 ) by the group ( NO , ) of equal valency volume involves very little change in form .
Taking the whole of the evidence brought forward in this section into consideration , it appears that whilst in the case of para-di-derivatives the alteration is practically confined to one principal direction in the crystal structure corresponding to that of the para-positions in benzene , in the case of ortho- and meta-derivatives two directions are affected .
In these more complex derivatives , as in the case of those considered in the previous section , the z parameter varies only within very narrow limits .
Complex radicles such as S02C1 , N02 , CH3 and CH2Br , which are ex hypothesiof equal valency volume , have practically equal influence on crystalline structure , though it is clear , as shown particularly in the case of paracyanobenzenesulphochloride , that elements of different valency volume\#151 ; as is only to he expected\#151 ; do not produce quite the same effect , the radicle CN ; consisting of two large atoms , not " packing " quite in the same way as one made up of a larger number of smaller atoms such as S02C1 .
It appears to us , however , beyond question that the evidence afforded by both types of compound\#151 ; those containing simple and those containing complex radicles\#151 ; is entirely in favour of the fundamental conception of the theory advanced by Barlow and Pope of the part played by valency volume .
, , Influence of Three or more Complex Radicles .
In discussing the data relating to trinitro- ( picryl ) derivatives of benzene in 1908 , Jerusalem and Pope were mainly concerned in showing that " the z dimension of benzene could be distinctly traced throughout the series " ; the value they obtained varied from 2-699 to 2*873 .
Although they recognised that expansion took place in the directions x and y , like ourselves they made no particular effort to discover the laws underlying the changes .
In view of the success that we have met with in dealing with the diderivatives , we have reconsidered their data and with the aid of models and geometrical projections have deduced values which appear to be rational .
In order to get a better idea of the probable dimensions of the equivalence parameters of the trinitro-derivatives , a structure was devised to represent trinitrobenzene , using spheres of appropriate sizes .
It was found that units of benzene in which the hydrogen spheres of one layer , i.e. the 1:3:5 positions , had been displaced by a nitrogen atom , could be packed together symmetrically in a plane in such manner that room was just left for the Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
12i\gt ; requisite number of oxygen spheres , in groups of three , to be placed in the hollows that were left .
The resulting structure had trigonal or nearly trigonal symmetry and its .
dimensions , supposing the or vertical dimension to be practically that of benzene , were = 3*88 : 4*46 : 2*78 .
In Table II on p. 130 are given the equivalence parameters of trinitrobenzene and picryl chloride : it can be seen that these agree very closely with , those of the ideal structure .
They differ considerably , however , from the figures given by Jerusalem and Pope , which are not compatible with this structure .
The table also contains the equivalence parameters of other trinitro-compounds : the values arrived at appear to be consistent with the derivation of the corresponding crystal structures from that of trinitrobenzene .
It will be seen that within narrow limits the z value is always that of the " benzene thickness .
" Attention may be directed to the striking agreement in form of 1:3:5 trinitromethylbenzene and nitromesitylene [ 1:3:5 trimethylnitrobenzene ] .
Styphnic Acid.\#151 ; This compound , which crystallises in the hexagonal system , a : c =\#187 ; 1 : 1*3890 , was referred by Jerusalem and Pope to a system of orthorhombic axes , a:b : c = 1*7321:1 : 1*3890 , whence x:y:z = 4*825 : 2*786 : 3*869 .
The y value is here the z value of benzene .
If styphnic acid be related in form to benzene in the way we suppose , a trigonal axis is to be looked for in the direction of the z parameter and consequently the " thickness " value should correspond to c , not to b. If in the above hexagonal ratio , we halve c and throw the ratio into the orthorhombic form\#151 ; 0*866 : 1 : ( c/ 2 ) cos 30 ' = 0*866 : 1 : 0*6014 the equivalence parameters become ( W = 52 ) x : y : z = 4*0175 : 4*6391 : 2*7901 The figures given for trinitrophloroglucinol hydrate need similar reconsideration .
This substance also is hexagonal , : = 1 : 1*0346 : taking 2c/ 3 , this becomes in the orthorhombic form\#151 ; :b:c \#151 ; 0*8660 :1 : 0*5973 whence x :y.z = 4*1760 :4*8221:2*8802 .
The parameters thus deduced appear to be more yearly rational than those previously arrived at .
The Structure of Benzenesulphanilide and its Derivatives .
The sulphonamides* do not , as a rule , crystallise in well defined forms and in the few cases in which satisfactory measurements have been secured , they have been found to crystallise in pseudotetragonal forms ( Table IY , p. 143 ) which cannot be interpreted .
The sulphanilides and similar compounds , however , usually crystallise with facility in forms well suited for measure130 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Podd .

Having accumulated a large number of data relating to such compounds , notwithstanding the complexity of the problem , we have attempted to decipher their structure , making use of graphic methods-The results arrived at are such that we venture to think our attempt is justified .
The complex nature of the material discussed will be obvious on reference to Table III .

Paradibromobenzenesulphanilide , however , is dimorphous : one form is nearly tetragonal and probably therefore is related closely to tetragonal benzenesulphanilide ; the other\#151 ; a labile form\#151 ; is closely related to orthorhombic benzene .
The axial ratios of the latter form are a:b:c = 1*372 :1:1163 , ft = 97 ' 50 ' .
If a be doubled , W being 68 , the equivalence parameters become x:y:z\#151 ; 3*234:7*631 : 2*781 .
A structure corresponding in symmetry and dimensions to this crystalline form of paradibromobenzenesulphanilide can be built up as follows .
Two undistorted benzene models are placed side by side so that two pairs of carbon and two pairs of hydrogen spheres are in contact ; two hydrogen spheres in contact are then removed and two spheres of volumes 2 and 3 are substituted for them , representing sulphur and nitrogen respectively .
This substitution causes a separation of the two benzene units which were formerly in contact , leaving room for the insertion of one oxygen atom between them .
The positions taken up by the remaining atoms of oxygen and hydrogen can be seen from the photograph , fig. 12 , which represents a model of a single unit of the composition\#151 ; CeH5.SG2NH .
C6H5 .
It should be noted that two such models can be constructed which are enantiomorphously related to one another .
Such units can be arranged in a plane layer to form a very compact structure in the manner shown in fig. 13 , in which the outline of each unit is defined by a broken line .
Units of successive rows are in opposite orientation ; digonal axes emerge perpendicularly from the points marked O Fig. 12 .

133 in the diagram and from all points similar to these .
There are two methods of stacking these layers , one being to rotate a layer similar to the first 180 ' about an axis parallel to the direction of y and then to stack the units so that centres of benzene units lie vertically over one another : in the alternative method , the units of the second layer are the mirror images of those of the first , the stacking in this case also being such that the benzene units lie directly over one another .
This latter is more likely to correspond with the crystal structure , as it is an internally compensated arrangement and is in accordance with the fact that hemihedral crystals of compounds of Fig. 13 .
this type are never observed .
If one crystal only contained molecules of the one type , presumably other crystals would be formed consisting of molecules of the other type : it is to be supposed that crystals thus constituted would show hemihedral forms but such forms are not observed .
No attempt is here made to explain the slight adjustments this structure must undergo to bring it into the most closely packed condition : such adjustments would involve but small changes in the dimensions of the structure and it will serve no useful end to attempt to discuss their nature .
The translations of the assemblage in the directions parallel to the edges of the diagram are shown as 2x and y. Assuming that the vertical translation 134 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Rod .
is 2'781 , the z value for paradibromobenzenesulphanilide , the other dimensions of the diagram are found to b ex ='3*18:7'70 .
These correspond remarkably well with the parameters deduced from the measurements made of paradibromobenzenesulphanilide , viz. , 3-234 : 7'631 .
In addition , the symmetry of the suggested structure corresponds with that observed in the case of this sulphanilide .
Benzenesulphonorthotoluidide.\#151 ; If the unit of benzenesulphanilide outlined in fig. 13 be examined , it will be seen that the two hydrogen atoms in orthopositions to the nitrogen atom are not equivalent and that therefore two different structures might be obtained by substituting the methyl group for the one or the other of these hydrogen atoms .
This does not imply that isomeric benzenesulphonorthotoluidides are possible , because by the simple process of altering the position of the two constituent groups of the toluidide , by rolling the sulphur and nitrogen atoms round each other in the plane of the layer , the two kinds of molecule are converted the one into the other .
" In the free state , the molecule probably takes up an intermediate position between the two forms : the fact implies , however , a possibility of dimorphism .
Diagram fig. 14 and fig. 15 represent a structure Fig. 14 .

135 Fig. 15 .
formed by the displacement of the hydrogen atom in the ortho-position to the nitrogen atom situated between the two benzene units in the molecule a more closely packed structure is obtained V XT \lt ; .
... when the methyl group takes up this position than when it occupies the other ortho-position .
The diagram indicates the manner in which such molecular units g of benzenesulphonorthotoluidide can be packed together in a plane layer .
As in the case of benzenesulphanilide , successive layers probably consist of enantio-morphous units .
If the third layer consist of units of the same kind as the first rotated through an angle of 180 ' about an axis parallel to the direction of y , the fourth layer being similarly related to the second , a structure is obtained having three axes of symmetry at right angles but no planes of symmetry .
This structure may correspond to orthorhombic benzenesulphonorthotoluidide .
Benzenesulphonorthotoluidide crystallises in the orthorhombic system , a:b : c = 0*7780 : 1 : 0-5910 .
Taking 3 and 4c/ 3 , the valency volume being 74 , the equivalence parameters become 3*427 : 7*999 : 2 700 .
If we suppose the vertical dimension in the diagram to be 2*700 , those of , x and y are found to be 3*44:7*96 .
These agree quite satisfactorily with the observed values and we seem therefore to have arrived at a satisfactory -solution of the structure of the orthotoluidide .
The 2:5 chlorobromo- ; benzenesulphonorthotoluidide described in Part II of these Studies appears to hatfe a similar structure , its equivalence parameters being 3*3368 : 8*1238 : 2*7917 ; \#163 ; = 102 ' 5 ' .
It can be seen that the effect of introducing the methyl group into the structure of .
benzenesulphanilide in the ortho-position is to lengthen both xand y parameters to about an equal extent .
Benzenesulphometatoluidide.\#151 ; The diagram fig. 16 illustrates the manner in which molecules of benzenesulphometatoluidide can be packed together .
The same procedure having been adopted in deriving this structure from that of the sulphanilide as in the case of the orthotoluidide , no further explanation is necessary .
It may be remarked , however , that the methyl group of each molecule is found to intrude considerably into the domain of the neighbouring molecule ; the four valencies of each methyl carbon atom in the assemblage are distributed approximately tetrahedrally .
136 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Rod .
Fig. 16 .
2:5 Chlorobromobenzenesulphometatoluidide crystallises in the monosym-metric system , a:b:c = 0*7576 :1 : 1*1546 ; / 3 = 100 ' 37 ' .
The equivalence parameters , taking 4 a , are x :y :z \#151 ; 3*2114 : 8*4287 : 2*7815 .
The dimensions of the diagram , as drawn from the model , are 3*25 : 8*18 : 2*78 .
The correspondence between the two sets of dimensions is very close and becomes even closer if allowance be made for the interaxial angle / 3 , as 8*4287 sin/ 3 = 8*285 .
Comparing these dimensions with those of the sulphanilide , it is obvious that the result of displacing the hydrogen atom in the meta-position by methyl is to increase y considerably and x but very slightly .
A consideration of fig. 13 shows that the displacement of either the meta-or para-hydrogen atom in the aniline radicle by methyl would produce almost identical changes in the dimensions of the structure , namely a considerable elongation of y and very little change in x. It has not , therefore , been deemed necessary to draw a diagram representing the structure of benzenesulpho-paratoluidide ; it is sufficient to show that the equivalence parameters of such compounds as we have examined bear out our statement .
The following examples illustrate this point:\#151 ; Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .

It may be anticipated that the effects upon the structure of benzene-aulphanilide of methyl groups in various positions will be cumulative when two or more groups are introduced together .
For instance , if methyl groups be introduced into both ortho- and meta- or ortho- and para-positions , an elongation of both x and y parameters is to be expected .
The following examples demonstrate this:\#151 ; X \ y : Z 0 Br - \lt ; 1 ^\gt ; so2nh\lt ; ^ y 3*234 : : 7 *631 : : 2 *781 97 ' 50 ' H ' Br ch3 ^\gt ; so2nh\lt ; ^ \ch3 3 *6802 : : 8 *0318 : : 2 *7293 97 25 ch3 * c \so2nh/ 3 *3485 : : 8 *8622 : 2 *7555 101 56 oh3 ch3 CH\lt ; " " SsOjjNh/ \ y \ / 3*4406 : 8 *4733 : 2 *7440 90 0 Unfortunately tolueneparasulphoparatoluidide crystallises in the anorthic system and consequently its axial directions cannot be determined but we should expect to find in this case a considerable extension in the direction of y and practically none in that of x. The displacement of the imino-hydrogen atom in benzenesulphanilide by the methyl group should produce an increase in the direction of x ; the further introduction of a methyl group in the para-position should leave x vol. xo.\#151 ; A.

It may be noticed that in all eases the z value approximates very nearly to that of benzene .
The yvalues vary from 7*513 to 8*86 ; they are therefore 0*553-1*90 in excess of twice the y value of benzene , 3*480 x 2 = 6*960 .
When the changes in composition are considered with reference to Diagram 13 ( benzene-sulphanilide ) and the manner in which the substitution is effected in various regions of the molecule of benzenesulphanilide is taken into account , it is obvious that the increase in the value of the y axis is of the character to be expected throughout the series .
As is indicated by the same diagram , the change to be expected in the parameter is relatively small in most cases ; actually the values deduced ( 3*2114-3*680 ) are but slightly in excess of the x value of benzene , 3*101 .
Disulphanilides.\#151 ; Benzenemetadisulphanilide has a crystal structure apparently very similar to that of benzenesulphanilide .
The accompanying diagram , fig. 17 , shows the probable configuration of a unit of this substance .
[ Fig. 17 .
The y dimension of a structure built up of such units should have a value about 3/ 2 times that of benzenesulphanilide .
The actual equivalence parameters of the meta-compound deduced are = 3*239:13*035 : 2*515 ; the low value thus found of z is noteworthy and in a measure unsatisfactory .
The structure of benzeneparadisulphanilide is apparently very similar to Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
139 that of the metadisulphanilide ; a comparison of the equivalence parameters of the two compounds in Table III shows them to be almost identical .
A ready explanation of this observation is immediately forthcoming , for if the unit of the meta-compound of fig. 17 be compared with the unit of the para-compound of fig. 18 , it can be seen that the configuration of the unit is Fig. 18 .
practically the same whether the three benzene units are linked through meta- or para-positions .
The Structure of Acetanilide and allied Compounds .
The cases previously considered have been either simple substitution derivatives or compounds such as benzenesulphanilide containing two benzene nuclei , more or less modified by substitution : in the present section , the effect of introducing acid radicles of paraffinoid type into aniline and its derivatives will be considered .
Models of the unit of acetanilide of appropriate size may readily be packed together but it will be noticed that the margins of the units in the region occupied by the acid radicle interpenetrate to an extent not noticeable in previous cases .
The form and dimensions of a plane layer of the assemblage are shown in fig. .
19 .
The axial ratios of acetanilide are\#151 ; = 2*0670 : 1 : 0*8488 , the symmetry being orthorhombic : taking 2a/ 3 , the equivalence parameters are \#151 ; x : y : z = 4*6862 : 3*4007 : 2*8865 .
The diagram is drawn accurately to these figures .
Attention may be called to the fact that , as was to be expected , the y and z values are those of benzene , the x axis alone being elongated and to a considerable extent .
The axial ratios and equivalence parameters of a considerable number of compounds of the series are given in the following table .
The figures indicate\#151 ; ( 1 ) that the hexagonal marshalling of benzene units is retained in the structures , z being slightly above the benzene value 2*780 ; ( 2 ) the value of y is scarcely affected by the introduction of alkylic radicles into the amino-group ; ( 3 ) the introduction of alkylic groups increases only the 140 Prof. Armstrohg and Messrs. Colgate and Rodd .

It is clear when the model structure of acetanilide is examined , that alkylic groups can be introduced without disturbing the dimensions of the translations y or z. It will be observed also that the structure of parabromoformanilide is very similar to that of formanilide .

In devising homogeneous closely packed assemblages of spheres to represent structures so complex as the substances under consideration , the difficulties encountered are very considerable .
The exact interpretation to be put upon the axial ratios is therefore somewhat uncertain and the equivalence para- meters given in the following table are only put forward tentatively as those | ''SSI a b : c \amp ; W 1 Fractions used 1 X * y : z ch3 ch3 S02C1 S02Et 1 -6499 : 1 : 1 -1806 90 ' O ' .66 3 e/ 2 4 -6638 : 5 -0059 : 2 *8268 ch3 M ch3 l J SOoCl S02Et 0-6856 : 1 : : 0-7410 80 9 66 2b 15 4-7361 i : 5-1189 : 2 -7632 so2ci ch3 ch3 f 1 S.Et 0 -9942 : 1 : : 0 -6214 92 27 62 \#151 ; 4 -6205 : : 4 ; 6485 : : 2 -8885 ch3 Cff3 f \ SOoNH2 u S.Et 0-7374 : 1 : 0 -8882 75 28 j 66 11 b/ 2 4 -3705 : 5 -2641 : 2 -9634 142 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs.

which appear to be rational , in order to show that the method is applicable in cases of this character .
The dimensions of the eqivalence parameters agree , so far as we have been able to ascertain , with the dimensions of model structures constructed on the lines of those already described .
It may be mentioned that several compounds allied to those considered by us were measured by Dr. Harker which crystallised either in anorthic or pseudotetragonal forms .
Anorthic , Pseudocubic and Pseudotetragonal Forms .
Of the large number of benzenesulphochlorides containing halogens which have been examined , not a few crystallise in the anorthic system , this being the case particularly in the 1:3:4 and 1:3:5 series studied by Jee .
As anorthie crystals possess no elements of symmetry , it is impossible to identify any principal directions in the crystal structure : no attempt can be made , therefore , at present , to interpret the structure of such crystals .
Another class of crystals which cannot be dealt with includes all those of exceptionally high symmetry which approximate to cubic or to tetragonal symmetry .
Such crystals are probably very closely related in structure to the cubic closely packed arrangement of equal spheres and in all probability , in such cases , the cubic or tetragonal space lattice contains several chemical units differing in their orientation .
The identification of the translations in the crystal structure , in such cases again , is a matter of impossibility , at present .
But the fact that such forms are met with frequently is of little effect on the argument , as it is possible to interpret the structure of substances closely allied to the forms which are anorthic ; and in not a few cases , if not connected by transition forms with members of their series of determined structure , the anorthic forms may be caused to assume forms of determinable structure by crystallising them with substances with which they are isopolymorphous\#151 ; a proof that they differ but slightly from the terms of recognised structure .
The argument is equally applicable to pseudocubic and pseudotetragonal forms .

Summary .
We venture to think that the evidence we are able to submit in this communication is conclusive proof of the validity of the postulates upon which Barlow and Pope have based their method of correlating crystalline form with internal molecular structure and of the general accuracy of their conclusions , at least in the case of benzene and its immediate derivatives .
It cannot be doubted that the establishment of a connexion between external and internal configuration is a step forward of immense consequence and that many problems hitherto beyond our reach may now be taken into consideration\#151 ; especially the inquiry into the internal structure of the simpler compounds which have so long defied analysis .
Hitherto crystallography has been little more than a descriptive science but it is to be expected that , in the near future , it will prove to be an all important and indispensable adjunct to chemical inquiry into both intramolecular and intermolecular structure .
Meanwhile there are some considerations to which it is desirable to draw immediate attention .
The Formula of Benzene and the Disposition of the Affinities of the Carbon Atom .
Chemists are accustomed to represent benzene by a plane symbol and of late years it has been fairly generally admitted that the properties of the hydrocarbon are best expressed by the centric formula .
In point of fact , this formula is practically the projection of the Barlow-Pope solid model representative of the interatomic structure and configuration of benzene arrived at by compressing the two layers into one plane , so as to exhibit the disposition of the carbon atoms in a " ring .
" In passing from plane to solid formulae , on the other hand , if we are logical , we must give to these latter as full a meaning as we have been accustomed to give to the plane formulae : in other words , the solid units must be considered to be endowed with the properties which are regarded as characteristic of the elements they represent ; It is generally recognised that the va n't Hoff tetrahedral symbol of carbon is a symbol of extraordinary significance and there can be little doubt that it is truly representative of certain fundamental properties of the carbon atom , particularly of the disposition of the four affinities : more especially of the fact that these affinities operate within and without the atom in certain directions : those represented by lines drawn from the centre of mass of the regular tetrahedron to its four Morphological Studies of Benzene .
145 apices : lines which meet , therefore , at an angle of 109 ' 28 ' and in the manner shown in fig. 20 .
As Barlow and Pope point out , when the carbon units are dissected out from their models , in the case of paraffinoid ( open chain ) derivatives , the directions in which affinity acts\#151 ; those in which the various atoms are attached in the solid models\#151 ; are those recognised by the va n't Hoff hypothesis .
It is owing to the fundamental property referred to that the carbon atoms in carbon compounds generally , not only in benzene , become arranged not in single layers in a plane but in zigzag fashion , in two superposed planes .
Thus , in the case of camphor , for example , the crystalline structure can be regarded as derived from an hexagonal closely packed assemblage of equal spheres arranged in two layers .
If two layers be selected from an hexagonal assemblage of equal spheres , in the plane perpendicular to the hexagonal axis ; and if from one of these layers alternate spheres be removed in two rows out of three , the remaining assemblage is immediately partitionable into units of 10 spheres so constituted as to simulate the arrangement of the carbon atoms in the camphor molecule but more opened out than in benzene .
A structure thus derived would probably possess trigonal symmetry .
As a matter of fact , camphor is trigonal and several of the derivatives are pseudotrigonal .
The dimension in the direction of the trigonal axis appears , from the model , to be close to the z value for benzene .
The parameters of camphor and several of its derivatives which we have been able to deduce are in accordance with this view d : b : c Fractions used x : y : z* Camphor 0 *866 : 1 : 1 -6851 1 -4830 : 1 : 1 -8365 1 -5409 : 1 : 1 -9943 1 *5379 : 1 : 1 -8355 0-9707 : 1 :1*2079 P = 93 ' 15 ' c/ 3 2a/ 3 4 *2625 : 4 -9220 s 2 -7647 4*1106 : 5-0904 : 2*7718 4-1027 : 5-3098 : 2-6625 4 -2117 : 5 -0273 : 2 " 7389 4 -2048 : 5 *0789 : 2 *7210 aa Diclilorocamphor act Dibromocamphor aa Bromochlorocamphor ... a Chlorocamphor As , therefore , it is to be expected that a dimension very near to the z dimension of benzene will be met with outside the benzene series , our demonstration that not only the z value of benzene but also the y value s characteristic of so a large a number of benzene derivatives is* of special interest and value , as definite proof that the postulates on which the Barlow-Pope theory is based are sound : the variations in dimension of the 146 Prof. Armstrong and Messrs. Colgate and Podd .
x and y values which are the outcome of the various changes in composition to which we have referred are equally of value and interest in this connexion .
But if the structure of benzene and benzenoid compounds be as suggested , the affinities of the carbon atoms cannot possibly meet at the natural angle ( 109 ' 28 ' ) .
It must , therefore , be supposed either that they do not act , within and from the atom , rigidly at a definite angle but are more or less deflected and strained : or that if they are so directed , interacting affinities do not overlap and neutralise each other but- remain more or less unneutralised .
The former view is practically that put forward by von Baeyer , the latter being that advocated by one of us .
The behaviour of benzenoid compounds is more in accordance with this latter point of view .
Fig. 20 .
Fig. 21 .
In the case of benzene , the interacting affinities , including those by which the hydrogen atoms are held , must be so directed , in the case of each carbon atom , that three are projected into one and the .same plane ; the fourth affinity of each carbon atom will then be directed into an opposite plane .
The result is that a bundle of three affinities\#151 ; Faraday tubes or lines of force\#151 ; emerges from each face of the benzene molecule , practically at right angles to the plane of the molecule , as shown in fig. 21 .
These are the " centric " affinities , it may be supposed : and it is their interaction apparently which gives benzene its special character .
Each affinity in the upper plane is balanced by a corresponding affinity in r.he lower plane but the two sets of affinities interpenetrate if projected upon a central plane .
The conclusion which we have been accustomed to draw , that the carbon atoms in benzene are united in a " ring " and nearly saturate one another is Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
147 thus seen to be incorrect : the stability of the hydrocarbon cannot be due to the fact that the affinities meet at nearly the natural angle ( 109 ' 28 ' ) but is rather to be ascribed to the influence exercised by the " centric " affinities : the unsaturated character of benzene is probably due to the unsatisfied affinities above referred to at the periphery of the molecule , which may be regarded as the active region .
If this view be applied in other cases important consequences follow .
Thus ______________ ___ / \ c-/ N\lt ; ____\gt ; | I 1 I it is customary to represent the hydrocarbons dibenzyl , stilbene and tolane by symbols such as the first but tl^e arrangement is more nearly that of the second given above : in this latter figure , bearing in mind that in the case of each pair of carbon atoms in benzene the two atoms which are combined are in different planes , the two carbon atoms which unite the two benzene residues are shown in different planes .
Crystallographically the three compounds are very closely related:\#151 ; a : b : c $ W Fractions used x : y : z Dibenzyl C2H4P1i2 ... r 1 -8938 : 1 : 0 *6261 81 ' 24 ' 70 36/ 4 3 *2265 : 8 '1468 : 2 6935 Stilbene C2H2Pli2 ... 1 '9970 : 1 : 0 '7026 84 38 68 36/ 4 3 '0141 : 8 0250 : 2 '8236 Tolane C9Ph2 2 *0197 : 1 : 0 '6800 82 45 66 36/ 4 3 '0091 : 8 '1036 : 2 '7285 Apparently the differences in the arrangement of the assemblage conditioned by the presence or absence of either two or four hydrogen atoms are but slight , the dimensions of the x and z parameters being very nearly those of benzene , the y parameter showing an increase such as is to be expected .
But taking into account the direction in which affinity acts in tolane from the benzene units towards the pair of carbon atoms at the junction , each of these latter must be supposed to have an affinity free , the which affinity is directed outwards : presumably these free affinities produce a disturbance in the fields normally existent at.each surface of the two benzene residues .
If this be a correct conclusion , the central carbon atoms in tolane cannot be and are not combined in the manner commonly supposed by three affinities of each but at most by two , as in ethenoid compounds.* * It may be remembered that it has been contended by Julius Thomsen that the carbon atoms are less firmly held together in ethylene than in ethane and still less firmly in acetylene ; cf. ' Phil. Mag. , ' vol. 23 , p. 73 ( 1887 ) .

There are many directions in which it will be desirable to pursue the inquiry into the correlation of crystalline form with molecular structure and with physical and chemical properties : it is already clear , that when the solid configuration of the molecules is taken into account , not a few of the problems which have occupied attention of late years will meet with a simpler solution than it has been possible to give to them hitherto .
The discussion of these matters and of the camphor and naphthalene derivatives , however , is reserved for a future communication .

Of the 15 sulphochlorides of the para-series previously considered , this is the only one for which we have not been able to deduce parameters in agreement with those given by other terms of the series : we have again prepared and measured the substance without discovering any error in the previous measurements but in so doing we have noticed that this chloriodo-chloride is dimorphous ; the second form , however , is labile and crystallises in the anorthic system .
It may be noted that the compound S02C1 : Br : I = 1 : 2 : 5 ( No. 12 ) is also dimorphous but the stable second form of this substance has uot been obtained from solution , the change taking place after removal from the liquid .
The two compounds referred to are the only instances of dimorphism yet observed in the 1 : 4 series .

Benzeneparadisidphochloride , C6H4(S02C1)2 .
This compound was prepared from potassium benzeneparadisulplionate by the action of a mixture of phosphorus tri- and pentachlorides .
After some trouble , good measurable crystals were obtained from benzene ; as a rule , the substance crystallises in four-sided prisms , terminated , at each end , by a single face .
Such crystals do not give sufficient data for the determination of the axial ratios , but other forms appear occasionally from which the necessary data may be derived ( cf. fig. 29 ) .
The compound is described by Hollemann* as dimorphous , the transition point being 71'4 ' C. Conclusive proof of the dimorphism of the substance is obtained if a thin liquid film be allowed to cool slowly upon a microscope slide under a cover-slip .
The film first crystallises in a transparent form , showing good colour effects when viewed under the polarising microscope ; in a few seconds , however , a change sweeps across it and it becomes opaque , the effect upon polarised light being then quite different .
Only one crystalline form has been isolated .

This compound has been measured by L. Brugnatelli , * but as the data quoted by him were somewhat scanty , we have again examined the compound .
System : Tetragonal .
Axial ratios : a : c =1 : 2*4324 .
Habit : Well-formed octahedra from acetone or ethylic acetate , consisting of the form { 112 } , the form { 001 } appearing as a truncation .
The form { 111 } was also observed .
y ery massive crystals are frequently obtained ( cf. fig. 30 ) .
Brugnatelli could detect no cleavage but we find that the crystals cleave perfectly parallel to c{001 } .
A cleavage plate exhibits the figure characteristic of an uniaxial crystal .

One of the most interesting results of this work is the observation that butyranilide exists in two forms an orthorhombic and a tetragonal\#151 ; and that these may be caused to pass over into one another reversibly by raising or lowering the temperature , the change involving an alteration in the angles which may be followed on the goniometer ; no other obvious change takes place in the crystal .
