( Abstract .
) These integrals present themselves in calculations dealing with arbitrary functions on the surface of a sphere which vary discontinuously in passing from one hemisphere to the other .
When n , n ' are both even or both odd , the values of the integrals may be immediately inferred from known theorems in which the integration extends from -1 to + 1 , or over the whole sphere ; otherwise a special method is necessary .
In the present paper a function of two variables is investigated , which , when expanded , has for coefficients the quantities in question .
As an example of the method , the problem is taken of a uniform conducting sphere exposed to the heat proceeding from a radiant point .
It will appear at once that the heat received by any element of the surface is expressed by different analytical functions on the two hemispheres-a source of discontinuity which renders necessary a special treatment of the problem .
The solution is afterwards generalized to meet the case of a sphere exposed to any kind of radiation from a distance .
One remarkable result not confined to the sphere is , that the effect of a radiation which is expressed by one or more harmonic terms of odd order is altogether nil , with the single exception of the term of the first order .
