] Although the great majority of the lines in the spectrum of e Orionis\#151 ; which is the type-star of the Alnitamian Group of the Kensington Classification\#151 ; have previously been traced to their source , there remained a few outstanding lines for which no satisfactory origin has been suggested .
Recent research here has revealed what appear to be , with little or no doubt , the laboratory equivalents of these lines , whose approximate wave-lengths r4647-6 are 4097*4 , 4379*8 , and4 ^ 5 g , the latter being a close double , the mean position of which falls very near the strong oxygen line 4649*3 .
The first of these lines was given in previous publications* as being probably due to silicium , forming with lines at 4089*1 , 4116*4 , what were described as the Group IV lines of that element .
In a later publication by Mr. Lunt , f although the last mentioned lines were confirmed by him as being high temperature silicium lines , he concluded that the line 4097 could not be ascribed to Si , as he had found no trace of such a line in any of his silicium photographs .
The results now arrived at here show that his conclusions , were correct , this line having been traced to another origin .
In the course ' of an inter-comparison of the spark spectra of various metals , a set of four lines of peculiar behaviour was noticed by one of us in the spark spectrum of chromium .
These appeared as " pole " or " beaded lines near one edge of the spectrum , and are shown in strip 10 of the Plate , where they are indicated by four small arrows .
Although the spectrum contained several hundreds of lines , a search for other lines of similar appearance along the same edge of the spectrum failed to reveal any .
Here , then , was a set of evidently associated lines\#151 ; possibly all due to the same element which occurred specially under the conditions of the vapour surrounding one pole of the spark .
It was at once seen that the position of the lines was in the * 'Roy .

Origin of certain Lines in the Spectrum of e Orionis .
533 vicinity of H3 , and the presence of strong lines in this region in the spectrum of e Orionis suggested a careful investigation of the laboratory wave-lengths and a comparison with the wave-lengths of the stellar lines .
As the chromium photograph contained lines of iron and calcium as impurities , several standard lines of these metals were available for use as fiducial lines .
Those adopted were 4005*408 ( Fe ) , 4063*759 ( Fe ) , and 4226*904 ( Ca ) .
From measures made on these and the " pole " lines , the wave-lengths of the latter were calculated by Hartmann 's formula .
They resulted as follows :\#151 ; 4089*04 4103*54 4097*49 4116*29 The first and last of these were so near the wave-lengths of the two strong lines of silicium ( Group IV ) , previously referred to , that a silicium origin at once suggested itself .
A comparison of the chromium and silicium spark photographs confirmed this , suggestion , the lines in the silicium spark agreeing exactly in position with the outside pair of " pole " lines of the chromium spark .
To establish definitely the occurrence of silicium as an impurity in the chromium , the other groups of silicium lines were looked for in the chromium spectrum .
Those of Group II ( 4128*1 , 4131*1 ) and Group III ( 4552*8 , 4568*0 , 4574*9 ) , were unmistakably present .
The lines of Group 1(3905*8 , 4103*2 ) were doubtfully present , but as these occur more prominently as arc than as spark lines , their possible absence could be understood .
It may be said here that the Group II and Group III lines of silicium occur in this spark spectrum of chromium as ordinary lines , and not as lines intensified at one edge of the spectrum similarly to the Group IV lines .
It thus became evident that at least two of the strange quartette ( 4089 and 4116 ) could be accounted for as being due to silieium occurring as an impurity in the chromium used .
With regard to the other pair , the stronger line of the two ( 4097*4 ) was known to be so near the well-marked line of unknown origin in e Orionis ( mentioned at the beginning of this paper ) that it was determined to enlarge the stellar spectrum up to the scale of the laboratory spectrum of chromium , and make a direct comparison of the two to see if the stellar and laboratory lines agreed in position .
When this was done it was found that the three lines mentioned ( 4089 , 4097 , 4116 ) fitted exactly the three well-marked lines of e Orionis in the neighbourhood of HS ( see strips 10 and 11 of the Plate ) .
The position of the fourth strange line ( 4103*5 ) is so near HS that the latter line , being strong and diffuse in the star , probably masks the stellar counterpart of the laboratory line .

[ May 15 , Although , then , there appeared to be no doubt as to the identity of the stellar and laboratory lines , it remained to determine the chemical element to which the middle pair of abnormal lines could be attributed .
Search for Origins of Lines 4097*4 , 4103*5 .
From previous experience we knew that the Group IV lines of silicium\#151 ; with which the above lines are associated in the chromium spark photograph \#151 ; show more prominently under vacuum tube conditions than in the ordinary spark spectrum .
We determined , therefore , to test various vacuum tubes to see if any of them furnished such a pair of lines .
As these lines are in the portion of the spectrum beyond the visual region , it was impossible to watch for their appearance , or , if they occurred in the spectrum , to watch their behaviour while the electrical conditions were being varied .
It was known , however , that in the Alnitamian stars there is invariably a strong double line of unknown origin near the strong oxygen line 4649*3 .
This being well inside the visible region of the spectrum , a careful comparison of the region near this oxygen line was made , using vacuum tubes containing various gases , with the object of determining whether any abnormality or intensification near the oxygen line mentioned was introduced while the spark discharge conditions wer6 being varied .
Using a vacuum tube which contained alcohol vapour , under the low-tension spark condition the oxygen line 4649'3 and other oxygen lines in the same region presented quite their normal appearance .
" With a strong disruptive spark , however , it was instantly seen that there was a conspicuous intensification in the spectrum at or near 4649 , without any corresponding alteration in the intensity of the neighbouring oxygen lines .
This appeared so encouraging that it was decided to obtain at once a photographic record of the spectrum for more detailed examination .
The resulting photograph portions of which are reproduced in strips 2 and 16\#151 ; showed the spectrum under the disruptive spark conditions .
As compared with the lines near 4649 as they appear in the normal oxygen spectrum ( strip 18 ) , it will be seep that there is a considerable modification in the appearance of the lines in the alcohol spectrum ( strip 16 ) , an extra line having appeared on the more refrangible side of the oxygen line 4649*3 , and the oxygen line on the less refrangible side , 4650*8 , being considerably strengthened , probably by the superposition , of another strange line .
These strange lines will be referred to in detail in a later part of the paper , and their relation to e Orionis lines discussed .
An examination of the alcohol photograph in the region near X4100 showed at once an outstanding pair of lines at \ 4097*4 , 4103*5 , which , 1909 .
] Origin of certain Lines in Spectrum of e Orionis .
when directly compared with the pole lines of the chromium spark photograph , was found to agree exactly with the middle pair , the origin of which was under investigation .
The alcohol spectrum contained , in addition to oxygen , hydrogen , and carbon lines , the strange lines referred to , and the ordinary lines of nitrogen .
These latter may have been introduced by a slight leakage of air into the tube .
A comparison of the alcohol photograph with various photographs of oxygen , carbon oxides , and hydrogen spectra , failed to show on the latter any lines corresponding to the pair under investigation .
It was found , however , that a pair of lines corresponding exactly in position with the strange double existed in the ordinary spark spectrum of nitrogen , the components being of the same relative intensity , but the double in the nitrogen being quite insignificant in intrinsic intensity as compared with its appearance in the alcohol tube .
This , then , tended to show that the lines were due to nitrogen , but under certain conditions of current were abnormally strengthened , relatively to other nitrogen lines .
Photographs were then taken of the spectra given by a nitrogen vacuum tube ( Gallenkamp)\#151 ; ( 1 ) Using the large jar and large air-break .

Under the low-tension condition , although the strong nitrogen line 3995 of the ordinary spark spectrum is shown as a strong line , the double 4097\#151 ; 4103 is lacking .
Under the high-tension condition , however , the latter double is very conspicuous , the stronger of the pair being now quite as strong as , if not stronger than , the nitrogen line 3995 .
The nitrogen tube spectrum of strip 3 shows the stronger oxygen lines .

During the search for the origins of the pair of lines 4097\#151 ; 4103 the spectrum given by an amidogene vacuum tube was photographed .
This was found to contain four lines which correspond exactly in position with the four " pole " lines of the chromium spark .
A portion of this amidogene spectrum is reproduced in strip 12 .
Reference to this and strips 10 ( chromium ) , 11 ( e Orionis ) , and 13 ( nitrogen high tension spark ) , will show that the three lines 4089 , 4097 , and 4116 of the amidogene and chromium spectra are identical with three very prominent lines of e Orionis , the fourth line 4103 being probably masked in the star by the adjacent strong H8 line .
The middle pair of the amidogene ( strip 12 ) and chromium ( strip 10 ) quartette is also seen to be identical with the strongly developed pair of the nitrogen spectrum of strip 13 .
The presence of the two silicium lines 4089*1 and 4116*4 in the amidogene spectrum is probably accounted for by the presence of small detached particles of glass in the bore of the capillary of the vacuum tube , which was an old one .
Reference to Nitrogen Lines in Stellar Spectra .
Shortly after the discovery by Mr. Frank McClean in 1897 of oxygen lines in some of the helium stars , the identity of other lines in similar types of spectra with the stronger spark lines of nitrogen was established by a comparison of the Kensington laboratory and stellar photographs , and these identifications were incorporated in the tabular matter in a Catalogue of 470 of the Brighter Stars.* In a paper " On the Presence of Oxygen in the Atmospheres of certain Fixed Stars , " t Mr. David Gill , after-saying ( p. 205 ) : " there remains not the slightest doubt that all the stronger oxygen lines are present in the spectrum of / 3 Qrucis , at least between X4250 and X4575 , " goes on to say : " It is almost equally certain that there is no trace of true nitrogen lines in this spectrum .
" In this he was probably referring to the limited region of the spectrum which he investigated .
That the strong nitrogen lines 39951 , 4630*7 occur in the Crucis spectrum there can be no question , as a reference to Mr. McClean 's tabular list of lines* and his reproductions will clearly show .
Another line recorded by McClean in / 3 Crucis at X 4447*2 is doubtless * Published by the Solar Physics Committee ( 1902 ) .

This line occurs in the region investigated by Gill , but he does not record it in his list of stellar lines .
The wave-length of the line in e Orionis near 4097 as recorded in a previous publication* was 4097*3 .
The wave-length of the abnormal nitrogen line with which this has now been identified has , from measures made on the Rowland grating photographs of the nitrogen spark , been found to be 4097*45 .
This is not far removed from the recorded wave-length of the stellar line , but the latter has , with others in the same region , been remeasured , and its position redetermined by use of Hartmann 's formula .
The fiducial lines used were 4026*34 ( helium ) , 4143*92 ( asterium ) , and 4388*10 ( asterium ) .
The resulting stellar wave-lengths are given in the first column of the following table .

The differences between the two sets are within the limits of error in determining the stellar wave-lengths ; and there seems no reason to doubt from this evidence that the identity of the stellar and laboratory lines given in the table is a real one .
The wave-length 4096*9 recorded in the Harvard publicationf for the e Orionis line appears to be about half a tenth-metre too low .
Hartmann , { for what is undoubtedly the corresponding line in 3 Orionis , gives 4097*49 , which is in very good accord with the redetermination of the stellar wavelength ( 4097*59 ) , and also with the wave-length of the nitrogen line identified with it ( 4097*45 ) .

" In a subsequent paper , + Miss Cannon ascribes the lines 4089*2 and 4096*9 to argon .
These identifications will be discussed in a later part of the present paper .
From the preceding table it will be seen that in the star 29 Canis Majoris line 4096*9 is tremendously strengthened relatively to the silicium lines 4089*2 and 4116*2 .
In e Orionis , although it is a well-marked line , it is considerably inferior in intensity to the two lines just mentioned .
With reference to the origin of the stellar line 4096*9 ( Hartmann 's X 4097*49 ) , Lunt , t after saying : " Some other origin than silicium must be sought for this line , " goes on to say : " There are both oxygen and nitrogen lines very close to this place , but neither of these elements accounts for the strong stellar line .
" That the nitrogen line he refers to is a line of abnormal behaviour was not , of course , then known to him , nor to us , and he probably based his opinion as to its non-identity with the stellar line on its insignificant intensity in the ordinary nitrogen spectrum .
It will be instructive to compare the intensities of the strongest spark lines of nitrogen , as they occur in various types of stellar spectra , with the intensity of the abnormal nitrogen line 4097*4 in the same types .
The following table gives these comparative intensities in the Eigelian , Crucian , and Alnitamian groups of the Kensington classification .
The type-stars of these groups are respectively Kigel , Bellatrix , and e Orionis .

On the other hand , the abnormal nitrogen line 4097*4 is lacking in the Eigelian , occurs as quite a weak line in the Crucian , and has considerably developed at the Alnitamian stage .
As shown in a previous table abstracted from Cannon and Pickering 's publication , this line becomes more intense still in other stars , having an intensity 6 in rCanis Majoris , and an intensity of 18 in 29 Canis Majoris .

[ May 15 , understand how they have come to be recorded as argon .
Beference to Eder and Yalenta 's publication* on the argon spectrum shows that there are lines at XX 4089-04 , 4097-27 .
The respective intensities of these , however , are only 1 and 2 where the maximum is 10 .
As there are , between XX 3900 and 4700 , 114 lines of argon , varying in intensity from 1 to 10 , the evidence for the stellar lines being argon is almost negligible unless it can be shown that the stronger argon lines also occur in the stellar spectrum , or , as an alternative , that this pair of weak argon lines has some special behaviour relatively to other argon lines when the laboratory conditions are varied .
To put this alternative to the test , the argon spectrum was photographed under the high-tension spark conditions which produced the abnormal nitrogen lines previously referred to , but there was no evidence of any relative strengthening of the weak argon lines in question .
Comparison has also been made of the wave-lengths of the strongest lines of argon with those of the e Orionis lines and there appears to be no connection whatever between the two sets .
Line 4379-8 .
After the stellar line 4097 had been identified with a nitrogen line of abnormal behaviour , the nitrogen spectrum was examined to see if there was an anomalous line which could account for a fairly well-marked and sharp line in e Orionis whose wave-length had , from recent measures , been estimated as 4379'8 , and whose origin was unknown .
In the ordinary spark spectrum of nitrogen there is a line of insignificant intensity agreeing in position with the stellar line .
Exner and Haschek 's wave-length for this line is 4379-75 .
Its intensity is 1 as compared with 50 for the strong spark line at 39951 , and 20 for the strong spark line at 4447'2 .
On turning to the spectrum given by the G-allenkamp vacuum ^tube of nitrogen when the high-tension spark is used , this line was seen to be enormously developed relatively to other nitrogen lines .
This is shown in strip 7 , where the line in question is quite as strong as 4447-2 , whereas in strip 9 although the 4447-2 line is very strong , 4379'8 is lacking .
In another spectrum of the Gallenkamp tube , not reproduced on account of the broad nature of the lines , the line 4379*8 is , without exception , the strongest line in the whole spectrum .
In the light of the existence of the other abnormal nitrogen line 4097 4 in the stellar spectrum , then , there is little doubt that this abnormal line 4379 8 is identical with the stellar line at the same wave-length .

] Origin of certain Lines in Spectrum e 541 Lines 4647-6\#151 ; 4650*8 .
When a strange double in this region was found in the alcohol spectrum ( strip 16 ) which showed the abnormal nitrogen lines previously discussed , nodoubt was felt as to its identity with the well-marked unknown double in " Orionis ( see strip 14 ) .
Pickering , although he only records the stellar line as single , gives its wave-length as 4649-2 , which is very near the wave-length of the oxygen line ( 4649-27 ) , which falls about midway between the components of the strange double in Kensington laboratory spectra , giving the appearance of an equal-spaced triplet ( see strips 16 and 17 ) .
To establish the identity more thoroughly , the wave-lengths of the lines were determined both from the laboratory and stellar photographs .
The-resulting values are as compared below:\#151 ; Taking into consideration the comparatively small dispersion of the stellar spectrum , their wave-lengths are in as good accord as could be expected .
Eeference to strips 14 and 16 will show that , although the stellar spectrum is enlarged 12 times , the double given by the alcohol vacuum tube and the stellar double are identical in position .
The two oxygen lines 4591 and 4596 are also seen to be in agreement with two weak stellar lines .
Although the identity of the stellar and laboratory doubles had been practically established both by measurement and direct comparison , there was no certainty as to their exact origin .
As the alcohol spectrum in which the lines were first noted showed lines of oxygen , carbon , hydrogen , and nitrogen ( the latter as impurity lines ) , it seemed reasonable to assume that the lines in question belonged to one of these elements .
With the object of tracing the lines to a definite origin , the spectra of various vacuum tubes were then investigated both visually and photographically , the same spark conditions being used as in the case of the alcohol tube which gave the lines .
The coil used was one which gives an 8-inch spark , and a large jar and large air-break were introduced .
The vacuum tubes investigated were those respectively containing , nitrogen , amidogene , oxygen , sulphur-dioxide , coal gas , and carbon bisulphide .
The only three of these to reveal the lines were SO2 , CH4 , and CS2 .
The fact that neither the oxygen nor nitrogen tubes gave the lines seems to preclude the possibility of their being due to either of these elements .

[ May 15 , SOa and CS2 spectra , in which the double occurs , show no hydrogen lines , so hydrogen could be discarded as furnishing no clue .
Sulphur clearly could not be the origin , as there is no trace of the lines of that element in either the alcohol or coal-gas spectra which give the strange double .
This process of elimination left only carbon to be considered .
That element could account for the presence of the lines in the alcohol , CS2 , and CH4 spectra , but not in that of S02 if the sulphur dioxide was pure and free from carbon .
To test the latter point the strong characteristic line of carbon at 4267*3 was looked for in the S02 spectrum , and it was at once seen that it not only occurred there , but was one of the strongest lines in the whole spectrum .
The fact was thus established that in every case where the strange double appeared , the spectrum also contained the strong carbon line 4267*3 , and the collective evidence pointed to carbon or some modification of carbon as being the true source of the lines .
It was then determined to investigate the spectra given by the spark between carbon poles in various gases at atmospheric pressure , using exactly similar electrical conditions\#151 ; with regard to coil , jar capacity , and size of air break\#151 ; as for the vacuum tube experiments .
The first gas tried in this way was oxygen , and although visual observations failed to show the lines with certainty , the photographic record showed that the more refrangible component was present but weak ; the less refrangible component , falling on the fairly strong line of oxygen at 4650*8 , cannot be separately distinguished .
The spectrum of the carbon spark in nitrogen and ammonia was then tried , but as the visual observations gave no indication of the lines under .discussion , no photographs were taken .
The spark in hydrogen was then examined , and it was at once evident that this condition gave the double quite strong and isolated .
A photograph of the spectrum was obtained , and the region 4550 4670 of this is reproduced in strip 15 , where it will be seen that the double stands alone , there being no oxygen lines mixed up with it , as in the alcohol and SO2 spectra of strips 16 and 17 .
The original photograph of the carbon spark spectrum in hydrogen shows , in addition to the double 464/ 6 , 46508 , the strong carbon line 4267*3 , the hydrogen lines , and a faint trace of the strongest nitrogen line 4630*7 . .
The last named is shown in the Plate ; the others are outside the region of spectrum reproduced .
As further evidence of the identity of the stellar and laboratory lines , it may be pointed out that the nature of the double , as seen isolated in strip 15 ( carbon spark in hydrogen ) , is the same as in the stellar spectrum 1909 .
] Origin of certain Lines in Spectrum of e Orionis .
( in the latter case this point is not so well shown in the reproduction as in the original negative ) , the more refrangible line 4647*6 being sharp on each |dge , while the other component , 46 50'8 , is sharp on its more refrangible-edge , but diffuse towards the red .
The fact that the double occurs strongly in the spectrum of carbon poles in-hydrogen , only weakly in that of the same poles in oxygen , and apparently not at all when nitrogen is the gas used , would tend to show that , if really due to carbon , the presence of hydrogen , although not absolutely necessary , is conducive to the production of the lines .
It must be borne in mind , however , that the SO2 vacuum tube gave the lines quite strongly without any trace of hydrogen being present .
It may be that , although in the presence of oxygen only along with the carbon the lines are not well developed , the presence of sulphur as an additional element has the same effect on the-development of the lines as that of hydrogen .
The bulk of the evidence is certainly in favour of the strange double being due to carbon or some modification of that element , the lines only coming out strongly under particular conditions of current .
Even at this stage of the inquiry , however , the evidence is not absolutely conclusive , and a carbon origin must be accepted as only provisional .
Further research will probably settle the origin more definitely .
It may be said here that , so far as we are aware , this important double-line has not previously been recorded in laboratory spectra , either of carbon or any other element .
The reason for this is probably that , in contradistinction to the carbon line 4267*3 , which occurs under a comparatively great range of spark conditions , the new double is of a more fleeting nature , and has probably hitherto eluded the attention of spectroscopists .
Reference to Bright-line-star Spectra .
In a paper on " The Wolf-Kayet Stars , " * Prof. Campbell gives a comparison of the lines in " Bright-line Stars ' with those of other types , amongst the latter being Orion stars ( dark lines ) .
In this he suggests that the strong line 4652 in stars of the Wolf-Kayet type is identical with the line 4652 of the Orion stars .
The line he refers to in the latter case is undoubtedly the strong conspicuous line of e Orionis , which has been found to be a double line in the Kensington spectra ( 4647*5\#151 ; 4650*9 ) , and which has been shown to be , in all probability , due to carbon , the laboratory lines occurring prominently only under particular conditions of current .
The position of the middle of this double is , from recent Kensington measures of the best e Orionis spectrum , 4649*2 , this being also the wave-* ' Ast .

[ May 15 , length of the single line recorded by Pickering .
If this be really identical with the Wolf-Rayet line , it would appear that Campbell 's wave-length for the latter is somewhat high , but the difference is possibly within the limits of error in determining the wave-lengths of such broad , crude lines as those in Wolf-Rayet stars .
The line 4652 , for instance , is , in 7 Argus , of such a width as to cover about 30 tenth-metres .
Possibly the apparent agreement in position of the Wolf-Rayet line and the strong , dark double of e Orionis , is only a fortuitous one , but as these spectra contain other lines in common , such as the stronger helium lines , and proto-hydrogen lines ( 4686 , 4542 , 4200 ) , it is suggestive of a real identity .
It seems necessary to obtain , if that be possible , more accurate wavelengths of the lines in Wolf-Rayet stars before this point as to the identity of the two lines can be definitely settled .
Further research will be made with the object of possibly tracing other conspicuous Wolf-Rayet lines to abnormal lines of known gases .
[ Note added June , 1909.\#151 ; Shortly after the above paper was sent in , and before the reading , further experiments were made , giving conclusive evidence that the double line at 4647*6 , 4650*8 , could be ascribed to carbon .
Three spectra were photographed on the same plate , the spark conditions being identical in every case , ( 1 ) carbon spark in hydrogen , ( 2 ) platinum spark in \#166 ; coal-gas , ( 3 ) platinum spark in hydrogen .
While the platinum spark in hydrogen shows no trace whatever of the double , the platinum in coal-gas gives it , quite conspicuous and identical in position and nature with the double produced with carbon in hydrogen .
