The Observatory of Infant D. Luiz has possessed since 1863 a set of magnetographs giving continuous records similar to those at Kew .
In 1870 the results of the declination magnetograph , from the year 1864 to 1867 , were published ; and in 1874 the results for the same period of the bifilar and balance magnetographs ( results embracing the horizontal force , vertical force , total force , and inclination ) were published .
At present the results of the declination for 1868 to 1871 are in course of publication .
The subject of this short paper is the diurnal variations of the disturbances of the declination .
The method which has been adopted for reducing the disturbances is that of Sir Edward Sabine .
I have taken + 2 millimetres , or 2 , ,26 , as the limits , beyond which limits all readings are regarded as disturbed .
In separating for each hour the disturbances ( that is to say , the excesses and the deficiencies of individual observations over the monthly means for each hour ) , and then taking for each year on one side all the excesses and on the other side all the deficiencies , we shall have a series of numbers in millimetres which represent the law of the frequency of these disturbances .
In comparing the curves which graphically represent the law of the frequency of the disturbances ( + West ) and ( \#151 ; East ) for the 8 years ( 1864 to 1871 ) , it is at once noticed that all the phases appear later ( as regards the hour of the day ) for the latter years .
In the easterly disturbances this tendency is manifested whether we make the comparison between the curves of 1864 and 1871 ( fig. 1 ) or compare the curves for every 2 years ( fig. 2 ) , or finally the curves of the two periods of 4 years ( fig. 3 ) .
In the westerly disturbances similar results are found , but they are less marked ; the movement appears to be slower ; and it is in On the Magnetic Declination at Lisbon .

375 hese disturbances more difficult to prove it on account of the close double 'aaximums which show variations from one year to another* .
] However , it is easy to see , in either of the figs. 4 , 5 , or 6 , that the dotted curves are generally displaced to the right of the plain .
This difference in behaviour between the easterly and westerly disturbances litill tends to support the supposition of their different sources .
It is ery probable that these movements are periodical .
' The staff at the Observatory who can be engaged in measuring the photographic curves of the magnetograph , and making the calculations upon the monthly tables , is at present engaged with the curves of the uifilar and balance magnetographs for the years 1868 to 1871 .
It would be very interesting to know if similar displacements in the listurbance-curves at the stations in Asia and America have been observed , and in what direction .

" On the Development of the Crustacean Embryo , and the Variations of form exhibited in the Larvae of 38 Genera of Podophthalmia .
" By C. Spence Bate , F.R.S. Received December 28 , 1875 .
( Abstract .
) The author states that , although the general forms of several genera of Podophthalmous Crustacea are known , yet the details of their structure have been so unsatisfactorily figured and described , that the value * It is observed that the hollow between the two maximums about noon corresponds closely to another secondary maximum of the easterly disturbances .
It thus appears that , during the hours 20 a.m. to 3 p.m. , there is another force in action independent of the two principal forces .
