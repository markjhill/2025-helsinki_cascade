\lt ; ( Distribution of the Radicals of Electrolytes upon an Insulated Metallic Conductor .

Among other facts demonstrated in my communication to the Royal Society in January 1876 ( Proe .

This phenomenon , it was contended , was explicable on the view which regards an electrolyte as a dielectric , with the additional function of being capable of mutually exchanging its constituents in the act of depolarization\#151 ; a conception which induced the quantitative experiments detailed below .

] distribution of the Positive Radical on the end of an insulated strip of metal facing the Positive Electrode .
For these experiments a 5-per-cent , solution of copper sulphate was nploved , and a glass trough 30 centimetres long by 13 centimetres 'oad and 12 centimetres deep .
In each experiment a strip of silver ate about the thickness of writing-paper was placed lengthwise mid-ay between the electrodes , and allowed to remain immersed in the lectrolyzing fluid for one hour , the battery-power being 5 cells of Grove , a experiments 1 and la the strips were similar , being 1 decimetre long md 1 centimetre wide .
In experiment 2 the strips were of the same vidth , but 4 millims. longer , 2 millims. at each end being covered with rarnish , with the object of eliminating the action of the end surfaces .
Successive lengths of 2 millims. exactly were cut off after the action , and :he copper thereon was determined by the cyanide of potassium and ammonia method .
One centimetre of the cyanide solution was equivalent ; o -00309 gram of copper .
The results were as under:\#151 ; Lengths of 2 millims. commencing at the end facing the + electrode .

00 00 Mr. A. Tribe on Distribution of [ May { It is apparent from the numbers that there is a considerable accumi lation of the positive radical ( and hence it may be concluded of negatb electricity ) at the extremity of the strip in proximity to the positive ele trod , and that this gradually diminishes until , at a distance of 22 millim from the end , it becomes too small for estimation .
The relatively sma number in the first line of experiment 2 shows the influence of the en surface .
The subjoined Table exhibits the results , showing the distribution upon a diamond-shaped strip ( 1 decimetre in its longer and 1 centimetre in it shorter diagonal ) placed lengthwise under similar conditions:\#151 ; Lengths of 2 millims. counting from positive electrode .

10 0-5 ia 1 0*4 00 It is worthy of notice that the positive radical is detectable at a somewhat greater distance from the point of the rhombus than from the end of the rectangular strips .
The area of the first 2 millims. of the rhombus equals 0*4 square millim. Calculating the copper on the first 2 millims. of the rectangular strip for an equal area , the accumulation on these areas is shown to be greater on the rhombus in the ratio of 20 to 1 .
This illustrates to a considerable extent the power of the more pointed conductor in storing up the radical .
Distribution of the Negative Radical on the end of the conductor facing the Negative Electrode .
Ton this a cylinder of pure copper , 1 decimetre long and 1 centimetre in diameter , was placed lengthwise in the trough containing a 5-per-cent , solution of copper sulphate , its position being similar to that of the silver strip in the previous experiments .
The end of the cylinder , which was so placed as to be eaten away in the experiment , was made up of sections M7J the Radicals of Electrolytes .
f 3 millims. each screwed together .
The first cylinder had six and the ; her two twelve divisions each .
The amount of action was found by eighing the sections before and after subjecting the cylinder to the ition of the electrolyzing fluid .
In experiment 4 , three cells of Grove were used , the time being two ours ; in experiment 5 , five cells for one hour ; and in 6 , ten cells for ie hour .

.0062 .0168 In experiment 4 , signs of corrosion were noticeable to 48 millims. from he end of the cylinder , while the deposit of copper reached 46 millims. rom the other end .
In experiment 6 , corrosion was noticeable also to 18 millims. from the one end , and deposition to 46 millims. from the i\#187 ; j \gt ; there end .
From this it would appear that the electro-negative radical fc preads over a greater surface than does the positive radical , or that the leutral line is not in the middle of the cylinder , but somewhat removed W'/ Owards the negative end , that is , where the deposition of the positive SB *adical takes place .
I hope to return to this .
A The numbers in the columns 1 , 1 and 2 may be taken as showing approximately the distribution of the positive radical or negative elec-ricity on the respective silver strips , and the numbers in 5 and 6 that )f the negative radical or positive electricity on the copper cylinders , which facts , graphically represented , give figures as in the diagram .
