" On the Recurrent Images following Visual Impressions .
" By Shelford Bidwell , M.A. , LL. B. , F.R.S. Received March 27 , 1894 .
The earliest recorded observation which I have been able to find of a certain curious phenomenon associated with optical after-images is that of Professor C. A. Young , who published a note on the subject in the year 1872 , and proposed that the phenomena should be called " recurrent vision."* He noticed that when a powerful Leyden jar discharge took place in a darkened room , any conspicuous object was seen twice at least , with an interval of a little less than a quarter of a second ; often it was seen a third time and sometimes even a fourth .
He thought that the phenomenon suggested the idea of a reflection of the nervous impulse at the nerve extremities , as if the intense impression upon the retina , after being the first time propagated to the brain , was reflected back to the retina and thence again to the brain , thus renewing the sensation of vision .
A few months later an account of two experiments on the same subject was published by Mr. A. S. Davis.t In the first , a piece of charcoal , one end of which was red-hot , was waved about so as to describe an ellipse or circle a few inches in diameter .
A blue image of the burning end was seen following the charcoal at a short distance behind it , the space between the charcoal and its image being absolutely dark .
The interval of time after which the sensation of blue light succeeded the primary sensation was estimated to be about a fifth of a second .
The other experiment was made w'ith a piece of apparatus resembling a photographic instantaneous shutter .
The shutter was interposed between the observer 's eye and the sky and was covered with pieces of coloured glass , through which momentary flashes of light were allowTed to pass .
It was found that each flash was , after a short interval , generally succeeded by a recurrent image , the colour of which was quite different from that of the glass .
The results of Mr. Davis 's observations are summarised below .
Mr. Davis remarks that except as regards the red glass , the recurrent colour does not differ much from the complementary colour , * ' Phil. Mag ; vol. 43 ( 1872 ) , p. 343 .

* Blue-green Red-blue No image j ) and he concludes that when any one of the three kinds of Young-Helmholtz nerve fibres is excited , an excitation is induced in the nerve fibres of the other kinds , the process being analogous to the induction of electric currents .
In 1885 I called attention to a very simple and effective method of exhibiting a recurrent image.* If an ordinary vacuum tube , illuminated by an induction coil discharge , is made to rotate slowly upon a horizontal axis fixed at right angles to the middle of the tube , the tube is seen to be followed at a distance of a few degrees by a ghost-like image of itself , the ghost exactly imitating the original in form , but having a uniform steel-grey colour .
In the same paper the following observation is noted :\#151 ; " The vacuum tube being at rest in a feebly lighted room , I concentrated my gaze upon a certain small portion of it while the discharge was passing .
The current was then interrupted and the luminous image was almost instantly replaced by a corresponding image which appeared to be intensely black upon a less dark back-ground .
After a period which I estimated at from a quarter to half a second the black image again became luminous ; this luminous impression lasted but for a small fraction of a second and the series of phenomena terminated with its disappearance ... ... ... ... It was also found desirable to make the preliminary illumination as short as possible , a single flash being generally sufficient to produce the phenomena .
" The following comment was added:\#151 ; " The series of phenomena seem to be due to an affection of the optic nerve which is of an oscillatory character .
Abnormal darkness follows as a reaction after the luminosity , and again after abnormal darkness there is a rebound into feebler luminosity .
" The subject has recently attracted much attention in connection with the experiments of M. Aug. Charpentier .
The account of them given by M. Charpentier in a paper on " Retinal Oscillations " f is briefly as follows :\#151 ; If a black disk having a white sector is illuminated by a strong light , and slowly turned round while the * ' Nature , ' vol. 32 ( 1885 ) , p. 30 .

134 Mr. S. Bidwell .
On Recurrent [ June 7 , observer 's eye is fixed upon its centre , there appears upon the white sector , near to its leading edge , a well-defined dark band , which is separated from the black ground of the disk by a similar white band .
The angular extension of the dark band increases with the speed of rotation , so that it always takes the same time to pass over a fixed point on the retina ; it begins about one-sixty-fifth or one-seventieth of a second after the first passage of the white , and lasts sensibly the same time .
He goes on :\#151 ; " The dark band is in fact only a kind of reaction of the retina after the luminous excitation , a reaction which can be demonstrated in a totally different manner .
I have found that if an instantaneous luminous excitation is produced in complete darkness the sensation appears to be reduplicated ; shortly after its first generation it seems to disappear and then manifest itself again .
This is the case , for example , when a single discharge from a Ruhmkorff coil is passed through a Crookes or Geissler vacuum tube , or simply , but less obviously , through the air ... ... .
There is , then , in this last experiment , as in the first , a negative reaction of the retina under the influence of excitation ... ... .
It would be difficult , and in any case premature , to indicate the cause of this phenomenon , but it may fairly be characterised as the result of a retinal oscillation set up under the influence of the beginning of the luminous excitation .
" I think it clearly appears from the above extract that M. Charpentier was unacquainted with the earlier observations of myself and others .
In consequence of the importance which seemed to be attached by physiologists to the phenomena of visual reaction , as evidenced by Professor Burdon Sanderson 's recent Presidential Address to the British Association , * I was induced to undertake the further experimental investigation , of which an account is given in the present paper .
This deals partly with the colours of recurrent images under different conditions , and partly with the reaction attending the early stages of a luminous impression as noticed by Charpentier .
In the observation of the recurrent images set up by the action of light of different colours I began , like Mr. Davis , by using coloured glasses .
A metal disk , about 8 cm .
in diameter , was arranged so as to rotate slowly and steadily about its centre in front of the condenser of a projection lantern .
Hear the edge of the disk was a circular aperture about 05 cm .
in diameter , the image of which was focussed upon a distant screen .
A plate of coloured glass was placed before the projecting lens , and thus was obtained a small , coloured disk of light , which described a circular path upon the screen .
The coloured disk was , in most cases , seen to be followed at an interval of a few degrees by a ghost of the same size and shape , but of feebler luminosity , and of a hue which varied more or less with the colour of the glass * ' Brit. Assoc. Rep. , ' 1893 .

employed .
With white electric light the colour of the ghost was violet .
This method of experimenting was , however , found to he unsuited for the purpose in view , and I mention it only on account of the facility which it affords for exhibiting the phenomenon to a large number of persons .
To obtain results of any value , it was necessary to employ the simple colours of the spectrum , and the arrangement finally adopted for this purpose is indicated in fig. 1 .

To the back of the mirror is attached a horizontal arm , which is not quite perpendicular to the mirror , its inclination being capable of adjustment .
The arm is rotated by clock-work , and turns once in 1| secs .
It was at first attempted to study the phenomenon by direct eye observations of the reflected image of the aperture in the rotating mirror , the aperture being covered by a piece of finely-ground glass ; but , for pretty obvious reasons , no satisfactory results could be thus obtained .
A telescope was then employed , having a power of 12 , and an eyeMr .

Recurrent [ June 7 , piece with a large field .
I believe that , after sufficient practice , this would be found the best possible method of observation ; but it is exceedingly difficult to keep the eye absolutely steady , and untrained observers never succeeded in seeing the looked-for phenomena at all .
Since it seemed desirable that my own observations should he confirmed by others , I abandoned the telescope and the ground glass , and by means of the lens 17 focussed the reflected image of the aperture upon a white screen , R. The diameter of the projected disk of coloured light was about 15 cm .
, and that of the approximately circular path which it described , 80 cm .
To aid in steadying the eye , a spot of luminous paint , upon which the gaze might be directed , was applied at the centre of the circle .
With this arrangement , almost any one can see the ghosts without the smallest difficulty .
^Vhen the mirror turns once in 1^ secs .
, the ghost or recurrent image appears about 50 behind the coloured disk , the corresponding time interval being one-fifth of a second .
Exact measurement isT however , not easy , and it is probable that the interval is not quite the same with light derived from different portions of the spectrum .
1 The ghost appears to be circular in form , its diameter being generally rather less than that of the original .
The colours of the recurrent images , as specified below , have all been observed by several persons , and , except as to those at the extreme limits of visibility , all the observations were in agreement .

For the screen with the aperture at D , tig .
I , another was substituted , having a horizontal slit 7 cm .
long and 2 mm. wide , the image of which was projected upon the screen R after reflection from the rotating mirror .
Thus a small spectrum was produced , which revolved parallel to itself , in a circle about 1 metre in diameter.* The eyes were directed upon a fixed spot near one end of the horizontal diameter of the circle .
The spectrum was followed by a ghost of the form rather roughly indicated in fig. 2 .
It extended from the orange of the spectrum to the beginning of the violet , terminating somewhat abruptly at the orange end , and fading away gradually at the other .
The image was distorted , as shown in the figure , approaching nearest to the spectrum at about the middle of the green , a little on the more refrangible side of the most luminous portion .
The distance separating the spectrum from the image increased more rapidly towards the red end of the spectrum than towards the violet end , and the image was widened out considerably at the violet end ; but neither the moving spectrum itself nor its recurrent image was so sharply defined as appears in the diagram .
It was remarkable that the whole of the recurrent image of the spectrum was of a violet hue , being brightest where the distance xrom the spectrum was least .
No trace whatever of yellow or greenish-yellow could be detected at the more refrangible end , nor of blue or bluish-green at the other .
The apparent absence of any colour except violet in the recurrent image of the complete spectrum is capable of two possible explanations .
The greenish-yellow seen at one end , and the blue and bluish-green seen at the other , when the spectrum colours are tested separately , may be due merely to an effect of contrast , the true colour of the image being in both cases a weak violet .
Or , on the other hand , these colours may really be present at the ends of the image of the whole spectrum , being , however , of too weak an intensity to be distinguishable when in proximity to the more luminous portions of the spectrum itself and of its image .
Two experiments were made in the hope of settling this question .
Experiment 3 .
The slit at D was removed , and in its place was put a zinc plate having two small apertures close together .
A second lantern and prism were set up , and two spectra were projected upon the zinc plate .
By the help of screens , things were so arranged that a violet * Helmholtz observed the after-images of a spectrum seen for an instant , but failed to notice the dark interval which preceded their appearance ( ' Phys. Opt .

These were reflected from the mirror ( which was not rotated ) , and formed two violet disks side by side upon the screen .

these disks was made as bright as possible , and the other very feebl6 .
By the side of the bright violet disk the feeble one often seemed to be of a greenish-yellow hue , though , when seen alone , it was distinctly violet .
Experiment 4 .
In a similar manner a feeble violet and brighter greenish-yellow were placed side by side , but , however much the intensity of the former was diminished , it could never be made to assume a blue colour at all comparable to that possessed by the recurrent image of the greenish-yellow .
Ror did it appear bluish-green beside orange-yellow or orange-red .
While , 'therefore , the result of Experiment 3 is consistent with the contrast hypothesis , that of Experiment 4 appears to be opposed to it ; but there is so great a difference in the circumstances of the two kinds of observation , the one involving a deliberate comparison of the colours of two stationary luminous disks , and the other an estimate formed while a disk and its recurrent image were in I'apid motion , that the opposing evidence cannot be regarded as conclusive .
Another experiment was therefore devised .
Experiment 5 .
The original screen with one small aperture was placed at D , and two spectra were projected upon it in such a manner that a green ray from one spectrum , and a red ray from the other , passed through the aperture , forming red and green images which were exactly superposed upon the screen ft. The colour of the single image thus formed could , by suitable regulation of the limelights , be made greenish-yellow , yellow , or orange-yellow , these colours being , of coui'se , not simple ones , but compounds of red and green .
Row , red by itself gives no recurrent image Avhatever ( this was verified before proceeding further by shutting off the green ray ) , while green by itself gives a violet recurrent image .
The question to be decided was whether the green , when accompanied by the inert red , would give a violet recurrent image as if it were alone , or whether the compound colour formed by the combination\#151 ; greenish-yellowy for example\#151 ; w'ould be attended by a blue or bluish-green recurrent image , just as if the compound were a simple spectrum colour .
The latter was found to be the case .
The same hue of greenish-yellow , whether a simple spectrum colour or a compound of red and green , was always attended by a blue ghost .
When the red ray of the compound was shut off by a screen , the ghost instantly became violet : when the screen was removed it at once resumed its blue colour .
140 Mr. S. Bidweli .
Recurrent [ June 7 This experiment , though not conclusive , is clearly in favour of the probability that the blue and bluish-green recurrent colours apparently f observed when the yellow and orange portions of the spectrum are tested separately are due merely to an effect of mental judgment , and not to any cause of a physiological nature .
I here are , therefore , four independent facts which are consistent !
with the conclusion that luminous recurrent images are due to a reaction of the violet nerve fibres only .
( a. ) With white light the recurrent colour is violet .
( \amp ; .
) In the recurrent image of the complete spectrum no colour but violet can be detected .
( c. ) A pure red light , however intense , gives no recurrent image .
It is generally supposed by the supporters of the Young-Helmholtz theory that red light has no action upon the violet nerve-fibres .
( d. ) The apparently blue colour of the ghost of simple spectrum yellow is just as well produced by a compound yellow consisting of green and red , the latter of which is inert when tested separately .
The path of the revolving spot of light is generally marked by a phosphorescent track , which , when the rate of revolution is not less than one turn in 1^ secs .
, often forms a complete circle .
The brilliancy of this luminous trail seems to vary with different observers , in some cases apparently being so intense that the recurrent image cannot be distinguished from it at all .
The trail is due to the usually feeble continuation of the after-image , of which the bright initial stage constitutes the recurrent image .
A spot of red light , although it is never followed by a ghost , is always considerably elongated during its revolution , and its colour ceases to be uniform , the rear portion assuming a light bluish-pink tinge .
However small the spot of light is made , and however high S the speed of revolution , no complete separation of the spot into red i and pink portions has ever been effected .
In the experiment next to be described the Charpentier effect and the recurrent image are made to exhibit themselves simultaneously , Experiment 6 .

141 centres , opposite open sectors might be obtained , of any aperture from 0 ' to 90 ' .
The apparatus was set up opposite a box containing a 32-candle power incandescent lamp , with a variable resistance in the circuit , the side of the box between the lamp and the disks being covered with a sheet of ground glass .
The sectors being in the first place opened as widely as possible , I fixed my eye upon the centre of the double disk , and at once saw Charpentier 's dark band upon the illuminated background .
The sectors were then gradually closed up , until the posterior edge of the dark band approximately coincided with that of the sector.* When this was accomplished it was found that the arc of the open sector was equal to about part of the whole circumference .
The dark reaction , therefore , ceased in of 1^ secs .
= ) -jV sec. after the first impact of the light upon the eye .
JFor more readily demonstrating the succeeding phenomena , it was found convenient to again open the sectors a little , so that they covered an angle of about 10 ' or 12 ' .
Resuming the observation , it was seen that the posterior edge of the open sector was bordered by a luminous fringe due to persistence .
A little beyond the termination of the fringe there appeared an intensely black radial band , estimated to cover a space of from 3 ' to 4 ' , and easily visible even upon the black ground of the metal disk , though it is shown far more conspicuously upon a translucent disk made of stout writing-paper , with a sector cut out .
Lastly , after another interval of , perhaps , 35 ' or 40 ' , came the luminous recurrent image , f which , with the yellowish light of the incandescent lamp , appeared to be of a blue colour .
By varying the angular aperture of the sector , it was ascertained that the recurrent image appeared at a fixed interval after the light was cut off , and not after its first impact .
This method of observation revealed one other point of interest , which seems hitherto to have escaped notice , though it is evident enough with a Charpentier disk , when once attention has been directed to it .
The average illumination of the bright band intervening between the dark band and the leading edge of the sector is much more intense than that of the other portion of the sector .
Moreover , it is not uniform , but increases , gradually at first , and very rapidly at last , from the leading edge up to the dark band .
In t'act when the light used is not strong , the luminous margin of the bright band is a far more conspicuous object than the dark band itself : it appears to glow almost like a white-hot wire .
Charpentier states that , under favourable conditions , he has been * This was not a very easy operation , because the luminous sector was slightly widened by persistence , especially near the circumference .
T This , of course , cannot be seen upon a translucent paper disk being overpowered by the transmitted light .

On Recurrent [ June 7 able to detect the existence of a second , and even of a third , dark band of greatly diminished intensity , though he adds that the observation is a very difficult one.* What is probably the samd effect in a different form can , however , be shown quite easily in the following manner .
Experiment 7 .
In a blackened zinc disk 15 cm .
in diameter , there were cut two opposite radial slits , about 05 mm. in width .
The disk was rotated at the rate of one turn per second in front of a sheet of ground glass , behind which was an incandescent lamp .
The glass was covered with opaque paper , in which a circular opening was made of slightly less diameter than the disk .
The disk was placed opposite this opening , and no light reached the eye except such as passed through the two slits .
When the disk was observed from a distance of about 1^ metres , the eye being fixed upon its centre , each slit appeared to give four ( or possibly five ) luminous images , arranged like the ribs of a partly opened fan .
The images were distinctly separated by dark intervals near the circumference , but overlapped one another towards the centre .
The leading image was naturally the brightest , each consecutive image being considerably weaker than its precursor .
All had the same tone of colour , namely that of the yellowish-light given by the electric , lamp .
The usual blue recurrent image could also be seen following the images of the radial slits , at an angle of about 80 ' .
It appears , then , that when the retina is exposed to the action of light for a limited time , the complete order of visual phenomena is as follows :\#151 ; .
( 1 ) Immediately upon the impact of the light there is experienced a sensation of luminosity , the intensity of which increases for about one-sixtieth of a second : more rapidly towards the end of that period th\amp ; n at first .
( 2 ) Then ensues a sudden reaction , lasting also for about one-sixtieth of a second , in virtue of which the retina becomes partially insensible to renewed or continued luminous impressions\#174 ; These two effects may be repeated in a diminished degree , as often as three or four times .
( 3 ) The stage of fluctuation is succeeded by a sensation of steady\#174 ; luminosity , the intensity of which is , however , considerably ' below the mean of that experienced during the first one-sixtieth i of a second .
* I have noticed that the intensity of the dark hand always appears to fluctuate s very rapidly , perhaps twenty or thirty times in a second .
The rate of fluctuation | is quite regular , and independent of the rate of rotation .

( 5 ) Then follows a sudden and clearly-defined sensation of what may be called abnormal darkness\#151 ; darker than common darkness\#151 ; which lasts for about one-sixtieth of a second , and is followed by another interval of ordinary darkness .
( 6 ) Finally , in about a fifth of a second after the extinction of the external light , there occurs another transient impression of luminosity , generally violet coloured , after which the uniformity of the darkness remains undisturbed .
An attempt has been made in fig. 3 to give a rough diagrammatic representation of the above-described chain of sensations .
No account has been taken of the comparatively feeble after-image , to which the phosphorescent trail before referred to is due , and which may last for two seconds or more .
In conclusion , it may not be unnecessary to add a warning that , though all the effects here described have been witnessed without much difficulty by several persons besides myself , it is hardly probable that any one , who is quite unaccustomed to observations of the kind , will be entirely successful in a first attempt at repeating the experiments .
Addendum .
May 24th .
Since the above was written , there has been brought to my notice an important paper by Dr. Carl Hess , " On the After-images following luminous Impressions of short Duration."* In his principal experiments momentary illumination was produced by means of an instantaneous shutter , giving an exposure of 1/ 100 or 1/ 200 second .

144 Recurrent Images following Visual Impressions .
[ June 7 , Observations were made of the effects following excitation by white light , by coloured light derived from different portions of the spectrum , and by the whole spectrum at once .
In all his experiments , Dr. Hess noticed the occurrence of what he speaks of as a negative after-image of very short duration ( corresponding to what I have called an interval of darkness ) which followed almost immediately upon the termination of the illumination , and preceded what is " commonly known as the positive after-image .
" He states that this negative after-image which , according to his measurements , lasted for about one-third or one-half second , was overlooked by Helmholtz , Aubert , Fich and others .
Hering , however , had reasons for suspecting its existence , and it was to test this point that the experiments in which Hering himself co-operated , were undertaken .
The negative after-images are stated not to have been represented in all cases by mere darkness .
Under favourable conditions , the " dark after-image " succeeding a momentary excitation by coloured ?
light , was tinted with a colour complementary to the original one ; i and when the stimulus was generated by the complete spectrum , all the complementary colours were seen for a short time after its disappearance .
No such complementary tints have ever revealed themselves in my own experiments , the space between the primary luminous image and its ghost always appearing as simply dark .
The colours assigned by Dr. Hess to the " positive after-images " i also differ from those observed by myself .
In most cases he describes the positive after-image as either having , a feeble colour of the same I hue as that of the light employed for the stimulus , or as being ?
colourless .
Dr. Hess considers , as I do , that , the brightest portion of the posi- j tive after-image of the spectrum corresponds with the green , and remarks that the brightness decreases gradually towards the more j refrangible end of the spectrum , and much more quickly towards the less refrangible end .
Such discrepancies as seem to exist between Dr. Hess 's results and my own may perhaps be accounted for by the very different methods ?
of observation which we employed .
A stationary stimulus would , no | doubt , be better adapted than a moving one for developing the feeble j tints of the dark negative after-images , as well as those exhibited by jj the bright positive after-images during by far the greater part of j their continuance , which , according to Dr. Hess 's estimate , is as long 1 as from four to eight seconds .
On the other hand , the method j adopted by myself discloses the important fact , of which Dr. Hess I makes no mention whatever , that the positive images are immensely 1 brighter for a very brief initial period\#151 ; not more than one-tenth of a j second\#151 ; than during their subsequent existence .
While this phase j of transient brilliancy altogether failed to attract Dr. Hess 's notice , 1 1894 .

( Abstract .
) 1 .
Conjectures as to the Age of Niagara Falls.\#151 ; Prior to the writing of the present paper , most of the conjectures as to the age of the Falls have been based simply upon the supposed uniform rate of recession .
Thus , in 1790 , Andrew Ellicott assigned 55,000 years as the age of the Falls .
In 1841 , Sir Charles Lyell allowed 35,000 years ; in 1886 , Professor R. S. Woodward , after three surveys had been made , calculated the age as 12,000 years ; and later , Mr. G. K. Gilbert , supposing the recession to progress at the maximum axial retreat alone , reduced the age of the Falls 6,000 years .
This latter was not intended as an estimate , as he fully recognised that such a time must have been greatly lengfliened by many changing conditions .
The rate adopted by the first two writers was only conjectural , as no surveys had then been made .
Three surveys had been completed before the writings of the latter two writers , and I have had the benefit of a fourth .
Woodward 's calculation was upon the mean mathematical enlargement of the Horseshoe guif at the end of the chasm , which rate was less than the geological rate of retreat .
The author 's method differs from the others in that it takes into consideration the rate of recession throughout the changing episodes of the river , which have been entirely discovered by Gilbert or himself .
His computations make the age surprisingly near to the conjecture of Lyell .
