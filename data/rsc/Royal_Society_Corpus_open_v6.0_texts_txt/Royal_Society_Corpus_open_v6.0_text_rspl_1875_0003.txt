32 Notice of Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 18 , the opposite side and the two ends of the box are far enough off that they may be regarded as practically at an infinite distance from the electrodes .
When c=l , the equation becomes r2 = r , r2 : so that the section of the cylindrical surface is a rectangular hyperbola .
A curve determined by experiment is drawn in Plate 2 .
fig. 12 , very near to the position of this hyperbola ; but as one of the electrodes was at the centre of the box , the forms of the equipotential curves will be slightly changed , because of the influence of the opposite side and ends of the box .
At the vertex the two curves coincide , and , measured along the latus rectum of the hyperbola , the distance between them is only 5 millims. Since the distance between the battery-electrodes is one half the breadth of the box , the influence of the opposite side and ends of the box will be quite sufficient to account for so small a difference .
Thus we see that with linear electrodes there is a very satisfactory agreement between theory and experiment .
The equipotential curves for Case 10 , with linear electrodes in the liquid , are theoretically the same as those for Case 5 , with points on a sheet of tinfoil for electrodes .
A comparison of the figures ( Plate 1 .
fig. 5 and Plate 2 .
fig. 12 ) which are laid down from the experimental results shows how closely they agree , and may be taken to be an independent proof of the accuracy of the theory of electrical distribution .

In pursuance of the Statutes , notice of the ensuing Anniversary Meeting was given from the Chair .
Mr. Etheridge , Mr. E. Gallon , Mr. New march , Dr. W. Pole , and Mr. W. W. Smyth , having been nominated by the President , were elected by ballot Auditors of the Treasurer 's Accounts on the part of the Society .
Mr. Robert Lewis John Ellery ( elected 1873 ) , Mr. James Geikie , Dr. Emanuel Klein , Prof. E. Ray Lankester , Mr. Robert Stirling Newall , and the Earl of Carnarvon were admitted into the Society .
The following extract from the Will of the late Sir Charles Wheatstone , E.R.S. , in a letter from Mr. Robert Sabine , one of the executors , was read :\#151 ; " I leave to the Royal Society of London for the Promotion of Natural Knowledge the Portrait of the Hon.

] On the Cruise of H.M.S. ' Challenger .
' The President expressed his regret , which would be shared by the Society , that intelligence had been received by the Admiralty of the decease , at sea , of Dr. von Willemoes-Suhm , a distinguished young Naturalist attached to the Scientific Staff of the ' Challenger ' Expedition .
The Presents received were laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
A direct-vision compound prism by Merz , the gift of Mr. Gassiot , was presented to the Society .
It is regarded by the maker as one of remarkable excellence , and is composed of a central prism , of large angle , formed of peculiarly heavy lead glass , with opposed prisms of crown glass cemented to its two faces .
It is capable of taking in a pencil of rays of 28| lines in width .
The indices of refraction , in the heavy glass , of Fraunhofer 's lines C , D , E , E are given by M. Merz as follows :\#151 ; C"=l-7389 .

Sib , \#151 ; The ' Challenger ' left Yokohama on the 16th of June , and ran an easterly course between the parallels of 35 ' and 40 ' north latitude , as far as the meridian of 155 ' east .
We then turned nearly directly southwards and reached Honolulu on the 27th of July .
The weather throughout was sufficiently favourable ; shortly after leaving Yokohama there was a good deal of swell , which interfered somewhat with our dredging-operations and caused the loss of a good deal of time ; we established , however , 24 observing stations , at each of which most of the desired observations were made .
On the 17th of June we sounded in 1875 fathoms , with a bottom of bluish-grey clay and a bottom-temperature of 1'*7 C. , 40 miles to the south-east of No-Sima Lighthouse .
The trawl was put over , and it brought up a large quantity of the bottom , which showed the clay was in a peculiar concretionary state , run together into coherent lumps , which were bored in all directions by an Annelid of the Aphrodita-cean group .
In many cases the Annelids were still in the burrows .
Among the clay there were large lumps of grey pumice .
The trawl contained several fishes ( belonging , as usual , chiefly to the family Macruridae ) VOL. XXIV .
D Prof. W. Thomson on the [ Nov. 18 , and a large number of Echinoderms , chiefly flexible sea-urchins , ophiurids , and starfishes of the genus Brisinga .
The hydroid zoophytes were represented by a very remarkable species , apparently referable to the genus Monocaulon of Sars , a Corymorpha-like solitary polyp with adelocodonic gonophores ; but instead of being of the proportions usual in its group , the stem in one of our specimens measured upwards of seven feet in height , while the polyp-head was nine inches in diameter across the proximal row of tentacles .
We afterwards got another fine example of the same species at a depth of 2900 fathoms ( Station 248 ) .
The temperature of the surface of the sea stood during the day at nearly 23 ' C. , considerably above the temperature of the air ; and a serial sounding gave the isotherm of 10 ' C. at a depth of little more than 200 fathoms .
We were therefore evidently under the thermic influence of the Japan current , which was found by observation to be running in an easterly direction at a rate of 1| knot an hour .
The thermometers registered a uniform temperature of 10,7 C. from a depth of 1000 fathoms to the bottom .
About twenty Albatrosses , of a nearly uniform brown plumage with whitish heads ( probably the young of the common North-Pacific species in their second year 's plumage ) , followed the ship .
On the following day there was a stiff breeze from the southward , with a heavy sea .
We sounded , however , successfully in 3950 fathoms , our deepest sounding in the North Pacific\#151 ; position by dead reckoning lat. 34 ' 43 ' N. , long .
144 ' 2 ' E. , with a bottom of " red clay .
" The gale continued on the 19th , and the weather prevented our attempting to trawl ; but a sounding in 3625 fathoms and serial temperatures to 1500 fathoms were obtained .
At both of the two latter stations the high surface-temperature was maintained ; and the position of the isotherm of 10 ' C. at station 239 , at a depth of nearly 300 fathoms , indicates that up to this point , at all events , there was no diminution in the influence of the " Kuro-Siwo .
" On the 21st we sounded in 2900 fathoms , with a bottom of " red clay .
" An attempt was made to trawl ; but the sea was still running high , and in hauling in the line parted .
The temperature-observations gave a singular result .
The surface-temperature had fallen to 18'*2 C. , and the belt of water above 10 ' C. was reduced in depth to considerably less than 100 fathoms , while all the isotherms , at all events to a depth of 400 fathoms , rose in proportion .
There seems to be little doubt , from a comparison of the American temperature-results with our own , that this sudden diminution of temperature is due to a cold surface-flow from the sea of Okhotsk , probably through Pico Channel or Vries Strait .
Very likely its effect may not be found to be constant ; and at this season it possibly attains its maximum from the melting of the snow over the vast region drained by the Amoor and the TJdi and Siberian rivers with a southern outflow .
June 23.\#151 ; We sounded in 2300 fathoms , with a bottom of " red clay .
" 1875 .
] Cruise of H.M.S. ' * The trawl brought up a quantity of lumps of pumice , more or less altered and more or less coated with manganese .
Animals of all the invertebrate groups were abundant , free , and attached to the stones ; but the assemblage was in no way remarkable .
At this station the effect of the cold current was already almost entirely lost , the isotherm of 10 ' C. having resumed its position at a depth of about 200 fathoms .
On the 26th of June we sounded in 2800 fathoms .
Temperature-soundings were taken to the usual depth ; and the dredging-line was then veered to about 3000 fathoms with a cwt .
lead and one towing-net at the end , two nets 250 fathoms from the end , and two more at a distance of about 1000 fathoms .
The line with the nets was slowly dragged along for a time with the drift of the ship and hauled in .
On carefully washing the nets and examining their contents several forms were met with which apparently do not occur on the surface , particularly a number of species of a group which is , so far as we know , entirely undescribed .
It seems to be intermediate between the Radiolarians and the Foraminifera , resembling the former in the condition and appearance of the sarcode and in the siliceous composition of the test , and the latter in external form .
The broken tests of these organisms are extremely abundant in the " red-clay " soundings ; a sufficient number of observations has not yet been made to enable us to say with certainty what is their bathymetrical distribution .
On the 28th we adopted a plan which we find extremely convenient at great depths , when we have reason to feel tolerably certain as to what the depth is going to be within moderately narrow limits .
The trawl was put over at daybreak , and the line veered to 3500 fathoms ; and while the trawl was going down the sounding was taken , in the present case at a depth of 2900 fathoms with a'bottom of " red clay .
" In this way the trawl reached the bottom , probably between 7 ' and 8 ' C. , and we could allow it to drift quietly for at least six hours before beginning to haul in .
From a zoological point of view this haul was remarkably successful ; there were one or two Fishes , a Scalpellum , a number of Annelids ( particularly a prominent Aphroditacean ) , Echinoderms of the genera Pourtalesia , Archaster , Brisinga , and a fine species of Comularia , several examples of Fungi a symmetrica , and some Actinice .
The general distribution of temperature remained much the same , the isotherm of 10 ' C. retaining its position near the 200-fathom line .
We trawled , on the 2nd of July , in 2050 fathoms , with a bottom of light brownish ooze with many Globigerina-shells .
The bag brought up a number of lumps of pumice , and among them a very characteristic assemblage of deep-sea animals , the most interesting an undescribed species of Hyalonema , which occurred in considerable numbers and in an excellent state of preservation .
The form of the sponge-body is almost spherical , with a comparatively small oscular opening , and the coil is much shorter than in H. Sieboldi , in the largest specimens not more than six inches in length .
One remarkable point was that in no case was Prof. W. Thomson on the [ Nov. 18 , there a commensal Palythoa connected with this sponge ; the coil was always perfectly clean .
The spicules of the network and of the sarcode closely resemble those of the Japanese species , but they all present marked specific differences in detail of form .
July 3.\#151 ; We sounded in 2530 fathoms , with a bottom of reddish-brown ooze ( " red clay " ) , and took temperature-soundings ; we afterwards veered the dredging-line to 1500 fathoms with tow-nets , and got many specimens of the usual deep-water Protozoa .
July 5.\#151 ; We sent down the trawl and afterwards sounded in 2900 fathoms , and took serial temperatures .
In the trawl , along with many other deep-sea forms , there was one fine specimen of the large solitary hydroid already referred to ( Station 237 ) .
On the 7th we sounded in 3000 fathoms , with the usual bottom of red clay ; on the 9th in 3050 fathoms , and on the 10th in 2950 fathoms .
The results of the dredgings for the last few stations had been so uniform , and the operation was rendered so critical by the heavy swell from the westward , that we did not consider it necessary to repeat it on every occasion .
On the 12th of July the trawl was lowered at a depth of 2740 fathoms .
The net contained very few animals , and was greatly tom and frayed ; but in a kind of pocket formed by an accidental folding of the net there were about a cwt .
of black mammillated concretions , which , when they were poured out on the deck , had very much the appearance of potatoes .
The external surface of the concretion was slightly rough , and a number of small animal forms , particularly a minute rhizopod in a membranous tube , nestled in the crevices .
The nature of these concretions will be discussed hereafter .
On the 14th of July we reached the point lat. 38 ' 9 ' N. , long .
156 ' 25 ' " W. , whence we turned southwards towards the Sandwich Islands .
For the last few stations the temperature of the water had been gradually sinking , and the influence of the Japan current dying out ; the isotherm of 10 ' C. was now only 100 fathoms below the surface .
The depth at this point was 3115 fathoms ; we put over the small dredge , as the nature of the bottom had latterly been so destructive to the trawl , and brought up manganese nodules , with a few small sponges and Bryozoa .
On the 17th of July we sounded in 3025 fathoms , the bottom still " red clay , " and on the 19th in 2850 fathoms .
A serial sounding taken at the latter station to 1500 fathoms showed a considerable rise in the temperatures near the surface , the isotherm of 10 ' C. having again sunk to a depth of 200 fathoms , and that of 15 ' C. corresponding with the 100-fathom line .
On the 21st the bottom was " red clay " at a depth of 2950 fathoms ; the small dredge was lowered and brought up a large quantity of the ooze , very smooth and tenacious , but containing scarcely a trace of living things .
The serial temperature-soundings indicated a still further rise in the temperature of the upper layers , due doubtless to progress southwards . .
1875 .
] Cruise of H.M.S. ' Challenger ?
On the 23rd we sounded in 2875 fathoms , and on the 24th in 2775 , the bottom in both cases having much the same character which it had maintained throughout the cruise .
The Albatrosses , which had followed the ship , to the number of from fourteen to twenty daily , since we left Japan , left us to-day .
" We saw one or two Boatswain Birds ( rubricauda ) , and a Turnstone ( Strepsilasinterpres ) flew about the ship for some hours , lighting on the combings and the rigging .
On the 26th we sounded in 2225 fathoms ; and on the morning of the 27th we passed into the strait between the islands of Molokai and Oahu , and trawled on hard ground in 310 fathoms , with but little success .
In the evening we anchored in the harbour of Honolulu .
This cruise naturally divides itself into two parts:\#151 ; a section about 3170 nautical miles in length , including the stations from No. 237 to No. 253 , very slightly to the northward of east , between the parallels of 35 ' and 38 ' N. lat. ; and a meridional section of 1128 nautical miles , along the meridian of 155 ' W. long .
The first of these sections corresponds very closely in relative position with the section in the Atlantic between Sandy Hook and the Azores , and the points of resemblance and difference between them , when fully worked out , must prove most instructive .
The two sections cross the two great deflections to the northward of the equatorial current , in the Atlantic the Gulf-stream , and in the Pacific the " Kuro-Siwo ; " and the thermic influence of the two currents is fairly contrasted .
The influence of the Gulf-stream , if not absolutely greater ( and this is a point which it will be somewhat difficult to determine ) , is at all events much more concentrated and effective , owing to the continuity of the coast-line of the American continent , to the way in which the water of the equatorial current is driven into the Gulf of Mexico and superheated there , afterwards to be kept together and ejected in a defined stream through the Strait of Florida , and to the absence of periodical winds in the Atlantic .
In the Pacific , on the other hand , the main flow of the equatorial current is weakened among the passages of the Malayan archipelago ; and although a large part of it is directed northwards by the broken barrier formed by the Fiji Islands , the New Hebrides , and Papua , it almost at once enters the region of the monsoons , where it is thwarted for half the year ; and it can only be regarded as comparable with that portion of the reflux of the Atlantic equatorial current which passes outside the " W"\lt ; est-Indian Islands .
Nevertheless it passes the south coast of Japan as a very palpable and apparently a permanent current , exercising a very perceptible thermic influence to a depth of at least 300 fathoms .
In traversing the Pacific the influence of the Japan current appears to be gradually lost ; while I am still inclined to believe that in the Atlantic the Gulf-stream is banked down against and reflected from the western coast of Europe .
It is a question of great complexity ; but it seems to me that it is consistent with our experience that the temperature of the Prof. W. Thomson on the rXT [ Nov.^l water of the ocean at any one place is due , in a great measure to th rature of the source of that water\#151 ; not entirely due , for in r\gt ; a ' ' I a long distance the temperature of even the greatest mass^^^0^ !
certainly gradually altered by conduction and mixture .
Wateri8j The suggestions of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Buchanan that the 1 of a deep layer of warm water in the Atlantic might be conn I some way with the mean annual temperature of the area and the h ^ I of ocean-currents , are very suggestive ; and I looked forward vdth I interest to an opportunity of testing them in the corresponding t* , nj* !
in the Pacific .
But there seems to be no trace of any thing of the kU as the influence of the equatorial reflux becomes weaker the temperat* ' fall uniformly .
^ To show that the conditions in the two oceans differ more in fpjl than in kind , I give in Plates 3 and 4 curves constructed from serial soundings along nearly corresponding lines in the Atlantic and Pacific Curves A and B are added on Plate 3 to show the position of the deeper belt of abnormally warm water which makes its appearance near L coast of Europe , Plate 3 .

] Cruise of H.M.S. the Atlantic , an indraught from the Southern Sea .
The more the question is investigated the less evidence there seems to me to be of any general ocean circulation depending upon differences of specific gravity .
It seems certain that , both in the Atlantic and in the Pacific , the bottom-water is constantly moving northwards ; and I am now very much inclined to refer this movement to an excess of precipitation over the water-hemisphere , a portion of the vapour formed in the northern hemisphere being carried southwards and precipitated in the vast southern area of low barometric pressure .
I hope to enter fully into the discussion of this matter on a future occasion .
The temperature of the water is greatly lower in the Pacific for the first thousand fathoms than in the Atlantic in the corresponding latitude of 35 ' N. There is one very remarkable difference between the two basins : while in the Atlantic it seems certain that the temperature sinks gradually , though very slightly , for the last thousand fathoms to the bottom , it appears that in the Pacific the minimum temperature of l'-7 C. is reached at a depth not greater than 1400 fathoms , and that from that depth to the bottom the temperature is the same .
The soundings from Yokohama to Honolulu are remarkably uniform in depth , the twenty-two soundings on one line , which are unaffected by the neighbourhood of land , giving an average of 2858 fathoms .
The nature of the bottom is also very uniform ; and , according to the nomenclature which we have adopted , it is , in each case , noted on the chart as " red clay .
" It is usually , however , somewhat greyer in colour than the typical " red clay , " and contains a large proportion of the tests of siliceous organisms ( a proportion which increases with increasing depth ) , and a considerable quantity of pumice in different states of comminution and decomposition .
The clay contains scarcely a trace of carbonate of lime , although the surface swarms with ooze-forming foraminifera .
In some cases the trawl came up half full of large lumps of pumice , which seemed to have been drifted about till they were water-logged , and to be softening and becoming decomposed ; these pieces of decomposing pumice were often coated and pervaded throughout with oxide of manganese .
Over the whole area the red clay was full of concretions , consisting mainly of peroxide of manganese , round , oval , or mammillated and very irregular , varying in size from a grain of mustard-seed to a large potato .
When these concretions are broken up , they are found to consist of concentric layers having a radiating fibrous arrangement , and usually starting from a nucleus consisting of some foreign body , such as a piece of pumice , a shark 's tooth , or a fragment of any organism\#151 ; as , for instance , in one case a piece of a Hexactinnelid sponge of the genus Ajohrocattistes , which was preserved as a very beautiful fossil in the centre .
The concretions appear to form loose among the soft clay ; the singular point is the amount of this manganese formation , and the vast area which it covers .
We were particularly successful , during this cruise , in getting good samples of the fauna from great depths ; and we found that the fauna of 40 Mr. J. Priestley on the [ Nov. 18 , the North Pacific , at depths of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms , although not very abundant in species , is by no means meagre .
In each of six dredgings and trawlings at depths greater than 2000 fathoms we found , along with a few Pishes , a fair representation of all the larger invertebrate groups ; and in one dredging , No. 253 , at a depth of 3125 fathoms , we took a small Sponge , a species of Cornu an , an Annelid in a tube , and a Bryozoon .
We were again struck with the wonderful uniformity of the fauna at these depths ; if not exactly the same species , very similar representatives of the same genera occur in all parts of the world .
I am glad to be able to report that every thing is going on in a satisfactory way in the departments under my charge .

" On the Physiological Action of Vanadium .
" By John Priestley , Platt Physiological Scholar , the Owens College , Manchester .
Communicated by Prof. Gamgee , F.B.S. Received June 18 , 1875 .
( Abstract .
) The author has divided his paper into four sections .
In the first the subject is introduced by a brief statement of the relationships of vanadium to other elements of the same and of allied groups ; and the main object of the research is set forth , viz. by an extended investigation to endeavour to fix the physiological relationships of vanadium to the closely allied elements arsenic and phosphorus , so as to throw some light on the relations which probably exist between the chemical and physiological properties of the elements .
The tribasic sodium vanadate ( Na3V04 ) is stated to have been the compound of vanadium made use of throughout the research , and the reasons of the preference are given .
In the second section the action of solutions of sodium vanadate upon simple organisms is shortly illustrated by the details of four sets of experiments , from which the conclusion is drawn that all solutions , except those which are extremely dilute ( i. e. which contain only so much salt as corresponds to .01-*5 per cent , of V2 05 ) , act injuriously upon the simpler organisms .
In the third section the effects of vanadium in the above combination on complex organisms are discussed under two heads , viz.:\#151 ; A. The general action on the animal system when introduced by Proc. Rov .
