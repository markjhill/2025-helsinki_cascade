Part of a Letter from Dr. Richardson , F. R. S. to Sir Hans Sloane , Bart. President of the Royal Society , and Colleg .
Physic .
concerning the Squilla aquae dulcis .
I Have met with very little of late in Natural History worth mentioning to you .
One Thing I cannot omit , which I do not remember is taken notice of by any Naturalist ; that is , the great Destruction that is made amongst the small Fry of Fish by the Squilla aquae dulcis , which abound in most standing Waters .
In a small breeding Pond nigh my House , where I had formerly plenty of small Carp and Tench every Year , and of late scarce any young Breed to be met with , my Gardener not long ago observed one of the Squillae , with a Carp in its Mouth almost as large as itself ; and has since observed these Insects hunting amongst the Weeds , and vigorously pursuing the small Fry .
I ordered the Gardener to catch some of these Insects , and bring them home alive , with some of the smallest Fish he could meet with .
We put them together in a large Bason of Water .
The Insects were so rapacious , that they fell upon the Fish immediately , and destroyed several in my Sight ; and before Morning had devoured all that were in the Bason .
