A paper was read , entitled , " Researches on Suppuration ; " by George Gulliver , Esq. , Assistant Surgeon to the Royal Regimentof Horse Guards .
Communicated by John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. , As ?
sistant Inspector of Army Hospitals .
The author , in consequence of some theoretical views of the suppurative process , was led to undertake an examination of the blood in the different forms of fever accompanying infiammation and sup ?
puration ; and the result has been the detection of globules of pus in that fluid in almost every instance where there had existed , during life , either suppuration , or great tumefaction of the external parts without the presence of pus .
The means by which he detect ?
ed pus in the blood were partly chemical , and partly by the aid of the microscope .
Availing himself of the solvent power which water exerts on the globules of the blood , while it has no action on those of pus , he had merely to dilute the suspected blood sufficiently with water , by which means the red globules were made to disappear , while those of pus remained at the bottom of the fluid , and were easily recognised by a good microscope .
A number of cases are detailed , from which the general result , above stated , was deduced .
He considers that his experiments tend to establish the conclusion that suppuration is a kind of proximate analysis of the blood .
As the fibrin separated from this fluid produces swelling of the part affected , or is attracted to the contiguous tissue for the reparation of the injury , the globules of the blood , altered by stagnation , become useless , and are discharged as excrementitious matter from the sy ?
stem .
Such is the constitution of healthy pus : but when mixed with broken down fibrin , it assumes the flaky and curdled appearance , with proneness to putrefaction , characterising unhealthy pus , and the presence of which in the blood is connected with fevers of the inflammatory or typhoid form .
