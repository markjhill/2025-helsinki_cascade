XVII .
A Catalogue of the Immersions and Emersions of the Satellites of Jupiter , for the Year 1751 .
of which there are 172 of the First , 87 of the Second , 62 of the Third , and none of the Fourth , by reason of its great Latitude ; in all 321 .
Computed to the Meridian of London from the Flamsteedian Tables : Corrected by James Hodgfon , F. R. S. Master of the Royal Mathematical School in Christ's-Hospital .
Now , inasmuch as , in the Beginning of this Year , the Latitude of the fourth Satellite is greater than the Breadth of the Shadow of Jupiter , the Satellite will pass wide of it , and there will be no Eclipse of it till the Middle of June in the Year 1752 .
It is to be observed , that , for about a Month before , and a Month ~ the Conjunction of Jupiter wi h the Sun , by reason of the Proximity of Jupiter to the Sun , the Eclipses cannot be observed .
And this is the Reason that no Notice has been taken of them in the Catalogue between the 25th of March and the 24th of May following .
The Times here set down are according to the astronomical Way of reckoning , which supposes the Day to commence at the Noon of each Day , or when the Sun is upon the Meridian ; and counting the Time on in a successive Order , without the Distinction of Morning and Afternoon , til the Sun returns to the Meridian again the next Day at Noon .
Thus , for Example , in the preceding Catalogue , the first Emersion of the second Satellite is said to happen on January 1 .
at 20 Hours 6 Minutes ; that is , according to the Civil Way of reckoning , on Jan. 2 .
at 6 Minutes after 8 in the Morning .
