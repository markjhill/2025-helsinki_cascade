PROPOSITION I. In every acute angled plane triangle , the sum of the three tangents of the three angles multiplied by the square of the radius , is equal to the continued product of the tangents .
Demonstration.-Let AH , HI , and IB be the arches to represent the given angles ; and AG , HK , and BT be their / tangents , put r the radius , AG a , and BT =b , \ Then rand b will be the tangents of : HD and DI .
Now by Prop. VIII .
Sect. I. Book I. EMERSON 's Trigonometry , ' As radius square-product of two tangents Is to radius square , So is the sum of the tangents To the tangent of their sum .

Q.E. D. PROPOSITION II .
In every obtuse angled plane triangle , the sum of the three tangents of the three angles multiplied by the square of radius , is equal to their continued product .
Deonstration.-Let AH be an obtuse Tr arc , and HE , ED the other two .
Then BF , ED , and AG are the three tangents .
Put BF t and DE =u radius r , then per trigonometry , as before , r'x A-i BT ; But BT = AG = t-x r ' .
rt Wherefore t+ u. xrt the sum of the three tangents , which being reduced is =tu x 4+t , and multiplied into r ' is equal to Gt X+ x the product .
