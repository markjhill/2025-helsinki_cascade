) This communication gives an account of measurements of osmotic pressures of aqueous solutions of cane sugar , dextrose , galactose , and mannite .
The method adopted is that briefly outlined by us in Yol .

Soc. Proc. ' A gradually increasing pressure is placed upon the solution ( which is separated from the solvent by a semi-permeable membrane ) until the solvent , which at first flows into the solution , reverses its direction and is squeezed out .
The pressure , when there is no movement of the solvent , is considered to be the osmotic pressure .
Owing to the difficulty of determining the exact point at which no movement takes place and for other reasons , the experiments are carried out so as to enable an observation to be made of the rate of movement of the solvent , both when the pressure on the solution is just below and when just above the turning point pressure .
The osmotic pressure is deduced from these rates .
The range of pressures covered by the experiments is from 12 to 135 atmospheres .
A description is also given of the methods adopted for making the copper ferrocyanide membranes , and it is pointed out that with the best membranes , in most cases , a small quantity of solution comes through during the experiment .
It is shown that even a small leak causes a considerable lowering of the observed pressure ; hence the final results accepted are those where the leak was least .
Attention is drawn to the fact that the osmotic pressures of cane sugar solutions when measured directly and when calculated from their vapour pressures agree to within 3 per cent.
