" On the influence of Physical Agents on the development of the Tadpole of the Triton and the Frog .
" By John HEigginbottom , Esq. Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , Sec. R.S. Mr. Higginbottom 's experiments were made in different positions and degrees of temperature , many of them in a rock cellar 30 feet deep , where no solar light ever entered , and where the temperature varied only in the course of the year from 48 ?
to 55 ?
Fahr. The results of numerous experiments showed that the development of the tadpole was principally hastened or retarded by temperature and the supply of food , and that , contrary to the opinion of many other observers , the presence or absence of light did not appear to exercise any perceptible influence upon their development .
