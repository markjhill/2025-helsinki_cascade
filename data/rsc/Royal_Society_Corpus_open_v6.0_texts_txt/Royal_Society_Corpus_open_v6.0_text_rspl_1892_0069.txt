William Marcet , M.D. , F.R.S. Received June 9 , Read June 16 , 1892.* I had the honour of communicating a paper to the Royal Society in June , 1891 , embodying the results obtained from a first series of inquiries on the interchange of pulmonary gases .
The investigation has been continued , and I have had the benefit of the assistance of Mr. Gi .
P. Darnell Smith , B.Sc. , in the present work .
I am greatly indebted to Mr. Smith for many useful suggestions ; while our discussions have been fruitful on many occasions .
The apparatus used for the estimation of carbonic acid and oxygen has been fully described in my former paper , but , as the drawing of the eudiometer employed could not be inserted in that communication , it is appended to this paper together with an explanation of the construction of the instrument .
The key to a method of investigation calculated to give correct information on the interchange of the respiratory gases is to be found in the means adopted for the determination of the volumes of aii inspired and expired .
C. Speck in his experiments , inspired a measured volume of air from a bell-jar , carefully balanced over a water trough , and expired it into another , the volumes of aii inspired and expired being thus determined by direct measurement .
Messrs. Hanriod and Richet used gas meters instead of bell-jars .
In my former inquiry , after trying how closely experiments with bell-jars agreed with each other , it was found that the results obtained were not sufficiently reliable to be used except in the form of means , on that account , the object was attained by calculation , assuming that the volume of nitrogen in the air expired was exactly the same as the volume of nitrogen in the air inspired ; consequently the volume of nitrogen expired was proportional to the volume of air inspired .
It has occurred to me that an objection to this means of determining the volume of air inspired might be raised on the ground that it is unscientific to adopt a method of inquiry based on an assumption , although the investigations of Regnault and Reiset have apparently placed what I call an assumption on the footing of an acknowledged fact .
There was consequently a gap to fill up , as it was necessary to ascertain whether nitrogen is either absorbed in the blood or given out , or whether it takes no appreciable part in the respiratory process ; with this object , an experiment was made by re-breathing a known volume of air in a bell-jar , and determining afterwards the volume of nitrogen present in this air , but the * Revised August , 1892 .

History of the Interchange of method proved unsatisfactory .
Another experiment was made with three hell-jars\#151 ; a small one , of a capacity of 10 litres , being placed between two others which held , when- full , 40 litres each ; the three bell-jars were connected with each other by india-rubber tubing in the course of which an apparatus was disposed for the absorption of carbonic acid .
* The person under experiment breathed out of and into the middle and smaller bell-jar , which held at the time 5 or 6 litres of air , while a known volume of air was driven from one of the large bell-jars into the other , through the smaller receiver and back again .
The carbonic acid absorbed was replaced by oxygen gas .
The principle of the method was indeed the same as that adopted by Regnault and Reiset , and more recently by Messrs. Jolyet , Bergonie , and Sigalas.* Great difficulty , however , was met with in this experiment , especially from the tension of gases in the bell-jars , and it was ultimately given up .
At last the simplest method was resorted to ; although , the results of the experiments varying somewhat widely from each other , this process necessitated the adoption of means .
The experiments were conducted much on the same principle as those made by C. Speck , every precaution being taken to carry them out as correctly as possible .
For this purpose , 40 litres of atmospheric air were introduced into one of my bell-jars , the air being saturated by passing it slowly through a glass vessel holding cottonwool wetted with tepid water .
Air was inspired from this bell-jar through the nose , with nose-pieces fitting closely into the nostrils , and expired from the mouth into another bell-jar , also holding 40 litres ; corrections were made for slight differences between the bell-jars and for temperatures .
In some of the experiments a valve was placed in the tract of the air inspired , and in others no valve was used , but the inspiratory and expiratory india-rubber tubes were pinched alternately with the fingers to prevent any regurgitation .
Notwithstanding every care to breathe as naturally as possible , the relations between the volumes of air inspired and expired were occasionally found to differ widely from each other .
On this account it has been found necessary to reject a certain number of these experiments , which yielded figures clearly far distant from those they should have given ; and I have finally a series of ten experiments to record , in which it will be observed that , although there is a very marked difference between the figures obtained , still the means show that nitrogen takes no appreciable part in the phenomenon of respiration , if concerned at all in this function .
The following are the results obtained , placed in a tabular form\#151 ; References to these papers were given in my former communication .

The third column gives the volumes of air inspired , calculated from the assumption that the whole of the nitrogen exhaled is also inhaled .
It will be observed that the mean of the volumes in the third column is all but exactly the same as the mean of the volumes in the first column , the difference being only by 3 c.c. ; hence the obvious conclusion that nitrogen takes no appreciable part , , or no part at all in the interchange of the pulmonary gases .
It follows from the harmony found to exist between the mean volumes of air actually inspired and the mean volumes of air inspired determined by calculation , that the corresponding volumes of nitrogen , of oxygen consumed , and oxygen absorbed and retained in the blood , whether found or calculated , will also be practically the same ; this is set forth clearly in the next table .
These experiments show most satisfactorily that the method adopted to obtain the volumes of air inspired by calculation can be trusted as correct ; and , therefore , that not only the means obtained by that method , but also every single experiment , may be accepted as giving a reliable result .
A certain amount of training was , however , required before the results could be considered as fit for recording .
The next point for consideration refers to the influence of changes of temperature on the consumption of oxygen per minute , or , in other words , on the carbonic acid produced and oxygen absorbed .
These experiments have been made on myself and Mr. Smith while under the influence of food , and an additional number were made on compared .

On Simultaneity of stations the times are distinctly greater and at others distinctly less than the average of times for all stations .
Either the magnetic impulse is really retarded at some stations and accelerated at others , as referred to the mean , or there exists at individual stations some systematic error , mechanical or otherwise , which affects the times in one particular way .
That such error should exist is not unlikely since it is difficult to make accurate , beyond a certain point , a time scale so contracted , and difficult also to measure correctly the photographic trace , besides which the desirability of securing such extreme accuracy has not been before made apparent .
It happens that on five of the selected days , Nos. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 , corresponding records were found in the magnetic section of the 'Mission Scientifique du Cap Horn , ' 1882\#151 ; 1883 .
Here Ho. 6 is said to be " un diminution brusque , " No. 7 " un mouvement tres rapide , " and No. 9 is said to commence " brusquement .
" Engraved copies of the registers on a small scale are given for Nos. 8 , 9 , and 10 , showing the movements to have been of the character described .
This affords five comparisons .
The times are given only to the nearest five minutes , and the mean of the five resulting deviations , which range from +7'lm .
to -8-6m .
, is +l'lm .
There were in addition six other instances of sudden movement contained in the Cape Horn series , not included in our selected list , for which corresponding movements were readily found in the Greenwich records .
These movements are spoken of as having at Cape Horn the same abrupt character as those already mentioned .
The separate values of deviation referred ( by comparison through Greenwich ) to the general mean of Table I range from +9'2m .
to \#151 ; 108 m. , the mean being \#151 ; 2T m. Or , combining the two sets , we have from eleven comparisons a mean deviation of \#151 ; 07 m. The mean deviation of time at each station from the general mean for all stations ( the means of the columns of differences in Table I ) and the difference between the greatest and least values at each station , adding the result for Cape Horn for eleven days just found , are as follows:\#151 ; Magnetic Variations at different Places , fyc .

This may explain the greater differences for Cape Horn and Melbourne in the last column of the table .
The question that now arises is , What is the explanation of the small differences between the values of deviation at different places ?
As already suggested , they must be due either to real difference in the time of the magnetic impulse , depending on geographical position , or to the existence at individual stations of some systematic error .
In regard to the possible variation of the values of deviation with geographical position , there may be variation with latitude or with longitude .
It will be observed that in Table II the stations are already arranged in order of longitude , and the run of the numbers would appear to indicate a tendency to negative values at westerly stations , and to positive values , on the whole , at easterly stations , but yet the differences are such ( remembering how easily some of these differences might arise , with existing apparatus ) as would hardly warrant the assumption that such variation really exists ; neither does a change with longitude seem to be one for which there would appear to be any ready physical explanation .
The variation in the values of deviation with latitude is better seen by arranging the numbers of Table II in order of latitude , and , considering the divergence of the magnetic equator from the astronomical equator , it seems better to group them according to the values of magnetic dip at the various stations , which has been done as follows , adding also a 200 Mr. W. Ellis .

South end There would seem to be here a tendency to negative values with northerly dip , and to positive values with southerly dip .
Remarking how five stations ( two with extreme northerly dip , two with extreme southerly dip , and one intermediate ) hang together , this apparent tendency may be accidental , and yet there is an undoubted drift to the left in the upper part of the diagram , and to the right in the lower part A variation with latitude certainly appears to be one better admitting of physical explanation than does a variation with longitude .
Can anything depend on the distribution of land and water ?
Whether the observed deviations represent a real inequality , Magnetic Variations at different Places , Sfc .
201 or whether the irregularities are wholly accidental , and that the magnetic impulse in these motions is everywhere simultaneous , we cannot say .
The data are not sufficient to permit of the formation of any definite conclusion .
But whatever may be the explanation of the irregularities of deviation , it would seem that over a certain portion of the earth 's surface the magnetic action in these initial impulses is practically simultaneous .
The values of mean deviation for Greenwich , Paw-lowsk , Mauritius , and Bombay are \#151 ; 0'1 m. , -0'2m .
, +0'5m , , and _0-1 m. , respectively , an agreement which is certainly striking , and which can hardly be explained on any supposition but that of simultaneous action .
For if we divide the series for these places ( Table I ) into two groups , say of 8 and 9 values each respectively , and take their means , we have as follows:\#151 ; Greenwich .
Pawlowsk .
Mauritius .

Greenwich and Bombay are thus in close accord , and in a remarkable degree , the agreement amounting almost to a confirmation of the adopted difference of longitude .
The extreme difference between the four values at the different stations is seen to be , in the first set l'8m .
, and in the second set 0'7 m. And the differences between the separate values at each station are severally 0*4 m. , 1*2 m. , 1*0 m. , and 0'3 m. Now the latter differences , which may be taken to indicate the amount of accidental irregularity in the values , bear a considerable proportion to the differences between the values at the separate stations ( 1*8 m. and 07 m. ) , so that these differences are probably wholly accidental .
Again , the mean of the first four values is +01 m. , and of the last four O'O m. , showing on the whole no real difference .
All this indicates that at Greenwich , Pawlowsk , Mauritius , and Bombay the magnetic impulse would appear to be really simultaneous , or at any rate that the variations between the observed deviations at these places afford no trustworthy evidence against such conclusion .
We come thus to an interesting result .
The magnetic impulse over that portion of the earth 's surface covered by the places last mentioned would evidently appear to be , on the whole , simultaneous ; although whether , in like manner , simultaneous over the whole earth Mr , W. Ellis .
On Simultaneity of we cannot say .
But , considering the inadequacy of our present registering apparatus to ensure in all cases the necessary accuracy of time indication , it becomes a question whether the coincidence may not be generally closer than present means will enable us to measure .
To determine this with precision would , however , require some modification of the apparatus now in general use .
The circumstance that the sudden magnetic movements of the-character here discussed appear to be so nearly , if not absolutely , simultaneous over the whole earth becomes , if established , a striking physical fact .
In numerous cases the disturbance , commencing suddenly , and continuing for many hours , follows on a state of comparative magnetic calm .
How is the sudden change to a state of activity brought about , and what is the influence that so instantaneously disturbs the magnetic condition of our globe P The magnetic movements at Greenwich at such times are always accompanied by corresponding earth currents , which , similarly following a state of calm , become at once active , precisely at the commencement of the magnetic disturbance .
It is believed that a similar effect is produced at other places , and that this is so is , in some cases , specially mentioned .
Some sudden action , apparently from without , sets up , as it seems , both earth current and magnetic activity simultaneously , or nearly so , over the whole earth .
It is to be noted that magnetic and earth current disturbance at Greenwich is , on the whole , more frequent in spring and autumn , when , in its diurnal revolution , the whole surface , or nearly the whole surface , of the earth becomes , during each twenty-four hours , exposed to the sun , as though the earth in some way contributed to the production of the phenomena observed , a given external influence appearing to cause at these times a greater activity than at other parts of the year .
For magnetic disturbance rises and falls generally with the existence of more or fewer sun spots , in which variation we do not expect to find an annual period .
Without , however , discussing further the production of , or relation between , magnetic disturbances and earth currents , on which something will be said in a later part of this paper , we will proceed to offer some particulars * more nearly concerning what has gone before .
In asking for corresponding times of magnetic movement at the places mentioned in Table I , request was also in each case made for information on the direction and character of the magnetic movement , and many interesting particulars were thus supplied .
It is not proposed on the present occasion to treat these details numerically , but rather to group them in such a way as to show , in a simple and ready manner , the direction of the magnetic movements at each place on the several days .
The results are given in Table III , in which the sign + indicates that the north end of the declina- Magnetic Variations at different , 8fc .
203 -fcion magnet was drawn towards the west , the north end of the horizontal force magnet toVards the north , and the north end of the vertical force magnet downwards ; the sign \#151 ; indicating in each .case the opposite movement .
At Mauritius , Batavia , and Melbourne , at which places the south end of the needle dips , the sign + indicates that the south end of the vertical force magnet was drawn downwards .
In the absence of definite information , this is presumed to apply also to Cape Horn , at which the south end also dips .
The movement in horizontal force appears to have been in general the most significant .
At the stations in tropical regions the movements in declination and vertical force were usually small .
The table gives an interesting synopsis of the direction of magnetic movement in the several cases , and the general similarity of movement at each station on different days .
Thus the movements in the three magnetic elements on different days at Cape Horn , Bombay , Batavia , and Zi-ka-wei were , so far as information is available , in each case similar throughout , and , with one or two exceptions , also at Greenwich , Pawlowsk , and Mauritius ; at Melbourne there were variations , and at Toronto , for which place information in regard to the declination change only was received , there were also variations .
At Greenwich the increase in all elements was always accompanied by earth cunent of one character as respects direction of current , the instances of decrease in the magnetic elements being accompanied by earth current of opposite character .
The general , indeed remarkable , similarity in the character of the initial magnetic impulse on different days at the several places , considered in connexion with the coincidence iq time , indicates the advent in these cases of some powerful disturbance or sudden shock influencing the magnetism of the whole earth nearly always in the same way , an influence in which the earth becomes , as it were , at once involved , a state of general magnetic calm being at all places immediately converted into a state of magnetic activity .
Whether these magnetic movements occur more frequently when any particular region of the earth is turned towards the sun is a question that the selected cases of Table I , with the additional instances to be found in Table IV , are too few to determine ; but this point may receive elucidation from a more extended inquiry which the many years of Greenwich records will readily afford , and with which object some tabulation thereof has been already made .
Our inquiry has been confined to a consideration of the initial magnetic movements preceding disturbance .
As pointed out , these movements occur simultaneously , both for the different magnetic elements and for alt places .
The character of the magnetic change is mostly similar at any one place on different days , but is not necessarily the same for all places ; that is to say , the initial phenomena become , on Mr. W. Ellis .
On Simultaneity of the different occasions , repeated at each station in a generally similar manner , but with the individual difference peculiar to the station .
Disturbance having , however , once set in , it is found that , although the magnetic irregularity will be practically similar for places not geographically distant , as Greenwich and Kew , there is not the same complete similarity in the movements at places widely separated .
The magnetic impulse at any moment during disturbance may , of course , be simultaneously propagated through the earth , as in the case of the initial movements ; but it is not usually possible to fix on any phase of movement , and say to what phase it corresponds at another distant station , unless the movement is sudden , when the initial type again recurs , and such recurrence , occurring during disturbance at Greenwich , has been found to correspond with recurrence at other places .
Generally it is only these cases of sudden , not necessarily large , movement , occurring at the beginning or during a magnetic disturbance , that we can readily identify as being really simultaneous and corresponding movements .
Reference has been made to the earth currents always so active during magnetic disturbance .
Mr. C. V. Walker , formerly telegraph superintendent of the South Eastern Railway , in a paper read before the Royal Society in the year 1861 , came to the conclusion , from observations made on the telegraph lines under his control , that earth currents , at least at times of great magnetic disturbance , exercised a direct action upon magnetometers , just as artificial currents confined to a wire exercise a direct action upon a magnet .
Two insula , ted lines of wire were afterwards established in connexion with the Royal Observatory , one passing from the Observatory to Dartford , the other from the Observatory to Croydon , expressly for the study of earth currents .
The distance between the earth plates in the Dartford circuit was 10 miles , and in the Croydon circuit 8 miles .
Sir George Airy , discussing the earth currents observed in these lines during the years 1865 to 1867 ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 158 , p. 471 ) , confirmed generally Mr. Walker 's result , considering that " it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the magnetic disturbances are produced by terrestrial galvanic currents below the magnets bqt there were some anomalies , the earth current appearing , in some cases , distinctly to follow the magnetic motion , instead of being coincident with , or preceding , it , as , on the supposition mentioned , should always happen , and in other cases preceding it by a longer interval of time than the conditions seemed to require .
In the year 1868 the earth current lines to Dartford and Croydon were replaced by two others running , one from near Morden College , Blackheath , to the North Kent East Junction of the South Eastern Railway ( distance between earth plates 2\miles ) , and the other from Angerstein Wharf ( on the bank of the River Thames , near Charlton ) Magnetic Variations at different , Sfc .

to Lady Well , Lewisham ( distance between earth plates 3 miles ) : these positions being selected in order that the recording apparatus at the Royal Observatory , through which the wires passed , should be nearly in the middle of the straight lines joining the respective earth plates .
Row it has been mentioned that the instances of sharply-defined magnetic impulses contained in Table I were all accompanied ( in the just-described newer earth current lines ) by active earth currents , in themselves just as sharply defined .
The distinctive character and generally isolated position of these magnetics and earth current movements thus afford a peculiarly favourable opportunity for investigating any relation that may exist between them , much more so than Magnetic Variations at different , SfC .
would any attempt to discuss movements of a mixed or involved nature , and it is found that motions of the declination and horizontal force magnets for the instances contained in Table I are , without exception , in direction such as would be produced by the action of a current passing through a wire under the magnet , similar to that of the actual accompanying earth current .
But then comes a further question:\#151 ; Do earth current and magnetic times really agree ?
For in the discussion of the Dartford and Croydon earth current records , the earth current on some occasions , according to the instrumental time scales , seemed undoubtedly to follow the magnetic movement , instead of being coincident with , or preceding , it .
But the system on which the time scales were in those days laid down was not arranged with a view to the accurate measurement of small intervals of time , and in this respect did not permit of an accuracy equal to that to be obtained from later registers , on which a time indication is made at every individual hour .
Thus we are now able to effect a much more certain comparison of the times of magnetic and earth current movement than was before possible .
This has been done for a considerable number of instances of sudden initial movement , including all those of Table I ( excepting 1882 , April 16 , on which day the earth current register was defective ) , and also a number of others , the whole particulars being given in Table IV .
When it is considered that each separate difference in this table includes the sum of the errors of two time measures from photographs having a time scale in which one minute corresponds to about 0-01 inch , the agreement of results , it will be seen , is very good .
Every case selected for measurement is given ; nothing has been rejected .
The variation between individual differences does not exceed in amount that which may well be expected , with a time scale so contracted , and would appear to be simply due to unavoidable errors of measurement .
The mean of the 31 differences is \#151 ; 0T4 m. , equivalent to 8 sec. , or , dividing the 31 differences into three groups of 11 , 10 , and 10 values respectively , the means of these groups are found to be \#151 ; 0*19 m. , \#151 ; 0T2 m. , and \#151 ; 0T0 m. , equivalent to 11 sec. , 7 sec. , and 6 sec. respectively , thus persistently showing the earth current to precede by a few seconds the magnetic movement .
Not that these results should be taken too strictly , but simply as showing , when definite comparison can be made , that the coincidence of time is really very close , possibly more so than present existing means will permit us to determine .
This so far removes the before-mentioned time anomaly , the observed facts being now seen to be altogether consistent with the supposition that earth currents may produce the magnetic movements , whether or not , as regards cause and effect , this be the true relation .

History of the Interchange of Pulmonary Gases in the Respiration of Man .

Smith , while fasting ; hence , in his case , the experiments show the influence of food on the interchange of pulmonary gases .
I regret that in the present inquiry no experiments were made on myself while fasting , and that those , fasting , on Mr. Smith are too few to show any influence of temperature under this condition .
It would have been , of course , more satisfactory to eliminate the influence of food while inquiring into the action of differences of temperature on the interchange of the pulmonary gases .
The results obtained show the effects of a change of temperature on the chemical phenomena of respiration to vary somewhat with different persons , some being more disposed than others to react against an accession of cold by an increased production of carbonic acid .
In my case , the effect is very obvious , as seen in the following table ( p. 218 ) .
First of all , if the means of the oxygen consumed per minute , the carbonic acid produced , and the oxygen absorbed , also per minute , be compared with the corresponding figures obtained under the influence of food in my former inquiry , * they will be found to harmonise with them in a marked degree ; they are as follows :\#151 ; The oxygen consumed is nearly exactly the same in both cases , varying by only 1 c.c. The carbonic acid produced is a little lower in the recent experiments , and the oxygen absorbed somewhat higher .
The slight difference between the carbonic acid produced in each set of experiments , and also the difference , which is rather greater , between the figures found for oxygen absorbed in the two series of experiments , 30'2 and 35*7 , are probably owing to the precaution taken in the recent inquiry of allowing half an hour 's perfect rest , in the recumbent posture , before commencing the experiment .
Formerly the time of rest had been limited to from five minutes to a quarter of an hour , wdien the pulse and breathing had become perfectly regular ; but it was subsequently found that half an hour at least should be allowed before collecting the air expired for analysis , in order to ensure the body being in a perfect state of rest .
The table has been disposed in a graphic form , the curves showing , at a glance , the influence of temperature on the interchange of pulmonary gases in my case ; this influence !

ll'-5 13''4 14'-4 Of course it cannot be expected , in a work of this kind , that tracings will be perfectly regular ; hence in the tracing for oxygen consumed we observe a slight abnormal rise between 140,4 and 160,3 .
This is probably owing to the weather being cold outside ; the experiment was done on the 24th of February ; the maximum temperature of that day in the open air was 9 ' C. ( Wimbledon Park ) , and the body was partly under this cooling influence , although the temperature of the laboratory , at University College , heated with hot-water pipes , was 160-3 .
The tracing for carbonic acid produced also exhibits irregularities , but the curves show distinctly that , at all events in my case , changes of temperature exert a very positive influence on the interchange of the pulmonary gases .
If the temperatures of the atmosphere in which the experiments are made be divided into two groups , one group including the lowest and another the highest , and a table constructed , into which the carbonic acid produced and oxygen absorbed are entered together with their corresponding temperatures , this table will be as follows :\#151 ; Low temperature .

Pulmonary Gases in the Respiration of Man .
The mean ratio of C02 produced to 0 absorbed is , therefore , very-different according to temperatures ; it is much lower in relatively cold than in warmer temperatures ; hence the interesting fact that the absorption into the blood of that proportion of oxygen consumed which is not transformed into carbonic acid is not concerned in the production of heat towards resisting external cold .
This is clearly the case , as the colder the atmosphere the less the proportion of oxygen consumed as absorbed in opposition to the proportion consumed towards the production of carbonic acid , which is markedly increased .
A similar effect of temperature is met with in the experiments reported in my former paper .
Out of six experiments made on myself under the influence of food , two were carried out 2 hrs .
25 mins , and 1 hr .
and 40 mins , respectively after a meal , when the laboratory in winter was much below its usual temperature , the readings being 10''4 C. and 12 ' C. ; on these occasions the oxygen absorbed per minute was 27 c.c. and 24-8 c.c. respectively , and the mean ratio between the C02 produced and O absorbed was 25'9 22g = 0*114 ; while when the laboratory was comfortably warm , at a mean temperature of 16''8 C. , the mean volume of oxygen absorbed .
32*4 was 32'4 c.c. , and the ratio igffT ~0'152 .
Hence , again , the ratios were lower in low than in high temperatures , which means that in my case in low temperatures less oxygen is absorbed , relatively to the carbonic acid produced , than in high temperatures .
The experiments while fasting reported in my former paper were all made when the laboratory was comfortably warm , and cannot be utilised towards showing the influence of temperature .

History of the Interchange Pulmonary Gases in the Respiration of Man .
223 In Mr. Smith 's case there are actually seven pairs of experiments ( fourteen altogether ) made under the influence of food .
Each experiment was repeated at the time , and the means of the pairs were taken and recorded .
Grouping these pairs of experiments two-by-two , as shown in this last table , the volumes of oxygen consumed will be found to exhibit a slight decrease as the temperatures rise , the carbonic acid produced also shows a slight tendency to fall with the increase of temperature .
The oxygen absorbed , which in my case is unmistakably increased with a rise in temperature , is not found to undergo a similar change , but remains nearly the same throughout ; there being a slight fall at the two highest temperatures .
With reference to the influence of food on the interchange of the pulmonary gases , the experiments made on Mr. Smith fasting , or when a desire for food was felt about five hours after breakfast , showed a considerable falling off in the oxygen consumed , carbonic acid produced , and oxygen absorbed .
Corresponding experiments have been reported in my former paper .
Mr. Russell , who assisted me at the time , a young gentleman twenty-one years of age , also exhibited a decrease , though but slight , of oxygen absorbed while fasting , the figures being 33'3 c.c. while fasting , and 37'5 at a mean period of 2 hrs .
16 min. after a full meal .
In my case the figures were 35'3 c.c. while fasting and 30'2 under food , which show a slight influence in the opposite direction .
It appears , therefore , that the influence of food upon the absorption of oxygen varies with different persons , but that in young and strong people the absorption of oxygen has a decided tendency to increase after a meal .
The results obtained from the present inquiry may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
Nitrogen acts a part inappreciable , if concerned at all , in the interchange of pulmonary gases .
2 .
The influence of changes of the atmospheric temperature on the oxygen consumed , carbonic acid produced , and oxygen absorbed , although in the present experiments this influence is more or less interfered with by the phenomena of digestion , is distinct in my case ; the oxygen consumed and carbonic acid produced increasing with falling-temperatures , while the oxygen absorbed is lessened ; and a similar result is obtained from the consideration of the figures given in my former communication .
This fact is interesting , perhaps , mainly as showing that the oxygen absorbed is not concerned in the formation of heat in the body towards resisting cold\#151 ; a function which appears to be limited entirely to the oxidation of carbon into carbonic acid .
If , as usually admitted , the blood is limited in its power of taking up oxygen , although this power may apparently vary according to temperatures , then it is obvious that an increased formation of carbonic acid vol. m ; q 224 Dr. W. Marcet .
History of the Interchange of must necessarily be attended with a falling off in the oxygen absorbed Cold would thus rob the body of a portion of its oxygen and interfere with those functions of nutrition with which the absorbed oxygen is concerned .
This would explain the hibernation of animals______ their functions are arrested because the whole of the oxygen they consume in winter is used up towards the formation of carbonic acid , and there is none left to carry on the phenomena of nutrition .
It would also account for the sleepiness or stupor well known to be produced by intense cold .
When Mr. Smith was under experiment the influence of temperature on the oxygen consumed and carbonic acid produced was in the same direction , though much less marked than in my case .
The oxygen absorbed does not , however , show the same tendency to decrease with a falling temperature .
This does not , I consider , invalidate the result as obtained on myself , the temperature of the air being higher when the experiments were made on Mr. Smith than when they were undertaken on myself , and the body being under the influence of an early spring season in March ; while the experiments on myself were made in winter , when the laboratory at times was very cold .
3 .
The influence of food on the interchange of respiratory gases , although being attended with a rise in the oxygen consumed and carbonic acid expired , apparently varies with reference to the oxygen absorbed .
Young and strong persons , requiring a full allowance of food , appear to absorb more oxygen while under the influence of a meal than while fasting , but late in life the oxygen absorbed appears to show little or no tendency to increase after a meal .
According to Hanriot and Richet , the carbonic acid produced increases considerably under the influence of food , while the increased absorption of oxygen is but slight.* In conclusion , I wish to allude shortly to a result embodied in my former communication , and relating to the respiration of air containing an increased proportion of carbonic acid .
Five experiments had been made\#151 ; three on myself and two on my assistant , Mr. Russell .
The proportions of C02 in the air inspired were respectively 2T3 , 3T4 , 4'06 , 3-79 , and 3'91 per cent. It was found that the amount of carbonic acid produced in a given time was lower than when pure air was breathed , and that the oxygen absorbed was greatly increased .
The following table gives the figures obtained for the oxygen absorbed:\#151 ; * 'Ann .

The figures given in the table for O absorbed under normal conditions , are taken , with one exception , from experiments made at the same sitting as those in which C02 was breathed , and therefore compare with them .
The excessive volume of oxygen absorbed when air mixed with 002 was inhaled must have been owing to the fact that a portion of the oxygen consumed , which under usual circumstances would have been given out as carbonic acid , remained in the blood , obviously as carbonic acid , because of the impeded diffusion in the lungs on account of the C02 contained in the air breathed .
The actual amount of carbonic acid being thus retained in the blood can be calculated , with what I think a near degree of approximation , by subtracting the oxygen which would have been absorbed in the respiration of pure air from the oxygen actually found to have been absorbed under the influence of the C02 inspired .
These figures , varying from 44 c.c. to 133 c.c. , are entered in the last column of the table , and show how large a volume of C02 may be retained in the blood when air contaminated with C02 is used for respiration .
This carbonic acid goes on accumulating in the body interfering with the normal phenomena of oxidation .
It is very difficult to consider this effect otherwise than poisonous ; although under circumstances which admit of the introduction of C02 in the blood through another channel than respiration , the gas appears innocuous .
Cl. Bernard has shown this to be the case by the injection of C02 into the circulation of animals , when the gas found its way out of the body through the lungs without producing any morbid action .

History of the Interchange of The eudiometer has the form of a ( J-tribe , drawn into an open neck at its bend , where the opening is controlled with a stopcock .
One of the limbs of the instrument , which is graduated , i3 surrounded by a water jacket , and has an iron cap cemented to it , in which there is a. Pulmonary Gases in the Respiration of Man .
227 three-way iron stopcock .
A scale is fixed at the back of the open limb , the divisions corresponding exactly to those engraved on the other limb .
The flask C , open at both ends , is full of water , and communicates by india-rubber tubing with the cylinder D , which contains the air for .analysis .
The process of analysis is as follows :\#151 ; The eudiometer is entirely filled with mercury .
Next , the hydrogen being placed under a pressure of 1 or 2 inches of water by depressing the receiver , the gas is driven through the three-way cock , while at the same time it is aspired by a compressed india-rubber syringe , which is suddenly released ; this washes out all the atmospheric air from the tube connecting the supply of hydrogen with the eudiometer .
The three-way cock being turned so as to connect the hydrogen-receiver with the eudiometer , mercury is let out at the bend of the instrument , when hydrogen is drawn into it , and the volume of the gas recorded .
Air from the flask D is admitted into the eudiometer through the india-rubber tube , pressure being exerted by the water held in the flask D , while aspiration is produced by letting out mercury from the eudiometer .
The gases are brought under atmo- , spheric pressure by adding or taking out mercury .
The gases are mixed in the eudiometer by means of an india-rubber syringe fitting to the open end of the instrument , where the funnel is shown in the drawing ; the syringe is compressed and released repeatedly , thus driving the mercury up and down .
The little movable spirit level is convenient , though not indispensable , towards the adjusting of the mercury in the two limbs .
I find that such an instrument has been proposed , or used , for similar purposes by Gr .
Lunge ( ' Chem. Soc. Jl .
, ' 1892 ) , but the readings are not so reliable as those obtained from two identical scales , one for each limb of the IJ'tuk6The gases are finally exploded in the usual way .
The process is described in full in my paper read June , 1891 , to the Royal Society .
