( Absti'ac.t .
) In this paper the results of observations made by exposing platino-type paper are recorded , and it is shown that the total intensity of light as thns registered is the same as if observations had been made on a ray of \4240 alone .
The observations were made at altitudes varying from sea-level to 12,000 feet , in different countries , at different times of the year , and during four to five years .
The instrument in which the exposures were made is described , as also the method of deriving the intensity of light from the developed prints .
The results of these observations agree closely with those obtained by the measures of the spectrum which was described in Part I of this subject .
The value of in the formula ( 1 ) I ' = ( from which can be calculated the loss of intensity of a ray of any particular wave-length ) was found to be 0-00146 at sea-level .
It was also found that k apparently varied as h2 , h being the barometric pressure .
A table is attached , showing the value of the transmitted light in the formula ( 2 ) I ' = la* , where a is a constant and x the air thickness in terms of the vertical thickness , / i being the formula I ' = Ie-^* , from which ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are both shown to be derived .
