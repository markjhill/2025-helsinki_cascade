( Abstract .
) This paper contains a minute account of the descending degenerations which have been observed to make their appearance in the lower portions of the central nervous system , as the result of artificial established lesions of parts of the cerebral cortex .
The work has been carried out by Mr. France with material supplied by the researches of Professor Horsley , Dr. Sanger Brown , and Professor Scbaf\#174 ; r\gt ; 1889 .

which have been published in the * Philosophical Transactions * ( vol. 179 ) .
It is illustrated partly by representations of certain of the brains showing the extent of the lesions , partly by photographs of microscopic sections through the spinal cord and medulla oblongata .

It is well known , that quite apart from a tendency to separate more or less completely into different mixtures during solidification , certain mixtures of molten metals show a tendency to separate into two alloys of different densities on standing fused for some time .
Lead and zinc and bismuth and zinc have been shown by Matthiessen and von Bose ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 11 , p. 430 ) to form two such mixtures .
We find that aluminium and zinc or aluminium and bismuth also behave in the same way .
In each case two different alloys are formed , one consisting of the heavier metal with a little of the lighter one dissolved therein , the other of the lighter metal containing a small quantity of the heavier one .
On the other hand , tin will alloy indefinitely in all proportions with any one of the four metals , lead , bismuth , zinc , or* aluminium , the mixtures exhibiting no particular tendency to separate into two different alloys on simply remaining at rest in a fused condition , although in certain cases more or less separation is apt to occur during solidification , owing to partial formation of eutectic alloy .
On quickly cooling a mass of 60 to 80 grams of mixed metal , fused in a small narrow crucible and kept molten for some hours , an ingot is obtained , the highest and lowest portions of which exhibit sensibly the same composition on analysis ; no more difference being observed than may reasonably be attributed to surface oxidation and volatilisation whilst standing molten , and to incipient formation of eutectic alloy during the act of solidification .
Thus the following figures were obtained with two ingots of zinc and tin , and similarly in the other cases Top layer ... Bottom layer Zinc .
