At the close of an interesting paper in the ' Annals de Chimie , ' vol. 20 , 1880 , Ogier describes the preparation of the compound phosphoninm chloride .
When the two gases phosphine and hydrochloric acid are mixed at 14 ' C. under atmospheric pressure they do not combine ; but when the pressure is raised to 20 atmospheres small crystals of the compound PH4C1 form at the upper end of the Jtube .
At 26 ' C. these crystals melt , and the liquid formed was shown by some later experiments of va n't Hoff ( ' Deutsch .

This was the extent of our knowledge when the following experiments were begun with a view to examine more exactly this dissociable process , ( 1 ) in regard to its relations to temperature , volume , and pressure , and to those of the separate gases PHS and HC1 ; ( 2 ) in regard to the thermal changes involved in the formation of the \#166 ; compound .
This paper deals with the first part of the research only , but owing to the interesting results which it contains there can be little hesitation in putting it forth .
Experiments on Phosp .
Phosphine was prepared by dropping strong potash solution on a mixture of broken glass and phosphonium iodide .
After leaving the flask in which this operation was conducted the gas passed through a tube containing moist broken glass kept at the temperature of melting ice , and then through a drying tube of CaOlg and P305 .
The gas was collected in tubes over mercury .
The hydrochloric acid gas was prepared from strong sulphuric acid and ammonium chloride .

In this way I prepared a mixture of equal volumes of the two gases .
Part of this was delivered into a Cailletet tube which was set up in one of the iron bottles of a Cailletet pump ; in the other bottle was placed a well tested air gauge .
The temperature of the tube was maintained constant by a vapour jacket of acetone , and altered by varying the pressure under which the liquid boiled .
Observations were then taken for isothermals .

The temperature at which the crystals are formed under one atmosphere pressure is given as \#151 ; 30 ' by Ogier .
The formation of these crystals is evidently a dissociable one , for when the pressure is removed they decompose into equal volumes of the separate gases .
The question whether any chemical combination takes place before the appearance of crystals is one we shall discuss when considering the saturated volume curve of PH4C1 in comparison with those of its constituents .
Experiments on Phosphine .
This gas , prepared and dried as before , was passed for some hours through a Cailletet tube from which the air had previously been displaced with carbonic acid gas .
After careful sealing the tube was placed in the iron bottle , and liquid was readily obtained at the ordinary temperature under a pressure of about 30 atmospheres .
The critical state was reached with this liquid at 54 ' and 7 atmospheres pressures ; so that it is easily observed when the tube is heated with acetone vapour .
It is interesting to compare this critical point with that of the nitrogen analogue , ammonia , which does not reach the critical state till 130 ' and 115 atmospheres pressure .

is an unexpected result , as the substitution of a less volatile element has the effect of raising the critical temperature : thus for C02 critical temperature is 3P9 ' and for CS3 278 ' .
I have also noticed the formation of a crystalline hydrate of phosphine when the gas is liquefied in the presence of water .
The liquid gas floats on the surface of the water like benzene , and is apparently only slightly soluble .
By suddenly increasing and decreasing the pressure the two liquids are mixed together , and after a short time a mass of crystals is formed .

The mass of the gas was 0-06435 gram .
The physical constants for hydrochloric acid gas used in the diagrams are calculated from Ansdell 's paper ( 'Boy .

The mass of the gas* he used was 0-08531 gram ; and therefore the proper reduction has been made so that the volumes in the diagram may be those occupied by the molecular mass of hydrochloric acid in milligrams .
In the first diagram I have plotted for comparison the maximum pressure of the vapours at different temperatures both above and below zero .
In the case of PH4C1 the curve is drawn from my own observations from the critical point to 7 ' ; that point is joined by a dotted curve to the point corresponding to 1 atmosphere at \#151 ; 30 ' , at which temperature Ogier states that the crystals are formed under atmospheric pressure .
The curve for HC1 below zero is from numbers given by Faraday ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1846 ) .
The curve for PH3 is from * Found by calculation from Ansdell 's data .

The boiling point of PH3 is given by Olszewski as \#151 ; 85 ' .
At first sight it is evident that the form of the curve for PH4C1 is not a normal one , for if it were it would lie in the same direction as the other two .
At all temperatures the pressure is much lower than that corresponding to a mixture of the two gases PH3 and HC1 , so that it is evident forces of chemical attraction are acting .
From \#151 ; 30 ' to 10 ' the curve runs normally , so it appears that the gas probably consists wholly , from reasons we shall presently point out , of PH3 and HC1 molecules .
Above 10 ' these two gases combine and the pressure necessary to deposit the crystals very rapidly increases .
If the temperature be maintained constant the whole of the mixture is converted to the crystals of the compound under constant pressure by reducing the volume , just as a saturated vapour is converted into a liquid under similar conditions .

In the second diagram I have plotted curves representing the saturated volumes at different temperatures .

[ Apr. 21 , about 10 ' the saturated volume of the mixture corresponds to the sum of that of its components , whilst about their critical points the volumes are approximately equal .
This shows that at 10 ' we are dealing with a mixture of the two gases , whilst near the critical point the mixture has combined and the deposition of liquid takes place from gaseous PH4C1 .
The volumes which the liquids occupy near their critical points are very nearly equal .
This may be shown to be the case in another way .
It has been proved from van der Waals ' formula that the result of dividing the critical temperature in absolute degrees by the critical pressure gives a number proportional to the greatest volume a liquid can occupy ( Dewar , ' Phil. Mag. , ' vol. 18 , 1884 ) .

is case of combina- tion of liquids obeying a law very similar to Gay-Lussac 's law for the combination of gases under ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure .
A symbolic representation of this combination would be PH3 + HC1 = PH4C1 .
1 vol. liquid + 1 vol. liquid = 1 vol. liquid .
A close analogy evidently exists between the law of combination by volume of these liquids near their critical temperatures and Gay-Lussac 's law ; whether other cases of such a law of combination will be found is a question which cannot yet be answered .
Nevertheless the results in this paper appear to me to give answers to these two questions which Ogier states in his essay:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Ce liquid est-il la combinaison meme ou un simple melange des gaz liquefies ?
C'est ce qu'il no m'a pas ete possible d'elucider ; ( 2 ) Peut-etre le chlorhydrate d'hydrogene phosphore existe-t-il reellement a l'etat gazeux a un temperature moins basse .
I hope to continue these experiments with a view to determine the heat of formation of this compound PH4C1 , and also to determine the Electric Time-constant of a Circular Dish 289 conditions of the formation and composition of the hydrate of phosphine .
I must express my best thanks to Professor Dewar , F.R.S. , for his many kind and helpful suggestions , and also to the Master and Fellows of Christ 's College , who have permitted me to retain my scholarship during the continuance of this work .

" On the Principal Electric Time-constant of a Circular Disk .
" By Horace Lamb , M.A. , F.R.S. , Professor of Pure Mathematics in the Owens College , Victoria University .
Received March 29 , 1887 .
The time-constant for currents of any normal type in a given conductor is the time in which free currents of that type fall to 1/ e of their original strength .
In strictness there are for any conductor an infinite series of time-constants , corresponding to the various normal types , but in such a case as that of a coil of wire one of these is very great in comparison with the rest , which belong to types in which the current is in opposite directions in different parts of a section of the wire .
And in all cases the time-constant corresponding to the most persistent type which can be present under given circumstances is , of course , the one which is most important from an experimental point of view .
A determination of the time-constants of a uniform circular disk would be of interest for two reasons : first , in relation to Arago 's rotations , which are entirely due to the greater or less persistence of currents once started in the disk ; and , secondly , in connexion with Professor Hughes 's experiments with the induction balance , in which the disturbance produced in the field by the currents induced in metal disks ( such as coins ) was studied .
Unfortunately , the mathematical problem thus suggested would seem to be difficult .
Restricting ourselves , for simplicity , to cases where the currents flow in circles concentric with the disk , so that the problem is not complicated by the existence of an electric potential , then if 0 be the current-function , the electric momentum at a distance r from the centre of the disk will be \#151 ; dP/ dr , where P is the potential of an imaginary distribution of matter of density 0 over the disk .
Hence , if p be the resistance per unit area , we have\#151 ; In any normal type , 0 and P will vary as e_Ai , and , therefore\#151 ; dt dr d d ( L ) ( 2 .
