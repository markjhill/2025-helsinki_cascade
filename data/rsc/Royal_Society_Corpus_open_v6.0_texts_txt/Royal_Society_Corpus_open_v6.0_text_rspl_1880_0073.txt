( Abstract .
) The paper contains the results of an investigation into the nature of the material used in Japan for converting starch into sugar in the brewing operations .
This substance " koji " is prepared from steamed rice by allowing the spores of a fungus , mixed with the grain , to vegetate over the surface .
Details of the manufacture are given , and it is shown that the rice suffers a loss of 11 per cent. , calculated upon the substance dried at 100 ' C. At the same time a great evolution of heat occurs .
A solution of the soluble portion of the " koji " thus prepared is shown to possess properties analogous to those of malt-extract , although differing from it in some important respects .
It rapidly inverts cane-sugar and hydrates maltose and dextrin .
It liquefies starch-paste , forming at first maltose and dextrin , but giving as ultimate products dextrose and dextrin .
Curves accompany the paper showing the action of the extract of " koji " upon starch-paste at different temperatures .
The paper concludes with an examination of the change which the rice grain undergoes by the growth of the mycelium of the fungus , and it is pointed out that the principal effect produced by the growing plant is to render the insoluble albuminoids previously existing in the rice soluble .
