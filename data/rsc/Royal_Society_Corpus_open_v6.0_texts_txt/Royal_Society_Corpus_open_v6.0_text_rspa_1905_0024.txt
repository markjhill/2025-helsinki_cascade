) Although the atomic weight of chlorine has been determined by Stas and other chemists with extraordinary care , nevertheless owing to the very indirect methods hitherto used in making the comparison between chlorine and hydrogen , it is possible that a , constant error may occur in some link of the long chain of connecting ratios .
To join up the open ends of the chain by a direct comparison between chlorine and hydrogen , if it could be done with reasonable accuracy , would serve not only to detect any such systematic error , but would permit the accidental errors to be distributed and prevent their accumulation at the unconnected end .
According to Professor F. W. Clarke the accumulated " probable error " in his recalculated value for chlorine amounts to + 00048 ; the probable error of the mean of our nine determinations is less than + 0-002 .
It was at the suggestion of Professor E. W. Morley , of Cleveland , U.S.A. , that we have attempted this direct comparison by determining the weight of hydrogen which burns in a known weight of chlorine .
Our method was briefly as follows:\#151 ; Chlorine prepared by the electrolysis of fused silver chloride ( with purified carbon poles in a Jena glass vessel ) was condensed and weighed as a liquid in a sealed glass bulb .
This was attached to a vacuous " combustion globe " and the chlorine allowed to evaporate slow3y into the globe .
The hydrogen prepared by the electrolysis of barium hydrate solution was dried and then absorbed by palladium in a weighed vessel .
The palladium , on being warmed , gave off the hydrogen , which was ignited by a spark and burnt at a jet in the 1905 .
] The Atomic Weight of Chlorine .
combustion globe previously filled with chlorine .
The gases were regulated so as to maintain the hydrogen flame until nearly all the chlorine had been combined ; then the palladium was allowed to cool and the hydrogen was turned off just before the flame died out .
The hydrogen chloride , as it was formed in the flame , was dissolved by water standing in the globe , which was kept cool by ice .
A little hydrogen chloride was formed by the action of the water-vapour on the chlorine in the flame , a corresponding amount of oxygen being liberated .
This oxygen was determined in the analysis of the residual gases , which contained , besides traces of air , the small quantity of hydrogen which filled the capillary tube between the tap and the jet when the flame was extinguished , and any that might escape unburnt from the flame .
The chlorine remaining unburnt in the globe was about 2 per cent , of that burnt .
This unburnt chlorine , as gas and in solution , was determined by breaking thin glass bulbs containing potassium iodide .
The residual gases having been pumped out ( and any iodine vapour caught by a wash-bottle ) , the liberated iodine was determined by standard thiosulphate in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide .
In the calculation of the unburnt chlorine the atomic weight of chlorine was assumed to be 35T95 , and the atomic weight of iodine 126'015 .
In each experiment we burnt between 11 and 13 litres of each gas .
The balance , by Oertling , was fixed on a stone pedestal in an underground cellar .
The vibrations of the pointer were read by a telescope , Gauss ' method of reversals being used .
The chlorine and hydrogen bulbs were counterpoised on the balance by bulbs of the same glass and of nearly the same displacement , and the small weights employed in the weighings were reduced to a vacuum standard .
The following were the corrected weights of hydrogen and of chlorine burnt in the several experiments:\#151 ; Chlorine combined Hydrogen burnt , Chlorine burnt , with unit weight in grammes .

In the whole of these nine experiments 91786 grammes of hydrogen combined with 323,0403 grammes of chlorine , hence the equivalent weight of chlorine , calculated in mass , is 35195 .
The number we have obtained for the atomic weight of chlorine is appreciably higher than that calculated by F. W. Clarke from the previous determinations , and is slightly higher than Stas ' value:\#151 ; Clarke 's calculation .
