~D~ ~~ AB~~ EAE~ F~ The Solutions of three Chorographic Problems , by a Member of the Philosophical Society of Oxford .
THE three following Problems may occur at Sea , in finding the distance and position of Rocks , Sands , &amp;c. from the shore ; or in surveying the Sea Coast ; when only two objects whose distance from each other is known , can be seen at one station : but especially they may be useful to one , that would make a Map of a Country by a Series of Triangles derived from one or more measured Bases ; which is the most exact way of finding the bearing and distance of places from each other , and thence their true Longitude and Latitude ; and may consequently occur to one that would in that manner measure a Degree on the Earth .
The First Problem ( Fig. 1 .
and 2 .
) There are two objects B and C , whose distance BC is known , and there are two stations at A &amp; E , where the objects B , C being visible , &amp; the stations one from another , the Angles BA C , BA E , AE B , AE C , are known by Observation , ( which may be made with an ordinary Surveying Semicircle , or Crostaff , or if the objects be beyond the view of the naked Ey , with a Telescopic Quadrant ) to find the distances or lines AB , AC , AE , EC .
Construction .
In each of the triangles BA E , CA E , two angles at A , E , being known , the third is also known : then take any line ~~ at pleasure , on which constitute the triangles ~~ ~ , ~~~ respectively equiangular to the triangles BA E , AE C ; join ~ ~ .
Then upon BC constitnte the triangles BC A , BCE equiangular to the corresponP pp dent dent triangles ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , join A E , and the thing is manifestly done .
The Calculation .
Assuming ~~ of any number of parts , in the triangles ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , the angles being given , the sides ~ ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ , ~~ may be found by Trigonometry : then in the Triangle ~~ ~ , having the angle ~~ ~ , and the legs ~ ~ , ~ ~ , we may find ~ ~ .
Then ~ ~ .
BC~~ ~ .
BA~~ ~ .
BE~~ ~ .
CA~~ ~ .
C E. The second Problem ( Fig. 3 &amp; 4 .
) Three objects B , C , D , are given , or ( which is the same ) the sides , and consequently angles of the triangle BCD are given ; also there are 2 points or stations A , E , such , that at A may be seen the three points B , C , E , but not D ; and at the station , E , may be seen A , C , D , but not B , that is the angles BA C , BA E , AE C , AE D , ( and consequently EA C , AE C , ) are known by observation : to find the lines A B , A C , A E , E C , E D. Construction .
Take any line ~~ at pleasure , and at its extremities make the angles ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , equal to the correspondent observed anglesE A C , EA B , AE C , AE D. Produce ~ ~ , ~ ~ , til they meet in ~ , join ~ ~ ; then upon CB describe ( according to 33 .
3 .
Eucl ) a Segment of a circle , that may contain an angle =~~ ~ ; and upon CD describe a Segment of a circle capable of an angle =~~ ~ ; suppose F the common section of these 2 circles ; join F B , F C , F D ; then from the point C , draw forth the lines C A , C E , so that the angle FCA may be =~~ ~ , and FCE=~~ ~ ; so A , E , the common sections of C A , C E , with F B , F D , will be the points required , from whence the rest is easily deduced .
The Calculation .
Assuming ~~ of any number , in the triangles ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ , all the angles being given , with the side ~~ assumed , sum 'd , the sides ~ ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ , wil be known ; then in the triangle ~~ ~ , the angle ~~~ with the legs ~ ~ , ~~ being known , the angles ~~ ~ , ~~~ with the side ~~ will be known : then as for the rest of the work in the other figure , the triangle BCD having all its sides and angles known , and the angles BF C , BF D , being equal to the found ~~ ~ , ~~ ~ ; how to find F B , F C , FD by Calculation ( and also Protraction ) has been shown by Mr Collins ( in Phil. Transact n. 69 p. 2093 .
) as to all its cases , which may therefore supersede my showing any other way .
But here it must be noted , that if the sum of the observed angles , BA E , AE D , is 180 degrees : then AB and ED cannot meet , because they are parallel , and consequently the given solution cannot take place ; for which reason I here subjoin another .
Another Solution .
Upon BC ( Fig. 5 .
) describe a segment BAC of a circle , so that the angle of the segment , may be equal to the observed ~~~ ~ , ( which as above quoted is shown 33 .
3 .
Euclid ) and upon CD describe a segment CED of a circle , capable of an angle equal to the observed CE D ; from C draw the diameters of these circles C G , C H ; then upon CG describe a segment of a circle GF C , capable of an angle equal to the observed ~AE C ; likewise upon CH describe a circles segment CF H , capable of an angle equal to the 'observed CA E : suppose F the common section of the two last circles HF C , GF C , join F H , cutting the circle HEC in E , join also F G , cutting the circle GAC in A : I say that A , E , are the points required .
Dem : For the ~BAC is =~~~ by construction of the segment , also the angles CE H , CA G , are right , because each exists in a semicircle : therefore a circle being described upon CF as a diameter , wil pass thro E , A ; ThereP pp2 fore fore the angle CA E= ~CF E=C F H= ( by construction ) to the observed angle ~~ ~ .
In like manner the ~CE A= CF A=C F G= observed angle ~~ ~ .
If the stations A , E fall in a right line with the point C ; the lines G A , HE being parallel , cannot meet : but in this case the problem is indeterminate and capable of infinite Solutions .
For as before upon CG describe a Segment of a circle capable of the observed ~~~ ~ , and upon C H , describe a Segment capable of the observed ~~ ~ : then thro C , draw a line any way cutting the circles in A , E , these points wil answer the question .
The Third Problem .
Four points B , C , D , F , ( Fig. 6 .
) or the 4 sides of a quadrilateral , with the angles comprehended are given ; also there are 2 stations A and E such , that at A , only B , C , E are visible , and at E only A , D , F , that is , the angles BA C , BA E , AE D , DEF are given : to find the places of the two points A , E ; and consequently , the lengths of the lines A B , A C , A E , E D , E F. Construction .
Upon BC ( by 33 .
3.Eucl .
) describe a segment of a circle , that may contain an angle equal to the observed angle BA C , then from C draw the chord C M , or a line cutting the circle in M , so that the angle BCM may be equal to the supplement of the observed angle BA E , i. e. its residue to 180 degrees .
In like manner on DF describe a segment of a circle , capable of an angle equal to the observed DE F , and from D draw the chord D N , so that the angle FDN may be equal to the supplement of the observed angle AE F , join M N , cutting the 2 circles in A , E : I say A , E , are the two points required .
Dem : Join A B , A C , E D , E F , then is the ~MAB=~ BCM ( by 21 .
3 .
Eucl : ) = supplement of the observed ~BAE by construction , therefore the constructed ~BAE is equal to that which was observed .
Also the ~BAC of the segment , is by construction of the Segment , equal to the observed ~BA C. In like manner the constructed angles AE F , and DE F , are equal to the correspondent observed angles AE F , DE F , therefore A , E are the points required .
The Calculation .
In the Triangle BC M , the ~BCM ( = supplement of BA E ) and ~BMC ( = BA C ) are given , with the side B C ; thence MC may be found ; in like manner .
DN in the ~DNF may be found .
But the ~MC D)= BCD --B C M ) is known with its legs M C , C D , therefore its base M D , and ~MDC may be known .
Therefore the ~MDN ( = CD F--C D M--F D N ) is known , with its legs M D , D N ; thence MN with the angles DM N , DN M , will be known .
Then the ~CMA ( =~ DMC +DM N ) is known , with the ~MAC ( = MAB +BA C ) and MC before found ; therefore MA and AC wil be known .
In like manner in the triangle ED N. the angles E , N , with the side DN being known , the sides E N , ED will be known ; therefore AE ( = MN -M A--E N ) is known .
Also in the triangle AB C , the ~A with its sides B C , CA being known , the side AB will be known , with the ~BC A ; so in the triangle OF D , the ~E with the sides , E D , DF being known , OF wil be found , with the ~ED F. Lastly in the triangle AC D , the ~ACD ( =B C D--B C A ) with its legs A C , CD being known , the side AD wil be known , and in like manner EC in the triangle ED C. Note that , in this problem , as also in the first and second , if the two stations fall in a right line with either of the given objects : the locus of A , or E , being a circle , the particular point of A , or E , cannot be determined from the things given .
As to the other cases of this third problem , wherein A , and E , may shift places , i. e. only D , F , E may be viP pp3 sible sible at A , and only A , B , C at E ; or wherein B , D , E , may be visible at A , and only C , F , A , at E ; or wherein A may be of one side of the quadrilateral , and E on the other ; or one of the stations within the quadrilateral , and the other without it : I shall for brevitys sake omit the figures , and diversity of the Signs + and in the calculation , and presume that the Surveyor wil easily direct himself in those cases , by what has been said .
The Solution of this third problem is general , and serves also for both the precedent .
For suppose C , D the same point in the last figure , and it gives the solution of the second problem : but if B , C , be supposed the same points with D , F , by proceeding as in the last , you may directly solve the first problem .
