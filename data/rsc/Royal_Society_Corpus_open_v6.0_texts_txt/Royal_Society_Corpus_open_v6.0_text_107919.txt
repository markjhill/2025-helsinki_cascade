On my attention being called to this comet during the last year , more than seven years after I had observed it , I placed the above observations in the hands of Mr. THOMAS HENDERSON , of Edinburgh , who has furnished me with the following remarks , which I transcribe verbatim , and request you will communicate to the Royal Society in the same manner .
" From the observations , " says Mr. HENDERSON , " made at Rio de Janeiro , by Captain ROBERTSON and Lieutenant DRINKWATER , on the second comet of 1822 , I have obtained the following position of that comet referred to the ecliptic , and cleared of the effect of refraction , but not of parallax , aberration , nutation , or precession .
Those positions have been adopted which represent the observed angular distances with the minimum of error , as found by the method of least squares .
' The errors of observation , on the differences between the observed and computed angular distances , do not exceed five minutes of space , except on the Mean solar time at Rio Apparent Apparent latitude .

" The following elements of the comet 's parabolic orbit have been obtained by OLBERS ' method of computation , founded upon the observations of June 19th , 22nd , and 24th .

The other errors , it may be remarked , are not greater than what might have been expected from the uncertainty of the observations , and great latitude of the comet , when the errors in longitude are apparently much increased , from being reckoned upon a small circle .
" On comparing the foregoing elements , computed from Captain ROBERTSON and Lieutenant DRINKWATER'S observations , with those deduced by M. HULINGENSTEIN from the observations made in Europe , referred to at page 2 , it will be seen that the differences between them are wonderfully small , considering the different instruments used by the observers in the two hemispheres .

But without entering into such an investigation , enough has been already stated to show that the instruments and other means in the possession of every naval officer , are sufficient to enable him to determine , with considerable accuracy , the orbit of any comet which is not too faint for being observed with the usual reflecting instruments used at sea .
" Before concluding this communication , it may not be improper to mention that about the same time that we were making the observations above detailed , on the " second comet of 1822 , " we were fortunate enough to see the celebrated comet of ENCKE , but it had not sufficient light to enable us to observe it in the same manner that we did the other .
We were therefore obliged to content ourselves with observing it through an ordinary telescope .
But , as it does not appear that on this return of ENCKE'S comet to the neighbourhood of the earth , it was seen in any other part of the world , except at Paramatta , the following notes of what we saw of it at Rio de Janeiro , may not be altogether uninteresting , though probably of little or no value to astronomers .

At 6h 30m P.M. Observed the comet calculated by Professor ENCKE , in the constellation Gemini .
It was only seen through a telescope , and appeared like a faint nebula of a round form .
There were two stars of the 5th 7 or 6th magnitude near it , with which it formed a right-angled triangle ; the right angle at the northernmost of the two stars , and the comet to the westward .

Observations of the Second Comet of 1822 , made at Rio de Janeiro .
By Lieutenant ( now Captain ) WILLIAM ROBERTSON , R.N. Communicated in a Letter to Captain BASIL HALL , F.R.S. Read June 17 , 1830 .
I SHALL feel obliged to you to lay before the Royal Society the following observations , which , with the assistance of Lieut. CHARLES DRINKWATER , R.N. , I made upon the second comet of 1822 , " as it is called .
They were made at Rio de Janeiro , when I was Lieutenant of His MAJESTY'S ship Creole , under the orders of Commodore Sir THOMAS HARDY ; but as the means I had in my possession for making such nice observations were not great , I did not imagine the results could be of much value , till I accidentally gained information of the following remarks in Baron ZAcH 's Journal , vol. vi .
page 596 .
6 " Cette comet , comme nous l'avons dit dans notre Vme cahier , page 481 , n'a ete que tres peu observ6e , a cause de son mouvement fort-rapide en d6clinaison australe ; elle s'est par consequent bient6t soustraite a nos regards , pour se montrer peut-etre avec plus d'6clat aux antipodes .
Nous n'avons regu d'autres observations que celles que nous avons d6ja publi6es dans notre cahier pr6c6dent .
Probablement l'orbite de cet astre passager nous restera inconnue pour toujours , a moins que MM .
FALLOW , RUMKER , ou un autre BASIL I-ALL , no parviennent ha observer dans l'hemisphere austral .
Mais la correspondence astronomique des deux hemispheres n'est pas encore bien 6tablie * .
" The above allusion to your observations on the comet which we observed together at Valparaiso in 1821 , and which are published in the Philosophical Transactions , induces me to address this communication to you , to be laid before the Society , if you consider it worthy of that honour .
M. PONS , it appears , ( ZACH , vol. vi .
p. 385 ) first discovered this comet on the 31st of May , about two o'clock in the morning .
It was then at the distance of 2- ?
from the star f Piscium , 5 ?
from g Aquarii , nearly in 340 ?
of JR , and in 2- ?
north declination .
As M. PONS had no instruments ready to observe the comet , it does not appear to have been further noticed till the 8th of June , by Professor CATUREGLI at Bologna , and two days afterwards by M. GAMBART at Marseilles .
Owing to its extreme feebleness , however , Baron ZACH does not appear to think the observations at Bologna very exact .

From these few observations , M. HULINGENSTEIN has deduced the orbit in SCHUMACHER'S Astronomische Nachrichten , vol. iv .
pp. 533 , 534 , and which I have copied at the end of this letter .
But as the above observations comprehend only a very small portion of the orbit , these elements are susceptible of improvement from observations made during a longer interval .
The following are the whole of the observations which were made by Mr. DRINKWATER and myself on this comet .
2 On the evening of the 18th of June it was first observed , with the naked eye , near the star Canopus , and though it had been in conjunction with the sun on that day , its great southern latitude permitted it to be seen after sunset .
Of course we did not know that it had been observed in Europe , and immediately proceeded to determine its position by the only means of which we had command .
By means of a reflecting sextant , we took its angular distances from known fixed stars .
The faintness of the comets light , and the uncertainty in estimating its apparent centre , presented considerable difficulties in the employment of this method of observation .
It was attempted to diminish the errors which , no doubt , arose from this cause , by taking the angular distances from four stars , and these observations were repeated , as often as the weather permitted , on the succeeding nights .
In this manner angular distances were obtained on the evenings of the 18th , 19th , 22nd , 23rd , and 24th of June , 1822 ; after which the increasing brightness of the moonlight , and the faintness , prevented its being accurately observed with the sextant , and eventually obliterated it altogether .
During the whole of the above period , the comet presented the same appearance as it seems to have done in Europe , -namely , that of a nebulous mass , without either tail or nucleus .
I was of course inclined to believe , at first , that these observations would be of little value , as I did not doubt that the comet must have been observed from other places in the southern hemisphere , with more efficient instruments than mine .
I hope it may still prove so ; but , after repeated inquiries , I have not been able to learn that the comet was seen in any other quarter of that portion of the globe .
Nor , indeed , was it until its orbit had been computed from my observations by Mr. THOMAS HENDERSON of Edinburgh , that the comet was suspected to have been one previously observed in Europe .
This discovery , it will perhaps be thought , gives a new value to the observations which we made ; for though the means used were deficient in that precision which is desirable , the observations , taken in conjunction with those made in Europe , embrace a far greater extent of the comet 's orbit than either series do alone .
And in the present state of cometary astronomy it is impossible to foretell the value which may one day be assigned to observations which at present appear to have little interest .
The following is a faithful transcript of the original observations as they B2 3
