) Considerable difference of opinion still prevails regarding the nature of the opsonic substances present in normal serum .
Wright , Bulloch and Atkin , etc. , uphold the view that the opsonin of normal serum is a simple thermolabile body .
Muir , on the other hand , regards the opsonin as a body which behaves like complement , while Dean holds that it is essentially thermostable and in all probability co-operates in its action with a thermolabile complement .
The demonstration of anti-bodies by complement-deviation experiments ( Bordet , Gengou , Pfeiffer and Friedberger , etc. ) has recently proved fruitful in connection with the bacteriolysins , haemolysins , precipitins of immune sera , and the following experiments were designed to test whether , by a similar method applied to phagocytosis , the presence in normal serum of opsonic amboceptors could be demonstrated :\#151 ; Experiment I. Normal human serum was heated for 30 mins , at 60 ' C. ( denoted " A " ) .
A very thick emulsion of tubercle bacilli in 1 :1000 salt solution was added in equal volumes to " A " and kept in contact therewith for 1 hr .
30 mins , at 37 ' C. The mixture was then centri-fugalised ( 7000 revolutions per minute ) for 1 hr .
, and the supernatant fluid pipetted off ( denoted " B " ) .
Equal volumes of " B " and fresh normal human serum were now mixed and kept in contact at 37 ' C. for 1 hr .
( final fluid denoted " T " ) .
The steps employed in the preparation of the control fluid were essentially similar to the above .
Thus , heated normal serum was added in equal volume to salt solution ( instead of to tubercle emulsion ) and the mixture kept in contact for 1 hr .
30 mins , at 37 ' C. Equal volumes of this mixture and fresh normal serum were now taken , and retained in contact for 1 hr .
at 37 ' ( control fluid so obtained denoted " C " ) .
The opsonic contents of " T " and " C " were now compared in the usual way , fresh tubercle and staphylococcal emulsions being emplo yed .
The result was as follows :\#151 ; Bacilli per leucocyte .
Test fluid " T " + leucocytes+B .

3*57 Inhibitory Action upon , etc. The difference between T " and " C " was sufficiently striking , but it seemed desirable to re-test the two fluids with stronger emulsions of tuberculosis and staphylococcus .
Accordingly , after standing in the cold room over-night at a temperature of 2 ' C. , they were again compared , with the following result:\#151 ; Bacilli per leucocyte .
Test fluid " T " + leucocytes + B. tuberculosis ... ... .
0'8 Control fluid " C " 4-leucocytes + B. tuberculosis ... 4*5 Cocci per leucocyte .

24'5 Thus the ratio of " C " to " T " in the case of tubercle rose after 16 hrs .
from 4'6 : 1 to 5'6 : 1 , and in the case of staphylococcus from 2'5 : 1 to 6'2 : 1 .
Experiment II .
Fluids " T " and contents compared .
" C " were prepared in the way described above and their opsonic Result:\#151 ; Bacilli per leucocyte .

9*0 The ratio of " C " to " T " thus rose after 16 hrs .
from 2*3 :1 to 7'7 :1 in the case of B. tuberculosis , while in the case of staphylococcus it remained practically the same .
Experiment III .
In this experiment the heated serum and the salt solution were emulsified directly with B. tuberculosis in an agate mortar .
Result:\#151 ; Bacilli per leucocyte .

Instead of B. tuberculosis , staphylococci were brought in contact with heated normal serum .
The further steps in the preparation of " T " and , " C " remained the same .
Result:\#151 ; Inhibitory Action upon Phagocytosis , etc. Cocci per leucocyte .

) The difference between " C " and " T " is thus relatively small .
A similar experiment was made , in which staphylococci , which had been heated at 60 ' C. for 1 hr .
30 mins .
, were passed through normal heated serum .
Result:\#151 ; Cocci per leucocyte .

In view of the consistent results obtained with tubercle bacilli in the first series of experiments , it was important to determine whether saline solutions , through which bacilli have been passed , exhibited a similar inhibitory action on fresh normal serum .
' A saline solution ( 1 : 1000 ) was digested at 37 ' with tubercle bacilli for 1 hr .
30 mins , and then centrifugalised .
The extract so obtained was added in equal volume to fresh normal serum and kept at 37 ' C. for 1 hr .
A control fluid was made by digesting the normal serum with salt solution ( 1 : 1000 ) .
The contents in tubercular opsonin of these two fluids were then compared , with the following result:\#151 ; Bacilli per leucocyte .

solution have , therefore , little , if any , inhibitory action on the tubercular and staphylococcal opsonins of fresh normal serum .
Conclusions .
Heated normal serum , through which tubercle bacilli have been passed , exerts a marked inhibitory action on the tubercular and staphylococcal opsonins of fresh normal serum .
Such an action points to the presence in normal serum of opsonic amboceptors , the combination of which with the free receptors thrown off from the tubercle bacilli deviates the complement from the fresh normal serum , and thus inhibits phagocytosis .
Further experiments of this nature are in progress .
