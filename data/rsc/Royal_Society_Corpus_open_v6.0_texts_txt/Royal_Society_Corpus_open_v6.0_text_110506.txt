" Some Account of the appearances of the Solar Spots , as seen from Hereford , on the 15th and 16th of May , 1836 , during and after the Solar Eclipse .
" By Henry Lawson , Esq. , in a Letter to Sir Henry Ellis , K.G.H. , F.R.S. , by whom it was communicated to the Society .
The spots on the sun 's disc , at the period referred to , were very numerous ; and one of great size , being many thousand miles in dia ?
meter , in particular attracted attention , from its penumbra presenting an appearance similar to a sky filled with small flocculcnt white clouds , perfectly distinct from one another - , while on two sides were seen large masses of darker clouds , which seemed as if pouring their substance into the central chasm .
The figure of the solar spots did not undergo any perceptible change of form during the progressive pas ?
sage of the edge of the moon over them .
