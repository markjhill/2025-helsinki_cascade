] The author first details the results of some experiments made with a view to ascertain whether frogs , that had been completely frozen , could , under any circumstances , be restored to life , which he found never to be the case when the brain had been entirely congealed , the substance of which , after such process , never regains its former appearance , but is dissolved into a watery fluid , mixed with some gelatinous matter .
In the act of freezing , the -human brain was found to suffer a similar decomposition ; the molecule of a pullet 's egg is also resolved during the process of freezing into materials corresponding with those of the brain , and the testicular secretion was found to be similarly constituted , and in no instance to contain animalcules , as Leuenhoek and other more recent authors have affirmed .
Magnified drawings , executed by Mr. Bauer , of the various substances described in this paper , accompany the communication .
