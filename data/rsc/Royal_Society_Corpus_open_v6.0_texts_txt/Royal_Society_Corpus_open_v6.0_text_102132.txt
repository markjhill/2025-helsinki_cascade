A further list of the Specific Gravitys of bodies , being in proportion as the following numbers .
PUmp water .
1000 .
Fir dry 546 .
Elm dry 600 Cedar dry 613 Walnut tree dry 631 Crab tree meanly dry 765 Ash meanly dry , and of the outside lax part of the tree 734 Ash more dry , but about the heart 845 Maple dry 755 Yew of a Knot or root 16 years old 760 Beech meanly dry 854~ Oak very dry , almost worm eaten 753 Oak of the outside sappy part , felld a year since 870 Oak dry , but of a very sound close texture 929 The same tried another time932 Logwood 913 Claret 993 Moil cider not clear 1017 Sea-water settled clear 1028 College plain Ale the same 1028 Urine 1030 Milk 1031 Box the same 1031 Redwood the same 1031 Sack 1033 Beer Vinegar 1034 Pitch 1150 Pit-Coal of Staffordsh , 1240 Speckled wood of Virginia 1313 Lignum Vitae 1327 Stone bottle 1777 Ivory 1826 Alabaster 1872 Brick 1979 Heddington stone , the soft lax kind 2029 Burford stone , an old dry piece 2049 Paving stone a hard sort from about Blaidon 2460 Flint 2542 Glass of a quart bottle 2666 Black Italian marble 2704 White Italian marble tried twice 2707 White Italian marble of another sort of a visibly 2718 closer texture Block tin 7321 Copper 8843 Lead 11345 Quicksilver 14019 Quicksilver 13593 The last Experiment was tried with another quantity of quicksilver , which had been used in water in the preceding experiment : however I rather trust the last , for that I found a small mistake ( tho'here in the calculation allowed for , ) in the weight of the glass containg the Quicksilver in the trial before .
The solids here mentioned , were examined Hydrostatically by weighing them in air and water ; but the fluids , by weighing an equal portion of each in a glass holding about a quart .
The numbers show the proportion of gravity of equal portions of these bodies : but if of these bodies we take portions equally heavy , their magnitudes will be reciprocally proportional to their correspondent numbers .
e. g. a cubic foot of water is to a cubic foot of Alabaster in gravity as 1000 to 1872 ; but a pound weight of water , is to a pound weight Alabaster in magnitude , as 1872 to 1000 .
So that knowing by the former table , the weight of a cubic foot of water , and by this , the proportion in gravity betwixt water and Alabaster ; we may by the rule of 3 find the weight of a cubic foot of Alabaster , and so of any other of these bodies ; or we may know their magnitude by knowing their gravity .
So that an irregular piece or quantity of these bodies being offered , it is but weighing them , and we may know their just magnitude without farther trouble .
