] Dr. Brinkley , in this communication , states a number of observations made with the floating collimator of Captain Kater , as applied to the Dublin circle , in which he observes it affords the means of ascertaining the index error with as great precision as by reversion , and that in several points of view it is undoubtedly superior to that method .
The reversing principle of the Dublin circle , he observes , serves very conveniently for a measure of the accuracy of the floating collimator , and serves to show very satisfactorily , that applying this instrument to any circle will introduce no error depending on the collimator itself .
The author regards the results of these observations as highly favourable to the principle of the collimator , which he considers as a new astronomical power , and as even belonging to a more advanced era of practical astronomy than the present .
The observations consist of , First , the mean zenith distances of a number of stars , deduced solely by the application of the index correction , as determined by the collimator .
In this case the circle was used as a mural circle , or rather as two mural circles , having been used with its face east and also west .
Secondly , the inclination of the line of collimation of the collimator , as determined on , different days .
As this appears to have been very permanent ( though such permanence is not essential in practice ) , he concludes that the collimator is applicable to the most powerful instruments .
Thirdly , the index corrections as determined by the collimator .
Fourthly , the index corrections as determined by reversion from several stars .
