' On the Anatomy and Physiology of certain structures in the Orbit , not previously described .
" By J. M. Ferrall , Esq. , M.R.I.A. Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie , Bart. , F.R.S. The author describes a distinct fibrous tunic , which he terms the tunica vaginalis oculi , continuous with the tarsal cartilages and ligaments in front , and extending backwards to the bottom , or apex of the orbit ; thus completely insulating the globe of the eye , and keeping it apart from the muscles which move it .
The eye-ball is connected with this fibrous investment by a cellular tissue , so lax and delicate as to permit an easy and gliding motion between them .
The use which the author assigns to this tunic is that of protecting the eye-ball from the pressure of its muscles while they are in action .
This tunic is perforated at its circumference , and a few lines posterior to its anterior margin , by six openings , through which the tendons of the muscles emerge in passing to their insertions , and over which , as overpullies , they play in their course .
A consequence of this structure is that the recti muscles become capable of giving rotatory motions to the eye without occasioning its retraction within the orbit , and without exerting injurious pressure on that organ .
In those animals which are provided with a proper retractor muscle ,
