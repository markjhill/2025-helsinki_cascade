The following papers were read : " A Proof ( by means of a series ) that every Number is composed of 4 Square Numbers , or less , without reference to the properties of Prime Numbers .
" By Sir Frederick Pollock , Lord Chief Baron , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received December 18 .
The paper contains a proof , that if every number of the form 8n+4 is composed of 4 odd squares , then every number whatever must be composed of 4 square numbers or less ; also a proof of the converse of this , viz. that if every number is composed of 4 square numbers or less , then every number of the form 8n +4 must be composed of 4 odd squares .
It is then proposed to show that every number of the form 8n +-4 is composed of 4 odd squares , by taking a number of the form 8n + 4 , viz. an odd square +3 , and showing that 8n+4 in that case is divisible into 4 odd squares ( other than the odd square and 1 , 1 , 1 ) ; thus 16n2+8n+1 is a form that includes every odd square , and 16n2+ 8n+4 is divisible into 4n0 + 4n 1 , 4n-+ 4n 1 , 4n ' + 4n + 1 , 4n T 4n + 1 .
8 is then added , and the sum is shown to be still divisible into 4 odd squares ; and again 8 , and so on , until by successive additions of 8+ 8+8 , &amp;c. , the quantity added to 16na+ 8n becomes equal to the original term with which the operation commenced .
The odd squares +3 form the series 4 , 12 , 28 , 52 , 84 , &amp;c. ; and if the successiveadditions reachth the tird or some higher term , and also if the sum added to 16 n+ ?
8n be equal to the term with which .
the operation commenced- , it is contended the following term may be attained , and so on , and every number of the form 8n +4 will be composed of 4 odd squares .
The paper concludes by a suggestion that the method is applicable to several other similar problems .
