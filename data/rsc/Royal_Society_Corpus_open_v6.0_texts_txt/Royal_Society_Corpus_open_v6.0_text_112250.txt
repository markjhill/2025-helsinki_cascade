( Abstract .
) In this paper the deformation of a homogeneous elastic solid bounded by two surfaces which are concentric spherical surfaces when the solid is free from strain , is investigated under each of the two following conditions : I. The displacement of every point of each surface is given .
II .
The force per unit of area is given in magnitude and direction at each point of each surface .
The formulae are applied to determine the deformation produced in the earth by the tide-generating forces of the moon and sun , on certain definite hypotheses as to the rigidity of the earth .
Thus the theoretical results used in a previous communication by the same author , " On the Rigidity of the Earth " ( Proceedings of the Royal Society , May 15 , 1862 ) , are proved .
