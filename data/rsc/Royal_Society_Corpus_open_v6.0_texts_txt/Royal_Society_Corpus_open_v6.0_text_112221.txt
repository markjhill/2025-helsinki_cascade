( Abstract .
) When a plane-polarized beam of light is incident on a polished surface at a certain angle of incidence , and polarized in a certain azimuth , the reflected beam of light is circularly polarized .
The tangent of this angle of incidence is called by the author the Coefficient of Refraction , and upon it appears to depend the brilliancy of a polished surface .
The cotangent of the azimuth of incident polarization is called the Coefficient of Reflexion , and upon it appears to depend the rich lustre , strikingly exhibited in polished copper and gold .
The paper contains an account of the experiments made to determine , with precision , these constants for the following substances : A. Transparent Bodies .

The determination of the optical constants of these substances leads to many interesting conclusions ; among which the following may be stated:1 .
That transparent bodies , as well as metals , possess a coefficient of reflexion , which is sometimes very sensible , although there are bodies in which it is very small .
2 .
That Silver is the only substance which possesses the qualities of brilliancy and lustre , represented by the coefficients of refraction and reflexion , in a high degree .
3 .
Of the metals which have high brilliancy and little lustre may be named Mercury , Palladium , Zinc , and Iron .
4 .
Of the metals which have high lustre and little brilliancy there are only two , Gold and Copper .
5 .
Results of the highest interest appear from an examination of the optical constants of the alloys of copper and zinc , which cannot be given in an abstract .
6 .
In the details of the several experiments , the author calls attention to several remarkable laws , or indications of laws , which appear to him to require some notice from theorists .
a. When the azimuth of the incident beam is less than the circular limit , the axis major of the reflected ellipse , at the principal incidence , lies in the plane of incidence ; but when the azimuth is greater than the circular limit , it is perpendicular to the plane of incidence , and as the incidence varies , the axis major twice approaches to a minimum distance from that plane .
6 .
There appears to the author to be some indication in the experiments on metals , that the quantity known to theorists as ( ) is not a function of the incidence only ; a conclusion which , if correct , would require the intervention of a third wave suppressed , or some such theoretical supposition , to account for it .
