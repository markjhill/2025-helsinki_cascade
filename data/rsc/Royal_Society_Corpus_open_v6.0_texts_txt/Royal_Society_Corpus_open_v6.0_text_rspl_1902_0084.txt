( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , S.W. ) In the course of investigation of the effects of light and of electrical excitation on the frog 's eyeball , I came to the conclusion that tissues other than retinal are coeffective in the response to strong induction hocks , and proceeded therefore to look for blaze-currents in other iving tissues.* # ' Phil. Trans.,5 B , 1901 , vol. 194 , p. 185 .
The following extract from my note book of 1900 gives instances in which the reaction of the anterior half of the eyeball was observed to exceed that of the posterior half .

] times found to give a larger response than the posterior half , and the present observations proeeed from an attempt to determine the principally effective part in such reaction .
And I may state at once , as my chief conclusion , that it is the crystalline lens .
The eyes upon which the determination was made , in the first instance , were those of fish\#151 ; whiting and mackerel\#151 ; by reason of the fact that these were for a season at my disposal quite fresh from the sea .
I subsequently made similar observations on the eyes of octopus , on sheep 's eyes fresh from the slaughter-house , and on the eyes of recently killed cats and rabbits ; also on the eyes of an owl .
The point that was most striking in these first observations was the great endurance of the reaction in the crystalline lens as compared with its rapid disappearance from the remaining tissues of the eyeball and from the skin , and with the rapid disappearance of the direct electrical excitability of muscle .
I should , as an outcome of these observations , look for the last sign of life of a fish by testing the crystalline lens , whereas in the case of man I should test a piece of .skin .
The reaction\#151 ; as far as I have yet seen\#151 ; has been completely absent from frozen fish ( salmon ) as received from London fishmongers .
Its normal direction in the lens is " negative , " i.e. , from external to internal pole .
It is abolished by heat ( 70 ' ) and by compression .
My first experiments with the eyes of fish were to ascertain on the entire eyeball what type of blaze reactions\#151 ; if any\#151 ; is manifested The results were as follows :\#151 ; Exp. 1 .

The lens of the frog 's eye is inconveniently small , nevertheless , with due care , typical effects can be observed upon it , viz. , negative responses* to both directions of excitation , the homodrome exceeding the antidrome response .
The normal and typical response of the entire eyeball was , as previously stated , positive to both directions of excitation .

Of five successive cod 's heads supplied to me in London as fresh , all but one gave responses of typical character , as illustrated by the photogram ; in every case , however , the lenses of the two eyes were # Throughout this paper , 'positive current signifies current through the ( eyeball or ) lens directed from posterior to anterior surface , and negative current the reverse of this .
In one experiment ( Exp. 13 , with reversed zincs ) the direction of the readings unavoidably breaks this conventional rule .
And , indeed , in other experiments this rule has occasionally been broken , as in Exp. 13 , in order to set aside conceivable fallacies of the electrodes , kept in an invariable relation to each other\#151 ; e.gan invariable inequality between them , or a gravitation current of liquid from A to B , or a constant difference of area , and therefore of current-density at A and B. " Blaze-currents " of the Crystalline Lens .

] unequally good ; in three instances one of the lenses gave no response , and in one of these three instances the eyeball was filled with blood .
I think the difference between the two eyes must have been due to the fish having been killed by stunning , or it may be that in transit to London one of the eyes had suffered compression .
But whatever the real cause of the difference may have been , the lenses of fish obtained in London were far less satisfactory than those of fish directly taken from the sea .
In the latter case , both lenses , if carefully removed , wrere equally effective ( provided the fish had not been stunned in the usual way on removal from the hook ) .
Similar effects are obtainable on the crystalline lens of the mammalian eye ; but it is essential to avoid any undue compression of the globe .
Thus I completely failed to observe any effect on the lens of eyes removed from the orbit of dogs and cats in the usual manner , also on the lens of sheep 's eyeballs brought fresh from the slaughterhouse .
But with lenses carefully removed from the eyes of a fresh sheep 's head and of a recently killed cat , typical and regular responses wrere obtained , which wrere abolished by intentional compression as well as by immersion in hot water ( 60 ' to 70 ' ) .
I think it desirable to give inextenso one experiment ( No. 13 ) to illustrate the precise nature of experimental evidence and the system on which it is taken down .
It is very easy to make sure of the direction of a current used for excitation in relation to a total or bipolar response , but it is not easy without a strictly systematic plan to make sure of this relation when a partial or unipolar response is under investigation .
It is advisable for the latter purpose to carefully verify the connections of the ABC key* so that directions of deflection may immediately signify directions of current between the points of investigation , and be noted accordingly in a legible form that can be readily reviewed .

The lens is submitted to compression , after which there is no response of any kind , either total or partial ; it is placed for a few minutes in hot water until coagulated white , and again tested without any response .
The temperature at which the first obvious sign of coagulation was observed was 38 ' .
The lens was completely white at 48 ' .
Beyond 50 ' no further increased whiteness could be seen .
I conclude from this and similar experiments\#151 ; 1 .
That a crystalline lens of suitable size is a good object upon which to study the nature of blaze-currents .
2 .
That a " blaze-current " is a physical sign of the " living " state .
3 .
That a blaze-current may be post-kathodic as well as post-anodic , antidrome as well as homodrome .
4 .
That the direction of blaze-currents in the lens is negative or ingoing , i.e. , from external or anterior to internal or posterior pole .

On [ Oct 23 , Indubitable response , negative to positive ( antidrome ) and negative to negative ( homodrome ) , to single shocks , was observed on the 4th day , absent on the 5th day .
Kesponse , negative to negative , with strong tetanisation in both pairs of directions , was still present on the 5th and 6th days .
But on the seventh day the only visible effects were of polarisation direction , i.e. , the lens was judged to be dead .

The unpolarisable electrodes A and B are applied to the intact corneae of the eyes of a decapitated pigeon .
Excitation is led in by A and B , the response is led out by AC or by BC ( previously compensated ) .

Babbit 's Eyes in situ.\#151 ; A similar series of trials gave in each case a small outgoing effect at each eye , presumably clue to corneal response .
In the discussion , attention was drawn to the details of certain experiments\#151 ; viz. , Exps. 3 , 7 , and 20\#151 ; as being in disagreement with the general rule that the lens response is negative .
Exps. No. 3 and 7 were made before I had learned the importance of attending to the orientation of the lens .
Exp. 20 ( and Exp. 5 ) are instances of what , in my experience , have presented themselves as transitional types intermediate between the typical physiological response and the ordinary polarisation effects of exhausted or dead organs .
I have thought it possible that certain irregularities of response occasionally met with might have been due to unavoidable injury of the Retractor Lentis ( Campanula Halleri ) , described and figured by Beer.# After Exp. No. 7 , I was always careful to mark the external or corneal pole of the lens in situ by a speck of moist china clay , with which the clay end of electrode A was subsequently brought into contact ; the opposite pole rested on electrode B. I may take this opportunity of stating that the eyes of crabs and of lobsters gave ingoing blaze-currents ( from A to B ) to both directions of excitation .
