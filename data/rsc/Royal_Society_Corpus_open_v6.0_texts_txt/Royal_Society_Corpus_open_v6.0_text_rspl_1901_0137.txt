( Abstract .
) The observations here recorded were intended to bridge over in some degree the gap between the very low pressures ( below 1-5 mm. ) dealt with in a recent paper and pressures approaching the atmospheric for which the usual mercury column and cathetometer method is adequate .
The principal novelty consists in the use of two similar manometric gauges .
Pressures in the ratio of 1 : 2 are obtained by the use first of a single gauge and secondly of the two gauges connected in series .
The equality of the gauges is tested by observations upon them when combined in parallel .
The use of these gauges allows abundant accuracy in the measurement of the pressures , and the difficulties relate rather to the adequate determination of volumes and temperatures .
The results show that , to an accuracy of \gt ; { lh'\gt ; hydrogen , oxygen , and argon obey Boyle 's law .
In the case of nitrous oxide a deviation was observed in the direction that might be expected .
