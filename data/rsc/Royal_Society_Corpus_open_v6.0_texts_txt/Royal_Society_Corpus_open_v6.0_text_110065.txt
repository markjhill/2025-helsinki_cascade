] The first fact stated by Sir Everard Home in this paper is the analogy in structure between the hind foot of the Walrus and the ; foot of the Fly .
In both these is a very similar apparatus for producing a vacuum , so as to enable the animal to proceed upon smooth surfaces against gravity , by the adhesion of the feet thus effected ; there being two cups in the foot of the fly and one in that of the , walrus for this purpose .
Secondly , he notices the peculiar mode in which the bile in the walrus is collected in a reservoir , and thence forcibly impelled into the duodenum .
The third new fact which the author adduces , is the peculiar structure of the funis and placenta of the Seal .
In this animal the vessels forming the funis are not twisted ; their whole length is nine inches ; after passing three inches from the navel of the foetus they give off anastomosing branches , connected with it by three membranous folds , between which the blood-vessels are conveyed to the placenta .
This structure gives uncommon facility to the placental circulation , and makes it worth inquiry whether the same peculiarities exist in other marine animals .
Several illustrative drawings accompany this paper .
