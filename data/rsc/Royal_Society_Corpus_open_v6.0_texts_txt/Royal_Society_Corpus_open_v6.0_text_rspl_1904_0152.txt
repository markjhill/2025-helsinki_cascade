] In the publication of the results derived from a study of the Kensington photographic spectra of the 1898 eclipse , it was stated* that a fairly prominent line recorded near A 4686 , for which no terrestrial origin could be found , agreed closely in position with a well-marked line of unknown origin in one of the Kensington photographs of the spectrum from a helium tube .
In the helium photograph the position has been recently found from careful measures made on the lines 412097 , 4388*10 , 4713*25 , and the line in question , and subsequent use of Hartmann 's formula .
The resulting wave-length of the strange line was 4685*97 .
Similar measurements were made on the eclipse photographs , the fiducial lines used being 4508*5 ( pFe ) , 4584*0 ( jp Fe ) , and 4713*25 ( He ) .
The result gave 4685*90 .
The two calculated wave-lengths so nearly agree that it is very probable the line is of identical origin in the two cases .
The eclipse line is , moreover , of the same nature as the helium eclipse lines , long and sharply defined .
It would therefore seem that the line is due to a gas which is associated in some way with helium .
The line , however , only appears in one photograph of the helium spectrum , and whether this is due to the particular sample of helium used , or to some special condition of current which is conducive to the appearance \#166 ; of the strange line , it is impossible to say .
A line near the same position has been recorded by various spectroscopists in different celestial spectra .
The following table -contains the available records of the line in question :\#151 ; Spectrum .

] On the Stellar Line near \ 4648 .
547 It will be seen that the mean wave-length is in fairly good accord with that of the unknown terrestrial line 4685*97 .
The line , however , in the nebular and bright-line-star spectra is broad and ill-defined , and the estimated wave-lengths are probably somewhat uncertain , and not to be depended on so much as those obtained from spectra in which the line is sharply defined .
If in seeking the mean wavelength these probably less accurate wave-lengths be excluded , the result is 4685*9 , which is in very close agreement with the position of the terrestrial line .
Rydberg has shown that the stellar line near 4686\#151 ; associated with the new series discovered by Pickering in the spectrum of \#163 ; Puppis\#151 ; is probably the first line of the principal series furnished by hydrogen .
His calculated wave-length value for the line is 4687*88 , * which would appear to be about two tenth-metres in error , as the corresponding celestial line probably has , as is shown in the present note , a wavelength near 4685*9 .
In the light of this evidence for the probable identity of the terrestrial and stellar lines , it seems desirable to institute further research on the spectrum of helium under varying electrical conditions , with the object of possibly obtaining the terrestrial equivalents of the so-called new hydrogen series of \#163 ; Puppis .
DESCRIPTION OF PLATE .
The plate shows a comparison of the spectrum ( region 4450 to 4750 ) of the chromosphere , the helium spectrum containing the line 4686 , and that of \#163 ; Orionis ( Alnitamian ) .
The identity of position of the helium lines , and 4686 , with lines in the chromospheric and stellar spectra is clearly shown .
The fainter lines in the helium spectrum are all due to oxygen .
