is turned upon this rod , there is at first a sudden deflection of twenty magnetometer-scale-divisions to the left , the spot afterwards moving slowly and steadily towards the right .
When the light is shut off there occurs at once a jump of twenty divisions further towards the right before the spot begins to move back in the zero direction .
Some attempts have been made to repeat the experiments with light polarised by means of a Nmol 's prism ; but , either because the largest prism at my disposal was too small ( its aperture being barely 2 cm .
) , or because too much of the radiant energy was absorbed by the spar , I failed to get any magnetic effects whatever with the prism in either position .
[ Professor Silvanus Thompson has quite recently been kind enough to lend me a very large and excellent Nmol 's prism .
From a few experiments already made with this instrument it appears that the action of the light is quite independent of the plane of polarisation.\#151 ; * .

] , There can be no doubt whatever of the reality of the effects here described : they are perfectly distinct , and are at any time reproducible with certainty .
The only question is how much of them is primarily caused by the action of light , and how much by mere incidental change of temperature .
But taking all the circumstances into consideration , I think the evidence is in favour of the conclusion that the instantaneous magnetic change , which occurs when are prepared iron bar is illuminated , is purely and directly an effect of radiation .

" Recalescence of Iron .
" By J. Hopkinson , F.R.S. Received March 7 , 1889 .
Professor Barrett has observed that if an iron wire be heated to a bright redness and then be allowed to cool , that this cooling does not go on continuously , but that after the wire has sunk to a very dull red it suddenly becomes brighter , and then continues to cool down .
He surmised that the temperature at which this occurs is the temperature S ' which the iron ceases to be magnetisable .
In repeating Professor arrett s experiments , I found no difficulty in obtaining the phenomenon with hard steel wire , but I failed to observe it in the case of soft iron wire , or in the case of manganese steel wire .
It appeared o be of interest to determine the actual temperature at which the P enomenon occurred , and also the amount of heat which was rated .
Although other explanations of the phenomenon have \#169 ; n offered , there can never , I think , have been much doubt that it was ue to the liberation of heat owing to some change in the ria , and not due to any change in the conductivity or emissive were .
My method of experiment was exceedingly simple .

[ Mar. 21 , cylinder of hard steel , 6 3 cm .
long and 5'1 cm .
diameter , cut a groove in it , and wrapped in the groove a copper wire insulated with asbestos .
The cylinder was wrapped in a large number of coverings of asbestos paper to retard its cooling , the whole was then heated to a bright redness in a gas furnace , was taken from the furnace and allowed to cool in the open air , the resistance of the copper wire being from time to time observed .
The result is plotted in the accompanying curve , in which the ordinates are the logarithms of the increments of resistance above the resistance at the temperature of the room , and the abscissae are the times .
If the specific heat of the material were constant , and the rate of loss of heat were proportional to the excess of temperature , the curve would be a straight line .
It will be observed that below a certain point this is very nearly the case , but that there is a remarkable wave in the curve .
The temperature was observed to be falling rapidly , then to be suddenly retarded , next ; to increase , then again to fall .
The temperature reached in the first descent was 680 ' C. The temperature to which the iron subsequently ascends is- 712 ' C. The temperature at which another sample of hard steel ceased to be magnetic , determined in the same way by the resistance of a copper coil , was found to be 690 ' 0 .
This shows that within the limits of errors of observation the temperature of recalescence is that at which the material ceases to be magnetic .
This curve gives the material for determining the 1889.1 Electrical Resistance of Iron at High lemperature .
457 quantity of heat liberated .
The dotted lines in the curve show the continuation of the first and second parts of the curve , the horizontal distance between these approximately represents the time during which the material was giving out heat without fall of temperature .
After the bend in the curve the temperature is falling at the rate of 0'21 ' C. per second .
The distance between the two curves is 810 seconds .
It follows that the heat liberated in recalescence of tin 's sample is 173 times the heat liberated when the iron falls in temperature 1 ' C. With the same sample I have also observed an ascending curve of temperature .
There is in this case no reduction of temperature at the point of recalescence , but there is a very substantial reduction in the rate at which the temperature rises .
V. " Electrical Resistance ot Iron at a High Temperature .
" By J. Hopkinson .
Received March 14 , 1889 .
Auerbach , Callendar , and I think also Tait , have observed that the temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of iron is abnormally high .
So far as I know no one has pushed his observations to the temperature at which iron ceases to be magnetic .
