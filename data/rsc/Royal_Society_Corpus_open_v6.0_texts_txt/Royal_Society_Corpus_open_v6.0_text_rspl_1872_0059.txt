] On the Electrical Resistance of Selenium .
283 the production of the line-spectrum of nitrogen , and the expansion of the F line of hydrogen , depend entirely on the intensity of the charge communicated to the Leyden jar .
When the pressure of the gas between the electrodes is high , the discharge does not take place until the jar is fully charged ; but as the exhaustion proceeds a less and less charge is communicated to the jar , and the discharge at last is virtually not more than that of the simple current .
The same effect may be produced by interposing a break in the circuit , the length of which may be increased as the pressure in the tube is reduced .
Pliicker and Hittorf appear to have used a break , as in their paper in the Philosophical Transactions , Nov. 1864 , they speak of the expansion of lines obtained by increasing the charge of the jar by an interposed stratum of air .
They do not , however , appear to have noticed that the reduction of pressure in the tube was only equivalent to a diminution of the charge of the jar , and that to this cause many of the changes of spectra which accompany the reduced pressure ought to be ascribed .
We are continuing our experiments on the effect of temperature on the spectrum , but prefer to reserve this portion of the subject for the present .

It having been recently brought to notice that selenium in the crystalline condition exhibits the remarkable property of having a conductivity varying with the degree of light to which it is exposed , the following experiments were undertaken with a view to the further elucidation of the matter:\#151 ; Experiment 1.\#151 ; A bar of crystalline selenium measuring approximately 1*5 " x *5 " x '05 " was procured , and platinum wire terminals were fastened to the ends .
The bar itself was then enclosed in a box having a draw-lid , so as to admit or exclude the light at pleasure .
Then , the lid of the box being on , the resistance of the selenium was measured by means of a high-resistance galvanometer and a Wheatstone 's bridge , with dial-coils capable of measuring up to 10,000,000 ohms .
The battery-power was 2 cells Daniell .
The measurement was made on a dull cloudy day , and in a room of equable temperature .
The resistance having been carefully balanced , the lid of the box was withdrawn , when the resistance of the selenium fell instantaneously and On the Electrical Resistance of Selenium .
[ May 8 , considerably , as indicated by the rapid movement of the spot of light on the galvanometer-scale .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; The transition from darkness to the light given by an ordinary gas-burner ( conditions as before ) , caused a slight and barely perceptible fall in the resistance .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; The bar of selenium was next tried in the solar spectrum on a very bright cloudless day ( conditions as before ) , except that more battery-power was used ( 10 cells Daniell ) .
The diffused daylight could not be cut off ; so the trial was made in the most shaded part of an ordinary room , the spectrum being superimposed on the ordinary diffused daylight .
The resistances were very carefully balanced in each case , with the following results:\#151 ; Resistance in darkness ... ... ... ... ... ... 330,000 " " violet ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
279,000 " " red ... .

It is to be noted that in this experiment the reflecting galvanometer was placed on a heavy masonry pillar insulated from the floor for observatory purposes , and that the battery , bar of selenium , and resistance-coils were in another room , being connected by long and carefully insulated leads with the galvanometer .
\#166 ; Experiment4.\#151 ; The diffused light was cut off as much as possible J screens ; and the resistances were again balanced in the solar spectrum .

285 Experiment 5.\#151 ; The selenium was also exposed to the spectrum of the electric light in a darkened room .
The effect was feeble ; but by using more battery-power in balancing , it was possible to measure the swing of the spot of light when the selenium was suddenly exposed to the action of the light of the spectrum .
The maximum effect was obtained in , or just at the edge of the red , the violet and blue rays producing scarcely any effect .
Experiment 6.\#151 ; The selenium was exposed to the full sunlight ; the resistance fell enormously and instantaneously , and on balancing it was found to be little more than half what it was in the darkness .
The following were the general results of the experiments :\#151 ; Results.\#151 ; ( 1 ) That the resistance of selenium is largely affected by exposure to light .
( 2 ) That this effect is not produced by the actinic rays , but is at a maximum at , or just outside the red rays , at a place nearly coincident with the locus of the maximum of the heat-rays .
( 3 ) That the effect of varying resistances is certainly not due to any change of temperature in the bar of selenium .
( 4 ) That the effect produced on exposure to light is sensibly instantaneous , but that , on cutting off the light , the return to the normal resistance is not so rapid .
It would seem that there exists a power in rays nearly coincident with the heat-rays of high intensity , of altering instantaneously and without change of temperature the molecular condition of this particular element .

( Abstract .
) The observations in this paper are a continuation of those referred to in the previous communication bearing the same title .
They deal ( 1 ) with the spectra of chemical compounds , and ( 2 ) with the spectra of mechanical mixtures .
I. Chemical Compounds .
Several series of salts were observed ; these series maybe divided into two:\#151 ; 1st , those in which the atomic weights varied in each series ; 2nd , those in which the associated elements varied in each series .
The following salts were mapped:\#151 ; Pb Fa , Pb Cla , Pb Bra , Pb I2 ; Sr Fa , Sr Cl2 , Sr Bra , Sr Ia ; Ba Fa , Ba Cla , Ba Bra , Ba Ia ; Mg Fa , Mg Cla , Mg Bra , Mgla ; Na F , Na Cl , Na Br , Na I. The conditions of the experiments are described .
The same aluminium cups , described in the first paper , were used ; and the poles were arranged
