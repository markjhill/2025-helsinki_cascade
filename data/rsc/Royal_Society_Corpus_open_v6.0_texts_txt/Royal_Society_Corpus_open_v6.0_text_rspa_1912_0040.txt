The Volatility of Metals of the Platinum Group .
461 In the present uncertainty with regard to the mechanism of conduction in solids it would be premature to attempt a theory of the potential effect on these lines .
But , on the other hand , the simple relation between voltage and resistance specified above may furnish some guidance in a future choice among theories of conduction .
In conclusion , I have to thank Prof. Pointing for offering me ample facilities in conducting this investigation , and Prof. T. Turner for some valuable hints regarding the distillation of metals and the treatment of thin conducting films .
The Volatility of Metals of the Platinum Group .
By Sir William Ckookes , O.M. , For .
Sec. R.S. ( Received February 15 , \#151 ; Read March 7 , 1912 .
) For the last two years I have been using an electric furnace , and some facts which came under my notice on the occasion of a breakdown of the heating arrangement led me to suspect that platinum was not so entirely fixed at temperatures well below its melting-point as has been universally accepted by chemists and physicists .
The electric resistance furnace used ( fig. 1 ) is on the Heraeus system .

consists of a highly refractory porcelain tube , around which is coiled a ribbon of platinum foil , 11 mm. wide , 2*8 metres long , and 0*01 mm. thick , VOL. LXXXVI.\#151 ; A. o T Sir W. Crookes .
[ Feb. 15 , each convolution almost , but not quite , touching its neighbour .
The ribbon closely enwraps the tube , practically covering the surface to be heated , so that the heat produced by the passage of the electric current is immediately transmitted to the tube .
The tube is 4 cm .
internal diameter ; the object to be heated stands on a porcelain rod fixed upright in the middle of the tube .
The body of the furnace is made to slide up and down by means of a windlass , so as to allow the crucible to be properly adjusted .
The temperature of the furnace is measured by a Le Chatelier platinum and platinum-rhodium thermo-couple .
Although the melting-point of platinum is 1753 ' , * it is not safe to use the furnace at higher temperatures than about 1500 ' , as a temporary variation in the voltage of the current for a few minutes , or a reduction of the resistance , may easily make a difference of one or two hundred degrees .
After a certain time the platinum ribbon coil gets thinner and melts at the weakest part , and the furnace becomes useless until a new porcelain tube and platinum ribbon coil are supplied .
During the two years I have had the furnace in use this breakdown has happened three times .
On examining the point of rupture I was struck by the appearance of a fine glistening dust on the porcelain tube .
I carefully removed particles to the slide of a microscope , and found the dust to consist of beautifully-formed hexagonal plates with a brilliant metallic lustre and perfect crystalline form .
The amount at my disposal was infinitesimal\#151 ; not more than a few milligrammes\#151 ; and careful chemical examination showed me that the crystals were almost entirely platinum .
A control examination by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey confirmed my observation .
When the furnace was taken to pieces more crystalline deposits of platinum were found , especially inside the outer tube facing the platinum spiral .
Fig. 2 shows some of these crystals .
At first sight it might seem superfluous to try experiments to see if platinum volatilised at all when strongly heated , considering how many generations of chemists have been daily igniting and weighing platinum crucibles .
But it is customary among chemists to cleanse their crucibles between each using , and in some cases they are scoured with fine sand .
It therefore seemed of interest to subject a platinum crucible to a temperature approaching that to which the platinum resistance coil had been exposed As an appreciable amount of platinum had sublimed and deposited in the form of crystals in the furnace it was possible that a carefully weighed platinum crucible exposed to a high temperature , after a 'certain number of hours , might show a detectable diminution in weight .

] The Volatility of Metals of the Platinum Group .
463 I assumed that the loss of weight in a platinum crucible by sublimation , at temperatures not much above those available in chemical laboratories , would be very small , and would require the balance to be in the best condition to enable its indications to be relied on .
The balance\#151 ; a very delicate chemical one\#151 ; I employed for this research was put into accurate adjustment , and not used for any other purpose .
It was kept in a dry room at nearly constant temperature , and was locked when not actually in use .
The grain* weights used were made for me in 1864 by Johnson and Matthey , and were turned out of bars of melted , cast , and well hammered platinum .
They were adjusted by the method I described in the ' Chemical Fig. 2 .
News ' for April 19 , 1867 , and ' Phil. Trans. Roy .
Soc. , ' 1873 , p. 288 , and have been in use ever since .
In 1895 Mr. Chaney , Superintendent of Weights and Measures , tested my 1000-grain platinum weight against their absolute standards , with the result that it was shown to be 3'9858 grains light .
This made no difference to previous work with the weights , as in chemical operations the object is not to ascertain the absolute weight of a substance in terms of a grain or gramme , but to determine its relative weight in comparison with that which it possessed at some other time before submission to certain analytical or synthetical operations .
If the weighings are performed with * My results are given in grains , not grammes .
I have used my standard platinum grain weights for nearly fifty years , and they are too valuable to discard in favour of gramme weights , which would demand many months ' work on them to bring them to the state of accuracy into which I have now got the grain weights .
Sir W. Crookes .
[ Feb. 15 , the same weights it does not matter whether they are absolutely of the value they profess to be\#151 ; but it is of vital importance that they should bear a known proportion to each other .
On receiving Mr. Chaney 's result I adjusted the 1000-grain weight by melting a bead of pure gold on it of the exact weight required , viz. , 3*9858 grains , and then readjusted the whole series in the same way so as to get them absolutely as well as relatively accurate .
In 1897 , the readjustment being complete , I again asked Mr. Chaney to tell me the absolute weight of my platinum 1000 grains , and he returned it in a few days , saying that in air at 62 ' F. and pressure of 30 inches , my 1000-grain weight weighed 999'99574 grains , and in vacuo it weighed 999*90300 grains .
Comparisons made last year showed that their values have remained absolutely unaltered , and I have the satisfaction of knowing they are as near perfection as can reasonably be expected .
By taking all precautions and using Gauss 's method of interchanges , the balance will clearly indicate a difference of O'OOOl of a grain when loaded with 1000 grains in each pan .
In the course of the research it was seen that this extreme delicacy was not needed , and , as weighing to such minute accuracy is very tedious , I have not , as a rule , gone beyond three places of decimals .
Platinum at 1300 ' .
A platinum crucible in good condition was ignited , cooled in a desiccator , and , an hour after , transferred to the balance .
It weighed 150*487 grains .
It was put into the electric furnace at 1300 ' C. , and kept at that temperature for two hours .
It was then removed , allowed to cool in a desiccator , .and after another hour in the balance room it was found to weigh 150*458 grains , showing a loss of no less than 0*029 grain .
It was now put into the furnace for another two hours , and the temperature kept at 1300 ' ( a white heat ) .
On cooling an hour in the balance case its weight was found to be 150*427 grains .
Table I shows the losses by sublimation when exposed to a temperature of 1300 ' for two hours at a time \#151 ; being cooled and weighed between each heating .
These results are shown plotted as a curve in fig. 3 .
After this heating , and loss of 0*245 per cent , of its weight , the platinum crucible was not appreciably different in appearance from the time it was first put into the electric furnace .
I examined its surface under the micro-tscope , expecting to find the re-crystallisation described by Mr. Rosenheim* * ' Roy .

I was unable to detect any appearance resembling the photograph given in his paper .
Probably the heating in his case was extended much beyond the 30 hours to which my crucible was exposed .
The action known as " air washing " ( particles from a white-hot semi-molten surface being mechanically carried away by a current of impinging air ) could not be active in the case of this experiment , for the tube of the furnace was closed at the top , nearly closed at the place where the crucible Sir W. Crookes .
[ Feb. 15 , stood , and almost completely obstructed at the lower end .
Therefore the platinum was in almost perfectly still air .
Palladium at 1300 ' .
Having with platinum obtained such unexpected results I tested palladium in similar conditions .
The metal used was pure , in the form of thick plate , bright and polished on both sides .
In the following table it will be seen that , like platinum , palladium loses weight when exposed to a temperature of 1300 ' for two hours at a time , cooling and weighing at each interval:\#151 ; Table II .

] The Volatility of Metals of the Platinum Group .
467 Moissan* says that " palladium is more easily fused than platinum , but is apparently less volatile .
, , From the foregoing data it appears that at temperatures much below its melting-point palladium is three times as volatile as platinum .
At the end of the series the plate of metal had curved into an arc of about 60 ' , and its concave surface showed raised blisters .
These blisters appeared after the first few heatings , and were due evidently to the liberation of occluded gas ; further heating did not seem to increase the blisters .
On examining the plotted curve the two-hourly loss of weight is seen to be greater in the earlier stages , diminishing up to 10 hours , and then pretty regular in a straight line .
This agrees with the supposition that gas was given off during the earlier heatings , and the extra loss at these stages was due to the weight of gas liberated .
From the above data the loss due to occluded gas would be about 0T5 of a grain , and supposing it were hydrogen it would measure about 111 c.c. The bulk of 58 grains of palladium would be about 0*34 c.c. , and as palladium will absorb more than 600 times its volume of hydrogen , the amount it could have held is 204 c.c. As the heatings at 1300 ' progressed there was a gradual change in the surface of the metal from smooth to crystalline , and at the end of the 30 hours the surface had a crystalline moire appearance , similar to that shown by iridium after similar heating , but not so marked , the crystals being smaller .
The metallic appearance was unimpaired and no oxidation was detected on the surface .
Iridium at 1300 ' .
In May , 1908 , f I suggested to chemists the great advantages of using crucibles of pure iridium instead of platinum in laboratory work .
An iridium crucible is hard as steel ; it may be heated for hours over a smoky Bunsen burner without injury .
It will stand hours of boiling in aqua regia without appreciable attack ; lead and zinc can be melted in it and boiled at a full red heat ; likewise nickel , copper , gold , and iron can be melted in an iridium crucible , and poured out without injury .
I used an iridium crucible for more than a year in the scandium research , and did not notice any appreciable diminution in weight .
Any slight loss I attributed to mechanical abrasion during the cleaning and burnishing with sand , sometimes rendered necessary after an experiment .
Subsequent observations , however , led me to suspect that iridium was not altogether fixed at high temperatures ; looking into the literature of the * 'Comptes Rendus , ' January 22 , 1906 , vol. 143 .

Sir W. Crookes .
[ Feb. 15 , subject I met with several references to the supposed volatility of this metal .
Accordingly , I commenced experiments to see if I could detect loss of weight in iridium at 1300 ' , a temperature at which I had found platinum to be slightly volatile .
An iridium crucible was heated for a few minutes in the electric furnace , and then cooled in a desiccator .
It was taken to the balance room , put near the balance for an hour , and then placed on the pan .
In an hour 's time it was weighed and found to be 145*726 grains .
This therefore was taken as the original weight from which to calculate the loss , if any , after long exposure to the high temperature of the furnace .
The crucible was put into the hot electric furnace , standing on an iridium plate , and kept at 1300 ' for two hours .
It was then removed , allowed to cool with all precautions , when its weight was found to be 144*520 grains , showing a loss of 1*206 grains or about 0*8 per cent. The experiment was repeated until the iridium had been exposed to this temperature for a total of 22 hours .
The following table shows how in the above circumstances iridium loses weight , the data being plotted as a curve in fig. 5:\#151 ; Table III .

Sir W. Crookes .
[ Feb. 15 , -After this severe treatment the crucible , which had taken on a crystalline appearance over the whole surface when the series commenced , began to show approaching disintegration along its edges ( fig. 7 ) , and after several more heatings of two hours pieces began to crumble when touched with the forceps .
Fig. 7 .
The disintegration of iridium has been examined by Messrs. Holborn and Austin , * who found that at high temperatures ( 1670 ' ) a narrow strip disintegrated about ten times as rapidly in the air as platinum .
Rhodium at 1300 ' .
I next tried rhodium , a metal intermediate in fusibility between platinum and iridium , and similar to iridium in its resistance to chemical agents which attack platinum .
In my paper above quotedf I suggested the use of rhodium for crucibles in the laboratory .
Its low density ( 11 as against iridium 22 ) would be a great advantage in quantitative operations , as the weight of a rhodium orucible would be only half that of one made of platinum , and its cost would not be excessive .

After the above heating the rhodium did not appear much changed .
It was a little darker , as if with a slight tarnish , but showed no crystalline structure .
Ruthenium at 1300 ' .
Ruthenium does not lend itself to such experiments as the foregoing owing to the formation of a volatile oxide .
A piece of the pure metal , in the form of a highly polished plate , exposed in the furnace to a temperature of 1300 ' for eight hours , lost 25 per cent , of its weight .
After this heating the ruthenium was of a dull black and was covered with a coating of oxide having a fused appearance .

Having obtained such unexpected results at 1300 ' it was of interest to see how these metals would behave at a temperature sometimes employed in an analytical laboratory .
* Platinum at 900 ' .
I therefore arranged a large M4ker burner , with fused silica triangle and a surrounding clay cylinder to obstruct radiation , and with it heated an almost new platinum crucible .
The thermo-couple showed a temperature of about 900 ' in the centre of the hot crucible .
After being heated to this temperature for 10 minutes the crucible was cooled and transferred to the ' balance .
It weighed 121*059 grains .
It was now subjected to 10 successive heatings of two hours each to 900 ' , weighing each time .
The original weight of 121*059 grains was not found to vary in the slightest degree , and the same experiment tried with other platinum crucibles gave a similar result .

Iridium at 900 ' .
Having found platinum to be absolutely fixed at 900 ' , it was of interest to see how iridium would behave at that temperature .
Another iridium crucible was taken , and its original weight , after good ignition , was found to be 175*374 grains .
Heating to 900 ' over a Meker gas burner in air for 2 hours 25 minutes reduced the weight to 175*322 .
In Table VII is shown the gradual diminution in weight with the duration of heating .
After these successive heatings to 900 ' , the iridium crucible was a little darker than it was originally , but it had no crystalline moire appearance , like the other one after having been heated for 22 hours to 1300 ' .

475 the metals at 900 ' can be compared one withi the other , and also with the corresponding curve of metals at 1300 ' .
The horizontal scale of hours is the same in each , but to render the curves at 900 ' distinct I have been obliged to make the vertical scale of percentage loss 10 times as large as it is in the 1300 ' curves .
Summary .
These results bear two explanations:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The metal is volatile per se at these high temperatures , or ( 2 ) the metal unites with oxygen at a certain temperature , forming a volatile oxide , which may either volatilise unchanged , , or may decompose at a higher temperature with deposition of the metal , the oxygen acting in this case as the temporary carrier of the metal .
It is .
probable that each of these causes is active in one or other of the metals experimented with .
I will take the case of the metal first tried , viz. , platinum .
The universal experience of chemists is against the supposition that platinum forms a volatile oxide below 1300 ' .
Deville and Debray , who worked long and thoroughly on the platinum metals , agree that " platinum is distinguished from all the metals which accompany it in the mineral , by the fact that it does not unite direct with oxygen in whatever condition the two bodies are placed."* The mode of occurrence of the beautiful crystals of platinum is against the supposition that they are a product of the decomposition of an oxide , for the crystals deposit on a part of the apparatus that is at a slightly lower temperature than the bulk of the metal , and it is inconceivable that platinum should unite with oxygen to form a volatile oxide at one definite temperature , and part with this oxygen and come down in metallic crystals at a little lower temperature .
The boiling-point of platinum is put by Kaye and Laby at about 2450 ' .
f Moissan 's electric furnace , in which the arc is used , is said by him to give with ease a temperature of 3500 ' , and here platinum enters into fusion in a few minutes , and soon volatilises .
The metallic platinum collects in small brilliant globules and in powder on the cooler parts of the electrodes , or on the surface of the lower brick some centimetres from the crucible . !
No. mention is made of the metal condensing in crystals .
I must therefore come to the conclusion that platinum is absolutely non-volatile at 900 ' , a temperature easily attainable in an analytical laboratory , and that the formation of crystals of the metal in the electric furnace is a true case of sublimation .

[ Feb. 15 , The next metal , iridium , under experiment behaves differently to platinum .
It is admitted that iridium is volatile at a high temperature .
Thus , Mendenhall and Ingersoll* speak of melting iridium into a globule , and then re-melting it two or three times , before it entirely sublimed .
This at a temperature above its melting-point , which these authors put at between 2300 ' and 2400 ' .
Waidner and Burgess , f describing an " iridium furnace , " of which the essential part is an iridium tube 25 cm .
long , 2 cm .
in diameter , and 0-25 mm. wall thickness , state that , to avoid evaporation of the iridium , it was coated with Nernst 's refractory earth mixture .
These illustrations , however , are taken from observations of experimentalists who were working with iridium at or near its melting-point .
At high temperatures below 1000 ' iridium oxidises , forming an oxide , lr203 , which is volatile .
Deville and Debray consider the alleged volatility of the metal is due to the formation of this volatile oxide .
They say : " Above 1000 ' all volatilisation becomes impossible in our atmosphere , because the oxide of iridium ceases to exist , and the metal is at least as fixed as platinum .
" !
In my experiments the cold iridium was put into the furnace , previously heated to 1300 ' or thereabouts , and the metal quickly became hot .
While it was rising to 1000 ' it oxidised superficially , and the oxide rapidly volatilised , accounting for the loss of weight .
I devised an experiment to see if iridium would volatilise at a high temperature in a vacuum .
A fused silica tube , 1 cm .
diameter and 20 cm .
long , had a bulb 2\ cm .
diameter blown on the end ( fig. 11 ) .
In the bulb was put 27'619 grains of clean iridium , and the other end of the silica tube was drawn out for connecting with the pump and sealing .
It was exhausted to a high vacuum and heated to near redness along its whole length , till all moisture and occluded gases had been removed ; it was then sealed off .
The tube was placed bulb uppermost in the furnace in such a position that the iridium would be at the point of greatest heat , the lower part of the tube remaining comparatively cool .
The bulb was kept at a temperature of 1300 ' for 30 hours .
On examining the silica tube when cold , it was seen that the long-continued high temperature had caused the bulb and the upper part of the tube to devitrify , and become white and translucent , and that it had an irregular black deposit on the lower part , which , on examination , proved to be metallic iridium .
The iridium removed from the bulb was now found to weigh 27'600 grains , showing a total loss of 0 019 grain , or 0069 per cent. , in 30 hours .

The Volatility of Metals of the Platinum Group .
The presence of a deposit of iridium in the cooler end of the silica tube may thus be accounted for : during the heating of the bulb containing the iridium , a little air leaked in , and the oxide of iridium formed before the temperature became high enough to decompose it volatilised and deposited on Fig. 11 .
the cooler part of the tube .
There the oxide remained until the heat rose to the decomposing-point\#151 ; somewhere about 1000 ' .
I must not conclude this paper without expressing my thanks to the firm of Johnson and Matthey , to whom I am indebted for many specimens of the pure metals used in this research .
