In this communication we record the results obtained , during a period of fifteen months , from the breeding of fancy mice .
The experi- I ments were commenced with the object of determining the extent , if any , to which the relative proportion of the sexes is capable of being influenced by varying conditions of age , nutrition , inter-breeding , etc. The work is still in progress , but in the hope of obtaining help and criticism from other observers , we think it desirable to put on record the experimental work that has already been carried out .
Our paper consists of two parts : ( a ) a list of the various crossings and their results , a record which we believe to be perfectly trustworthy ; and ( b ) a series of conclusions at which we have arrived after careful study of the figures .
As these conclusions form the most generally interesting portion of the paper , we have decided to place them first , especially as the mere statistics are only likely to be of use in the criticism of our deductions or in furnishing material by the aid of which others , not at first apparent , may perhaps be formulated .
In using these tables an explanation of our symbols may be necessary ; it should , for instance , be noticed that all the bucks are indicated by small Greek letters\#151 ; the does by Eoman capitals .
When a numeral follows the letter representing a particular doe , it shows that the bearer is the daughter of the doe whose indication is the letter alone .
Thus , B2 represents the second daughter which we kept of B , while B2*3 refers to the third daughter kept of B2 , and , consequently , the granddaughter of B. This method , of course , gives no clue to the male ancestry of a mouse , but this can always be ascertained by referring to the record of the particular animal .
If we translate one line taken at random from the doe 's record it will , perhaps , make our system clear : C1 ( to e ) .

On looking at the top of the paragraph devoted to C1 in the doe 's record , her percentage will be seen , while all that is known of the ancestry of e will be found at the top of the paragraph devoted to him in the buck 's record .

Part I.\#151 ; Generalisations .
The first question as to which we are desirous of obtaining information concerns the possibility of the male or female parent , in any particular instance , exerting a marked influence in the direction of a preponderance of male or female offspring .
In seeking an answer to this question it is necessary to state that out of the total number of 493 young produced in the course of our experiments , 258 , or 52*3 per cent. , were of the male sex , and 235 , or 47*7 per cent. , of the female sex .
Taking the buck 's descendants first , we have the following records :\#151 ; \lt ; ?- 5 .
CL 71 ( 48 per cent. ) 77 ( 52 per cent. ) / ?
... ..\#166 ; 18 ( 66-5 55 ) 9 ( 33-5 \#187 ; ) r 28 ( 46-5 55 ) 32 ( 53-5 \#187 ; ) 3 52 ( 57 55 ) 39 ( 43 \#187 ; ) e 25 ( 43 55 ) 33 ( 57 \#187 ; ) c 6 2 v 33 ( 66 55 ) 17 ( 34 \#187 ; ' ) 0 7 * 6 i 18 ( 51 55 ) 17 ( 49 " ) K 0 3 258 235 The cases of ( , 6 and k may be left out of consideration , as the numbers of their offspring are so few .
Of the rest , a and i closely approach the normal , but f3 , 8 and r\ have male offspring in excess , in connection with which fact it must be remembered that 8 was the son of ( 3 .
On turning to the record of we find that in the case of all five does with which he was mated , the male offspring was in excess , and in the case of 8 also when put to five different does in succession , more males were produced than females in every instance .
V was put to seven does\#151 ; five times males were in excess , once the sexes were equal , while only once ( with C1'2,2,1 ) were there more females than males produced , y and e on the other hand had female offspring in excess of male to a rather marked degree , and in each case the record is taken from more than fifty young .
With y the females were in excess of the males in four litters out of nine , while in two others the sexes were equal , so that in only three out of nine litters were there more males than females .
In the case of e the females were in excess in five litters out of nine , while in one other the sexes were equal .
In this case too there were more males than VOL. lxxiii .
n 34 Dr. S. M. Copeman and Mr. F. G. Parsons .
[ Dec. 1 , females in only three litters out of nine .
When it is remembered j that all these bucks were put to at least five different does selected at random , it certainly does appear that some bucks have a tendency to beget more male , and others more female offspring .
This , we S believe , is the experience of many breeders of animals .
It may be I objected that these bucks were not placed with exactly the same j\#187 ; series of does in each instance , and we regret that this is so , but I by looking through the records of 3 ( a male producer ) and e ( a female I producer ) it will be noted that they both had young by the three I does B2 , C1 and D1 , with the following results :\#151 ; $ \#165 ; B2 ... ... ... .
2 1 C1 ... ... ... .
3 2 D1 ... ... ... .
9 6 14 9 8 12 so that their tendency to produce an excess of male or female offspring would appear to have had no relation to the particular does with which they were mated .
With regard to ft ( a male producer ) and ( a female producer ) , both had young by the four does A B D and F with the following results:\#151 ; A y. \lt ; ?\#165 ; \#165 ; 4 3 4 0 1 4 7 9 ( in 3 litters ) 3 2 8 8 ( in 2 " ) 4 3 4 3 12 12 23 20 This is not nearly so satisfactory a result for our contention , as with the same does y ( the female producer ) actually produced a larger proportion of males than did ft ( the male producer ) .
We shall , therefore , , content ourselves by saying that 8 and rj are instances of bucks which tend to produce an excess of male , and e of one producing excess of female offspring .
On looking through the record of the does the point that is most striking is the behaviour of C1 and her descendants:\#151 ; A .

C1 produced 9 17 O2 55 3 11 C1,2,1 55 2 3 01-2.2 55 2 5 01.2*2.1 55 5 10 21 46 ( 31 per cent. ) ( 69 per cent. ) On the other hand C1,3 had 17 male and 6 female young , but she was a daughter of e not of a. There is , however , an influence at work in this family which may possibly account for the excess of females over males , and it is that the same buck a was largely responsible for the results , as each of the does was put to him ; thus C1,2*2*1* was his daughter on the male side , and his great , great granddaughter on the female .
It has already been noted that a was a buck who produced practically the normal proportion of young , so that his influence alone is not likely to account for the excess of females .
But the practice of inbreeding a buck with his daughter , granddaughter , \amp ; c. , for several generations may perhaps account for an excess of female offspring ; this theory being strengthened by the fact that C1*2,2,1* was the only doe with which the male-producing buck had more females than males in a litter .
The clue is one which we are now following up and which we would suggest to other breeders as worthy of further investigation .
On the whole , our statistics seem to point to the fact that certain bucks and does tend to produce a preponderance of one sex , but that the influence is greater in the male parent ; also that a doe which is the result of prolonged inbreeding is more likely to produce female than male offspring .
The next point inquired into refers to the possibility of the number of young in a litter exerting any influence on the proportion of the sexes .
If there is any basis of fact in the theory that the amount of nourishment an embryo receives affects the determination of its sex , we should expect that large litters would show a predominance of one sex and small litters a predominance of the other .
Up to the present we have neglected the young which were eaten by their mothers before their sex had been determined , because we have no reason to believe that the mother preferred to eat male or female young , and , in taking large numbers , we have presumed that as many male as female young would be eaten in this way .
We have , however , kept a record of the total number in each litter when first seen ; often an hour or two , and never more than 12 hours after the birth .
A doe hardly ever eats the whole of a young one at once , as she apparently prefers to first eat the viscera and brains of several , leaving their carcases for a future meal .
So that , even after 12 hours from the birth , it is easy to see , by the D 2 36 Dr. S. M. Copeman and Mr. F. G. Parsons .

487* 231 211 45 This table shows that 487 young were produced in 73 litters , thus I giving an average of 6 .
7 for a litter .
There are 45 litters of 7 or over , I and 28 of under 7 .
These we may speak of as large and small litters I respectively .
If the number of young in the 45 large litters is added I up it amounts to 356 , and of these 164 ( 46 per cent. ) were males ; | 155 ( 43'5 per cent. ) females ; while 37 ( 10*5 per cent. ) were eaten and I their sex undetermined .
Similarly if the number of young in the 1 28 small litters is taken we get a total of 131 ; of these 67 ( 51 percent .
) I were males ; 56 ( 43'7 per cent. ) females ; while 8 ( 6 per cent. ) were I eaten .
Tabulated these results are as follows:\#151 ; per cent. per cent. Large litters ( over 6 ) ... ... ... . .
46 43'5 Small litters ( 6 or under ) ... 51 43 Eaten per cent. 10*5 This result suggests two conclusions\#151 ; firstly , that in a large litter a I greater percentage of young is eaten by the mother , which is , perhaps , what I one would expect , and , secondly , that in small litters there is a slightly I greater percentage of males than in large ones .
Other things being I equal , one might fairly suppose that , in a small litter , each individual I embryo would be better nourished than in a large litter , and this * The records of the six does with which the buck 8 was placed in a large cage have not been added in , because we have no means of knowing how many were eaten .
Dr. S. M. Copeman and Mr E. G. Parsons .
[ Dec. 1 , supposition is strengthened by our experience that , in small litters , the young are individually of greater size than we have found to be the case in larger families .
The difference between the percentages of the large and small litters is not great enough to enable any general conclusion to be drawn from it , but , so far as it goes , it suggests that ample nourishment is more likely to result in an excess of male rather than of female offspring .
The next point to be discussed is whether the age of either parent affects the proportion of sexes in the young .
As an aid to the determination of this question the records of all the does of two months or under at the time of conception , may be compared with those of all the does of 6 months or over .
We have records of 21 litters produced by does up to 2 months of age .
These give a total of 108 young , of which 55 ( 51 per cent. ) are males , and 53 ( 49 per cent. ) females .
With does over 6 months old we have also records of 21 litters , with a total of 134 young ; of these 74 ( 55 per cent. ) are males and 60 ( 45 per cent. ) females .
These figures show that there is an increase in the proportion of males to females in the progeny of those does over 6 months of age .
It will now be worth while noticing that the does at intermediate ages , that is , from 2|\#151 ; 5\#163 ; months ( inclusive ) , produced 27 litters , giving a total of 173 young , of which 85 ( 49 per cent. ) were males , and 88 ( 51 per cent. ) females .
Tabulated , we arrive at the following results :\#151 ; \lt ; ? ?
per cent , per cent. Does up to and including 2 months ... . .
51 49 , , between 2\#163 ; and 5^ months ... ... ... .
49 51 " of 6 months and over ... ... ... ... . .
55 45 This suggests that , in does over 6 months old , the proportion of males to females increases , but we are unable to deduce anything from this knowledge at present , for the reason that we do not know the duration of the breeding period of a doe , nor at what stage the young are likely to receive the greatest amount of nourishment .
Moreover , the difference in the proportion of the sexes among the young is not a very great one , and , doubtless , there are many other influences at work , the effect of which it is difficult to eliminate .
One of these is the tendency , of which proof has been adduced , that certain bucks produce a preponderance of male or female offspring , but this tendency , to a certain extent , has been neutralised by the fact that our statistics have been drawn from the pairing of ten bucks with twenty-eight does .
It is unfortunate that the buck of which we possess most records should have been paired so extensively with does under 6 months of age , as had he been put with an equal number of old and young does , it would have been interesting to have determined 1903 .
] Observations on the Sex of Mice .
whether the percentages of male and female young would have varied .
Some little information may , however , be obtained from the record of 8 , who when he was mated with five does of an average age of 7 months , produced 65 per cent , of male offspring , while with six does averaging 2 months old the male offspring was only 53 per cent. Though the numbers here are small ( eighty-three young in all ) , the record certainly supports the suggestion that an adult doe is more likely to bring forth an excess of male offspring than a very young one .
With regard to the effect of the age of the buck we are unfortunately unable to give- any definite opinion , since the bucks from which we chiefly bred were apparently fully grown when purchased , though we had no means of actually determining their age .
It will be seen , on looking at the record of a , that in his later offspring females predominated , but there three factors at least are concerned : ( 1 ) The advanced age of the buck ; ( 2 ) the predisposition of C1 and her descendants to produce females ; and ( 3 ) the possibility that the excessive inbreeding to which these mice were subjected may have led to an increase of females .
The last factor we propose to consider at the present time is that of external temperature .
The mice were kept in an unheated greenhouse in which the temperature usually ranged between 80 ' and 100 ' F. during the day-time in summer , while in winter it often descended several degrees below freezing point .
It may be interesting to contrast the records of the young born in July , August and September with those born in December , January , February and March , and both of these with the total records for the whole 15 months over which our experiments extended .
During the 3 hot months 136 young were born , of which 75 ( 55 per cent. ) were males , and 61 ( 45 per cent. ) females , while during the 4 cold months 127 young were born , of which 65 ( 51 per cent. ) were males and 62 ( 49 per cent. ) females .

In conclusion it must be confessed that we have learnt comparatively little from this 15 months ' experimental work on mice , but we are hopeful that the labour has not been entirely expended in vain , and that at least certain clues have been obtained which may usefully be followed up , both by ourselves and other breeders .
So far as our experiments have gone , the chief points of interest would seem to be:\#151 ; 40 Dr. S. M. Copeman and Mr. F. G- .
Parsons .
[ Dec. 1 , \#174 ; 1 .
That the number of males born is slightly larger than that of females .
2 .
That certain males beget a markedly large proportion of male , 1 and others of female offspring .
3 .
That there is some evidence that this tendency is hereditary .
4 .
That certain does tend to bear an excess of either male or female j offspring , but the evidence of this is not so conclusive as in the case of the male .
5 .
That mice bear inbreeding between a male and his offspring for s five generations without loss of fertility or apparent bodily degeneration\#151 ; this inbreeding in our one series of experiments being attended with a large excess of female offspring .
6 .
That the average number of young in a litter , judged from seventy-three litters , is 6 " 7 .
7 .
That in large litters more of the young are likely to be eaten by the mother than in small ones .
8 .
That in large litters the proportion of females is greater than in small ones .
9 .
That more males are produced by does over 6 months than is the case with does under that age .
10 .
That the temperature and time of year at which impregnation occurs seem to exert little or no influence on the proportion of male and female offspring .
Of course the larger the number of experiments the greater will be the likelihood of obtaining reliable statistics , so that it will be interesting to determine whether another year 's breeding confirms or neutralises the results now recorded , but we think it desirable to publish our observations at this stage , for two reasons , firstly , to invite criticism on our methods and suggestions for future work , and , secondly , to indicate to'other breeders clues which would appear worth while following up .
It should , perhaps , be mentioned that , in each instance , careful record has been kept of the colour of the individual mice mated together , and also of that of their progeny .
These results we have handed over to Mr. Bateson , by whom they have been utilised in connection with his investigation of Mendel 's theory of inheritance of parental characteristics.* * ' Zool. Soc. Proc. , ' 1903 , vol. 2 , p. 83 .
