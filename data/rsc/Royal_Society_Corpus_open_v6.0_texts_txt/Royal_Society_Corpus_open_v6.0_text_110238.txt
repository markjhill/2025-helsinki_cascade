] The author , in a paper published in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions , gave the analysis of 328 calculi contained in the collection of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital ; and has been since enabled to complete the analysis of the 335 remaining specimens , which have now been divided .
The results of the analysis are given in a tabular form , exhibiting in the order of their occurrence from the centre , the consecutive deposits of the different materials of which the calculi are composed , according to the most prominent character of such material .
The most remarkable circumstance brought to light in the course of this investigation , is the discovery of the presence of silex in one specimen composed principally of oxalate of lime , and weighing about 5 grains .
The particles of silex were very minute , and were imbedded in , and diffused through , the oxalate of lime .
Three examples of a similar occurrence are quoted by the author .
The paper concludes with a few remarks on the statistical conclusions stated in his former communication .
He thinks there is reason to believe that the average number of calculous disorders in Scotland has been much underrated ; on the other hand , the proneness to those complaints is very small in Ireland .
A much larger proportion of calculous cases occurs in towns than in the country .
