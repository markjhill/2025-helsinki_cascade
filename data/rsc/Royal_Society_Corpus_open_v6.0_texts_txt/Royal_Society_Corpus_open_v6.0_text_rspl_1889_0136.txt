" On the Limit of Solar and Stellar Light in the Ultra-violet Part of the Spectrum .
" By William Huggins , D.C.L. , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received March 28 , \#151 ; Read April 4 , 1889 .
It has been long known that the solar spectrum stops abruptly , but not quite suddenly , at the ultra-violet end , and much sooner than the spectra of many terrestrial sources of light .
The observations of Cornu , of Hartley , and , quite recently , of Living and Dewar , appear to show that the definite absorption to which the very rapid extinction of the solar spectrum is due , has its seat in the earth 's atmosphere , and not in that of the sun ; and that , consequently , all ex-terrestrial light should be cut off at the same place in the spectrum .
During several years I have attempted to obtain the limit in the ultra-violet for stellar light here , but as it was necessary to make use of a bright star at a high altitude , and at a time when the atmosphere was very clear , it was not until September 20th , 1888 , that I was able to obtain a result which , seemed to me to be satisfactory .
On that night three successive photographs of Vega , with increasing exposures , were taken on the same plate .
The first spectrum was exposed for 10 minutes , the second for 20 minutes , and the third spectrum nearly four times as long , namely , for 70 minutes .
A comparison of the extent of the second spectrum due to an exposure of 20 minutes with that of the third spectrum , to which an exposure of 70 minutes was given , leaves no doubt that the latter spectrum has reached the limit imposed by atmospheric absorption , and has not stopped in consequence of an insufficient exposure of the plate .
