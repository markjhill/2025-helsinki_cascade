( Abstract .
) This research was originally undertaken by Professor Schuster and Mr. H. Hadley , before the authors were aware that Mr. E. H. Griffiths was engaged on a similar investigation .
After a number of preliminary experiments , and just as the final arrangements for the conduct of the measurements were being definitely made , Mr. Hadley , on his appointment to the Head Mastership of the School of Science and Art , Kidderminster , had to leave Manchester .
In the meantime Mr. Griffiths ' important research was published , and we had to consider whether our own work , which was designed on a smaller scale , could compete with it in accuracy .
We decided to complete the investigation , principally for the reason that , although we both aimed at determining what is commonly called the mechanical equivalent of heat through the heating of a certain mass of water by means of an electric current , the details of the experiments differed very materially , so that our two ways of dealing with the problem seemed to afford a useful test of the amount of agreement which at present may be obtained .
Our investigation touches only a small part of that treated by Mr. Griffiths , as we did not attempt to measure the changes in the specific heat of water .due to change of temperature .
On the other hand , the more modest limits within which we have confined ourselves allowed us to use a much simpler apparatus .
On Mr. Hadley 's departure , Mr. W. Gannon took his place .
From the former gentleman we received a good deal of help in the divising and construction of some important parts of the apparatus .
The principle of the method we have used is extremely simple .
The electrical work done in a conductor being measured by j ECd\#163 ; , where E is the difference of potential at the ends of the conductor , C the current , and t the time .
We keep the electromotive force Constant , and measure J Cdt directly by a silver voltameter .
We do not , therefore , require to know the resistance of the wire , and we thus avoid the difficulty of having to estimate the excess of temperature of the wire over that of the water in which it is placed .
We also gain the advantage of not having to measure time , and therefore of being able to complete the experiments more quickly than we could 26 Prof. A. Schuster and Mr. W. Gannon .
[ Nov. 22 , have safely done if the length of time the current passed had to be measured with great accuracy .
The Results .
We divide our experiments into three series , hut only attach any value to the third , as during the first two sets the thermometer was falling in the last period .
We bad hoped at first to be able to apply a small correction to eliminate the error which is due to the fact that a falling thermometer will read too high , and we made a large number of experiments to determine the correction .
We arrived , however , at the result that the indications of a falling thermometer are so irregular that no correction is possible .
Consequently in our third series the thermometer was rising during the whole course of each experiment .
We think it worth while to put on record an impression that the behaviour of our Baudin thermometer has altered since we first received it from the maker .
As soon as it came some preliminary experiments were made to see if we could work with the thermometer while it was falling , and the observations seemed to show that the fall was sufficiently uniform .
Our first three experiments gave results which were very consistent , and a minute after the current was broken the temperature seemed to fall already in a perfectly regular manner .
But as we continued our work , the behaviour of the instrument seemed to deteriorate .
Thus , in our experiment on March 8 , the temperature had hardly fallen three minutes after the current had stopped .
It is possible that this is due to accidental circumstances , for it is well known that different places of the bore of a capillary tube behave very differently .
We wish , therefore , to express no opinion at present as to the probability of an actual change in the thermometer , but only to draw the attention of other experimenters to this point , which seems worth keeping in mind .
Our final value is J = 4T804 Joules on the mercury scale of hard French glass , 4'1905 on the nitrogen scale , 41917 on the hydrogen scale , at a temperature of 19'T .
This result depends on the assumption that the electrochemical equivalent of silver is 0 001118 , and that our standard Clark cell had an electromotive force of 1-4340(1 \#151 ; * t'\#151 ; 15 ) volts , where * = 0-000814 + 0-000007 \#151 ; 15 ) , 1894 .

f. Instrumentenkunde , ' vol. 18 , p. 310 , 1893 ) .
Glazebrook and Skinner 's coefficient refers to a mean temperature of 7''5 , and is identical with the above at that temperature .
The comparison of the results of different observers will be facilitated by Table I , in which we compare the work done in ergs with the foot-pound at Greenwich and the kilogrammetre at Paris .
This table has been calculated on the assumption that g at Paris is equal to 980-96 , and at Greenwich equal to 981-24 .
We have prepared another table ( II ) , which at any temperature will give the correction of an interval measured on our mercury thermometer to an interval measured on the nitrogen and hydrogen thermometers .
This table has been calculated with the help of the equation given by Chappuis for the correction to the thermometer made of French hard glass .
In comparing our results with that of other observers , we have in the first place to consider the value which Mr. Griffiths has obtained in his very excellent series of measurements .
His final result ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 55 , p. 26 ; ' Phil. Trans. , ' clxxxiv , A , 1893 ) is J = 4-1982(1\#151 ; 0-00266 0\#151 ; 15 ) xlO7 .
This refers to the nitrogen thermometer .
At a temperature of 19-1 ' , the value would be reduced to 4T936 , which corresponds to our 4-1905 at the same temperature .
Griffiths ' value is to be increased slightly , owing to the fact that he really measures the difference between the specific heat of water and of air .
This would increase the value of J by -0011 about , so that the value of J at 19"1 ' would be raised to 4*1947 X 107 , which is exactly one part in a thousand larger than ours .
The difference is small , but must be due to some systematic error , as both Griffiths ' value and our own agree so well with each other , that , ordinary observational errors and accidental disturbances could not have produced so large a difference in our results .
The least satisfactory part of a calorimetric measurement must always be the application of the cooling correction , and we have considered it of great importance to reduce that correction as much as possible .
The uncertainty of the cooling correction does not necessarily depend on its value ; thus we can much diminish it by starting , as we have done in the third series , with the initial temperature of the calorimeter about as much below that of the water jacket as the final temperature is above it ; yet the uncertainty of the correction does not seem to us to be diminished by that process .
We may reasonably estimate the uncertainty due to the cooling correction , by calculating what the error in the observed rate of cooling , either at the beginning or the end of the experiment , must have been in order to produce a difference of one part in a thousand in the final result .
We find in our own experiments that the error must Table I. to 00 Ergs x 10-7 .

have amounted to more than 15 per cent. We consider it unlikely that so large an error occurred always in the same direction .
Apart \#166 ; from the cooling correction , however , it is difficult to see how a differ-ence of one-tenth per cent , in our result can be prodnced unless by the accumulation of a number of small errors .
The weak , point of Mr. Griffiths ' determination is the small quantity of water he uses , his result depending on the difference in his rate of rise after the addition of about 120 grams into his calorimeter .
The highest water equivalent with which he worked was about 360 grams , of which 85 are due to the calorimeter itself .
The chief objection to the use of such small quantities of water lies in the great cooling correction .
In the experiments quoted by him at p. 482 , the loss of heat due to radiation and conduction at the end of his experiment amounts to about 9 per cent , of his heat supply .
If such loss had been wrongly estimated to 1 per cent. , an error of one-tenth per cent , would result in the final value .
The consistency of Mr. Griffiths ' results shows that if an error occurred due to that cause , it must have been systematic ; and we may point out how , with such a large cooling correction , serious errors may arise .
In applying the cooling correction , it is always assumed that the loss of heat depends only on the difference of temperature between the calorimeter and enclosure ; but , as has been already pointed out , this is not the case as regards conduction .
Mr. Griffiths ' calorimeter was suspended by three stout glass tubes , through one of which the stirrer was passing .
The exhaustion in the space surrounding the calorimeter was never sufficient to do away with the conduction of air ; so that we may take the larger part of the cooling to be due to conduction and convection .
The loss of heat in that case must to some extent depend , not only on the temperature , but also on the rate .of change of temperature .
Whether the part which depends on the rate of change is sufficient to produce a sensible difference in the result , it is not ) easy to say .
But the error produced would , with different currents and quantities of water , be the same in all cases , and could not therefore be detected by the inconsistencies thereby introduced into the results .
The difference between our value of the equivalent and that of Mr. Griffiths are , however , of smaller importance than the difference which exists between them and the equivalent as determined directly by Joule , Rowland , and Miculescu .
Joule 's latest value , which is the only one which needs consideration , is 772*65 foot-pounds , at 61'*7 Pah .
The number refers to the degree as measured by Joule 's mercury thermometer .
Rowland adds to this a correction to the air thermometer of about 3 , and another small correction for a change in the heat capacity of the apparatus , which brings the value up to about 776 .
The correction to the air thermometer has been obtained by Prof. A. Schuster and Mr. W. Gannon .
[ Nov. 22 , means of a comparison made by Joule himself with one of Rowland 's thermometers .
Joule 's original thermometers have been temporarily placed by Mr. B. A. Joule in the hands of Professor Schuster , in order that an accurate comparison may be instituted between it and modern thermometers .
A full description of the comparisons made will be given on another occasion .
The result arrived at shows that the correction is less than that assumed by Rowland , and would bring his value up only to 775 at the temperature indicated .
Griffiths compares his result with that deduced by Rowland from Joule 's observations .
Rowland combined the different values obtained by Joule in his various investigations , attaching weights according to his judgment as to their relative merits .
He finds in this way that the difference between him and Joule amounts to one part in 350 , but if equal weights are attached to all Jonle 's results , the difference is reduced to one part in 4281 .
Little value can be attached , however , to a combination of Joule 's results which gives equal weights to that obtained in 1847 and that deduced from hi3 latest and most careful work .
There is , moreover , in Rowland 's table a misprint or error in the reduction of Joule 's 1847 result from foot-pounds to kilogram-metres , which lowers the value as given by Griffiths from to about 778 .
It does not seem to us advisable to go beyond Joule 's 1878 results , and the value assigned by him in this latest research should be taken as giving his final judgment on the matter .
Reducing to the nitrogen thermometer of the Bureau International , Joule 's result is 775 foot-pounds at Greenwich , at a temperature of L60,5 C. At the same temperature Griffiths ' number is 779'8 .
Great weight must be attached to Rowland 's determination , which at the temperature to which Joule 's number applies is 777'6 , and at 19''l , 776*1 , corresponding to our 778 5 .
Rowland 's value is therefore halfway between our and Joule 's result .
But it must be taken into consideration that if the comparison between Rowland 's and Joule 's thermometers as made by the latter is to be trusted , Rowland 's value referred to the " Paris " nitrogen thermometer would be slightly reduced .
At any rate it seems probable that if his value is in error , it is rather in the direction of being too high .
We have therefore a difference of three parts in a thousand to account for between our result and that of Rowland , and of nearly four parts in a thousand between Griffiths and Rowland at a temperature of 19'T .
These results are summarised in the following table :\#151 ; Table III.\#151 ; Equivalent in foot-pounds at Greenwich at 19'T referred to the " Paris " Nitrogen Thermometer .

We now turn to an investigation of Miculescu ( 'Annales de Chimie et de Physique , ' vol. 27 , 1892 ) , in which the mechanical equivalent of heat is measured directly by what seems a very excellently devised series of experiments .
Its result is 4T857 X 107 .
He does not state the exact temperature to which this applies , but all his experiments , seem to have been made between 10 and 13 , so that we may assume 11'"5 to be the mean temperature of his experiments .
Rowland 's value at that temperature is 4'1999 X 107 .
We must draw attention to one point in Miculescu 's work which requires clearing up before we can give to it any decisive value .
Everything in the experiments depends on the measurement of a couple , the arm of the couple being the distance between two knife-edges ; one of them had to support a weight of more than 43 kilograms .
The distance between these knife-edges is said to have been 28 cms .
in all experiments .
Very insufficient information is given , however , as to how that distance was measured , and it would almost seem as if the author had trusted to the maker in adjusting the central knife-edge to the zero point of that scale .
If the apparatus is still in existence , it might be well to make sure that no error has been introduced through a wrong estimate of the distance of the lever arm .
In order to compare Miculescu 's value with that of others , we must apply a temperature correction which is somewhat doubtful ; but taking the mean of Rowland 's and Griffiths ' values as the most probable at present , we obtain at 15 ' the following table:\#151 ; Table IV.\#151 ; Equivalent in foot-pounds at Greenwich at 15 ' referred to the " Paris " Nitrogen Thermometer .

775 '778-3 776-6 780-2 779-7 If we remember that Rowland 's number referred to the " Paris " nitrogen thermometer would probably be smaller by one unit , we are struck with the fair agreement there is , on the one hand , between the results of Joule , Rowland , and Miculescu , and on the other hand between Griffiths and ourselves .
As far as we can draw any-conclusions from the comparison , it seems to point to a difference in the value obtained by the electrical and direct methods .
Whether this difference is due to some remaining error in the electrical units , or to some undiscovered flaw in the method adopted by Mr. Griffiths and ourselves , remains to be decided by farther investigation .
