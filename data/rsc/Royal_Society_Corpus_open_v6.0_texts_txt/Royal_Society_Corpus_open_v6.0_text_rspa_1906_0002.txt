28 Sir William Christie .
[ Oct. 16 , Sir William Abney 's intensity scales were impressed on the corona plates by the light of a standard candle on the night before the eclipse .
Mention should be made of the fact that had the clouds cleared away sufficiently soon to allow of photographs being taken during totality , valuable time would have been required to set the image properly in the camera , as the clock had no maintaining power to keep the image in position during the necessary windings .
The general design of the apparatus was very satisfactory , but a half-plate focal plane shutter , adapted for trial photographs of the sun for focussing purposes , would be a valuable addition .
Total Eclipse of the Sun , 1905 , August 30 .
Preliminary Account of the Observations made at Sfax , Tunisia .
By Sir William Christie , K.C.B. , Astronomer Royal .
( Received October 16 , 1905 .
) I. General Arrangements .
An expedition to observe the total solar eclipse of August 30 having been sanctioned by the Admiralty , it was arranged , in concert with the Joint Permanent Eclipse Committee , that a party from the Royal Observatory should make observations at Sfax , a town on the north coast of Africa , about 150 miles south of Tunis .
The programme of observations consisted of photographs of the corona on various scales for coronal detail and streamers , and photographs of the spectrum of the corona and chromosphere .
The observers from Greenwich who took part in the expedition were Sir William Christie , Mr. Dyson , and Mr. Davidson .
Professor Sampson , Mr. J. J. Atkinson , and Captain Brett , D.S.O. , generously volunteered their assistance and shared the work of erecting and adjusting the instruments as well as of the observations on the day of the eclipse .
The Admiralty gave instructions that H.M.S. " Suffolk " should convey the observers and instruments from Malta to Sfax and should assist in the preparations and in the observations on the day of the eclipse .
The expedition is greatly indebted to Captain Beatty , D.S.O. , and to the officers and men of the " Suffolk " for their assistance and hearty co-operation .
We are indebted to M. Eidelle , Controleur and Vice-Consul ( the representative of the French Government ) and to the Mayor and Municipality for a 1905 .

very kind reception at Sfax .
Facilities were accorded for the landing of the instruments without customs examination ; precautions were taken against the possibility of any inconvenience arising from the curiosity of the natives on the day of the eclipse , and any assistance we required , such as watering the ground to lay the dust , was readily given .
Our thanks are specially due for the excellent site for the observations afforded us by the playground of the girls ' public school being put at our disposition .
Itinerary.\#151 ; It was considered that the observers and their instruments should arrive at Sfax not later than August 19 , and it was hoped that the Admiralty might be able to make arrangements to convey them in a man-of-war from Gibraltar as the most convenient port for Sfax , it being advisable that the instruments should be conveyed directly by sea to avoid risks of overland travel and transhipments .
This was not found practicable , but H.M.S. " Suffolk " was instructed to take them from Malta .
In order to reach Malta in time , Sir William Christie , Mr. Dyson , and Mr. Atkinson , with the instruments and observing huts , had to leave London on July 29 by the P. and 0 .
S.S. " Sumatra , " arriving at Malta at 1 a.m. on August 7 .
The cases of instruments were transferred the same morning to the " Suffolk " and remained there till her departure for Sfax .
The party of observers , including Professor Sampson who joined them on August 16 , went on board the " Suffolk " on August 17 , which , after a day 's firing practice off Malta , left for Sfax on the evening of August 18 and arrived there at noon on August 19 .
The instruments were landed and carried to the site of the observing station the same day .
Mr. Davidson and Captain Brett arrived on August 20 , having come directly from England vid Marseilles .
After the eclipse on August 30 the dismounting of the instruments was at once commenced .
The same evening the undeveloped photographs were taken from the carriers and carefully packed .
The cases containing the photographs and instruments were put on board the " Suffolk " on September 1 , which sailed the same evening for Malta .
At Malta they were transferred to a lighter , where they remained till September 8 , when they were put on board the P. and 0 .
S.S. " Formosa , " which sailed for England early the next morning , arriving at Gravesend on September 17 , the cases of photographs and instruments being landed at the Albert Docks on September 19 , and brought direct to the Eoyal Observatory .
The observers returned to England in different ways .
Sir William Christie and Mr. Dyson accompanied the photographs and instruments , Mr. Davidson and Captain Brett returned as far as Malta on the " Suffolk , " and Professor Sampson and Mr. Atkinson proceeded directly to England , vid Tunis .
Sir William Christie .
[ Oct. 16 , In connection with the travelling arrangements and carriage of the instruments thanks are due to the P. and 0 .
S.S. Company , who allowed the instruments to be taken as passengers ' luggage , free of charge , and also for the careful handling of the cases containing plates , lenses , mirrors , etc. We are also indebted to Admiral Bromley , Superintendent of the Malta Dockyard , for the facilities and care taken in the transhipments at Malta .
Station.\#151 ; The station occupied was at Sfax , in Tunisia , and was situated some 10 or 12 miles north of the central line .
In the choice of station we were assisted by Mr. Leadbetter , of Tripoli , and by Mr. Leonardi , the British Vice-Consul at Sfax .
The Trench Authorities kindly placed the playground of the girls ' public school at the disposal of the expedition , as the eclipse occurred during the school holidays .
This playground was an excellent station , being of a convenient size , enclosed , and within a few minutes ' walk of the hotel at which the observers stayed .
In addition , on one side of the ground there was cover from the sun , which was useful during the unpacking and packing of the instruments , and during the putting together of the huts , and there were also the schoolrooms available for writing , etc. , and storing plates , mirrors , etc. , till they were required .
The latitude and longitude of the observing station are approximately:\#151 ; Long. , 10 ' 46 ' = 43 m. 4 s. E. ; Lat. , 34 ' 40 ' K The accompanying plan shows the arrangement of the four instruments .
Erection of Instruments , etc.\#151 ; As in the previous eclipses observed at Ovar and in Sumatra , the boxes in which the instruments were carried were utilised as stands on which to mount them .
The boxes were weighted with 100 lb. practice projectiles lent by the " Suffolk .
" The instruments were protected by light wooden framed huts covered with Willesden waterproof canvas .
The huts were fitted together at Greenwich and the woodwork marked so that they could be erected quickly .
The huts covering the Thompson coronagraph and the astrographic telescope were alike , and each consisted of two equal and similar parts , which could be bolted together .
When the instrument was in use , the section of the hut over the ccelostat mirror was withdrawn a few feet , to give a clear view of the sun .
Each section was 8 feet square and 6 feet high , rising to 8 feet at the gable .
The canvas was stretched over the top and sides in two lengths , and tacked to the framework .
The ends of the section covering the camera were fitted with canvas panels , which were removed during observations .
The spectrographs were in a similarly constructed hut consisting of only one section 8 feet square , with panels at one end .
The double tube mounted on the Dallmeyer photoheliograph stand , when not in use , was covered with a piece of canvas .

Lieutenant Ballantyne changed plates of quartz spectrograph .
Lieutenant Hop wood made drawing of the corona .
Lieutenant Biddlecombe ( R.N.R. ) gave the exposures for Professor Sampson .
Mr. Eason gave the exposures for Mr. Davidson .
Two petty officers counted seconds with a metronome in turns for each minute during the totality .
A petty officer also recorded the times of exposure for the Astronomer Royal .
In addition , eight seamen , two at each instrument , assisted by handing the plate-holders to the observers .
The general arrangements for the observations were exactly similar to those made at Ovar and in Sumatra .
The programme of observations was rehearsed on the afternoons of September 27 and September 29 .
Day of the Eclipse.\#151 ; Each day , till August 29 , although there was sometimes a little cloud in the early mornings , the sky was invariably cloudless in the afternoons\#151 ; the time of the eclipse .
August 29 was cloudless , but there was a " scirocco , " and the maximum temperature was 100 ' Fahr. , which was several degrees higher than on previous days .
On August 30 there were clouds at sunrise , which increased later with haze round the sun .
This partly cleared away , but some haze remained , with passing clouds through the eclipse .
The inner corona was very bright all round the sun , but no great extensions or streamers were remarked .
A drawing made by Lieutenant Hopwood on board the " Suffolk " shows the maximum extension visible to the eye to have been only 20 ' from the sun 's limb , though the photographs show much greater extension .
The only star seen , although watch was kept by several of the officers of the " Suffolk , " was Regulus .
Watch was kept on board the " Suffolk " for possible electrical disturbances during the eclipse which might affect the wireless telegraphy instruments .
Lieutenant Ballantyne has furnished the following report:\#151 ; " The wireless telegraphy instruments of the ' Suffolk ' were connected up and kept in sensitive adjustment for receiving from 8 a.m. on August 29 to 8 p.m. on August 31 .
The 'plain ' and ' B ' receiving jiggers were used in the receiving boxes , and the magnetic detector was also used for receiving .
" Observations were taken every two hours , and from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. the instruments were under continual observation .
" No unusual atmospheric disturbances were observed during these three 1905 .
] Eclipse Observations made at Tunisia .
days , and from 8 A.M. to 6 p.m. on August 30 the atmosphere was quite free from electricity affecting the installation .
" During the eclipse special care was taken to detect any disturbances , but nothing was recorded by the instruments .
" Development of the Photographs.\#151 ; Although provision was made for developing at Sfax trial photographs taken for adjustments before the eclipse , it was arranged to bring the eclipse photographs home and develop them at Greenwich , " where the development could be carried on at greater leisure and under much more favourable conditions as regards temperature and water supply .
The evening of the eclipse they were all taken out of their carriers and carefully packed in cardboard boxes .
These were packed in tins , which were fastened by medical strapping so that they were air-tight .
Although three weeks elapsed before any of the photographs were developed , no deterioration of any kind appears to have taken place .
The photographs were developed between September 21 and September 27 by Mr. Davidson and Mr. Melotte under Sir W. Christie 's directions .
In general the developer used was weak hydroquinone ( one-third of the normal strength ) and the development was continued for from 15 to 30 minutes .
In a few cases pyro-soda or pyro-metol was used .
The development was arranged so as to give a graduated series of photographs ranging from those showing the wisps of corona over the prominences to those giving all the extension it was possible to obtain .
Previous to development Abney squares , with exposures adapted to the circumstances in each case , were printed on a number of the photographs .
II .
Photographs of the Corona .
Four series of photographs were taken of the corona :\#151 ; ( i ) With the Thompson coronagraph on the scale of 4 inches to the sun 's diameter ; ( ii ) With the object-glass of the astrographic telescope on the scale of 1\#163 ; inches ( 32 mm. ) to the sun 's diameter ; ( iii ) With a Dallmeyer rapid rectilinear lens of 34 inches focus working at / /8 on the scale of 0*3 inch to the sun 's diameter ; and ( iv ) With a Unar lens by Ross of 12 inches focus working at / / 5 on the scale of O'12 inch to the sun 's diameter .
The photographs with the Thompson coronagraph would give the structural detail , particularly of the inner corona , while those with the astrographic object-glass should give a much greater extension in the coronal streamers .
The photographs with the Dallmeyer are similar to those with the VOL. lxxvii.\#151 ; a. D Sir William Christie .
[ Oct. 16 , astrographic object glass , but on a much smaller scale , while those with the Unar lens having a large field give the sky round the sun for the detection of a possible intra-mercurial planet .
Clouds round the sun unfortunately interfered with the coronal streamers , without , however , affecting the details in the inner corona , and the full advantage of the light grasping power of the astrographic telescope with the longer exposures was , to some extent , lost , the development having to be limited owing to the brightness of the sky background .
( 1 ) Photographs of the Corona on a Scale of 4 inches to the Sun 's Diameter .
( Taken by Sir William Christie .
) The instrument used was the Thompson photographic telescope with object-glass of 9 inches aperture and 8 feet 6 inches focal length , in combination with a concave telephoto lens by Dallmeyer of 4 inches aperture and 16 inches focus , fitted as a secondary magnifier , to give an image of the sun 4 inches in diameter , with a field for full pencils of 14 inches .
The total length of the coronagraph was 12 feet , the equivalent focal length being 36 feet .
The sun 's light was reflected into the telescope by a 16-inch plane mirror with coelostat mounting .
The telescope was mounted on boxes loaded with 100-lb .
shot , providing a firm stand , and was depressed about 5 ' in the azimuth 16 ' S. of W. The adjustment of the ecelostat wras made in the usual manner by observations of the declination of the sun with the attached theodolite .
The clock was rated by observations of the sun 's image on the ground gla\amp ; s of the camera .
The telescope was focussed by means of the image of a gauze net in the plane of the plate reflected back from the plane mirror of the ccelostat , * in the same manner as in previous eclipses since 1896 .
It is of interest to note that the position of the focus was found to be the same as in the eclipses of 1900 and 1901 .
The camera was furnished with eight plate holders to take 15 x 15-inch plates , or for the shorter exposures 12 x 10-inch plates in a carrier .
The following table indicates the plates taken , with the times of exposure reckoned from the beginning of the eclipse .
It was proposed to take eight photographs , but owing to the very bright group of prominences at the point of second contact , and a want of definition in the image on the ground glass , several seconds elapsed before it was realised that totality had begun .
In consequence of this and a little difficulty with the plate holders , owing to the camera end being warped by * ' Monthly Notices R. A. S. , ' vol. 57 , p. 105 ; ' Roy .

\#171 ; the sun 's heat , only seven plates were exposed , the sun coming out just before the eighth plate could be exposed .
This plate was subsequently exposed for orientation about 20 minutes after totality , the aperture of the object-glass being reduced to 1 inch , and three instantaneous exposures being given at suitable intervals with the clock stopped .
It is of interest to note that totality occurred about 15 seconds before the time computed from the data in the Nautical Almanac , the local time being supplied by Commander Hyde from sextant observations .
Abney squares were printed after return to Greenwich on the Photographs 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 by exposure to a standard candle for the times and at the distances indicated in the above table .
The photographs were developed at Greenwich , normal Irydroquinone diluted to one-third strength being used except for No. 4 , for which pyro-soda similarly diluted was used .
The time of development varied from 13 minutes for No. 2 to 30 minutes for No. 5 , being carefully regulated by examination of the plates one by one as developed , so as to give a progressive series extending from the prominences and inner corona to the streamers .
The series of photographs shows very interesting detail in the inner corona associated with prominences , supporting the evidence for the connection between prominences and coronal structure shown in the photographs of 1898 , 1900 , and 1901 , and exhibits the perspective of the coronal rays in a striking manner .
The inner corona in this eclipse seems to be in a state of turmoil ( all round the sun 's limb ) , corresponding to the sunspot and prominence activity of the sun , oval rings and arched structures above the prominences being a special feature , whilst the streamers are relatively faint and generally distributed round the sun , without any indication of polar plumes or equatorial extension , the only feature suggesting polar plumes being at the sun 's equator on the east side .
Another interesting D 2 Sir William Christie .
[ Oct. 16 , feature is a dark ray strikingly shown as a vacuity in the coronal streamers .
The very bright prominence on the east limb , extending over an arc of more than 30 ' , associated with oval rings and arches in the corona , is conspicuous on all the photographs from the beginning to the end of totality .
As regards extension , coronal rays can be traced on No. 5 to a distance of fully 30 ' from the sun 's limb .
( 2 ) Photographs of the Corona on a Scale of Inches to the Sun 's Diameter .
( Taken by Mr. Davidson .
) \#187 ; These photographs were taken with the object-glass of the astrographic equatorial .
The aperture is 13*0 inches , or 033 m. , and the focal length 1351 inches , or 343 m. , so that the scale is 1 mm. to 1 ' , and the diameter of the sun 's image 32 mm. , or T26 inches .
It was arranged to use this object-glass as a telescope fixed in an approximately horizontal position , in conjunction with a 16-inch ccelostat as in the case of the Thompson coronagraph .
A wooden tube was constructed at Greenwich to carry the object-glass , and to take plate-holders with 10-inch x 10-inch plates .
The wooden tube , half an inch thick , was in three sections of equal length , provided with flanges by which the sections were screwed together .
Two of the sections\#151 ; the central one , and the one to which the object-glass was attached\#151 ; were square , of 14 inches inside measurement .
One of the sides of the third section ( the top side as the tube was mounted for the observations ) sloped downwards from a height of 14 inches to 12 inches in order to clear the lever which opened the dark slides .
A wooden frame was fitted at the end of the tube to carry the dark slides , so that the 10 inch x 10 inch plates should be at the centre of the field .
A mahogany block was fixed to the object-glass section of the tube , into which a steel ring of 13| inches internal diameter and breadth 2f inches was let .
The cell of the object-glass was attached to this ring by three adjusting screws in exactly the same way as it is attached to the tube of the astrographic equatorial .
The tilt of the object-glass and of the plate were adjusted by means of a small collimating telescope .
The focus was carefully determined by photographs of stars taken at Sfax , and the necessary adjustment made by moving the object-glass .
An examination of the eclipse photographs shows that the focal adjustment was remarkably good .
The adjustments of the coelostat were made by means of the attached theodolite , and the clock was rated by means of the image on the ground glass .

The greatest extension is shown on No. 5 , which shows the corona to a distance of about 70 ' from the sun 's limb .
With a sky free from haze and cloud , much greater extension would doubtless have been obtained , as the development had to be stopped when the sky came up on the plates .
The photographs with shorter exposures on slower plates show the structure of the corona in beautiful detail , and supplement and confirm those taken with the Thompson coronagraph .
( 3 ) and ( 4 ) Small Scale Photographs .
( Taken by Professor Sampson .
) The double camera was used exactly as at Ovar and in Sumatra , mounted equatorially on the stand of the Dallmeyer photoheliograph .
The Dallmeyer rapid rectilinear lens is of 4 inches aperture and 34 inches focus , and the Unar lens , by Eoss , of 2'4 inches aperture , and 12 inches focus .
Seven plate-holders , each taking a pair of 16 cm .

The width of the slit was adjusted by means of the diffraction image ?
according to the method given by Mr. Newall .
In order to get a greater length of spectrum in focus the plate-holders wrere made so as to carry two plates 3jr inches wide , inclined at a suitable angle , instead of each carrying one of 6J inches .
The length of the spectra are as follows:\#151 ; Flint spectroscope , green end , 38 mm. from I)3(A5876 ) to FQ(A4861 ) .
Flint spectroscope , blue end , 59 mm. from A , 4500 to H ( A 3968 ) .
Quartz spectroscope , blue end , 55 mm. from the helium line at A 4471 to the titanium line at A 3685 .
Nothing was shown on the plate in the extreme ultra-violet .
The spectroscopes were mounted horizontally and supplied with light by a heliostat with a 12-inch mirror .
The two spectroscopes were adjusted so that the slits were nearly tangential to the sun 's limb .
The following diagram shows the position of the sun 's image on the slit as nearly as it can be inferred from the spectrographs .
The position of the prominence has been drawn on the diagram from one of the coronagraphs .
It happened that the second contact coincided within 1 ' with the point when the sun 's image reflected by the heliostat could be made to touch the slit , and the spectroscopes were adjusted for the slits to be as nearly tangential as possible .

Sir William Christie .
[ Oct. 16 , " flash " spectra were unsuccessful , but extremely interesting spectrographs of the corona and the large prominence were obtained .
The exposure was approximately 3 minutes , lasting from about 20 seconds after the beginning to 10 seconds from the end of totality .
The plates used were Barnet ortho-chromatic in the green and Rocket in the blue and violet .
In the above diagram , which is drawn to scale , the line ABCDF gives the breadth of the spectra obtained .
The continuous spectrum is shown corresponding to the lines A B and C F , but is strongest in the part A B. Chromospheric lines are shown in the part corresponding to C D , and end sharply .
The part corresponding to B C is blank , except that the bright corona lines at 5303 and 4231 stretch right across it .
No chromospheric lines are seen in the part A B. The continuous spectrum is shown to a distance of 3/ -3 from the sun 's limb .
It is shown on the different photographs from D3(X5876 ) to X 3550 .
In the bright-line spectrum two new lines are clearly shown at X 5536 and X 5117 .
These are shown where the corona spectrum is strongest , and where there are no prominence lines .
Their position is fixed relatively to the green coronium line at 5303 .
The lines 4231 , 3987 , and 3801 are also strongly shown , while lines at 4361 , 4086 , and 3643 are faintly shown .
The lines at 5536 and 5117 are probably the lines which have been referred to by previous observers , as seen in the neighbourhood of the green line .
The green line 5303 is very strongly shown .
As the green coronal line stretches through the part of the spectrum where the prominence lines are shown , it is possible to determine its wave-length with reference to them .
Unfortunately they are somewhat distant .

green line and the two new lines , the lines D3 ( X 5876 ) , ( 5184 ) and ( 4861 ) being used to determine the constants of Hartmann 's formula .
Judging from photographs taken in Sumatra and reduced with these three lines as standards , the correction required by the formula near X 5303 cannot exceed 02 .
The wave-lengths are provisional to this extent , and measures will be made to determine , if possible the amount of this correction .
The wave-length of the blue coronal line is found to be 4231T .
The wave-lengths of the other lines have not yet been determined .
The possibility of a party from the Eoyal Observatory occupying a station in Labrador was considered at first , but afterwards given up as impracticable .
In April , however , Mr. Maunder received an invitation to join the party sent out by the Canadian Government to Hamilton Inlet at the head of Lake Melville .
In this way the possibility arose of obtaining comparable large- and small-scale photographs of the corona taken at a considerable interval of time apart .
Mr. Maunder took with him the Dallmeyer coronagraph , a 4-inch lens which , in combination with a 3-inch concave telephoto lens , formed a telescope of 21 feet equivalent focal length , and gave an image of the sun of 2^ inches .
He also had the Abney lens belonging to the Royal Astronomical Society , a lens exactly similar to the Dallmeyer lens used by Professor Sampson at Sfax .
Unfortunately it was completely overcast on the day of the eclipse , and no observations could be made .
