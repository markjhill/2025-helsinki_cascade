] The theory of the figures of the planets involves two questions perfectly distinct from each other ; first , the figure which a mass of matter would assume by the mutual attraction of its particles , combined with a centrifugal force , arising from rotatory motion ; and secondly , theforce with which a body so formed will attract a particle occupying any proposed situation .
The latter is the subject of the present inquiry ; and it is also limited to the consideration of homogeneous bodies bounded by finite surfaces of the second order .
This subject was first partially treated of by Sir Isaac Newton , who , in determining the attraction of spherical bodies , has also treated of other solids , formed by the rotation of curves round an axis , and of the attractions they exert upon bodies placed in the line of their axes .
MacLaurin was the first who determined the attractions that such spheroids of revolutions exert on particles placed anywhere , either in or within their surfaces .
Le Gendre extended the same inquiry to particles without the surface of such solids of revolution .
La Place took a more enlarged view , and extended his researches to all elliptic spheroids , not formed by revolution , but such whose three principal sections are all elliptical ; and he arrived at conclusions , with regard to them , similar to those of MacLaurin and Le Gendre .
But notwithstanding the ingenuity and skill displayed by La Place in this investigation , Mr. Ivory conceived that the inquiry might be simplified , and the results obtained more directly , by a method which forms the subject of the present communication ; which , however , is of a nature not adapted for public reading .
