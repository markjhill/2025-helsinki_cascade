On the Constitution of the Resins , Part V. By James F. W. Johnston , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S. In this paper the author continues his examination of what are called the fetid resins , and from repeated analyses deduces for the resin of Sagapenum the formula C40 H2 !
, O , , , and for that of Galbanum C , l0 H^7 07 .
He then compares the formulae for the four resins : Opoponax = C40 H25 014 , Assafcetida == C40 H26 Ol0 , Galbanum = C40 Ho7 070 , Sagapenum = C40 H290Q ; and considers it probable that , though no striking analogy among the irrational formulas for these resins is perceptible , by which their analogy in physical properties can be accounted for , that they may possess an analogous rational constitution , which future researches may disclose .
Euphorbium consists of two resins , of which the more soluble , A , gave the formula C40H3 ] 06 .
Elemi also consists of two resins , of which the more soluble , A , is represented by C40 H3o 04 , and the less soluble , B , by C40 H3a O , , as had previously been shown by Hess and Rose .
The Bdellium of commerce contains much gum , and a resin C40HJ1O !
j. The resin of Benzoin presented peculiar difficulties when submitted to investigation , from the ease with which it undergoes decomposition , even at temperatures much below that at which it melts .
With regard to this resin , the author gives the following as the result of his numerous analyses : § 1 .
That the colourless resin of benzoin is represented approxi ?
mately by C40 H22 09 .
2 .
That by heat and dilute carbonated alkalies it is decomposed into water , benzoic acid , a little volatile oil , and a resin C40 H23 09 , or C40 H24 09 .
3 .
That by boiling with quicklime , or concentrated carbonated alkalies , it gives two resins , one in large quantity = C40 H24 08 ; and another in small quantity = C40 H30 07 .
4 .
That by caustic potash the crude resin is resolved into two re ?
sins represented respectively by C40 H22 0L ) , and C40 H30 07 , of which the former is precipitated , and the latter remains in solution , when a saturated aqueous solution of caustic potash is added to an alcoholic solution of the crude resin .
5 .
And that by oxide of lead two resins are separated , for which analysis gave respectively the formula ?
C40H22Oy and C40H26O10 .
The author concludes by stating that such metamorphoses are by no means confined to this resin , though the more accurate knowledge of their nature , obtained by the imperfect study he has made of the resin of benzoin , has explained many anomalies he had pre ?
viously observed , with regard to the relations of the resins to the al ?
kalies and metallic oxides .
He considers the group of which dragon 's blood is the type , and which he represents by the expression C40 H24 ?
x 09 to be peculiarly susceptible of modification ( or decomposition ?
) by the action of bases ; and he specifies among other results , with regard to which it is his intention to address the Society in a future paper , that dragon 's blood , of which the lump variety s= C40 H21 08 , and the drop variety ( heated to 300 ?
F. ) = C40 Ho0 08 , gives by the action of quicklime and oxide of lead , among other products , two resins represented approximately by C40H20Ol0 and C40H20O12§§that guiacum = C40H23OJ0 , with oxide of lead , gives a resin = C40 H21 On , the resin of jalap = C4 ?
H34 0,8 ; by the action of the same oxide , a resin = C40H34 O20 , and that of assafoetida = C40 H26O10 , a new resin = C40H23 0^3 .
These metamorphoses lead to the second great branch of inquiry respecting the nature and constitution of the resins .
Certain results being established , at least approximately , with regard to the irrational constitution of the resins , and certain general irrational formula ?
by which to express it , we are prepared for the study of their rational constitution .
This part of the subject the author proposes to consider farther in subsequent communications .
