88 Effect of Carbon .
According to KARSTEN* , copper takes up 0'2 per cent. of carbon ; we could not , however , obtain wires containing more than 0'05 per cent. This small quantity causes the conducting power to decrease considerably .
Thus galvanoplastic copper in small pieces was fused down with lamp-black , and gave , upon analysis , 0 05 per cent. of carbont ; and for the conducting power we found o Mean .

Effect of Phosphorus .
Phosphorus alters the properties of copper to a very great extent ; it becomes very much harder , and its tenacity is greatly impaired .
Of all the impurities , this has the greatest reducing effect on the conducting power of copper .
Red phosphorus was thrown on melted copper in a tobacco-pipe and re-fused .
The amount of phosphorus was determined as phosphate of magnesia .

Effect of Sulphur , Selenium , and Tellurium .
Sulphide of copper does not appear to dissolve in copper , but merely to mix with it mechanically .
It makes the copper very brittle ; and although we succeeded in drawing a wire which contained , according to the analysis , 0418 per cent. of sulphur , the values obtained for the conducting power did not agree at all with each other .
The mean of four determinations gave 88'58 at 19 ?

Traces of selenium and tellurium make copper so rotten that we were unable to draw it .
5 .
Effect of Arsenic .
When arsenic is thrown upon melted copper the greater part of it is absorbed , whilst a part volatilizes ; and on re-fusing the alloy formed , if a large quantity of arsenic has been used , it has a dingy grey colour , and is very hard and brittle .
We managed to draw an alloy containing 5'40 per cent. of arsenic to the diameter of 0'29 millim. ; and had we had draw-plates with finer holes at our disposal , we might have drawn it much finer , -a fact , which does not at all agree with the assertions lately made , that copper with a small amount of arsenic cannot be drawn into fine wire .
The arsenic was determined as arseniate of magnesia .
The following values show that arsenic greatly reduces the conducting power of copper : I. Copper with 5'40 per cent. of arsenic II .
Copper with 2'80 per cent. of arsenic III .

Effect of Heating in a current of Ammonia .
Several experimenters state , that when copper is heated in ammonia , the gas is decomposed and nitride of copper formed , a fact which SCHROTTER* disputes , and has been proved totally incorrect by DICK .
We repeated the experiment by heating a copper wire , whose conducting power had been previously determined , for a quarter of an hour in a current of dry ammonia ; when cold , the conducting power was found the same , and the wire was as ductile as before .
In all probability the reason why in the experiments of previous observers the copper became brittle , was ( as already suggested by DICK ) that they used copper containing suboxide .
7 .
Effect of the Metals .
The electric conductivity of copper is not so much impaired by the presence of small quantities of foreign metals as by that of the metalloids ; it is , however , very considerably diminished by iron and tin .
The union of the copper with the other metals was effected in the manner before described , which offers in this case the additional advantage , that , by the constant movement caused by the hydrogen in the melted metals , the most intimate combination results .
The amount of the metals thus alloyed with the copper was determined by analysis .

Now the copper smelters add a small quantity of lead to their copper , to soften and render it more tough .
The addition of lead is supposed to reduce the suboxide of copper present ; but , according to J. NAPIER'S * analysis , lead was always found present where it had been added , and often in quantities equal to the amount which had been put in .
We have therefore made a few experiments in this direction .
To copper fused in contact with air 0-1 per cent. of lead or tin was added , and the alloy fused in the tobacco-pipe in a current of carbonic acid gas .

The experiments , however , tend to prove that on the addition of traces of lead , &amp;c. to copper containing suboxide , a relatively purer metal is obtained .
From the foregoing experiments , we may conclude that there is no alloy of copper which conducts electricity better than pure copper ; and in conclusion , in order to be able to compare their results with those of others , we would call the attention of experimentersIT , To the importance of stating whether the wires experimented with are hard drawn or annealed , as it makes in some cases a very marked difference in the values obtained .

As the electric conducting power of copper varies so much according to different experimenters , we thought it would be of some interest to study the causes of these differences ; and on comparing the values found for copper , we find that , taking silver =100 , copper conducts according to BECQITEREL* RIESS LENZ4 DAVY ?

By precipitating sulphate of copper galvanoplastically by a very weak current .
We have also tested the galvanoplastic copper of commerce , and have found that its conducting power is the same as that of the copper we prepared .
The method used for the determinations was the same as that described in the Philosophical Magazine ( February 1857 ) .
The diameters of the wires used were about 0*25 to 0'5 millim. , and the lengths from 0'5 to 1*5 metre ; and of each specimen of copper or alloy two or three determinations were made with wires of different diameters .

1 .
Effect of Oxygen ( Suboxide of Copper ) .
Copper readily absorbs oxygen from the air when in a fused state ; and it is supposed to be present as suboxide , which it retains very obstinately ; and in fact we may lead hydrogen over fused copper , in a porcelain tube , for hours without completely reducing the suboxide .
It is also very difficult to prevent the oxygen being absorbed during casting , &amp;c. In order to prevent all these sources of error , we thought that in making the alloys of copper by the following method , we might obviate them : Fig. I shows the disposition of the apparatus .
In the furnace-door communicating with a closed muffle are two holes ; through the upper one passes a glass tube connected with a carbonic acid gas apparatus , through the lower one passes a clay tobacco-pipe , to the stem of which is joined the bottle evolving hydrogen .
The hydrogen is washed with Fig. 1 .
potash , nitrate of silver , and concentrated sulphuric acid , and the carbonic acid gas with bicarbonate of potash and strong sulphuric acid .
The metal ( about 8 grms. were taken for each experiment ) was placed in the bowl of the pipe , and so fused in a current of hydrogen ; when fused , the hydrogen bubbled up through the melted metal ; thus by offering a fresh surface to the hydrogen , any suboxide that might be present was reduced ; and when making the copper alloys complete mixture was effected .
When the hydrogen had passed through for a certain length of time , the india-rubber tubing was disconnected from the sulphuric acid bottle , and the fused Fig. 2 .
metal carefully sucked into the pipe-stem , forming , as shown by fig. 2 , a wire which might , if necessary , be drawn finer .
The carbonic acid gas was used to help ... . .
to drive the air out of the muffle , as well as in some experiments which will be presently detailed .
In order to test the method , copper No. 3 was fused in the pipe , and kept so for about half an hour , when we found the conducting powero Mean .
a. 92'57 at 17.8}92.99 at 17 ?
05 b. 93-40 at 17-2J In this manner we have been able to reduce the suboxide in the copper by degrees : all the alloys made were fused in this manner , only substituting carbonic acid gas in cases in which hydrogen could not be employed .
We did not try to determine quantitatively the amount of suboxide present in the copper , as we know of no method which will give results which can be depended upon* .
We shall only give the conducting power of copper that had been fused in contact with
