Let A be the given cube root .
Erect the perpendicular ; bisect AB in , and with radius describe the arcs intersecting at ; let fall the perpendiculnr and trisect ; then , with radius from as a centre , describe the arc I cutting in ; join A , which will be nearly equal to the cube root of double the cube of A , the amount of error being very small , which is proved as under .

Quadrature of the Circle .
In and about a given circle , as A , draw the inscribed and tangent quares i the manner indicated by the figure , with their diagonaIs .
Draw the diameter A bisecting the opposite sides of the said squares ; bisect AB in , and in ; set off from and respectively EG and equnl to and join ; from let fall EH perpendicular to with radius describe the circle HK ; dr the line touching diagonals , shown by the diagram , which will be one side of a square very nearly equaI to the circle A [ The author has appended a mathematical calculalion proving , somewhat indirect manner , that his construction gives an exceedingly doae approximation .
The construction leads directly to the following result : Let the radius of the circle taken as unity , and let be a side of the square given by the construction ; then ' where is the radius of the circle , and the tangent of the indination ot to AE .
Mr. Hayden has reduced these expressions to numbers , with the ing result : \mdash ; instead of September .
