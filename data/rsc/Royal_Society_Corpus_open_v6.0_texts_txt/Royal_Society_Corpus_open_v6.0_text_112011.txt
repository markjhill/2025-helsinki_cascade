" Experiments to determinie the effects of impact , vibratory action , and a long-continued change of Load on Wrought-iron Girders .

( Abstract .
) The author observes that the experiments which were undertaken , nearly twenty years ago , to determine the strength and form of the Tubular Bridges which now span the Conway and Menai Straits , led to the adoption of certain forms of girder , such as the tubular , the plate , and the lattice girder , and other forms founided on the principle developed in the construction of these bridges .
It was at first designed that the ultimate strength of these structures should be six times the heaviest load that could ever be laid upon them , after deducting half the weight of the tubes .
This was considered a fair margin of strength ; but subsequent considerations , such as generally attend a new principle of construction with arn untried material , showed the expediency of increasing it ; and instead of the ultimate strength being six times , it was in some instances increased to eight times the weight of the greatest load .
The proved stability of these bridges gave increased confidence to the engineer and the public , and for several years the resistance of six times the heaviest load was considered an amply sufficient provision of strength .
But a general demand soon arose for wrought-iron bridges , and many were made without due regard to first principles , or to the law of proportion necessary to be observed in the sectional areas of the top and bottom flanges , so clearly and satisfactorily shown in the early experiments .
The result of this was the construction of weak bridges , many of them so ill-proportioned in the distribution of the material as to be almost at the point of rupture with little more than double the permanent load .
The evil was enhanced by the erroneous system of contractors tendering by weight , which led to the introduction of bad iron , and in many cases equally bad workmanslhip .
The deficiencies and break-downs which in this way followed the first successful application of wrought iron to the building of bridges led to doubts and fears as to their security .
Ultimately it was decided by the Board of Trade that in wrought-iron bridges the straini with the heaviest load should not exceed 5 tons per square inch ; but on what principle this standard was establishled does not appear .
The requirement of 5 tons per square inch did not appear sufficiently definite to secure in all cases the best form of construction .
It is well known that the powers of resistance to strain in wrought iron are widely different , according as we apply a force of tension or compression ; it is even possible so to disproportion the top and bottom areas of a wrought-iron girder calculated to support six times the rolling load , as to cause it to yield with little more than half the ultimate strain or 10 tons on the square inch .
For example , in wrought-iron girders with solid tops it requires the sectional area in the top to be nearly double that of the bottom to equalise the two forces of tension and compression ; and unless these proportions are strictly adhered to in the construction , the 5-ton strainl per square inch is a fallacy which may lead to dangerous errors .
Again , it was ascertained from direct experiment that double the quantity of material in the top of a wroughtiron girder was not the most effective form for resisting compression .
On the contrary , it was found that little more than half the sectional area of the top , when converted into rectangular cells , was equivalent in its powers of resistance to double the area when formed of a solid top plate .
This discovery was of great value in the construction of tubes and girders of wide span , as the weight of the structure itself ( which increases as the cubes , and the strength only as the squares ) forms an important part of the load to which it is subjected .
On this question it is evident that the requirements of a strain not exceeding 5 tons per square inch cannot be applied in both cases , and the rule is therefore ambiguous as regards its application to different forms of structure .
In that rule , moreover , there is nothing said about the dead weight of the bridge ; and we are not informed whether the breakingweight is to be so many times the applied weight plus the multiple of the load , or , in other words , whether it includes or is exclusive of the weight of the bridge itself .
These data are wanting in the railway instructions ; and until some fixed rinciple of construction is determined upon , accompanied by a standard measure of strength , it is in vain to look for any satisfactory results in the erection of road and railway bridges composed entirely of wrought iron .
The author was led to inquire into this subject with more than ordinary care , not only on accouint of the imperfect state of our knowledge , but from the want of definite instructions .
In the following experimental researches he bas endeavoured to ascertain the extent to which a bridge or girder of wrought iron may be strained without injury to its ultimate powers of resistanice , or the exact amount of load to which a bridge may be subjected without endanrgering its safety-in other words , to determine the fractional strain of its estimated powers of resistance .
To arrive at correct results and to imitate as nearly as possible the strain to which bridges are subjected by the passage of heavy trains , the apparatus specially prepared for the experiments was designed to lower the load quickly upon the beam in the first instance , and next to produce a considerable amount of vibration , as the large lever with its load and shackle was left suspended upon it , and the apparatus was sufficiently elastic for that purpose .
The girder subjected to vibration in these experiments was a wrought-iron plate beam of 20 feet clear span , and of the following dimensions : Area of top. .

From these experiments it is evident that wrought-iron girders of ordinary construction are not safe when submitted to violent disturbalnces equivalenit to one-third the weight that would break them .
They , however , exhibit wonderful tenacity when subjected to the same treatment with onefourth the load ; and assuming therefore that an iron girder bridge will bear with this load 12,000,000 changes without injury , it is clear that it would require 328 years at the rate of 100 changes per dav before its security was affected .
It would , however , be dangerous to risk a load of oie-third the breaking-weight upon bridges of this description , as , according to the last experiment , the beam broke with 313,000 changes ; or a period of eight years , at the same rate as before , would be sufficient to break it .
It is more than prohable that the beam had been injured by the previous 3,000,000 changes to which it had been subjected ; and assuming this to be true , it would follow that the beam was iundergoing a gradual deterioration which must some time , however remote , have terminated in fracture .
After the beam had thus sustained one million changes of load without apparent alteration , the load was increased to 10,486 lbs. , or -2ths of the breaking-weight , and the machinery again put in motion .
With this additional weight the deflections were increased , with a permanent set of 05 inch , from *23 to '35 inch , and after sustaining 5175 changes the beam broke by tension at a short distance from the middle .
It is satisfactory here to observe that during the whole of the 1,005,175 changes none of the rivets were loosened or broken .
The beam broken in the preceding experiment was repaired by replacing the broken angle-irons on each side , and putting a patch over the broken plate equal in area to the plate itself .
A weight of 3 tons was placed on the beam thus repaired , equivalent to one-fourth of the breaking-weight , and the experiments were continued as before .
