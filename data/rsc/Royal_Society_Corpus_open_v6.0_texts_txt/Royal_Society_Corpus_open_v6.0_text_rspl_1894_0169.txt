This result might be caused by the methane and hydrogen formed during the decomposition diluting the remaining ethylene , and rendering the decomposition more difficult ; it may also arise secondary actions taking place amongst the primary products , and again forming ethylene , or it may be due to both these causes together .
In order to trace the effect of dilution , a series of experim made in which ethylene , diluted with hydrogen , was passed through 6 inches of the same tube as was used in the previous heated to the same temperature , and under precisely similar conditions .

the expel.illlents made upon the effect of length of heahd and rate of flow , and tabulating the percentages of saturaM drocarbons and corrected for change of volume , obtain the following results:\mdash ; Saturated Hydrocarbons .
The temperature employed these experiments is not high to cause any large amount of the methane to decompose , so that the volume should , according to theory , approximate to two-thirds the ethylene decomposeCl .
Action of Heat upon Ethylene .
fact that when only 1 in .
of tube is heated , there is a fairly deficit of the kind to be expected at the temperature employed , .
and that when a greater length of heated tube is used with a .
rate of flow the deficit becomes a substantial surplus , at once ggests that methane is amongst the secondary as well as the primary products of decomposition .
In the dilution expsriments , the larger contraction in the volume noticeable points to the diluting of the products favouring polymerisation .
It seems probable from the figures that when dilution reaches above per cent. , not only is decomposition of the methane retarded , but formation as a secondary product commences .
Ever since water gas has been in use it has been well known that it contained traces of methane and acetylene , under conditions which render it impossible for them to have been formedfrom hydrocarbons remaining in the incandescent fuel , and the probabilities are thab they have been produced ; the acetylene by direct combination of carbon and hydrogen , and the methane by its partial decomposition .
The formation of ethylene from nascent hydrogen and acetylene takes place at such temperatures as those employed , and the amount formed and again broken up by the radiant heat is purely a function of mass ; so that I conceive from these experiments , the ethylene at once to a great extent decomposes under the influence of ufficiently high radiant heat according to the equation:\mdash ; and that the acetylene partly decomposes , the nascent hydrogen again unlting with more acetylene to reproduce ethylene , whilst other portions of the acetylene polynlerise to benzene and other more complex ydrocarbons , and that , if the flow of this mixture be continued through a heated chamber , the action continues , the amount of ethylregenerated becoming less and less , until it ceases to exist as a product of the decomposition .

volume taken , showing that error from this cause is not likely b ) have taken place .
A new series of experiments was now undertaken to ascertain , if possible , how increase of contact with the heated walls of the con .
taining vessel affected the amount and character of the decomposition taking place .
In order to do this , a small platinum tube 25 mm. in diameter and cm .
long was taken in place of the one used in the previous periments , which was 14 mm. in diameter .
The area of the big tube therefore , as compared with the area of the small tube , was as to , and in order to obtain the relative amount of decomposition it is manifest that the rate of flow must be the same in both tubes .
If the rate of flow in the big tube be 40 .
per minute , then give the required rate for the small tube .

The ethylene used contained per cent. of unsaturated hydrocarbons , therefore the amount decomposed is\mdash ; I. II .

Turning now to the experiments made with the large tube and 40 .

15.48 rhowing that the maximum of 34 per cent. rapidly falls with increased length of flow , whilst the ratio of area of heated surface to the passing gas is , or times as great in the small tube aS in the large , yet only gives an increase of at most in the decomposition .

Dilution has but little effect in retarding the decomposition of ethylene , unless it be very large .
3 .
Increase in rate of flow diminishes the amount of decomposition when the heated area is small , but rapidly diminishss in effect as the length of flow through a heated area increases .
4 .
The decomposition of ethylene is chiefly caused by radiant heat , the eflect of which is very great as compared with the decom .
position due to contact with heated surfaces .
