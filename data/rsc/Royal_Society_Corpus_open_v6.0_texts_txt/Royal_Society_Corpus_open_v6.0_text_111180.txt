" On the Meteorology of the English Lake District , including the results of Observations on the Fall of Rain at various heights , up to 3166 feet above the Sea-Level : " Fifth paper , for the year 1851 .
By John Fletcher Miller , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received March 1 , 1852 .
The author states that the results for the past year do not seem to call for any particular remarks , and as it appears desirable , as a general rule , to defer all attempts at deduction until after the completion of the observations , the Tables for 1851 are presented , without many notes or comments , in continuation of the series which have previously appeared in the Transactions of the Society .
The table for January , 1851 , is given as an example of the daily fall of rain in the district during an excessively wet month , and also as showing the form of permanently registering the returns from the various stations , when sent in at the close of each month .
He remarks that the quantity of 38'86 inches precipitated on " The Sty " in January 1851 , is , he believes , without a parallel in the temperate zone .
