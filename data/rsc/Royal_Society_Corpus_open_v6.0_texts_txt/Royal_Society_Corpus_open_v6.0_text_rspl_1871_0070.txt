362 Messrs. C. M. Tidy and W. B. Woodman on Ammonia [ May 30 , themselves in the " fry " of the osseous fish , their absence does not affect the general skeletal morphology .
The salmon amongst fishes , like the fowl amongst birds , never attains to the greatest degree of special class-modification ; it remains , with a dentigerous maxillary , a ductus pneumaticus , a very chondrosteus state of the skull , and a very heterocercal tail .
Yet , from an ichthyological point of view , this fish is an immense height above the Sharks and Bays , and is far in advance , as a fish , of the whole group of " Ganoids .
" The results of the gradational study of the fish-forms by the zoologist , and of their secular study by the palaeontologist , are both in harmony with morphological facts .
Although the light obtained is but as the first streak of dawn , yet it is a pleasant light , and quite sufficient to show each kind of worker where and how to renew his own special toil .
I cannot close this brief abstract without remarking that my researches in these , the highest types of animals , seem to me to be in perfect accordance with the results obtained by long study of the very lowest , the Rhizopods\#151 ; namely , that they both yield increasing evidence in favour of the doctrine of Evolution .
Researches of this kind show what the life-processes can accomplish in the history of one individual animal , and also that the morphological steps and stages are not arbitrary , but take place in a manner in accordance with all that has of late been revealed to us of the gradation of types in the ages that are past .

( Abstract .
) The authors refer to the researches of Andrews , Clark , Neubauer and Vogel , and others on the presence of ammonia as a constant constituent of healthy urine , Neubauer regarding 108 grains per diem as the average normal excretion .
After numerous experiments , the authors regard this quantity as excessive , and suggest some reasons for this discrepancy .
The method adopted by the authors is as follows :\#151 ; The freshly passed urine is to be first diluted with a given bulk of distilled water , sufficient to destroy all apparent colour , a known quantity of the urine being taken in each case .
To these is to be added an excess in the Urine in Health and Disease .

] of Nessler 's solution , and then compared with the tint-depth produced by-known quantities of ammonia in a similar bulk of liquid treated with the same solution .
The trace of ammonia in the water itself must be always allowed for .
The external temperature in the observations was always about 62 ' .
They regard 60 oz. as the normal daily excretion of urine in adults .
I. Ammonia in Health .
In 50 cases the average quantity of ammonia =0,0825 gr. in 1000 grs. =2'1656 grs. per diem .
The 10 highest cases gave an average of 0*1620 gr. per 1000 grs.=4*2525 grs. per diem .
The 10 lowest cases gave an average of 0*0252 gr. per 1000 grs. = 0*6615 gr. per diem .
The mean of these 20 cases gives 0*0936 gr. per 1000 grs. = 2*457 grs. per diem .
The authors conclude that the average daily excretion of ammonia in health amounts to rather less than 2*5 grs. in 24 hours .
These results are modified by :\#151 ; 1st , age .
The amount of ammonia was largest under the age of 35 years , to the extent of a little over one third .
2nd , sex , but very slightly ( ?
) .
3rd , food .
The amount of ammonia after meals was nearly double that excreted before meals .
Their experiments seem to prove that a large proportion of the urinary ammonia is derived from the food ingested ; confirmed by other experiments .
4th , atmospheric conditions .
The authors consider that the excretion of ammonia by the kidneys is governed by a similar law to that which regulates the formation of dews .
5th , exercise increases the excretion of ammonia .
II .
Ammonia in Disease .
Before dealing with special diseases , the authors examined the influence of some general conditions both of the urine and the patients .
A , colour of the urine .
( Yogel 's colour-scale was adopted .
) From No. 1 to No. 7 the ammonia rises in proportion to colour ( jaundice and haema-turia being excluded ) .
True also , to a great extent , of normal urine .
B , specific gravity of the urine .
The general rule is that the excretion of ammonia keeps pace with the specific gravity .
C , pulse .
The lowest quantities were met with when the pulse was rapid , the highest average being met with when the pulse was nearly B , respirations .
It appears that the amount of ammonia decreases ^ith accelerated respirations .
\gt ; temperature ( axillary ) .
The largest excretion per 1000 grains is On Ammonia in the Urine in Health and Disease .
[ May 30 , arly normal temperatures ; but when the total quantity of ted , it is seen that such normal temperatures ( as in diabetes ) found with near urine is estimated , eo with increased ammonia . . . .
F , condition of skin .
The largest excretion occurred when the skin was m'G , condition of tongue .
Excretion largest with moist tongue .
H , condition of bowels .
Ammonia was slightly in excess when the bowels were open .
I , diet .
Even in various diseases the amount of ammonia was very much larger when the diet was full and included stimulants .
K , medicines .
Only acids and alkalies contrasted .
I he amount was nearly double in the case of acids .
III .
Special Diseases .
A , acute rheumatism .
In nineteen observations ammonia equalled 0*0684 gr. per 1000 grs. = 1-7955 gr. per diem .
Considerably less than normal .
B , erysipelas .
In ten observations NH3=0-0402 gr. per 1000 grs. = 1*0552 gr. per diem .
Very much under health .
C , diabetes .
In seven observations , with an average of 240 oz. o urine per diem , NH3=0*0348 gr. per 1000 grs. = 3*654 grs. per diem .
Considerably in excess of healthy urine .
D , smallpox .
In eleven cases NH3= 0-0627 gr. per 1000 grs. E , enteric fever .
In eleven cases NHa=0-0543 gr. per 1000 grs. F , typhus fever .
In two cases NII3= 0-0435 gr. per 1000 grs. N.B.\#151 ; The results of B , D , E , and F , considering that the amount ot urine will be nearer 25 oz. than 60 oz. per diem , show that the atnouD of ammonia excreted in these diseases is actually less than one fourth t ia of health .
G , cancer ( verified by post mortem examinations ) .
In five obseiva tions NH3=0-0918 gr. per 1000 grs. = 2-4097 grs. per diem .
II , heart disease ( chiefly valvular ) .
In ten cases NH3=0-0927 gr. per 1000 grs.=2-4334 grs. per diem .
I , chronic alcoholism .
In four observations NH3=0-1065 gr. per 1000 grs. = 27956 grs. per diem .
N.B____G , II , I show ammonia very nearly normal , as might be expecte K , chorea .

In eight observations NH , =0-0521 gr. per 1000 grs. M , phthisis .
In five observations NH3=0 072 gr. per 1000 grs.= l'89 gr. per diem .
N , nervous diseases .

\lt ; J , chronic nodular arthritis ( rheumatic gout ) .
In 4 observations NH3=015 gr. per 1000 grs. = 3-9375 grs. per diem , or nearly double that of health .
P , gout .
The ammonium seems to be increased in this disease .
Q , In nine cases of complicated disease , with extreme physical prostration , NHa\#151 ; 0-0009 gr. per 1000 grs.=01835 gr. per diem .
R , the cases taken just before death are very remarkable , showing a j vast decrease in the amount of ammonia .
Eight cases gave an average of NH3=0'0304 gr. per 1000 .
In two cases it was entirely absent , the only cases of entire absence known to the authors .
The authors refrain from any generalization .
The total number of cases upon which observations were made exceeded 200 .

The investigation by Graham of the gases given off by meteoric iron from Lenarto , in Hungary , when heated in a vacuum produced by a Sprengel pump , excited much interest at the time of publication* , but does not seem to have been followed up by any similar examination of i other meteorites .
I have made use of pieces of the iron found about J three years ago in Augusta Co. , Virginia , the description and analysis of i which were published by me in the * American Journal of Science ' for July 1871 , in order to repeat the experiment of Graham , and ascertain I whether similar results to his would be obtained .
A large part of the work of the extraction and analysis of the gaseous contents of this iron has been done by two of the students in my laboratory , Mr. F. P. Dunnington , of Baltimore , and Mr. J. 13 .
Adger , of South Carolina , to whom I am much indebted for their assistance .
Iwo preliminary experiments were made , \#151 ; the first with some shavings from the cutting of the iron upon a planing-machine ; the second with a \#166 ; j s'bd piece of the metal planed to smooth , clean surfaces , and quite free * Proc. Roy .
