On the ultimate analysis of vegetable and animal ' substances .
By ANDREW UR , M. D. F. R. S. Read June 27 , 1822 .
TnIHE improvements lately introduced into the analysis of vegetable and animal compounds , with the investigation of the equivalent ratios , in which their constituent elements , carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and azote are associated , have thrown an unexpected light into this formerly obscure province of chemical science .
While the substitution by M. GAY LussAc , of black oxide of copper for the chlorate of potash , ' has given peculiar facility and elegance to animal analysis , it may be doubted whether , in those cases , where the main object of inquiry is the proportion of carbon , it has not , fre .
quently , led to fallacious results .
As the quantity of this element is inferred from the volume of carbonic acid evolved in the decomposition of the organic matters , such of their particles as happen not to be in immediate contact with the cupreous oxide , will remain unconverted into carbonic acid ; and thus the proportion of carbon will come to be underrated ; an accident which cannot occur with chlorate of potash , since the carbonaceous matter is here plunged in an ignited atmosphere of oxygen .
It is probably to this cause , that we must refer the discrepant results in the analysis of pure sugar , between M. M. GAY LussAc , THENARD , and BERZELIUS , on the one hand , and Dr. PROUT , on the other ; the former gentlemen assigning about 43 parts in the hundred of carbon , while the latter states the carbon at only 40.* The objects of the present paper are , first to indicate , and endeavour to remove several sources of fallacy attending the method with peroxide of copper ; and next , to exhibit the results of its application to a considerable series of vegetable and animal compounds .
Peroxide of copper , prepared by igniting the pure nitrate of thismetal , is , like yellow oxide of lead , and many other metallic oxides , readily absorbent of a small portion of humidity from the air , the quantity of which depends , in some mnieasure , on ' the ' length of time during which it has suffered ignition .
If exposed to a red heat , merely till the vapours of'nitric acid are expelled , 100oo grains of .
the oxide will absorb , in the ordinary state of the atmosphere , from one-tenth to two-tenths of a grain of moisture in the space of an hour or two ` ; a'-ndabout one half of the above quantity in a very few minutes .
The French chemists , who have operated most with this 'agent , seem to be well aware of this circumstance , for : they direct the peroxide to be used immediately after ignition ; and to be triturated with the organic matter in a hot mortar of agate or glass .
Yet this precaution will not entirely prevent the fallacy arising from the hygrometric action for I find that peroxide thus treated does absorb , during the long trituration essential to the process , a certain quantity of moisture , which , if not taken into account , will produce serious errors , in the analytical results .
It is better therefore to leave the powdered peroxide intended for research , exposed for such ' time to the air , as to bring it to hygrometric repose , 4 Dr. PRoUT has informed me , since the above paper was written , that he re-triturated and re-ignited the contents of his tubes , in the analysis of sugar .
then to put it up in a phial , and by igniting one hundred grains of it in a proper glass tube , sealed at one end , and loosely closed with a glass plug at the other , to deterrmirne the proportion of moisture which it contains .
This , then , indicates the constant quantity to be deducted from the loss of weight which the peroxide suffers in the course of the experiment .
The mortar should be perfectly dry , but not warm .
Experimenters bhave been at great pains to bring the various organic objects of research to a state of thorough desiccation before mixing them with the peroxide of copper ; but this practice introduces a similar fallacy to that above described .
We ought , therefore , after having made them as dry as possible by the joint agencies of heat , and an absorbent surface of sulphuric acid in vacuo , to expose them to the air till they also come into hygrometric repose , noting the quantity of moisture which they imbibe , that it may be afterwards allowed for .
The plan which I adopt for the purpose of desiccation seems to answer very well .
Having put the pul verulent animal or vegetable matter into short phials , fur- , nished with ground glass stoppers , I place the open phials in a large quantity of sand heated to 21 ?
F. in.a porcelain capsule , and set this over a surface of sulphuric acid in an exhausted receiver .
After an hour or more the receiver is removed , and the phials instantly stopped .
The loss of weight shows the total moisture which each of them has parted with ; while the subsequent increase of their weight , after leaving them unstopped for some time in the open air , indicates the amount of hygrometric absorption .
This is consequently the quantity to be deducted in calculatingex.ierimental results .
459 Many chemists , particularly in this country , have employed the heat of a spirit lamp , instead of that produced by the combustion of charcoal , for igniting the tube in which the mixed materials are placed .
I have compared very carefully both methods of heating , and find that for many bodies , such as coal , and resin , which abound in carbon , the flame of the lamp is insufficient ; while its application being confined at once to a small portion of the tube , that uniform ignition of the whole , desirable towards the close of the experiment , cannot be obtained .
I was hence led to contrive a peculiar form of furnace , in which , with a handful of charcoal , reduced to bits about the size of small filberts , an experiment may be completed , without anxiety or trouble , in the space of half an hour .
Since I have operated with this instrument , the results on the same body have been much more consistent , than those previously obtained with the lamp ; and it is so convenient , that I have sometimes finished eight experiments in a day .
Fig. 1 .
( Plate L. ) represents the whole apparatus , as when in action .
Fig. 2 is a horizontal section of the furnace , in which we perceive a semi-cylinder of thin sheet iron , about 8 inches long and $L wide , perforated with holes , and resting on the edge of a hollow prism of tin-plate , represented more distinctly in fig. 3 , where i shows a slit , through which the sealed end of the glass tube may be made to project , on occasion .
i , is a handle attached to the semi-cylinder , by which it may be slid backwards or forwards , and removed at the end of the process .
d , is a sheath of platinum foil , which serves , by aid of a wire laid across , to support the middle of the tube , when it is softened by ignition .
At , g , the plates 4s6o which close the ends of the semi-cylinder and tin-plate prism , rise up a few inches to screen the pneumatic apparatus from the heat .
A third occasional screen of tin-plate is hung on at f. All these are furnished with slits for the passage of the glass tube .
This is made of crown glass , and is generally about 9 or io inches long , and.of internal diameter .
It is connected with the mercurial cistern by a narrow tube and caoutchouc collar .
This tube has a syphon form , and rises about an inch within the graduated receiver at e. By this arrangement , should the collar be not absolutely air-tight , the pressure of the column of mercury causes the atmospheric air to enter at the crevice , and bubbles of it will be seen rising up without the application of heat .
At the end of the operation , the point of the tube e , is always left above the surface of the mercury , the quantity of organic matter employed being such as to produce from 6 to 7 cubic inches of gaseous product , the volume of the graduated receiver being 7 cubic inches .
As the tubes with which I operate have all the same capacity , viz. half a cubic inch ; and as the bulk of materials is the same in all the experiments , one experiment on the analysis of sugar or resin , gives the volume of atmospheric air due to the apparatus , which volume is a constant quantity in the same circumstances of ignition .
And since the whole apparatus is always allowed to cool to the atmospheric temperature , the volume of residual gas in the tubes comes to be exactly known , being equal , very nearly , to the primitive volume of atmospheric air left after the absorption of the carbonic acid in the sugar or resin experiment.* Thus this quantity , hitherto ill appreciated or neglected in many experiments , though it is of very great consequence , may be accurately found .
At k , fig. 2 , a little tin plate screen is shown .
It is perforated for the passage of the tube , and may be slid along , and left at any part of the semi-cylindric cage , so as to preserve from the influence of the heat , any requisite portion of the sealed end of the tube .
At fig. 4 is seen the shape of the little bulb , into which I introduce the proper weight of ether , alcohol , naphtha , or other volatile liquids , which are destined for analysis .
After weighing it exactly , it is immediately slid down to the bottom of the tube , and covered with .
15o or 200 grains of peroxide of copper .
The bulb has a capacity equal to 3 grain measures of water , and its capillary point is sonietimes closed with an inappreciably small quantity of bees wax , to prevent the exhalation of the liquid , till the peroxide be ignited .
b is a cover to the furnace , with an oblong orifice at its top .
It serves for a chimney , and may be applied or removed by means of its handle , according as we wish to increase or diminish the heat .
cc are tin cases enclosing corks , through which the iron wires are passed , that support the whole furnace at any convenient height and angle of inclination .
The tightness of the apparatus at the end of the process , is proved by the rising of the mercury in the graduated receiver , by about one-tenth of an inch , as the tube becomes re_ frigerated .
My mode of operating with the peroxide of copper is the following : I triturate very carefully in a dry glass mortar , from 1 to 2grains of the matter to be analyzed , with from loo to 140 grains of the oxide .
I then transfer it , by means of a platinum-foil tray and small glass funnel into the glass tube , clearing out the mortar with a metallic brush .
Over that mixture I put 2o or go grains of the peroxide itself , and next , 50 or 6o grains of clean copper filings .
The remaining part of the tube is loosely closed with 1o or 1 grains of amianthus , by whose capillary attraction the moisture evolved in the experiment is rapidly withdrawn from the hot part of the tube , and the risk of its fracture thus completely obviated .
The amianthus serves moreover as a plug , to prevent the projection of any minute particles of filings , or of oxide , when the filings are not present .
The tube is now weighed in a very delicate balance , and its weight is written down .
A little cork , channelled at its side , is next put into the tube , to prevent the chance of mercury being forced backwards into it , by any accidental cooling or condensation .
The collar of caoutchouc is finally tied on , and the tube is placed , as is shown in fig. 2 , but without the plate k , which is employed merely in the case of analyzing volatile liquids .
A few fragments of ignited charcoal are now placed under the tube at the end of the furnace next to the cistern , and the remaining space in the semi-cylinder is filled up with bits of cold charcoal .
The top , b , may then be put in its place , when the operation will proceed spontaneously , the progressive advance of the ignition from one end to the other being proportioned to the expansion of glass , so that the tube very seldom cracks in the process .
Indeed I have often used the same tube for a dozen experiments , in the course of which it became converted into vitrite , or Reaumur 's porcelain .
Since the evolved gas is saturated with moisture , I reduce it to the volume of dry gas , by help of the following table , computed by the well known formula from my table of the elastic force of steam , which the Royal Society did me the honour to publish in their Transactions for the year 1818 .

In certain cases , where the quantity of hydrogen is small , or where , as in the example of indigo , its presence has been denied , I employ pulverulent proto-chloride of mercury ( calomel ) instead of peroxide of copper .
The organic compound being intimately mixed with that powder , and gently heated , the muriatic acid gas obtained , demonstrates the presence , though half of its volume will not give the total quantity of , hydrogen ; for a proportion of this elementary body continues associated with oxygen in the state of water .
Dry oxalate of lead , treated in this way , yields not the slightest trace of muriatic acid , for on passing the disengaged gas through a dilute solution of nitrate of silver , no precipitation or 464 even cloud of chloride is produced .
But 5 grains of indigo , prepared from the de-oxidized solution of the dyer 's vat , and freed from its lime and resin by the successive application of dilute muriatic acid and alcohol , gave 5 cubicinches of muriatic acid gas when heated along with 150 grains of calomel .
Here we have a quantity of gas equivalent to 4 cubic inches of hydrogen .
By means of peroxide of copper , however , nearly 4 times the above quantity of hydrogen may be obtained from the same weight of indigo .
I shall now give in detail , one example of the mode of computing the relation of the constituents from the experimental results , and shall then state the other analyses in a tabular form , subjoining a few remarks on the habitudes of some peculiar bodies .
1.4 grains of sulphuric ether , specific gravity o.7o , being slowly passed in vapour from the glass bulb through 2oo grains of ignited peroxide of copper , yielded 6.8 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas at 66 ?
F. which are equivalent to 6.57128 of dry gas at 60 ? .
This number being multiplied by 0.127= the carbon in 1 cubic inch of the gas , the product o.8345256 , is the carbon in 1.4 grains of ether ; and o.8345556 x -3= 2,2254 the oxygen equivalent to the carbonic acid .
The tube was found to have lost 4.78 grains in weight , o.1 of which was due to the hygrometric moisture in the oxide , and 1.4 to the ether .
The remainder , 3.28 , is the quantity of oxygen abstracted from the oxide by the combustible elements of the ether .
But of these 3.28 grains , 2.2254 went to the formation of the carbonic acid , leaving 1.0546 of oxygen , equivalent to 0.1318 of hydrogen .
Hence , 1.4 ether , by this experiment , which is taken as the most satisfactory of a great number , seem to consist of Carbon o 8345 Hydrogen 0.1318 Water 0.4337 1.40oo And in 1 grain we shall have Carbon o.5960 3 atoms 2.25 6o.oo Hydrogen o.l33o 4 atoms 0.50 1353 .

x o.625 = 1.25 4.1666 which suffering a condensation equal to the whole vapour of water , will give an ethereous vapour , whose specific gravity is 2.5 .
The proportion of the constituents of sulphuric ether , deduced by M. GAY LUSSAC from the experiments of M. TH .
DE SAUSSURE , are 2 volumes olefiant gas +i volume vapour of water , which 3 volumes are condensed into i of vapour of ether , having a specific gravity 2.58 .
The ether which I used had been first distilled off dry carbonate of potash , and then digested on dry muriate of lime , from which it was simply decanted , according to the injunction of M. DE SAUSSURE .
Whether my ether contained more aqueous matter than that employed by the Genevese philosopher , or whether the difference of result is to be ascribed to the difference in the mode of analysis , must be decided by future researches .
-46 .
By analogous modes of reduction , the following results were deduced from my experiments .
I ought here to state , that in many cases the materials , after being ignited in the tube , and then cooled , were again triturated in the mortar , and subjected to a second ignition .
Thus , none of the carbon could escape conversion into carbonic acid .
I was seldom content with one experiment on a body ; frequently six or eight were made .

Remarks on the preceding analyses .
i. Sugar .
The sugar which I employed had been purified by Mr. HOWARD'S steam process , and was so well stovedried , that it lost no appreciable portion of its weight , when enclosed along with sulphuric acid in vacuo .
The diabetic sugar has a manifest excess of oxygen , which I believe to be the case with all weak sugars , as they are called by the sugar refiners .
I consider this excess of oxygen as the chief cause which counteracts crystallization , and therefore the great obstacle to the manufacturer .
The smallest proportion of carbon , which I have ever found in any cane sugar , was upwards of 41 per cent. The experiments on starch and gum were among the earliest which I made , and the results differ so much from those given by other experimenters , that I shall repeat the analyses at the earliest opportunity .
The constituents of the above three bodies , referred to the prime equivalent scale , will be approximately as follows : Sugar .
Starch .
Gum .
Carbon 3-75 40-5 35-z5 Carbon 5 atoms 3.75 45.4 5 atoms i 3.75 40.5 4 atoms 3.0 35.25 Oxygen 4 -40 48.5 5-5 .

All the elementary principles of organic nature may be considered as deriving the peculiar delicacy of their chemical equilibrium , and the consequent facility with which it may be subverted and new modelled , to the multitude of atoms grouped together in a compound .
On this view , none of them should be expected to consist of a single atom of each component .
The allurement of theoretic simplicity has led some ingenious philosophers to represent sugar by i atom of carbon , i atom of oxygen , and 1 atom of hydrogen ; or of 40 carbon , 53 oxygen , and 6-| hydrogen in loo parts .
But I am satisfied that all sound specimens of sugar will yield considerably more carbon than 40 per cent. Starch is liable to a similar deterioration with sugar ; that is , some species of it make a much firmer coagulum with hot water than others ; a difference probably due to the proportion of oxygen .
The starch here employed was that of commerce , and was not chemically desiccated : hence , the redundancy of water beyond the equivalent proportion .
A little hygrometric moisture was present also in the gum , as it was not artificially dried .
A note of interrogation is placed after azote .
That doubt will I trust be solved , when I complete my analyses of grains , roots , and leaves , with the view of tracing the origin of azote in the bodies of graminivorous animals .
We now come to a class of bodies in which the hydrogen predominates over the oxygen .
With regard to resin , I believe the quantity of its carbon to be somewhat underrated in the table .
Though three experiments were made on it , I now perceive that I had omitted to re-triturate and re-ignite ; and the carbon of resin is very difficult of oxygenation .
Its true composition is probably , Carbon 8 atoms 6.0 75.00 Hydrogen 8.o 12.50 Oxygen i -10o 12.50 8.0 100.00 46 , A still more symmetric arrangement would be derived from Carbon 8 atoms .

Had the loss of weight suffered by the contents of the tube , during their ignition , been a few hundredth parts of a grain more , the experimental result would have coincided with this theoretical view .

Hence , this coal is found at the Glasgow gas works to yield a very rich burning gas .
I do not know whether the azote be essential to the constitution of this coal , or accidentally introduced from animal remains at the formation of the strata .

I had intended to pursue , at considerable detail , my researches on this curious azotized product of vegetation , but the subject having been lately taken up , and ingeniously prosecuted by my pupil and friend , Mr. WALTER CRUM , I was induced to leave it in his hands .
He announced to my the presence of hydrogen in indigo , before I had analyzed this substance myself ; and drew my attention , particularly , to the fallacy occasioned by the hygrometric water of the peroxide of copper .
It is likely that some slight modification may require to be made in my tabular proportion of the constituents , for I did not resume the subject of indigo , after I had become most familiar with the manipulations .

7.1 1.625 100.0 It is very difficult , even by the best regulated ignition , to resolve the whole carbon of this very volatile body into carbonic acid ; hence , the carbon may come to be underrated in the result .
Naphthaline is obtained during the rectification of the petroleum of the coal gas works .
It is found encrusting the pipes in the form of a greyish crystalline mass ; and when purified by a second sublimation at the temperature of about 22o0 , it forms beautiful thin plates , white and glistening .
It has a powerful petroleum odour .
With brine of the specific gravity i.o48 , these plates , when once thoroughly wetted ( which is difficult to effect ) remain in equilibrium ; that is , float in any part of the liquid .
That number , therefore , represents the specific gravity of naphthaline .
It is insoluble in water , but very soluble in ether , and moderately so in alcohol .
With iodine , it fuses at a gentle MDcccxxII .

Naphthaline is soluble in oils .
In water heated to 168 ?
F. it fuses , and remains like oil at the bottom of the liquid ; but when stirred it rises , and spreads on the top in little oily patches .
At 180 ?
it rises spontaneously from the bottom in oily globules , which , as the temperature is raised , dissipate in the air , undergoing motions similar to those of camphor floating on water .

At the specific gravity.814 alcohol would have exactly this atomic constitution .
If the condensation be equal to the whole 3 volumes of olefiant gas , that is if the 7 volumes of constituent gases become 4 of alcohol vapour , we shall have its specific gravity at this strength = 1.372 ; the additional volume of aqueous vapour producing necessarily this abatement in the density .

I could perceive no smell whatever of nitrous gas in the gaseous products , which were made to traverse a column of copper filings 3 inches long , in a state of ignition .
I shall renew the inquiry on urea , and employ the lowest temperature compatible with the formation of carbonic acid .

Crystallized oxalate of ammonia consists of i atom acid , i atom ammonia , and ?
atoms water = 8.875 .
By a gentle heat 1 atom of water may be separated ; and an oxalate of ammonia , as dry as is compatible with its neutrality , remains .
I have analyzed , by the peroxide of copper , the citrate , tartrate , and oxalate of lead ; and on comparing the results thus obtained , with those derived from the analysis of the crystalline acids , I have come to the above determinations .
Ferroprussic acid , the ferrocyanic acid of the French chemists , has proved , hitherto , a stumbling block to me , in reducing the results of my experiments to the atomic theory .
I have subjected it to very numerous trials in many states of combination , and have sought , with great pains , to accommodate the results to the doctrine of prime equivalents ; but hitherto without success .
The following facts , however , may perhaps be deemed of some consequence .
In the first place , the prime equivalent of the crystallized ferroprussiate of potash is 13.l15 , compared to oxide of lead 480 14 , and to nitrate of the same metal 20.75 ; that is , 13.125 of the former salt neutralize o2.75 of the latter .
In the second place , 14 parts of oxide of lead yield 21 parts of dry ferroprussiate of lead ; or the atomic weight of dry ferroprussic acid is 7 : The mean of my analyses of ferroprussiate of lead , gives the relation of the constituents of the acid , as marked in the table .
These proportions , reduced to the atomic weight 7 , afford Carbon. .
2.5774 Azote. .
2-4703 Ferreous matter 1.9523 7.0000ooo Were we to suppose the prime equivalent of the ferroprussic acid 7.5 instead of 7 ; and were we farther to suppose that the carbon in the above result should be 2.25 3 atoms , and the azote = 3.5 , or two atoms , then we might conceive an atom of dry ferroprussic acid to be made up of Carbon 3 atoms 2.25 Azote -3.50 Iron -1.75 7.-50 But experiment does not permit me to adopt this theoretical representation .
The best mode that has occurred to me for analyzing ferroprussiate of potash , is to convert it , by the equivalent quantity of nitrate of lead , into the ferroprussiate of this metal ; then to separate the nitrate of potash by filtration ; and , after evaporation , to determine its weight .
In this way , 13.1i5 grains of crystallized ferroprussiate of potash afford iae.3 grains of nitre , which contain 5.8 of potash , .
By heating nitric acid in excess on gi grains of ferroprussiate of lead , I obtained 2.625 grains of peroxide of iron , equivalent to 1i8375 of the metal .
Hence I infer , that the iron in the ferroprussiate of lead is in the metallic state ; for the joint weights of the carbon and azote contained in 7 grains of the dry acid is 5.0477 ; and the difference , 95 , approaches too closely to the above quantity , 1.8375 , for us to suppose the metal to be in the state of protoxide .
In fact , 2.625 parts of peroxide x 0.9.= 2.3625 of protoxide , is a quantity much beyond what experiment shows to be present .
By fareful desiccation , 1.69 grains of water , may be separated from 13 , I25 grainsof the salt .
