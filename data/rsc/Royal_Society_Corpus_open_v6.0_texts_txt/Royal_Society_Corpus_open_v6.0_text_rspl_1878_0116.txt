I do not obtain any change of phase by reflection in any case ; and this is to be expected , as this change of phase probably depends on the nature of the change from one medium to another , which , following M'Cullagh , I have uniformly assumed to be abrupt .
Apart from this question of change of phase , my results conform completely to Mr. Kerr 's beautiful experiments on the reflection of light from the pole of a magnet , as published in the Philosophical Magazines for May , 1877 , and March , 1878 .

It has often been noticed , especially in and near large towns , that a foggy atmosphere is not always saturated with moisture : thus on the 17th of October last , at 3'30 p.m. , during a thick fog in London , the degree of humidity was only 80 per cent , of saturation ; and Mr. Glaisher , in his memorable balloon ascents , observed that in passing through cloud or fog the hygrometer sometimes showed the air to possess considerable dryness .

Feb. 27th 99 4,400 42-0 " 52 It is thus evident that the air closely surrounding the spherules of water in a mist , cloud or fog , is sometimes far from saturated with moisture ; although , as is well known to persons occupied with gas analysis , when a perfectly dry gas -is admitted into a moist eudiometer it very rapidly assumes the volume indicating saturation , notwithstanding that the proportion of water surface to volume of gas is obviously far less than that afforded to the interstitial air of a fog .
In a special experiment of this kind , it was found that air dried over calcic chloride became completely saturated with moisture in less than one minute and fifty seconds , when it was passed into a moist glass tube three-fourths of an inch in diameter .
It appeared to me , therefore , interesting to inquire under what condition the evaporation from the surface of water can be so hindered as to cause this delay in the saturation of the closely surrounding air .
Many years ago I became acquainted with the fact , first noticed I believe by Mr. P. Prof. E. Fraiiklaiid on Fog .
[ Jan. 9 , Spence of Manchester , that the evaporation of saline solutions , kept just below their boiling point in open pans , can be almost entirely prevented by covering the liquid with a thin stratum of coal-tar .
It was thus that Mr. Spence effected a considerable saving of fuel in that part of the process of manufacturing alum in which burnt aluminous shale is digested for many hours with hot dilute sulphuric acid ; much less fuel being of course required when the digestion was carried on without evaporation , than when steam escaped from the surface of the hot liquid .
This simple though important technical application suggested to me a condition of things under which the existence of so-called " dry fog " would be possible .
From our manufactories and domestic fires , vast aggregate quantities of coal-tar and paraffin oil are daily distilled into the atmosphere , and condensing upon , or attaching themselves to , the watery spherules of fog or cloud , must of necessity coat these latter with an oily film , which would , in all probability , retard the evaporation of the water , and the consequent saturation of the interstitial air .
' The following experiments were made in order to test the validity of this explanation I. Two platinum dishes , containing water and presenting equal surfaces of liquid , were placed side by side in a moderate draught of air ; the water in one being coated by a very thin film of coal-tar .
By comparing the loss of weight in the two dishes , it was found that during twenty-four hours the evaporation was reduced by the film of coal-tar from 7*195 grms. to 1*124 grms. or 84*4 per cent. II .
In a similar experiment , the evaporation during twenty-four hours was reduced from 7*986 grms. to 1*709 grms. , or 78*6 per cent. In order to imitate more nearly the modus operandi of actual smoke in foggy air , the smoke from burning coal was in the next experiments blown upon the surface of the water in one of the platinum dishes , the dishes being placed as before in a draught niche .
III .
The evaporation during eighteen hours was reduced from 4 26 grms. to *969 grm. , or 77*3 per cent. IV .
In another experiment , the evaporation during twenty-four hours was diminished from 6*325 grms. to 1*173 grms. , or 81*5 per cent. , and during forty-two hours from 10*585 grms. to 2*142 grms. , or 79*8 per cent. So far the experiments were made in a current of ordinary air of varying humidity ; but they were afterwards repeated with the following results , under a large bell-jar , in which the enclosed air was continually dried by a large surface of concentrated sulphuric acid .
As in the last two trials , the film was produced by coal smoke .
V. During forty-eight hours , evaporation was diminished from 5*178 grms. to *737 grm. , or 85*8 per cent. 879.1 Prof. B. Stewart .

During twenty-two hours , evaporation was reduced from 2*123 *rms .
to *668 grm. , or 68*5 per cent. VII .
During twenty-four hours , the reduction was from 2*460 jrmg .
to *180 grm. , or 92*7 per cent. VIII .
In a period of seventy-two hours , the reduction was from 7*638 grms. to *917 grm. , or 88 per cent. IX .
In seventy hours , the evaporation was diminished from 7*732 jrms .
to 2*586 grms. , or 66*6 per cent. X. In forty-six hours , the diminution was from 4*973 grms. to L*647 grms. , or 66*9 per cent. Experiments were also made with single drops of water suspended in loops of fine platinum wire , and placed in the hell-jar filled with dry air ; hut it was found that the oily film had a strong tendency to leave the drop and run up the platinum wire .
In a comparative experiment , in which one of the drops was protected by a coal-smoke film , the unprotected drop lost 90 per cent , of its weight in two and a half hours at 16'*6 C. ; whilst the protected drop lost only 37*8 percent , at 17'*8 C. in the same time .
Another drop , protected by a film of coal-tar , lost 37*6 per cent , of its weight in two and a half hours , the temperature being 14 ' C. in the bell-jar .
It is highly probable that if globules of water without any solid support ( like those in cloud and fog ) could have been operated upon , the retardation of evaporation would have been still more marked , or perhaps altogether arrested ; for in all the above experiments the oily films manifested a tendency to break up and attach themselves to the solid support of the water , leaving the surface of the latter partially unprotected .
The results of these experiments point out a condition of very common occurrence , competent to produce " dry fog , " whilst they also explain the frequency , persistency , and irritating character of those fogs which afflict our large towns ; inasmuch as some of the products of destructive distillation of coal are very irritating to the respiratory organs , and a large proportion of them is scarcely if at all volatile at ordinary temperatures .

Matthews , for his assistance in the foregoing quantitative determinations .
