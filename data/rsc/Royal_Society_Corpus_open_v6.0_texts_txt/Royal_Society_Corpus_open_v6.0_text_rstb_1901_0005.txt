then sought to learn whether it were exclusively retinal , by means similar to those by which I had previously satisfied myself of the exclusively retinal origin of the electrical response to light .
I compared , namely , the effects of electrical excitation of the two halves , anterior and posterior , of the eyeball , but at once was met with the difficulty that the injury and compression incidental to the division of the eyeball into two halves greatly modified the phenomenon .
And whereas in the case of light the contrast between effects of light upon the two halves was generally sufficiently well marked by reason of there being no distinct effect at all on the anterior half , the similar contrast between the effects of electrical stimulation of the two halves was far less absolute ; I generally obtained a comparatively small effect upon the anterior half of the eyeball , and , but by no means in every case , a comparatively large effect upon the posterior half ; but in at least two instances I find noted that the anterior gave a larger effect than the posterior half .
I therefore concluded that whereas in the electrical response to light the retina is the principal , if not solely , effective factor , tissues of the eyeball other than retinal are coeffective in the electrical response to strong electrical stimulation ; and I recognised in this fact an indication that blaze currents might be expected to occur in other living tissues .
The consequent investigation* to which this gave rise will be reported on in due course ; my present paper deals exclusively with the phenomena as witnessed upon the eyeball .
At a later period of the investigation I made careful comparison between alterations of response to light and of response to electrical stimulation ( vide infra ) .
The conclusion I arrived at from such comparisons may be expressed in the following apparently contradictory propositions to the effect that : ( 1 ) There is a degree of parallelism between response to light and response to electrical stimulation , indicating that the retina is concerned in both kinds of response ; ( 2 ) There is a defect of parallelism between response to light and response to electrical stimulation , indicating that tissues of the eyeball other than retinal ( .
, the corneal epithelium ) are coeffective in response to electrical stimulation .
I prefer , therefore , to designate the effects under investigation as eyeball currents rather than as retinal currents , although , no doubt , the retina is a principal factor in the effects .
The typical response to light is positive , but with lapse of time or by injury ( pressure more especially ) , a negative component becomes manifest , until finally the response is purely negative .
The typical response to an electrical stimulus , whether homodrome or heterodrome , is positive , but , as indicated in my previous paper ( p. 32 ) , the effects become variable at later stages .
The first object of the experiments reported on in the present communication was to obtain a clearer general view of such variations , and of the parallel effects of electrical and luminous stimuli in various states of retina .
* Preliminary note in the 'Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences , ' 3rd September , 1900 .
VOL. CXC1V.\#151 ; B. 2 B DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS Towards the conclusion of my first series of experiments I had found means of experimentally controlling the retinal response to light , of converting , e.g. , the normal positive response of the first stage into the abnormal negative response of the third stage .
I have since found ( 1 ) that the changed response to light can be gradually effected by gradually increased pressure ; ( 2 ) that by similar means similar changes can be effected in the response to electrical stimuli ; and ( 3 ) that the direction and magnitude of the lesponse to electrical stimuli are modified hy the presence of weak constant currents .
Method\#151 ; The electrical response of the eyeball is observed\#151 ; and if need be recorded\#151 ; on the following plan : \#151 ; To a keyboard having five plugs and plug-holes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 are connected\#151 ; 1 .

With 4 and 5 unplugged , any eyeball current that may be present is shown by the galvanometer .
Such current is exactly balanced by manipulation of the compensator ( which is unplugged at 1 ) until the galvanometer can be plugged and unplugged without deflection from zero .
With the galvanometer plugged at 5 , a single induction shock is sent through the eyeball but not through the galvanometer , which is immediately afterwards unplugged , so as to exhibit deflection only by the excited , and not by the exciting , current .
This excited or after-current may be homodrome or heterodrome to the exciting current .
In the heterodrome direction an after-current is not at first sight particularly significant ; the direction is that of polarisation which is manifested by nonliving , as well as hy living , electrolytes .
But after-current in the homodrome direction cannot be caused by such polarisation.# It is this clear and evident after- * * The anomalous or positive polarisation of commercial zinc in commercial zinc sulphate , and of amalgamated zinc in water ( DU Bois Reymond , 'Gesammelte Abhandlungen , ' Bd .
I. , pp. 57 and 67 ) , was OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL .
current that first aroused my attention as being an expression of physiological activity , and that has been referred to above as " blaze current of the obvious form/ ' The magnitude , time-relations , \amp ; c. , of blaze current will be considered below ; at this stage it will be sufficient to say that the electromotive value and the duration of the phenomenon on fresh vigorous eyeballs are such that it can be demonstrated with a galvanometer of less than ordinary sensitiveness ( e.g. , giving only 1 centim. deflection by 1T0"8 ampere ) , and at an interval between excitation and galvanometer closure of many seconds or even minutes , not requiring any rheotome for its demonstration .
For its closer investigation an instrument by which that interval may be taken of small and constant value is , however , advantageous and convenient .
A somewhat important condition to fulfil as regards any exact comparison of magnitudes of blaze is to preserve a constant and , if possible , brief interval between excitation and opening of galvanometer circuit .
With induction shocks this was easily effected by connecting primary circuit of coil and galvanometer to the two sides of a Pohl 's commutator without cross wires , as figured in the diagram .
One pair of pools completes the primary circuit at ; the other pair of pools short-circuits the galvanometer through GG .
The lateral Fig. 3 .
pools of mercury and the semicircular wires are adjusted so that circuit is completed at G ( i.e. , the galvanometer short-circuited ) before circuit is completed at p. On releasing the commutator cradle the weight , W , lifts the two wires from the mercury , breaking first the primary circuit and subsequently the galvanometer short circuit .
Thus the break current is cut out of the galvanometer and its after-effect alone passes through the galvanometer .
The time of transfer is constant and may be conveniently adjusted by preliminary measurement ; I adjusted it to be as nearly as possible 1/ 10 second .
Direction of exciting currents should be ascertained by preliminary trial with weak currents sent through the eyeball and galvanometer , with 4 and 5 unplugged .
A reverser is placed in the exciting circuit so that its positions to right and left shall correspond with the deflections of the galvanometer spot right and left .
taken into consideration and found to be out of the question .
No trace of this effect was exhibited by any of the unpolarisable electrodes employed throughout these observations .
2 b 2 DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS " The nature of an exciting current , and its strength , influence the result , which in any given case is the algebraic sum of blaze current and of polarisation current .
The observations of du Bois-Reymond on positive polarisation of muscle , nerve , and electrical organ , those of Hermann and Hearing on the post-anodic action currents of muscle and nerve , were systematically made with the constant current , by which the polarisation factor is elicited in highest degree .
By reason of this fact the aftercurrents observed were very generally diphasic , first negative , then positive , duration of current being favourable to the manifestation of the negative factor , strength of current to that of the positive factor .
Thus , on muscle , du Bois-Beymond obtained , e.g. , negative maximum after 10 minutes closure of the current from 1 Grove cell , and positive maximum after 0'075 second closure of the current from 20 Grove cells .
He incidentally mentions the fact that he obtained pure positive effects by sufficiently strong break induction shocks both upon muscle and upon nerve .
The case of the electrical organ is perhaps of greatest interest in connection with the present investigation .
In Malapterurus the natural discharge of the electrical organ is directed from head to tail .
A longitudinal strip of organ traversed by a constant current behaves just like muscle or nerve as regards the subsecpient aftercurrent , which is diphasic with a predominant negative ( polarisation ) factor or a predominant positive ( action ) factor , according as the exciting current has been taken weak and prolonged or strong and brief .
But\#151 ; and this is the point in which the retinal blaze is comparable\#151 ; the positive factor predominates when the exciting current is directed from head to tail , i.e. , the natural discharge swamps the polarisation counter-current.# Similar phenomena obtain in the Torpedo organ , the natural discharge in this case being from ventral to dorsal surface , which is the direction in which the positive after-current , caused by a constant current , is alone manifested .
Precisely similar effects are obtainable on the eyeball , in which the natural direction of discharge when excited by light is from fundus to cornea , which is also the direction in which the positive after current caused by an electrical current is alone manifested ( in the normal state of the eyeball ) , f The complicating effect of polarisation currents is very greatly reduced by taking as exciting current a strong induction shock in place of the brief closure of a strong galvanic current .
A troublesome piece of apparatus is dispensed with , and the chief desiderata for the manifestation of positive after-currents are fulfilled by an induction shock which is " short " and may be taken " strong .
" I have therefore systematically used as exciting current the break induction shock of a Berne inductorium fed by two Leclanche cells with the secondary pushed home over the primary coil .
I have also occasionally in cases where such strength had seemed to be excessive used the coil at * du Bois-Reymond , 'Gesammelte Abhandlungen , ' II .

three fixed distances corresponding with 1000 , 5000 , and 10,000 of the Berne graduation .
With this instrument polarisation , although still present , was relatively far less obtrusive , and in general far too small to obscure the positive ( i.e. , homodrome ) aftercurrents in epiestion .
But for closer investigation I have used condenser discharges , because of the great certainty of energy dosage by this means , and the ease with which any given energy may be delivered at various gradients found by preliminary experiment to be the most suitable .
By this means polarisation effects can be , if not entirely eliminated , reduced to a minimum and rendered practically insignificant .
And in preliminary experiments by means of the condenser , I made frequent use of a method which I had first applied to the case of nerve , # viz. , having fixed upon a given energy of excitation at given capacity and voltage , I proceeded at once to two further tests\#151 ; one at twice the voltage and one quarter the capacity , i.e. , with the same energy at eight times the previous rate of discharge\#151 ; the other at one-half the voltage and four times the capacity , i.e. , with the same energy at one-eighth of the original rate of discharge .
These two further tests may be briefly denoted as made an octave above or below the first test with reference to the rate of discharge .
Blaze currents are elicited by single induction shocks and by single condenser discharges with a very wide range of varying strengths .

WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS " I he typical normal result of a rough preliminary experiment is a pair of responses of invariable direction in response to an induction shock first in one then in the opposite direction , and it is evident that one of these two responses must be homo-drome with an exciting current , while the other must be antidrome , in the polarisation direction .
One may feel well assured of the physiological nature of the homodrome effect ; it is completely abolished wfith death of the eyeball .
The heterodrome after-effect appears at first sight to be a polarisation current ; nevertheless on closer examination it also must be characterised as physiological , for it also is very greatly diminished with death of the eyeball .
The fresh eyeball gives a pair of large Normal Blaze Currents in response to single break induction currents at 10,000 units .

is more prolonged than I. responses in response to excitation of both directions .
The dead eyeball gives , if anything at all , a small pair of positive and negative responses of contrary direction to excitation .
The organ discharge of a normal eyeball is directed from fundus to cornea , and like the discharge of an electrical organ of Malapterurus or of Torpedo , can be aroused both by a homodrome and by an antidrome exciting current .
Seeing that the eyeball current aroused by an electrical stimulus is similar in direction to that aroused by light , it is highly probable that the electromotive origin of both effects is in part identical , i.e. , in the deeper layers of the retina , that of the rods and cones , which are rendered physiologically active ( i.e. , electropositive or galvanometrically negative ) by luminous and by electrical stimuli .
One of the most striking features of blaze currents is their very considerable duration\#151 ; several minutes when the exciting currents have been taken at all strong .
I have more than once seen a blaze current evoked by a strong homodrome induction shock last for over an hour ; the ordinary duration of a moderately strong reaction is generally between five and ten minutes .
This great duration renders it possible to observe the reaction at considerable intervals after excitation , and , if OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL .
desired , to rheotome it at regular long intervals .
On the other hand , this great duration does not permit of an expeditious repetition of a succession of reactions hy excitations of any considerable strength .
The most satisfactory and trustworthy means of observation is the photographic record , which brings out far more clearly than unaided observation the character ox blaze currents and the particular points of difference between the homodrome aftereffect of anodic origin and the antidrome effect of kathodic origin .
The following statements are based upon a review of a considerable number of such records :\#151 ; It very commonly ( not always , however ) occurs that the retinal blaze ol a normal eyeball ( i.e. , of an eyeball manifesting positive response to illumination ) is elicited more easily and in greater amount by homodrome than by heterodrome excitation .
Both effects are small and brief after weak stimuli , large and prolonged after strong stimuli ; or , otherwise stated , they increase both in magnitude and in duration with increasing strength of the exciting current .
Thus , e.g. , to quote some ordinary values , the dimensions one may expect are as follows :\#151 ; Strength of break induction .

The eyes of fresh vigorous frogs give much better effects than those of poor half-starved specimens .
Moribund frogs give very small effects ; the eye shares in the general physiological " misere " which is also evidenced by muscle , nerve , heart , \amp ; c. The eyes of frogs found dead in their tank give no effect at all ; and , according to my experience , the eyes o\#177 ; Rana temporariahave always proved to be more active than those of Rana esculenta .

My attention was not particularly directed to the observation of maximum values when the best frogs were under experiment , and I did not therefore make any special measurements under optimum conditions .

At the present stage I shall confine my remarks to one or two principal points .
The statement of evident fact that increasing strength of exciting current evokes increasing strength of blaze can be at once made more precise by the statement that the latter increases more rapidly than the former , at least within the considerable range of what may be termed excitation of medium strength , so that a curve of blaze effects plotted as ordinates with strength of excitation along the abscissa , is concave towards the base , and appears to rise convex towards an asymptote , the position of which one is tempted to determine on the assumption that the curve is logarithmic .

But before actually proceeding to this refinement , I think it is advisable to wait for more numerous and precise data , and above all to settle the fundamental point as to whether it is correct to measure out the abscissa of excitation in units of energy or in units of quantity .
I have indeed already* offered reason for concluding that energy rather than quantity is the factor to be considered in the measurement of excitation ; but I do not know yet how far I might be held justified in proceeding further from that conclusion assumed as point of departure .
The relation is in any case difficult to examine both above and below the limits of moderate excitation\#151 ; above by reason of the injuries caused by very strong stimuli , below by reason of the relatively large error of small measurements , and more especially of the relatively large value of polarisation where small blaze effects are in question .
The following experiment and numbers taken from my previous paperf will illustrate The preceding remarks .

, but quantities are unequal ; the blaze effects are approximately equal .
Note.\#151 ; The rate of discharge , as shown in the column V/ F in III .
has been eight times that in II .
I have not yet obtained satisfactory measurements of minimum energy of excitation giving maximum energy of blaze effect .
But I have repeatedly had occasion to recognise this principal point , that the energy of the excited effect may be in excess of the energy of the exciting cause .
Excessive stimulation , so far from giving a larger , gives a smaller blaze effect than does moderate stimulation .
And I have repeatedly been struck by the fact that a single over-strong stimulus not only diminishes the blaze effect provoked by a subsequent moderate stimulus , but that the effect of the excessive stimulus is itself far short of the effect caused by a moderate stimulus .
One might have expected that the final explosion provoked by the excessive stimulus should itself be excessive , but one finds that such excessive stimulus , by injury of tissue , sets a limit to the effect which itself produces .
The development of a blaze effect is sudden ; its decline is gradual .
The culmination appears to outstrip the rate of progress of the deflected galvanometer mirror , more clearly so in the case of a heterodrome than in that of a homodrome blaze .
This difference when present is due to polarisation counter-current present in the two cases , which counter-current somewhat accelerates the culmination of heterodrome blaze , and somewhat retards the culmination of homodrome blaze .
OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL .
From observations on dead eyeballs some indication of the dimensions of this polarisation current may be obtained , and these are found to be such that no fear of confusion by their presence need be entertained , at least in connection with any but the smallest values of blaze currents .
The following values will illustrate this point ; they are taken upon an eyeball in which blaze effects were rather below their ordinary value and polarisation , therefore relatively more considerable ; moreover , the eyeball was not assuredly " killed , " but only " stunned " by repeated shocks from a Ruhmkorff coil .

Moreover the duration of blaze far exceeds that of polarisation in the case of any given current whether weak or strong , although naturally the duration of polarisation is greater in the case of strong than in that of weak currents .
This is particularly well seen when , as sometimes happens , a homodrome blaze effect develops more slowly than usual , and is preceded by a short , sharp polarisation effect in the contrary direction .
The decline of a blaze current , most rapid at first , progresses more and more slowly , towards zero in the case of strong excitation , beyond zero in that of weak excitation , in either case giving , when photographed , a curve falling convex towards its abscissa .
Cceterisparibus , particularly after strong excitation , a homodrome generally subsides less rapidly than a heterodrome effect ( see fig. 5 ) .
The time during which an excised frog 's eyeball remains capable of manifesting the blaze effects is very considerable .
I have observed them five days after excision , and have no doubt that they might be seen still later .
The feature that most aroused my attention in these late effects was that they were of normal ( positive ) direction as in the fresh eyeball .
* These terms are purely relative .
What is here referred to as a medium stimulus generally gives maximal effect .
" Strong " is in reality excessive .
DR , A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS " A succession of homonymous blaze currents taken at regular intervals of time by uniform stimulation , exhibits progressive modifications which vary with the nature of the eyeball , the strength of stimulation , and the interval between successive stimuli .

30 min. strength and interval of excitation summation of effects may be witnessed similar in general type with the summation of effects manifested by muscle that is excited to contraction by frequently repeated stimuli .
Summation of stimuli as well as summation of effects may be observed upon the frog 's eyeball .
A stimulus may be fixed upon by trial of such magnitude that it may be indefinitely repeated at long intervals without producing any effect whatever .
The same stimulus repeated in rapid succession will produce a considerable effect .
OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL , This is most readily demonstrated by the difference in effect of single induction shocks and tetanisation with an eyeball and galvanometer in series , as in the experiments described at p. 210 .
The single shocks produce equal and opposite deflections , i.e. , excite no blaze reaction ; tetanisation at the same strength gives a considerable positive effect due to a summation of the succession of make and break stimuli .

Influence of Eaised Temperature .
In my previous paper* it was stated that the normal electrical response to light is temporarily abolished by rise of temperature .
A precisely similar influence is produced upon the blaze current caused by electrical excitation .
A series of such responses taken upon an eyeball set up in a moist chamber , of which the temperature is gradually raised up to 50 ' , exhibits at first a progressive increase , followed very soon after by a progressive decrease .
At 35 ' to 40 ' the blaze current is at its smallest ; at 40 ' to 45 ' it commonly reappears , and is then of a prolonged and " sticky " character ; at 50 ' it is completely abolished .

been maintained high for too long a period , the response may reappear to some extent , with subsequent fall of temperature to normal .
The electromotive value of the response does not fluctuate up and down in ratio with augmentation and diminution of deflection .
Rise of temperature causes alterations by resistance , viz. , diminution of resistance of the moist warmed electrolyte , and augmentation of resistance in consequence of drying .
In order to know which of these two effects predominates at any given time and to obtain electromotive values of the blaze deflections , these must be compared with deflections by a standard electromotive force observed at frequent intervals during experiment .

In my previous communication I showed cause for admitting that the positive electrical response of a normal fresh eye has a minor negative component which , with lapse of time and decline of the major positive component , becomes more and more prominent until , in what I have termed the third stage , the response to light becomes frankly negative .
I showed further , that by gentle massage of the eyeball , the positive component may be at once abolished , and made to give place to an uncomplicated negative effect .
I have found since then that the change may be brought about without massage , by a gradually increased compression of the eyeball , and I think therefore that the change effected by massage is essentially due to compression and increased eyeball tension , producing some modification of the retinal elements , as evidenced by their modified response to light .
The response to electrical stimulation exhibits an analogous change , and I have expended much time in the endeavour to disengage some " law " amid the rather perplexing phenomena presented by " stale " or injured eyeballs .
There was never the slightest doubt or uncertainty as regards a fresh and uninjured eyeball ; the response was always positive .
Difficulties of interpretation arose only in the case of eyes that had undergone manipulation ; these , however , have been considerably diminished since I have found means of experimentally modifying at will the character of the response by means of increased eyeball tension .
And I may remark in passing that this fact has led me to believe that in the modifications that have sometimes ( but not always ) supervened with lapse of time , alterations of eyeball tension have been a principal factor .
I have witnessed response of the first type two or three days after death , when the eyeballs had become obviously flaccid ; and I have witnessed response of the first type very shortly after excision , and I now think it probable that in such case the eyeball had been accidentally compressed more than usual .
The various 4types of response that may be witnessed on excised eyeballs , are summarised in the accompanying diagram ( fig. 13 ) .
Type I. is that presented by the response of a normal fresh eyeball in the great majority of cases\#151 ; nearly always in fact\#151 ; to such an extent indeed that I feel assured in the rare cases in which the type is of another form , the eyeball must have suffered compression .
According to the terminology used in this paper , both responses are positive ; the first being in the same direction as the exciting current , cannot be polarisation , but is obviously blaze effect ; the second being opposed in direction to the exciting current , is in the polarisation current , and is therefore of debateable nature .
Type IY .
is that presented by an absolutely dead eyeball .
The after-currents are counter-currents in relation to excitatory currents , of much smaller electromotive value and of much shorter duration than blaze currents .
They are ordinary polarisation effects .
Type III .

Both responses are in the negative direction ; the first being opposed in direction to the exciting current , is of debateable nature ; the second being of the same direction as the exciting current , is an obvious blaze effect .

Both responses are of the same direction as their exciting currents , and are therefore obvious blaze effects .

During the period of observation , positive blaze currents decreased and negative blaze currents increased .
Excitation was made throughout by break induction currents of a Berne coil at 10,000 units , supplied by two Leclanche cells .
Blaze currents of this type have been , in my experience , of exceptional occurrence .
Note.\#151 ; Considering the eyeball in the light of an electrical organ , of which the normal direction of discharge is from fundus to cornea ( = " positive " ) the correspondence between the terminology used above and that employed by DU Bois-Reymond with reference to electrical organs is as follows :\#151 ; Negative .

The word " absolutely " in the DU Bois terminology is used with reference to the organ-discharge , the response being denoted as absolutely positive or absolutely negative according as it is in the same direction as the normal discharge or of opposite direction .
The word " relatively , " as used by du Bois , refers to the direction of response in relation with that of the exciting current , relatively positive and relatively negative , signifying that the response is in the same and in the opposite direction to that of the exciting current .
Retinal responses of Type I. correspond with DU Bois ' organ responses of the first and second stages , both " absolutely positive , " but one " relatively positive " and the other " relatively negative .
" Retinal responses of Type IV .
correspond with DU Bois ' third and fourth stages , and are both in the direction of polarisation current , one being absolutely and relatively negative , the other absolutely positive and relatively negative .
Retinal responses of Types II .

are not represented in DU Bois ' four stages , which indeed are reducible to only two stages , equivalent as described above to Type I. and Type IV .
Type I. is that of a normal living eyeball .
Type IV .
is that of an exhausted or dead eyeball.* du Bois-Reymond 's experiments on the electrical organs of Torpedo and of Malapterurus have been repeated by Gotch and by Burdon-Sanderson , and extended to the analogous organs of the Skate .
The last-named observers distinguish between the normal excitatory reaction caused by induction shocks of either direction , and the " after-effect , " also in the normal direction , caused by induction shocks and by voltaic currents of sufficient strength and brevity led through the organ in either direction . !

VOL. CXCIV , \#151 ; B. 2 E DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS excited to its maximal blaze current , I have always found this latter to be accompanied by a marked increase of conductivity .
This alteration was shown by the fact that a standard deflection by VC)lt was found to be increased sometimes by as much as 50 per 100 .
In such case , however , since the total resistance in circuit was unknown , it was not possible to translate this obvious increase into its value in ohms .
But this much it was possible to see with certainty , 1st , that the altered conductivity was similar to both directions of testing current , and 2nd , that it subsided with subsidence of blaze .
The principal difficulty that stands in the way of exact measurements of resistance arises from the fact that the testing current itself excites retinal discharge in a given ( " positive " ) direction .
The phenomenon of apparent " irreciprocal resistance , " due to organ discharge in one direction only , is thus presented by the eyeball precisely as by an electrical organ.# Deflection caused by a homonymous induction shock sent through eyeball and galvanometer in series is greater than deflection caused by a similar but heterodrome shock .
The algebraic sum of positive shock p^us positive discharge is greater than the algebraic sum of negative shock plus positive discharge .

As regards the blaze effect it is of Type I. ( normal ) .

after 4 hours B jooo + B jooo + Nor is the difficulty avoided by placing the eyeball in the arm of a Wheatstone bridge , for the testing battery is apt to itself provoke a blaze current that greatly complicates the determination of any equilibrium value of balancing resistance .
I have therefore postponed the attempt to give definite values to the indubitable diminution of resistance that goes with the state of blaze .
Nevertheless , certain principal points are already clear at this stage of the inquiry\#151 ; 1 .
The inequality between -f- and \#151 ; break induction shocks ( or between -j- and \#151 ; condenser discharges ) is due to the + discharge of the eyeball itself .
2 .
While the eyeball is in the state of blaze its electrical resistance is diminished , eg .
, from 17,000 down to 12,000 o\gt ; ; from 8000 down to 6000 m ; from 10,500 down to 7000 w. 3 .
The inequality between + and \#151 ; shocks just referred to is diminished or abolished when the eyeball has been provoked to its maximal electrical discharge .
DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS1 The diminution is temporary , and the inequality reappears with return of the eyeball to its normal quiescent state .
Regarding the two extreme states of the eyeball as analogous to the two extreme functional states of glands , we may characterise them as\#151 ; A. Loaded and ready to discharge when excited .
B. Discharged and refractory to excitation .
The inequality of deflections by equal and opposite electrical shocks is a sign of the loaded state , whereas equality of such deflections is a sign of the discharged state .
In the case of a dead eyeball , giving equal and opposite polarisation after-currents , the deflections caused by equal and opposite electrical shocks are themselves equal and opposite .
In the case of what may be termed a " stunned " eyeball , i.e. , after violent tetanisation , the inequality is diminished or abolished .
In a few hours the eyeball recovers more or less perfectly .
In my previous communication* I commented upon the remarkable persistence of the retinal response to light after even violent tetanisation of the eyeball .
In view of the comparative ease with which blaze currents are abolished , 1 was led to repeat the previous experiments , observing upon one and the same eyeball the response to light and the response to electrical stimuli , before and after strong tetanisation .
Blaze effects were completely absent while the response to light remained unaltered \#151 ; if anything , apparently increased by reason of a diminution of resistance .
I must refrain from any attempt to explain this remarkable result at present .
There can , however , be no mistake as regards the fact itself .
Experiments Exhibiting the Influence of Strong Tetanisation upon the Blaze Currents .
The eyeball is set up as usual in the dark chamber and connected with the keyboard as shown in fig. 2 .
Compensation is established at the commencement of each group of excitations , and is left unaltered during that group .
The exciting currents are not short-circuited from the galvanometer , which is left in series with the eyeball , the compensator , and the induction coil ( by unplugging the keyboard of fig. 2 at 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 ) .
The observations are taken before and after tetanisation for \ minute at 10,000 units of the Berne coil fed by 2 Leclanche cells .
Excitation is by a single break induction shock of the same coil at 1000 units .
The galvanometer is shunted , except when it is desired to observe response to light .

Experiments Exhibiting the Influence of Pressure upon the Electrical Response Light , and upon Blaze Effects .
The eyeball is set up in the dark chamber between unpolarisable electrodes which are fixed to the stage and body of a small microscope stand .
A handle passing into the dark chamber is fixed to the fine adjustment screw of the microscope , so that the eyeball can be compressed at will by turning the screw from the outside .
The ends of the electrodes are covered by two small slabs of pipe-clay , so as to afford the necessary firm pressure of the eyeball when the screw is turned .
Illumination of the eyeball is made DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS in the usual way by exposure at regular intervals for a regular period , and between each exposure the compression screw is turned by half a turn , giving a vertical displacement of about \#163 ; mm.

I also found that a normal ( positive ) blaze could be converted into a reversed ( negative ) blaze by similar means .
But when I came to study the progressive development of the two kinds of change , I found that there was no constant parallelism between them .
In some cases\#151 ; as illustrated , e.g. , in fig. 16\#151 ; the two kinds of change were quite similar and parallel , i.c. .
positive response to light ( Stage l ) was converted into negative response to light ( Stage 3 ) , while positive blaze ( Type 1 ) was converted into negative blaze ( Type 3 ) .
But in the great majority of cases there was no such exact correspondence , and as a rule , indeed , I noticed that an eyeball giving negative response to light of the Experiment 2.\#151 ; Influence of Pressure upon the Blaze Currents\#151 ; Progressive Modification of Type .

It is possible that the difference is to a considerable extent a question of strengths of excitation .
Nevertheless , it exists and distinctly forbids us to admit an exact correspondence in all cases between the Stages 1 , 2 , and 3 as regards response to light , and the Types I. , II .
, and III .
as regards response to electrical stimuli .
I found also that whereas a positive blaze current could be reversed by negative galvanisation , no such reversal was thereby produced of a positive response to illumination .
Concerning the Influence of Light upon Blaze Currents .
No portion of this investigation has given me more trouble than that relating to the influence of illumination upon the response to electrical stimuli .
Whereas the converse influence of electrical stimulation upon the response to luminous stimulation has been clear and manifest , I am unable to say definitely whether electrical stimuli are more , or are less , effective after prolonged illumination .
I should , indeed , have preferred to omit all reference to this doubtful point in the present paper , but the DR- A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS " fact that I have carefully examined into the possible parallelism between luminous and electrical stimulation effects in different states of eyeball makes the omission unadvisable , and I think it will he preferable that I should give a brief account of these somewhat unsatisfactory results .
Moreover , the very facts that no clear results have been obtained , and that there is very evident defect of parallelism between effects of luminous and of electrical stimuli , are , although negative items of evidence , points of some possible future significance .
At an early stage of the investigation , I noticed more than once that an eyeball put up as usual in a dark box gave larger blaze currents than an eyeball put up on electrodes and exposed to the continuous effect of ordinary light .
I therefore made a set of experiments ad hoc\#151 ; bisecting the heads of pithed frogs , but leaving the eyes in situ , one in a dark chamber , the other exposed to light .
I could not assure myself of any regular and constant difference between the blaze currents of the dark eye and of the light eye .
Moreover , control experiments with both eyes under similar conditions of light and dark exhibited differences between the two eyes of the same order of magnitude as those presented by dark versus light eyes .
Nevertheless , the currents of dark eyes appeared to be , on the whole , larger than those of the light eyes\#151 ; but not with convincing regularity\#151 ; and it appeared that unavoidable differences of disturbance during manipulation might have accounted for the results .
I he following experiment was the most apparently satisfactory of this set : \#151 ; Stimulus .

The objection to this plan of procedure is that we may find it difficult to distinguish an effect of altered light from the spontaneous modifications occurring with mere lapse of time , and in such prolonged observations we have to bear in mind that by reason of gradual evaporation , which is apt to take place even in the moist chamber if not fully saturated , an alteration of total resistance of the eyeball may take jdace , causing the standard deflection to become smaller , and the eyeball response of apparently higher OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL .

With this reservation borne in mind , we may consider the following series of data ; it certainly appears from their plotted curves that the magnitude of blaze currents has been better maintained during darkness than during light .

I consider this to be a true difference , and find it to be in relation with the course of the so-called current of rest in a dark and light eyeball respectively .
Already , at the time of my previous communication , I had seen reason to believe that the normal eyeball current , or current of rest , or current of darkness\#151 ; which is generally positive immediately after excision , then declining to and beyond zero , and becoming increasingly negative\#151 ; is partly an injury current due to electromotivity of the optic nerve section , and partly a blaze current due to the mechanical disturbance necessarily caused by excision .
I have subsequently become fully confirmed in this opinion , and am satisfied that the falling positive and rising negative current is essentially a subsiding blaze current .
I find that with this fall of current the blaze current that can be elicited by a given electrical stimulus gradually increases .
I find further that the fall of current is delayed by light and more rapid during darkness .
And , finally , in association with this more rapid fall during darkness , I find that there is a more pronounced increase of successive blaze currents than occurs in association with the less rapid fall during illumination .
I regard this difference as an evidence , if not a convincing proof , of an effect of light upon the blaze currents .
The point is illustrated , if not very obviously , by the data of the accompanying experiments .
It is explained by the accompanying diagrammatic representation , the dimensions of which have been chosen in approximation to observed data .

These ordinates will in general be larger from BD than from BL , and will at the outset increase more rapidly from BD than from BL ; and if the observation is commenced with a rested eyeball , made to give a rising in place of a falling current , then we may have during the initial period diminishing in place of increasing effects bi b-2 .

But as by previous modes of trial the finding by this method remained in doubt , and although there did appear to be some diminution during , and OF THE FROG'S EYEBALL .
some augmentation after , illumination , the alteration was not striking and indubitable .
I hesitate , therefore , to make any brief assertion based upon data or averages however scrupulously treated , and prefer to give an example of the data themselves .
I do not consider that they are such as to justify more than the conclusion that the effect of light upon blaze currents is ill-defined .
Finally , I should state that I have failed to detect any alteration of electrical resistance of the eyeball during and after the action of light .
To sum up the points referred to in this paragraph , we may say that the influence of electrical excitation upon the response to light is experimentally clear and unmistakable , whereas the influence of light upon the response to electrical stimulation is little or none .
The difference is to some extent intelligible on the supposition that the retina alone is concerned in the response to light ; whereas tissues other than retinal are coefficient in the response to strong electrical stimuli .
On the other hand , we have to recognise that , whereas the positive blaze current of an entire eyeball is augmented and diminished and reversed by galvanisation , and abolished by strong tetanisation , the positive response to light suffers little or no modification during galvanisation , and is augmented at a strength of tetanisation sufficient to abolish the blaze current .
This difference is difficult to understand otherwise than on the assumption that response to light is of retinal origin , and response to electrical stimulation of non-retinal source .
For this reason , I have felt it necessary to avoid use of the qualification " retinal response , " and to use the expression " eyeball response .
" Concerning the Influence of Weak Galvanic Currents upon the Blaze Currents .
Comparatively late in the investigation I noticed that a blaze current was liable to be modified by the compensating current when the latter was at all considerable .
I therefore proceeded to investigate the effect of weak galvanic currents sent through the eyeball in the positive and negative directions .
Compensation being inadmissible , I used the plan of connections described on p. 210 , sending induction shocks through the galvanometer and eyeball in series .
This was done in the absence of any added galvanic current ; ( b ) during the passage of positive current ; and ( c ) during the passage of negative current .
Inasmuch as the added current has to pass through the galvanometer , we are restricted to weak voltage , and after a few preliminary trials , I took yyth volt , and we are obliged to bring the galvanometer on to the scale or photographic plate by means of the controlling magnet .
Alterations of field thereby produced do not invalidate the readings , seeing that in every case the value of deflection is standardised by a known voltage\#151 ; in this case , by y^th vo^The result of the experiment is quite regular .
During the passage of a galvanic current in the positive direction from fundus to cornea , the positive blaze , whether by DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS " homodrome or by heterodrome excitation , is increased .
During passage of a galvanic current in the negative direction , it is diminished or reversed .
This effect on the blaze current of a positive and negative galvanic current having been determined , the next obvious step to take was to look for the effect of galvanic currents upon the electrical response to light .
So far , however , I have not found the response to light to be modified by galvanic currents in either direction sufficiently strong to markedly influence the electrical responses to electrical stimuli .

1 have gradually reached the conclusion that the positive ( fundus to cornea ) current regularly manifested by a freshly excised eyeball is mainly due to a subsiding disturbance .
It is of the nature of blaze current , and therefore in no sense cunent of rest " or current of darkness , but action current .
It rapidly subsides , and gives place to a negative ( cornea to fundus ) current , which is the true current of rest , analogous with an ingoing current of rest of the skin .
And the positive i espouse to light with reference to this current of rest is its negative variation .

The results ot the action ot C03 and of tetanisation upon the retina and upon nerve are in harmony with this analogy .
Carbonic acid gives primary diminution and secondary augmentation of the DR. A. D. WALLER ON THE " BLAZE CURRENTS negative variation of nerve and of the positive variation of the eyeball current .
It diminishes the positive variation of nerve and the negative variation of the eyeball.* The typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards nerve is an augmentation of the negative response to electrical stimulation .
The typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards the retina is an augmentation of the positive response to luminous stimulation .
And I think I may also say that the positive response of nerve and the negative response of the eyeball are both diminished after tetanisation .
Experiments on the Mammalian Eye .
I have not examined mammalian eyes as systematically as the frogs eye ; nevertheless , I have ascertained certain points of similarity and of difference between the two kinds of eye , using for the purpose the eyes of a litter of puppies between the ages of three and five weeks .
Such an eye , disposed between unpolarisable electrodes like a frog 's eye , has a much smaller " current of rest , " and gives much smaller " blaze currents " in response to electrical stimulation .
When first observed , the current of rest may be positive or negative , e.g. , -f- 0*0017 , -j- 0'0032 , -J- 0*0034 , giving place to \#151 ; 0*0013 at the end of two hours , -j- 0*0012 , -f- 0*0016 , 0 giving place to \#151 ; 0*0056 at the end of eight hours , -f- 0*0020 , -f- 0*0010 .
Thus the fall of positive current and increase of negative current which is so well marked and constant in the case of the frog 's eye , occurs also , but in less marked degree , in that of the puppy 's eye .
Its current of rest is comparatively small .
Blaze currents are also less conspicuous than in the case of the frog 's eye .
With the first eye I tested , as quickly as possible after excision and at ordinary room temperature , they were so small as to be doubtful , and I did not pursue the observation .
Subsequently , however , with eyes examined in a warm chamber at about 35 ' d : 2 ' , they were quite unmistakable .
In all cases they were of considerably lower electromotive value than in the case of the frog , and of negative direction , i.e. , from cornea to fundus .
I noticed that in the warm chamber they were at their best two or three hours after excision , and I have observed them for as long a period as ten hours , when they gradually gave way to the small currents contrary in direction to that of exciting currents , as in the case of the frog 's eye .
Thus the puppies ' eyes , as regards their blaze current , corresponded with Type III .

There is hardly any summation of successive effects .
The second response reaches to a lower level than the first , but the third and subsequent excitations produce no further increase of the negative effect .
On the other hand , fatigue and exhaustion by strong stimulation was far more easily effected .
Nevertheless , even after complete exhaustion or shock caused by violent tetanisation , a certain amount of recovery may be witnessed .
