) This research was undertaken with the object of ascertaining whether a large quantity of air , if systematically fractionated , would yield any constituent lighter than helium .
It has been stated that " coronium " has revealed its presence in the gases emitted from the Solfatara of Pozzuoli by a line of wave-length 531-5\#151 ; 531'6 ; and that from some of the Vesuvian fumaroles gases have been obtained which give rise to new lines not coincident with any important lines in the neon or helium spectra.* Again , it has been stated by Dewar in a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution ( April 11 , 1902 ) , f that in the most volatile part of the atmosphere " a vast number of rays , generally less brilliant , are distributed through the whole length of the visible spectrum .
The greater part of these rays are of , as yet , unknown origin."| A subsidiary object of the present research was to form a new estimate of the proportion of free hydrogen in air by the method of fractionation .
The most important estimations have been made by Gautier , Rayleigh , and Dewar .
Gautier , using the method of passing air over red-hot copper oxide , found 19*5 volumes of free hydrogen in 100,000 volumes of air , i.e. , about half as much free hydrogen as carbon dioxide .
S Rayleigh|J discussed and , in part , repeated the work of Gautier ; he considered three parts per 100,000 as a maximum estimate , but regarded the question as still unsettled .
Dewar , in the lecture mentioned above , stated that " air contains as a minimum not more than -I0^000th of free hydrogen .
" The conclusions arrived at in this paper may be briefly stated : ( 1 ) there are no unknown lines in the spectrum of the lightest portions of the air , all thost observed being traceable to helium , neon , and hydrogen ; ( 2 ) the amount of hydrogen separable from air is much less than the maximum assigned by the above-mentioned investigators , for it amounts to about one volume per million and a-half volumes of air .
The first stage in the fractionation was effected by means of the air- * Nasini , Anderlini , and Salvadori , ' Accad .

An Examination of the [ Nov. 29 , liquefying apparatus at University College , Gower Street .
The air of the compressor room ( situated in the basement and well ventilated ) passed through the apparatus , and the portion which did not liquefy was collected in a large gas-holder .
This , together with fresh supplies of air , was repeatedly circulated through the apparatus , with the object of making a preliminary concentration of the lighter portions .
To avoid contamination with hydrogen , the gas-holder was well painted inside and the compressor cylinders lubricated with very dilute alkali .
The total quantity of air dealt with in this operation amounted to about 73,500 litres .
A second fractionation of the gas thus collected was obtained by liquefying about 70 or 80 litres at a time in a glass bulb immersed in liquid air boiling under reduced pressure.* Light fractions were boiled off and the process repeated several times until the volume was reduced to 4700 c.c. This portion ( 1 ) was separated , by the method of absorption in cooled charcoal , into three fractions , ( 2 ) not absorbed at about \#151 ; 190 ' C. , ( 3 ) not absorbed at about \#151 ; 110 ' C. , ( 4 ) discarded .
Spectroscopic examination showed ( 2 ) to be almost pure neon and helium with faint hydrogen lines .
An attempt was made to fractionate ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) at the temperature of liquid air boiling at ordinary pressure ( \#151 ; 190 ' C. ) , but , in the case of ( 3 ) , the fractions always showed the nitrogen spectrum ( see table of fractionations ) ; it was therefore decided to work at the temperature of liquid air boiling under reduced pressure , which represents a temperature of about \#151 ; 205 ' C.

] Lighter Constituents of Air .
Spectroscopic examination showed ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) to be chiefly neon and helium , with a little hydrogen\#151 ; no new lines were detected ; ( 7 ) was neon and nitrogen , while ( 8 ) and ( 11 ) consisted chiefly of nitrogen ; ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) were mixed and separated into the fractions ; ( 14 ) pumped off at -205 ' C. , ( 15 ) at -190 ' C. , ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) at 18 ' C. , and ( 18 ) at 236 ' C. ; ( 8 ) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) were mixed and similarly separated into fractions ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ; ( 19 ) gave the nitrogen spectrum , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) consisted of neon and helium ; ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) contained hydrogen in addition to neon and helium , while ( 18 ) contained more nitrogen than neon .
Fractions ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) were therefore analysed for hydrogen , whilst the remaining fractions , as shown by the table , were worked up for neon and helium , of which 25 c.c. were obtained .
The gases were measured separately , sparked with oxygen , the excess of which was subsequently withdrawn by means of phosphorus .
The diminution in volume gave the amount of hydrogen present .
The gases were measured by the method described by Ramsay.* c.c. Volume of ( 14 ) ... ... ... .

Any hydrocarbons in the air would have been removed in the charcoal .
As a test of this method of separating a small proportion of hydrogen from air , a parallel series of fractionations was performed on about 60 litres of air , to which 5*6 c.c. ( measured to 0*1 c.c. ) ol hydrogen had been added .
Three fractions were finally obtained from charcoal : ( 1 ) at 205 C. , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) at \#151 ; 190 ' C. Analysis , as before , gave the following results:\#151 ; * ' Eoy .

2*457 c.c. Thus , only about half the added hydrogen was recovered .
The most probable source of loss seems to be in the fractionation from the liquefied gas , when even the passage of air bubbles through the liquid appears insufficient to expel all the hydrogen .
Dewar has also stated* that hydrogen is very soluble in liquid air ; it is thus possible that a little hydrogen might have been removed during the initial process with the liquefying machine .
It is noteworthy that the fraction pumped from the charcoal at \#151 ; 205 ' C. contains less hydrogen than that which comes off at \#151 ; 190 ' C. ; the absorption of hydrogen seems to be of about the same order as that of neon .
The total volume of hydrogen obtained from the air was 0*778 e.c. , and the total volume of mixed neon and helium was 46 c.c. Using the estimate of Ramsay , f agreeing with the previous one of Dewar , \#163 ; viz. , 60,000 volumes of air contain 1 volume of neon and helium together , it is found that 2,760,000 c.c. of air contain 46 c.c. of neon and helium and 0*778 c.c. of hydrogen , whence 3,550,000 c.c. of air contain 1 c.c. of hydrogen .
This number can be corrected by assuming , as an approximate factor , the ratio 2*5/ 5*6 derived from the experiments on the air to which hydrogen had been introduced .
The corrected estimate is 1 c.c. of hydrogen in 1,583,600 c.c. of air , or , approximately , one volume of hydrogen per million and a half volumes of air .
On comparing the total volume of air originally dealt with , it is evident that the liquefying plant was of very little use in concentrating the lightest portions ; it is certainly better to calculate the hydrogen on the quantity of neon and helium actually obtained than on the original volume of air .
It appears from these results that the proportion of free hydrogen in the atmosphere is exceedingly small\#151 ; so small , indeed , as to make its exact estimation a matter of extreme difficulty , and we must regard our results as indicating the order rather than the exact proportion in which the hydrogen is present .
In conclusion , I wish to express my warmest thanks to Sir William Ramsay , who suggested and constantly superintended the work during its progress .
