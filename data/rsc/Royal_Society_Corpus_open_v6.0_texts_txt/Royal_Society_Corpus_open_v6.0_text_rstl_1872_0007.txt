On the Normal Paraffins .
By C. Schorlemmer , F.R.S. Received December 20,1871 , \#151 ; Read February 1 , 1872 .
In the year 1858 Bertholet proved that the compound CH3 Cl , obtained by the action of chlorine upon marsh-gas , was identical with methyl chloride , by converting it into methyl alcohol and other methyl compounds .
Since that time the researches of Pelouze and Cahours , as well as my own , have shown that this method is a general one , and that by means of it the corresponding alcohol may be prepared from any paraffin .
On oxidizing some of the alcohols obtained by this method , acids were formed containing the same number of carbon atoms in the molecule as the alcohols themselves contained , from which it would appear that these alcohols were primary alcohols .
Pelouze and Cahours , however , stated that the octyl alcohol which was obtained from octane contained in petroleum was identical with the so-called capryl alcohol prepared from castor-oil , and Chapman afterwards came to the same conclusion .
At that time it was believed that capryl alcohol was a primary alcohol .
However , by the study of its oxidation products I found this not to be the case , but that this alcohol belongs to the group of secondary alcohols , being methyl-hexyl carbinol* .
It was therefore necessary to repeat the experiments of Pelouze and Cahours and Chapman , and to study carefully the oxidation products of the alcohol from petroleum , which none of these chemists had done .
The result of my investigation was that this alcohol is a mixture of methyl-hexyl carbinol with a primary octyl alcohol f. This observation made it highly probable that , by acting with chlorine upon the paraffins , primary and secondary chlorides are formed at the same time ; and the more so , as I had formerly found an acetone amongst the oxidation products of the amyl alcohol from petroleum , the origin of which I was then at a loss to explain $ .
As I have already stated in a preliminary note , further experiments with hexane fully confirmed the correctness of my supposition .
The reasons why , in my former researches , I overlooked the secondary compounds are the following:\#151 ; The mixture from which the chlorides had to be isolated contained , besides large quantities of unattacked hydrocarbon , also higher chlorinated products .
The difference between the boiling-points of the two chlorides is about 10 ' , but by far the greatest portion distils within these limits at a nearly constant temperature ; and as by fractional distillation the boiling-point becomes yet more constant , and the quantity of liquid distilling at this temperature increases , I believed I had obtained a pure compound , and considered the smaller quantities of liquids boiling a little above and below the constant * Proc. Roy .

point to consist of mixtures of the chloride with the paraffin , or with higher chlorinated products .
, .
To convert the chlorides into the alcohols , they were first heated with potassium acetate ; during this operation a large quantity of the secondary chloride splits up into hydrochloric acid and an olefine , from which the acetic ethers formed had again to be separated by fractional distillation .
From the highest boiling fraction , which of course consisted chiefly of the primary acetate , the alcohol was then prepared ; but the quantity obtained was so small , that the acid formed by oxidizing it could not be isolated , and its existence was only proved by analyzing the silver salt , in the preparation of which the small quantity of the acetone remained in aqueous solution and was thus overlooked .
As soon as I had ascertained that by acting with chlorine upon the paraffins a mixture of primary and secondary chlorides is formed , the problem next to be solved was under what conditions the one or the other is formed .
In order to obtain decisive results , it was first of all required to work with large quantities of a hydrocarbon ; and I chose for my first experiments the heccyl hydride or hexane , C6H14 , from petroleum , a hydrocarbon which can be obtained most easily in a sufficient quantity .
The hexane was treated with chlorine under the following conditions:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Dry chlorine was passed into the well-cooled hydrocarbon in diffused daylight .
( 2 ) It was acted upon in the cold by chlorine in presence of iodine .
( 3 ) Chlorine was passed into the vapour of the boiling hydrocarbon .
( 4 ) Chlorine was passed into the vapour in the presence of iodine .
The result was that in all four cases , as first product , a mixture of primary and secondary hexyl chlorides was formed .
Further , it was found that when chlorine acts on the liquid hydrocarbon , or when iodine is present , always large quantities of higher chlorinated products are formed , but that by passing chlorine to the vapour , the formation of these bodies can be almost completely avoided .
In investigating the other paraffins , to be described further on , I always used the latter method .
The apparatus employed consisted of a large flask , which , by means of a cork , was connected on one side with the chlorine apparatus by a tube reaching to the lower end of the neck , and on the other side with a reversed Liebig 's condenser , the upper end of which was further connected with absorption-bottles containing caustic soda solution , and in which the hydrocarbon which was carried away by the current of hydrochloric acid was condensed .
On passing a moderately strong current of dry chlorine into the vapour of the , gently boiling hydrocarbon , the colour of the chlorine disappears instantaneously , and the chloride formed is seen to flow back in oily streaks on the side of the vessel .
The operation was interrupted in the evening , the hydrocarbon not acted upon distilled off , and treated repeatedly in the same way until a sufficient quantity of the chlorides had been formed .
The latter were then heated with the required quantity of potassium acetate , and an equal volume of glacial acetic acid in sealed tubes to 190 ' to ME .

200 ' for two or three hours , by which they were completely decomposed .
On diluting the contents of the tubes with water , a light layer , a mixture of olefines and acetates , separated out , from which , after drying , the acetates were isolated by fractional distillation , and then decomposed by an alcoholic solution of caustic potash .
The alcohols thus obtained were repeatedly washed with small quantities of water and dried , first with fused potassium carbonate , and finally with anhydrous baryta .
Whilst neither a mixture of the two chlorides nor of the acetic ethers can be separated even approximately into its constituents , it is , however , easy to obtain from the mixed alcohols two liquids , each having a nearly constant boiling-point .
But although apparently a definite separation has thus been effected , the bodies obtained in this manner are far from being pure compounds .
This might have been expected , as the difference between the boiling-points of the two alcohols is only about 10 ' .
The products of oxidation showed that the lower boiling liquid consisted principally of the secondary alcohol , but still mixed with some of the primary ; whilst in the higher boiling liquid , besides a large quantity of primary alcohol , also some secondary was contained .
In order to oxidize the alcohols , I used , as in my former researches , a solution consisting of two parts of potassium dichromate , three parts of sulphuric acid , and ten parts of water , which was added gradually to the alcohols until the brownish colour of the liquid indicated an excess of chromic acid , care being taken at the same time to keep the liquids as cold as possible .
After standing for some time , and being repeatedly shaken , the liquid was diluted with water and distilled , when the acetone formed passed over with the first portion .
The residue was again distilled with water , and this operation repeated as long as the distillate exhibited an acid reaction .
The aqueous distillates were neutralized with sodium carbonate , the acetone which dissolved in them separated by distillation , and the solution of the sodium salts evaporated to dryness .
By adding dilute sulphuric acid to the residue , the acid was liberated and dried with phosphorus pentoxide .
Normal Amyl Hydride or * , C5 H12 .
This hydrocarbon is a mobile colourless liquid , boiling at 37 ' to 39 ' , which I first discovered in the light oils from cannel tar* !
* ; it is also found in boghead tar , and in large quantities in Pennsylvania petroleum .
According to Pelouze and Cahours , the amyl hydride from petroleum boils at 30 ' J , whilst Warren has found that it contains two isomerides , C5 H12 , one boiling at 30o,2 and the other at 37 ' S. My last researches agree with Warren 's statement .
I have formerly stated that the amyl hydride from petroleum boiled at 35 ' || ; but this body , as well as the derivatives which I prepared from it , are , as I have now found , only mixtures .
The petroleum which I used for this research * * * S * HoFMAmsr calls this hydrocarbon quintane and its derivatives quintyl compounds .
I prefer the names pentane and pentyl , as corresponding with hexyl and heptyl , which terms are now in general use .

contained but small quantities of the hydrocarbon boiling at 30 ' ; by long-continued and carefully conducted fractional distillation I succeeded in obtaimng about 800 cub. centime , of pure pentane , boding constantly at 37 ' to 39 ' , the hoiling-point of which was not altered by further distillations .
The mixture of pentyl chloride obtained by the method described above boded between 95 ' and 110 ' , the principal fraction distilling at 100 ' to 102 ' .
On decomposing these chlorides with potassium acetate , a mixture of pentene boding at 39 to 40 , and of the acetic ethers boiling at 135 ' to 145 ' , was formed .
The latter were converted into the alcohols , which by fractional distidation could be separated into two portions , one boding at 120 ' to 122 ' , and the other at 134 ' to 137 ' .
The products of oxidation of the alcohols were found to consist of methyl-propyl ^ |CO , and rianic or pentylic acid .
Methyl-propyl ketone is a colourless liquid boiling at 102 to 105 , having the same boiling-point as the ketone obtained by the distillation of a mixture of calcium acetate and butyrate , and that formed by oxidation of isoamylic alcohol .
It combines with the bisulphites of the alkali-metals , and yields by further oxidation acetic and propionic acids .
The aqueous distillate containing these acids was neutralized with sodium carbonate , the solution evaporated , and from the residue the acids liberated by successive distillations with insufficient quantities of sulphuric acid in four fractions , from which , by boiling with silver carbonate , the silver salts were prepared , which were analyzed .

On igniting the dry residue , 0*3265 Ba COs were left behind , corresponding to 40*8 Ba , the calculated quantity being 40-4 per cent. The salt obtained by spontaneous evaporation of the solution is , according to Lieben and Rossi , anhydrous .
I have therefore , after the publication of Lieben 's and Rossi 's complete paper on normal valerianic acid , prepared this salt again ; by spontaneous evaporation it was obtained in small plates and needles , which , after being dried in the air at the common temperature , lost at 180 ' , 2-6 per cent , of water , corresponding to J H2 O. 0-316 of the salt , dried at 180 ' , gave 0*1832 BaC03 , corresponding to 40*3 per cent.

Lieben and Rossi prepared their salt in the dry climate of Turin , whilst I worked in the damp air of Manchester , which may account for the differences .

Lieben 's salt contained only 1 vol. of water ; but all other properties of these salts , which Lieben has described so very minutely , agree perfectly .
From the cold saturated solution shining laminae separate on heating , the greater portion of which dissolve again on cooling ; on the other hand , a solution saturated at 100 ' gives on cooling to 70 ' a crystalline precipitate , which on further cooling nearly completely redissolves .
I have repeated these experiments several times , following exactly Lieben 's instructions , and with exactly the same results .
Besides pentylic acid and methyl-propyl ketone , I also obtained a small quantity of a high boiling liquid , having a pleasant smell like apples , which principally consisted of pentyl pentylate , as on decomposing it with caustic potash , pentyl alcohol , boiling at 134 ' to 137 ' , and pentylic acid were formed .
As there can be no doubt that Lieben and Rossi 's normal valerianic acid has the following constitution , CH3 i ch2 I ch2 dii2 CO. OH , Q 2 it follows that the carbon atoms are grouped together in the same way in the pentane which , therefore , belongs to that group of the paraffins which I have called " normal paraffins ; " and the constitution of it and those of the alcohols derived from it are expressed by the following formulae:\#151 ; a \lt ; D ch3 1 rH ch2 1 d Q -J 1 ch2 \amp ; 8 I ch2 g ^ .

OH CH3 The primary pentyl alcohol from pentane is identical with Lieben and ftossi s normal amyl alcohol ; and the secondary alcohol is methyl-propyl carbinol , a compound obtained by Friedel by the action of nascent hydrogen on methyl-propyl carbinol .
The isoamyl alcohol obtained by Wurtz from isoamylene or ethyl allyl , appears to have the same constitution .
Normal Hexyl Hydride , or , C6 H14 .
This hydrocarbon was discovered by Pelouze and Cahours in American petroleum .
It is also found in cannel and boghead tar , and other coal tars .
According to Warren , petroleum contains , besides the hexane boiling at 68 ' , an isomeric hydrocarbon , which boils at 61'-3* .
In the petroleum which I used this latter body was not present , the fractions between 40 ' and 68 ' being quite insignificant , and diminishing on each further distillation .
The monochlorides obtained from hexane boil between 120 ' and 130 ' , by far the largest portion distilling nearly constantly at 125 ' to 126 ' , as Pelouze and Cahours have already observed .
On acting upon them with potassium acetate , hexene boiling at 69 ' to 70 ' is obtained , and a mixture of the two hexyl acetates , which boil at 158 to 170 ' , and not , as Pelouze and Cahours state , at 145 ' .
The alcohols obtained from the acetic ethers were readily separated by fractional distillation into two portions , one boiling at 140 ' to 141 ' , and the other between 150 ' and 155 ' .
As I have already stated , this separation of the alcohols is only very incomplete .
I tried to obtain the pure alcohols by preparing the iodides and transforming those again in the alcohols .
The iodide obtained from the portion boiling at 140 ' gave an iodide , the chief portion of which boiled , after fractional distillation , at 164 ' to 169 ' .
On heating it with potassium acetate and glacial acetic acid to 100 ' , nearly half of it was decomposed into hexene and hydriodic acid , whilst the remaining portion was converted into an acetate boiling at 155 ' to 159 ' , from which the alcohol was regenerated , but could not be further examined , as it was lost .

The iodide prepared from the alcohol boiling at 150 ' to 155 ' was subjected to fractional distillation ; the largest portion of it boiled constantly at 170 ' to 171 ' .
On decomposing it with potassium acetate , ^ was converted into hexene and -S\#166 ; into hexyl acetate , which boiled at 160 ' to 164 ' .
The alcohol prepared from this acetate boiled now at 149 ' to 152 ' , and yielded on oxidation caproic acid , besides a not inconsiderable quantity of methyl-butyl ketone , from which it follows that it was still a mixture of primary and secondary hexyl alcohol .
The difference between the boiling-points of the primary and secondary iodide is too small to effect in this way a separation of the alcohols .
C H 1 Metliyl-butyl ketone , n 3 \gt ; CO , was obtained , as well as caproic acid , by oxidizing the O4 kLy ) mixture of the two hexyl alcohols , as described above .
It is a colourless liquid with a pleasant smell , and boiling at 126 ' to 128 ' , which forms crystalline compounds with the bisulphites of the alkaline metals .
It exhibits , therefore , all the properties of the acetone which Erlenmeyer and Wanklyn obtained by oxidizing methyl-butyl carbinol on the secondary hexyl alcohol obtained from mannite .
On further oxidation it yields , like the latter compound , acetic and butyric acids , which were converted into the silver salts .

64*67 per cent. In order to throw light on the constitution of hexane , it was necessary to investigate closely the butyric acid obtained from it .
To isolate this acid , the aqueous distillates obtained in the oxidation of the acetone were repeatedly distilled , when the butyric acid came over with the first portions , whilst the greatest part of the acetic acid was left behind .
The aqueous solution of the butyric acid thus obtained was neutralized with milk of lime and evaporated on the water-bath .
The butyrate separated as a crystalline scum on the surface , which was not wetted by water .
The cold saturated solution of this salt , contained in a sealed tube , was heated to 70'\#151 ; 80 ' , when shining laminae separated , which , on cooling , slowly but completely redissolved .
This experiment was more than ten times repeated , always with the same results .
The calcium salt possesses therefore all the characteristic properties of normal calcium butyrate .
The primary alcohol from hexane yielded as the product of its oxidation caproic acid , boiling at 200 ' to 205 ' .
The silver salt is a white precipitate , which from a hot solution crystallizes in small needles .

The most characteristic salt of this acid is the barium salt , which could not be obtained in the crystalline state , but which on evaporating an aqueous or alcoholic solution at a higher or at the common temperature , is always obtained as an amorphous , gum-like mass .
As the caproic acids of different origin have been so far very little studied , I have not investigated the salts of my acid more fully .
The oxidation products of the secondary hexyl alcohol or methyl-butyl carbinol , viz. acetic acid and normal butyric acid , are quite sufficient to prove that the hexane in petroleum is a normal paraffin , the constitution of which is expressed by the formula CII3\#151 ; CII2\#151 ; CH2\#151 ; CH2\#151 ; CH2\#151 ; CH3 .
Hexane from Mannite .
Erlenmeyer and Wanklyn obtained this hydrocarbon by heating the secondary hexyl iodide obtained from mannite with zinc and water .
I found it more convenient to act on the iodide with zinc and hydrochloric acid in the cold .
To prepare it , a flask is filled with finely granulated zinc , the iodide is added , and then so much dilute hydrochloric acid that the zinc is not completely covered .
The vessel must be immersed in cold water , or else a very violent reaction sets in .
After a few hours the heavy iodide has disappeared and a light layer swims on the top , which , when subjected to distillation , was found to consist of a liquid boiling at about 70 ' , besides a smaller quantity of a body boiling at above 190 ' .
The liquid boiling at 70 ' had the odour of hexene , and the reaction with bromine showed that this body was present .
In order to remove it , bromine was added drop by drop to the well-cooled liquid as long as its colour disappeared , and then hexane and hexene dibromide separated by fractional distillation .
The hexane from mannite , after being purified by treatment with nitric and sulphuric acids and rectification over sodium , is a mobile liquid , having the faint but characteristic odour of the paraffins .
It boils constantly at 71'*5 , and has at 17 ' the specific gravity 0*6630 .
By acting with chlorine on its vapour a product is obtained , the greater portion of which boils at 126 ' to 128'*5 , and a smaller at 128'*5 to 130 ' .

chlorinated products had been formed , but only in a small quantity .
From the liquid boiling between 126 ' and 130 ' , the alcohols were prepared and separated by fractional distillation into two portions ; one , being about f of the whole , boiled constantly at 140 ' to 141 ' ; between 141 ' and 150 ' only a small quantity distilled , the remainder coming over between 150 ' and 153 ' .
The products of oxidation were the same as those from the petroleum hexane , viz. methyl-butyl ketone and caproic acid .
The methyl-butyl ketone boiled constantly at 127 ' , and appears to be identical with that which Erlenmeyer and Wanklyn obtained from the secondary hexyl alcohol ; on further oxidation it yields acetic acid and normal butyric , the presence of the latter being proved by the characteristic properties of the calcium salt .
The analyses of the silver salts , which were obtained as described above , gave the following results:\#151 ; Calculated for silver butyrate ... .

0*1655 of silver caproate , which formed small needles , gave 0*0803 Ag=48*5 per cent. , the calculated quantity being 48*43 per cent. The calcium salt had the same properties as that from petroleum ; the barium salt , however , was not amorphous , but crystallized most readily in plates or broad needles .
On decomposing the monochlorides with potassium acetate about equal quantities of the acetic ethers and hexene were formed , and by oxidizing the mixture of the two alcohols the quantity of acetone was double that of the caproic acid .
Now , as the hexene was no doubt derived from the secondary chloride , it appears that by the action of chlorine upon the hydrocarbon \ is converted into the primary chloride , and f into the secondary one .
The hexane of mannite and some of the derivatives boil a few degrees higher than the corresponding compounds from petroleum , and also the barium salts of the two caproic acids exhibit a decided difference .
The hexane from petroleum is certainly not a pure compound ; but whether this is the cause of the difference between the two hydrocarbons , or whether we have here a case of fine isomerism , for which an explanation has to be found , it is at present impossible to decide ; the formation of acetic and normal butyric acids , however , proves that the hexane from mannite is also a normal hydro-carbon .
The products formed by acting with zinc and hydrochloric acid on hexyl iodide consist of hexane , lu^ rt^7'^he'specific'gravi^0 7^38^ SL me boiling-point as the dihexyl obtained by the electrolysis of cenanthylic acid , which , as I shall show further on , is also a normal hydrocarbon .
Whether these two hydrocarbons are identical or not has to be yet deeded .

Normal Dipropyl , C6 H14 .
To obtain this compound , allyl alcohol was first prepared from glycerine by Tolled S method* and converted into propyl alcohol *f* , from which propyl iodide was obtained , boiling at 100 ' to 102 ' .
On adding anhydrous ether and sodium to this iodide no reaction took place , either at the ordinary temperature or at the boiling-point of the mixture .
To effect a complete decomposition , the substances had to be heated together in closed tubes to 140'\#151 ; 150 ' .
Pure dipropyl boils at 69 ' to 71 ' , and has at 17 ' the specific gravity 0 6630 .
It has , therefore , the same physical properties as the hexane from mannite , and from its formation it follows that it has also the same constitution .
The quantity obtained was not sufficient to examine its derivatives .
Normal Eeptyl Hydride , or , C7 H16 .
This hydrocarbon was first discovered by me in the light oils from cannel coal-tar J , and afterwards I found it in large quantities in the petroleum from Pennsylvania S. Warren has since shown that , besides this body , petroleum also contains an isomeric heptane , which boils at 90o,41| ; and my later researches have led me to the same conclusion^ .
This lower-boiling heptane is always present , but in smaller quantities than the normal hydrocarbon .
As the boiling-points of the two isomerides differ only by 10 , their complete separation is a very difficult and tedious process .

conducted fractional distillation I succeeded in obtaining about one litre of normal heptane , 600 cub. centims. of which distilled at 97'*5 to 98 ' , and the remainder at 98 ' to 99 ' .
According to Pelouze and Cahours , the heptyl hydride from petroleum boils at 92 ' to 94 ' ; but this body was a mixture of the two isomerides .
The heptyl chlorides boil at 145 ' to 160 ' , the principal fraction distilling , as I have formerly stated , at about 150 ' .
The acetates which boil between 175 ' and 185 ' yielded , by acting on them with caustic potash , the two alcohols .
The secondary heptyl alcohol boils at 160 ' to 162 ' , and the primary one at 170 ' to 175 ' .
The former yields on oxiC H 1 dation methyl-pentyl ketone , ~ \gt ; CO , and the latter cenanthylic , C7 H14 O. C5 -tin ) Methyl-pentyl ketone has a pleasant smell , like all these acetones ; it boils at 150 ' to 152 ' , and combines with the bisulphites of the alkaline metals .
By oxidizing it with chromic acid , acetic acid and pentylic acid are formed .
The latter was isolated by repeated distillation of the aqueous solution of the two acids , the pentylic acid always coming over with the first portions , whilst the acetic acid is left in the residues , from which , by boiling them with silver carbonate , silver acetate was obtained , crystallizing in shining flat needles .
0*585 of silver acetate left on ignition 0*378 Ag=64*62 per cent. The distillate containing the pentylic acid was neutralized with sodium carbonate , the solution evaporated , and the residue decomposed by sulphuric acid .
The acid , after being dried with phosphorus pentoxide and freed by distillation from a little acetic acid , boiled at 183 ' to 187 ' , and smelt exactly like that obtained from pentane .
The calcium salt separates as a crystalline precipitate on heating the cold saturated solution to about 70 ' , as well as on cooling down the boiling saturated solution to that temperature .

34*5 per cent. 34*6 per cent. The mother-liquor of the barium salt from heptane gave with silver nitrate a white precipitate , which crystallized from boiling water in indistinct needles .
0*387 of this salt gave 0*178 Ag=46*0 per cent. Calculated for C7H1302 Ag=45*6 per cent. A.S the secondary heptyl alcohol yields on oxidation and j)entyhe or valerianic acid , it follows that the heptane is a normal hydrocarbon , having the constitufion CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 .
CEnanthylic acid is consequently a normal acid , and dihexyl , which Brazier and Gosleth obtained by the electrolysis of potassium cenanthylate , is therefore a normal hydrocarbon , to which I give the name dodecane , C12 H26 .
Normal Dibutyl or , C8 H18 .
Normal butyl iodide , prepared by Lieben 's method from butyric acid , and boiling at 128 ' to 130 ' , is easily acted upon by sodium in the cold .
After a sufficient quantity had been gradually added , the mixture was heated for some hours , and then the hydrocarbon distilled off and purified by the well-known methods .
Dibutyl boils at 123 ' to 125 ' , and has at 17 ' the specific gravity 0*7032 .
These are exactly the properties of the octane which I have obtained from methyl-hexyl carbinol* and from sebacic acidf , and of that which Zincke prepared from his primary octyl alcohol J. As the properties of these hydrocarbons of different origin agree so very closely , it appears almost certain that they are identical .
If so , the dioctyl , C16 H34 , which Zincke obtained as a by-product in preparing octane is also a normal paraffin , which I call hecdeca/ no .
We are now acquainted with the following normal paraffins or homologues of marsh-gas , in which the carbon atoms are linked together in a single chain S. .
