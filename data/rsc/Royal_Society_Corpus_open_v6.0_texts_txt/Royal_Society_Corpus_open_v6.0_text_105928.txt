A general Investigation of the Nature of the Curve , formed by the Shadow of a prolate Spheroid , upon a Plane standing at right Angles to the Axis of the Shadow ; in a Letter to the Royal Society , by Mr. George Witchell , F. R. S. Gentlemen , I Beg leave to lay before the Royal Society the following investigation of an irregularity in the duration of the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites , occasioned by the figure of his body .
Read Jan. 15 , 1767 .
It has been known for a long time , that Jupiter 's body was not truly spherical , but a prolate spheroid , and that in a much greater degree than any of the other planets ; but notwithstanding this , it was never suspected that it would affect the durations of the eclipses of the satellite , till Dr. Bevis first thought of it , in the latter end of the summer 1761 .
The Doctor , being at that time indisposed , recommended the subject to my consideration ; and , in consequence of his request , I not long after presented him with a solution of the problem , being in substance substance the same with this , as far as proposition V. a copy of which he soon after transmitted to that excellent mathematician the late M. Clairaut .
In March 1763 , M. de la Land , an eminent French astronomer , being here , Dr. Bevis showed him my paper ; this occasioned a new article in the Conn. des Mouv .

1765 , p. 177 , under the title , Inegalite dans les demi-durees des eclipses des satellites de Jupiter , causee par l'applatissement de Jupiter : in which he mentions this circumstance in the following words ; M. le docteur Bevis me fit voir a Londres , au mois de Mars dernier , un solution rigoureuse &amp; algebraique de ce problem , qui consiste a trouver la courbe qui resulte de la section de l'ombre d'un spheroide a un distance quelconque .
' ' In this state it remained ever since ; for though the Doctor , and some other gentlemen , to whom I showed it , frequently urged me to lay it before the Royal Society ; I always declined it , till I should have time to make some farther additions to it .
A few months since , M. Bailly , a French gentleman , published at Paris an elaborate treatise upon the theory of Jupiter 's satellites ; in which he has been pleased to give the honour of this discovery entirely to M. de la Land , without the least mention of Dr. Bevis .
I then thought it incumbent on me to do justice to the Doctor , by immediately finishing my paper in the best manner I was able , and presenting it to the Royal Society .
I shall be extremely glad , if this rude essay should excite some more able person to treat the subject in the manner it deserves ; for though , I believe , my solution will not be deficient in point of truth , I am not vain enough to think it may not be performed in a more elegant manner .
I have the honour to be , Gentlemen , Your most obedient humble servant , Fleet-Street , George Witchell .

LEMM A. If any spheroid is cut by a plane , in any direction whatever ( excepting that which is perpendicular to its axis ) , the figure of the section will be an ellipsis .

( 1 ) : cosine BF ( b~ ) : : sine ABF ( p + p~z : cosine BAF = sine of LAB , or its equal PAO ; therefore ~= b~ ~p+ p~z = the sine of the required inclination of the planes LPH , BOD .
In like manner in the same triangle it will be as rad .

BA = z/ z ; hence Z= ~/ ~~2 + p~ pz 2 , and Z= p~ pz/ ~~2 +p pz 2 , which are the sine and cosine of the required arc AB .
COROLLARY I. If instead of a sphere we now suppose BEGK represents a prolate spheroid , whose axis is CP ; the figures of the sections LPH , BOD , &amp;c. instead of circles , will become ellipses ( by the lemma ) ; but it is evident that the inclinations of those planes to each other , and likewise the inclination of the right lines AC , BC , or the angle ACB , will remain unaltered .
COROLLARY II .
If BEGK represents any primary planet revolving about the sun in an orbit whose plane co-incides with the plane BCD , it is manifest that BCD will be its ecliptic , making the angle of obliquity BY with its equator EAK ( whose pole is P ) ; and if B be the place of the sun in this ecliptic , at any given time , the arc BI will be the distance of the sun from the nearest equinoctial point I ; and the arc BF his declination at the same time .
COROLLARY III .
If the plane POG , which passes through P , the pole of the spheroid , be perpendicular to the plane LPH , it will also be perpendicular to any other plane BOD , which passes through A , the intersection of the equatorial plane EAK , with the plane LPH ; therefore the angle ACO being a right angle , it is evident that AC will be the semi-transverse , and CO the semi-conjugate axis of the elliptic section BOD .
COROLLARY IV .
Hence it appears , that the transverse axis of any elliptic section BOD , made by a plane passing through the center of the spheroid , will always be equal to the equatorial diameter of the spheroid , but the conjugate axis will be longer or shorter , according as the inclination of the planes LPH , BOD , is more or less .

To find the length of the semi-conjugate axis CO , of the elliptic section AOb , formed by a plane cutting the given prolate spheroid POG through its center C , and making the angle PCO with the axis CP .
Let the sine of the angle PCO= ~ , CG= t , CP= c , CO= x , ( radius being unity ) ; draw PO perpendicular to CP : then in the right angled plane triangle BC O , we have as rad .
( 1 ) : CO ( x ) : : sine PCO ( ~ ) : BO ( x ~ ) ; and rad .
( 1 ) : CO ( x ) : : cosine PCO ( ~ 1 ~2 ) : BC ( x~ 1 ~2 ) ; but from the nature of the ellipsis we have c2/ t2 X t2 x2 ~2 =B C~2 = x2 x2 ~2 ; therefore x2 = t2 c2/ t2 t2 c2 x ~2 , or putting t2 c2 = f2 , and t2 x2 = ~2 , we have x2 = t2 c2/ t2 f2 ~2 , and ~2 = t2 x1~ 2/ t2/ f2 ~2 .

Let BOD be an ellipsis , whose transverse diameter Ab makes the angle ACB , with the right line BCD , and let TkG be a tangent to the ellipsis , in the point F , making the angle GTC with the right line BCD : It is required to find the length of the normal Ck , drawn from the center of the ellipsis , to the tangent TG .
From C , the center of the ellipsis , let CE be drawn parallel to the tangent T G , meeting the ellipsis in the point E ; and CG perpendicular to the line BCD , meeting the tangent in the point G : Put the sine of ACB= Z , its cosine = Z , the sine of TGC= V , its cosine =V ( radius being unity ) AC= t , CO= x , and t2 x2 = ~2 ; then will the sine of OCE ( = the sine of OCD+DC E ) be expressed by ZV+Z V , and by the last proposition we shall find CE =t x/ ~ t2 ~2 xZV+Z V ; but ( by conics ) CExCk=COxC A , whence we shall obtain Ck=~ t2 ~2 xZV+Z V~2 .

Put MS= ~ , KS= r , MN= ~ , the sine of the given angle hnM= q , its cosine = q~ , the sine of HNM= V , its cosine = V , the sine of HNMhnM= x , and radius = 1 .
Let ML be drawn parallel to H K , and Ml parallel to S K : then in the right angled plane triangles NM l , SML , we have as rad .

( 1 ) : MS ( ~ ) : sin. LMS ( V ) : LS ( ~V ) ; but Ml+ LS = KS ; therefore ~V + ~V = r , and by the foregoing notation V=q+ q~ x , and V= q~ q x ; therefore these values of V and V being wrote in the above equation we shall find x= q~ ~+q~ r/ q~-q~ ~ , and from thence V=~ q~ r/ q~ q~ ~ , and V=qr ~/ q~-q~ ~ .
PROPOSITION V. Fig. 5 .
If the opake prolate spheroid BPO D , given in species and position , be opposed to the given luminous sphere HKQI at the given distance C S , forming the shadow Ffb c : It is proposed to determine the figure of the section aRN made by a plane , cutting the shadow perpendicularly to its axis at the given distance M S. Let the required curve aRN be conceived to be generated by the extremity R , of the variable right line M R , revolving about the given point M as a center , the line MR being alway8s perpendicular to the axis of the shadow MS : Let the right line RQ be a tangent to the sphere HKQI in the point Q , and in the same plane with the right lines R M , M S , it will then represent one of the rays of light , which constitute the conical superficies of the shadow , and , therefore , by the laws of optics , will be a tangent to the spheroid also ; now when the generating point R has arrived at N , the ray RQ ( being supposed to revolve with it ) will co-incide with the tangent N K , touching the sphere in K , and the spheroid in F : Join K , S , and the angles NM S , and NK S , will be right angles ; let the spheroid be supposed to be cut , by the quadrangular plane NMS K , forming thereby the elliptic section BO D , draw Ck perpendicular , and Cl parallel to N K ; put CA= t , MC= ~ , CS = d , MS = ~ , SK = r , MN = v , CO = x , the sine of bNM= V , its cosine = V , the sine of ACB= Z , its cosine = Z , and radius = 1 : Then in the right angled plane triangle Cl S , it will be as rad .

If the sphere HKQI represents the sun , and the spheroid BPOD one of the primary planets , it will appear , from the preceding reasoning , that the figure of the section of its shadow received upon a plane , which is perpendicular to its axis , will not be a circle ( except when the axis of the planet produced passes through the sun 's center ) but a curve of the oval kind , whose species will be known from the foregoing equation .
If the sphere HKQI had been regarded as a spheroid in the above solution , it is easy to see that the foregoing process would have determined the nature of the required curve ; but the figure of the sun is so nearly spherical , that it was not thought necessary to embarrass the solution with that consideration .
Hence the duration of an eclipse of a given satelles may be determined in the following manner : Let BRC ( fig. 6 .
) be the section of the shadow , through which the satelles passes , NpN the path of the satelles , making the given angle Np M , with the circle of latitude Rp M ; BMCa part of the primary 's orbit produced , and Mp the given latitude of the satelles at the time of the syzygia ; the circle of latitude RpM is represented in fig. 1 .
by the primitive circle BEG D , and the angle RM N , by the spherical angle EB A ; therefore the sine of RMN= the sine of EBA= the sine of EBF+FBa+aBA =a p ' + a ' p+ a ' p ' apx z , and its cosine = a ' p ' apa p ' + a ' px z ; which for the sake of brevity may be expressed by y , and y ' ; then putting Mp= n , MN= v , the sine of MpN= m , its cosine = m ' , and radius = 1 ; we shall have the sine of MNP expressed by m y ' + m ' y ; and therefore we shall have in the plane triangle MpN , as the sin. MNp ( m y ' +m y ) : Mp ( n ) : : sine MpN ( m ) : MN ( v ) ; hence v= m.n/ my ' + ym ' ; from which , and the equation of the curve ( determined above ) v y/ m =p N , and consequently , the duration of the eclipse will become known .
In prop. I. the sine of the angle ABF is expressed by p+ p ' z , and its cosine by p ' p z , instead of their true values pz ' + p ' z , and p ' z ' pz ; this was done to render the following conclusions more simple than they otherwise would have been ; and as the angle aBA is , by hypothesis , but small , its cosine will approach so near to the radius , as not to occasion any sensible error in the result ; and the same may be observed with regard to what is advanced in prop. IV .
It remains now to apply , what has been investigated above , to the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites , and to examine whether the prolateness of his figure will have any sensible effect upon their durations ; and this is become the more necessary , as that celebrated astronomer M. de la Land ( who candidly acknowledges , that he was excited to turn his thoughts upon this subject , from a cursory view of this paper , which was shown him by Dr. Bevis * ) does not seem to have considered the question , with that degree of attention which I think it demands .
But before this can be done with exactness , it will be necessary to have the inclination of Jupiter 's axis , with respect to his ecliptic , and the place of his equinoxes determined by observation , neither of which I believe has yet been done with any degree of certainty ; I shall , therefore , proceed in this inquiry upon M. de la Lande 's hypothesis , that Jupiter 's axis is perpendicular to his orbit ; and perhaps this supposition is not so far distant from the truth , as to occasion any material error in the conclusion .
It may also be remarked , that in the general equation given above , V and V express the sine and cosine of the semiangle of the cone of Jupiter 's shadow , but this angle can never exceed 3~ , and consequently we may very * Vid. Connoiss .

safely use the radius instead of V wherever it occurs .
By this means the general equation will become rdV=~ t2 ~2 , or which is the same rdV =x , therefore V= r-x/ d ; but by prop. IV .
V=qr v/ q~-q'v , which , because q is nearly equal to V , and q ' v very small with respect to q ~ , will become V=r v/ ~ ; therefore r-x/ d =r v/ ~ , from which we shall find ~=~x~ r/ d ; and this equation is exactly the same with that which would arise from considering the sun as a circular , and Jupiter as an elliptic plane , limited by one of his meridians , and always parallel to the disk of the sun ; which supposition , the immense distance of Jupiter from the sun renders very allowable .
From this equation an easy mechanical method may be derived of delineating the curve of the shadow , at any given distance from Jupiter , for as x denotes any semi-diameter of the elliptic section of Jupiter 's body , it is manifest , that the term ~/ d x x , will express the corresponding semi-diameter of a similar ellipsis , whose axes are to those of Jupiter in the given ratio of ~ to d , and the term ~r/ d is wholly given : Therefore if arm ( fig. 7 .
) be such an ellipsis , and there be drawn through its center M any number of semi-diameters M a , M b , M c , &amp;c. meeting the ellipsis lipsis in a , b , c , &amp;c. let a A , b B , c C , &amp;c. be taken each equal to the given term ~ r/ d , and the points A , B , C , &amp;c. will be in the required curve .
It appears from considering the nature of this curve , that it will have two cusps , one at each extremity of its lesser axis , which will approach toward each other , according as the distance ~ is augmented ; therefore , if the distance of the section of the shadow , from Jupiter 's center , was taken , such that ~=d c/ r c , the lesser axis of the curve would then vanish , and the cusps meet in the center , and thereby form two distinct shadows ( as represented in fig. 8 ) ; in consequence of which , if a satelles , revolved at that distance , it might suffer a double eclipse , at the same conjunction , which remarkable phenomenon may also happen , at a less distance from Jupiter , in some circumstances .
I shall now show how the duration of an eclipse of a given satelles may be determined independant of the equation of the curve ; and this , perhaps , will be the more acceptable , as it will afford a practical rule , which may be applied , in every position of Jupiter 's axis , with very little trouble .
This may be done by the help of the following proposition .
PROPOSITION VI .
If a circle eDfG be described about the conjugate axis G D , of a given ellipsis ADB G , and a right line OF be drawn , making the given angle F~ D , with the conjugate axis , and passing through the given point ~ taken therein , it is proposed to determine the length of the segments F f , E e , intercepted between the circumference of the circle , and the perimeter of the ellipsis .
From the point F , draw the right line Fd parallel to the transverse axis A B , meeting the conjugate GD in the point d , and the circle in c ; draw the lines C F , C f , C c , and let c~ be joined : Then by conics we shall have , as C B : C D : : tang .
F~ D : tang .
c~ D , and in the right lined triangle C~ c , it will be as Cc ( C D ) : sin. C~ c : : C~ : sin. Cc ~ , whence the angle c C~ becomes known ; but as CD : CB : : tang .
cC ~ : tang .
FC ~ ; therefore FC~ is known ; from which taking away the given angle fC ~ , there remains the angle FCf ; consequently all the angles , in the right lined triangle fCF , together with the side Cf ( CD ) , are known : we shall therefore have , in the right lined triangle , Ff C , as sin. fF C : C f : : sin. fC F : f F , one of the required segments , and by a similar operation , the other segment Ee will be found , whence as of is given , OF will become known .
COROLLARY I. The required segments F f , E e , will be found in the same manner , when the given point ~ is not taken in one of the axes , but any where between ; but in that case , the point where the line OF intersects the conjugate axis , must be first determined .
COROLLARY II .
If a perpendicular Cn be let fall from C upon the line E F , the angle ~Cn will be given , to which , adding FC~ ( found above ) the angle FCn will be known ; hence we shall have the following analogy for determining Fn : As tang .
fC n : tang .
FC n : : f n : F n. Now let KkH ( fig. 10 .
) represent the disk of the sun , and eDfG that of Jupiter , considered as a circle , whose diameter is equal to his axis D G , draw Np n , the path of the satelles , making the given angle Np R , with a right light Rg drawn parallel to the diameter D G , and let ab be the duration of the eclipse , and V the apex of the shadow in this hypothesis ; join V a , V b , and let the plane aVb be produced , till it meets the sun 's disk in K and k , it will then intersect the disk of Jupiter in the line f~e , and the lines VK , Vk , will also touch the circumference of the circle eDf G , in the points e and f , draw the line SV , and it will be the axis of the shadow , and consequently will pas through C and M , the centers of Jupiter , and the section of the shadow ; join a M , b M , f C , e C , and the triangles ab M , of C , will be similar to each other , and , therefore , abM being wholly given , feC will likewise be known .
Let ADBG be the elliptic section of Jupiter 's body , and produce e~f both ways , till it meets the periphery of the ellipsis in the points E and F , draw K F , k E , and produce them till they meet with a b , produced both ways in N and n , then will Nn be the required duration of the eclipse in the true shadow : Now the triangles KfF , KaN , being similar , as are also the triangles ke E , kb n , and the segments F f , e E , being given by the preceding proposition , the required segments N a , b n , will also become known , for they will be to the former segments in the given ratio of SM to S C. It may be observed , that this method is equally applicable , whether the axis of Jupiter is perpendicular to his orbit , or not ; for if it is not , we can easily find by proposition I and II .
the species and position of that elliptic section of Jupiter 's body , to which a right line connecting the centers of the sun and Jupiter is perpendicular ; and this being obtained every thing else will remain as before .
As it would require more time , than I have to spare at present , to enter into a particular inquiry concerning the alterations , which this irregularity in the shadow will occasion , in the present theory of Jupiter 's satellites , I shall conclude with observing , that the errors in the semi-durations of their eclipses , arising from this cause , may sometimes amount to 20~ in the first ; 50~ in the second ; 2~ 19~ in the third ; and 11~ 14~ in the fourth ; which errors will , I believe , be deemed sufficiently large to merit the attention of astronomers .
