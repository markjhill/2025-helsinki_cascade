ABOUT three months ago I wrote a paper entitled " Consideration of the objections raised against the geometrical representation of the square roots of negative quantities , " which paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. YOUNG , and read on the 19th of February last .
At that time I had only discovered the manner of representing geometrically quantities of the form a+ b/ j 1 , and of geonietrically adding and multiplying such quantities , and also of raising them to powers , either whole or fractional , positive or negative ; but I was not then able to represent geometrically quantities of the form a+b ^/ " 1 , that is , quantities raised to powers , whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities .
My attention , however , has since been drawn to these latter quantities in consequence of an observation which I met with in M. MOUREY'S work on this subject ( the work which I mentioned in my former paper ) ; the observation is as follows : " Les limits dans lesquelles je me suis restreint m'ont force6 passer sous silence plusieurs esp &amp; ces de formules , tells sont celles-ci a4 , a _ , sin ( 1 ) &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c. Je les discute amplement dans mon grand ouvrage , et je demontre que toutes expriment des lignes directives situ6es sir le meme plan que 1 et 1 .
" 1 where a , and 1 in M. MOUREY'S notation signify respectively a ( 1 ) 41 and ( 1)4 according to my notation .
2x2 From this observation it was evident that M. MOUREY had arrived at the geometrical representation of all algebraic quantities whatever , and that in a larger work he entered fully into the subject ; but from his Preface it appeared also , that this larger work existed only in manuscript , and that circumstances would not permit the author to publish it at present .
I was induced therefore to pursue my own investigations further ; and the result was , that I found ( as M. MOUREY had stated ) that all algebraic quantities whatever are capable of geometrical representation , and are represented by lines all situated in the same plane : and my view in what I am now writing is to communicate this result to algebraists .
This paper , therefore , is intended as a continuation of my " Treatise on the geometrical representation of the square roots of negative quantities ; " and the object of it is to extend the geometrical representation to the powers of quantities , whose indices involve the square roots of negative quantities .

Def. ) Mathematicians apply the words 'possible ' and 'impossible ' to algebraic quantities , the former signifying either positive or negative quantities ; the latter , quantities involving the square roots of negative quantities .
In this sense , as a matter of convenience , these words will be used in this paper ; it being understood at the same time that by the word 'impossible ' no impossibility is necessarily implied , but on the contrary , that the quantities called impossible have a real existence , and are capable of geometric representation .

Def. ) Logarithms , according to the common definition given by mathematicians , must be possible quantities ; therefore as a general definition of logarithms will be given in this paper , it will be desirable for the sake of distinction to give a more limited name to the common definition of logarithms , and accordingly they will be called possible logarithms ; also for the like reason , the powers of quantities according to the common definition of powers , will be called possible powers .

358 With respect to quantities such as sin ( a +b -1 ) ) , cos ( a +b/ -1 ) , &amp;c. , quantities strictly speaking not algebraic , it may be observed , that if it be found useful to introduce these quantities into algebra , they may without im propriety be introduced , by giving to sines , cosines , &amp;c. , algebraic definitions ; thus sin A may be defined to signify AA ( 1)c( i ) C ( E)A -I(E Av -OJ L -- ... . .
_ , and we shall have a 4-1/ -a1 jbb1 sin(a+ -l)=0 ---U ----- ? ?
2_ -i2_ -_ , therefore , considering sines , cosines , &amp;c. , merely as algebraic quantities , we may make use of the expressions sin ( a +b/ ) , cos ( a +b fJ ) , &amp; c , if such expressions be found convenient in algebraic operations .
