281 The Effect of Light on the Transpiration of By Sir Francis Darwin , F.R.S. ( Received October 22 , \#151 ; Read December 4 , 1913 .
) The method employed is essentially that described in my paperf " On a Method of Studying Transpiration , " where it was applied to the investigation of the relation between the relative humidity of the air and the loss of water by leaves .
The stomata of the plants used were closed by vaseline or cocoa-fat rubbed in , and the leaves were then incised to allow of transpiration .
No attempt was made to subject the plants to light of known intensity .
My object was to compare the transpiration occurring in a dark room with that in a north light at a laboratory window .
The rates of transpiration were estimated either by weighing or by means of a potometer , and the general plan was to subject the plant to alternate light and dark periods of something-like an hour .
J The psychrometric condition of the laboratory air and that of the dark room was estimated by the wet and dry bulb thermometer , and the transpiration rates corrected for any differences , in the manner described in the paper above referred to .
The first experiment was made by a plan which has some merits , but was afterwards replaced by the simpler method of moving the apparatus from the window to dark room and back again to the light .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; December 9 , 1909 .
P. laurocerasus .
Branch fitted to potometer December 8 and the lower surfaces of the leaves greased ; leaves cut about 10 a.m. , December 9 .
Placed under a bell-jar through which a current of laboratory air is drawn * It is not easy to find any recorded experiments on the transpiration of leaves in light and darkness , in which the action of the stomata is absolutely excluded .
In Bonnier and Mangin 's experiments on the transpiration of fungi this is facto the case ( see ' Ann. Sc. Not .
, ' 1884 , vol. 17 , p. 298 ) .
The average of the experiments on Trametes suaveolens is :\#151 ; L/ D = 119/ 100 .
For versicolor the corresponding fraction is 127/ 100 .
The symbol L/ D stands for the relation between the transpiration in light and darkness .
+ ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' this vol. , p. 269 .
+ A few weighing experiments were , however , made on the effect of the natural darkening occurring at night .
The average of eight experiments gave the proportion between transpiration in the day ( L ) and in the evening ( D ) , as L/ D =* 129/ 100 .
Four experiments made with the potometer under similar conditions gave day ( L)/ evening ( D ) = 112/ 100 .
This subject , including the effect of continuous darkness , requires fresh investigation .

Transpiration was approximately steady before darkening and fell from 213 to 175 , or from 121 to 100 , during actual darkness ; or , if we include the reading taken at 11.54 , it fell from 213 to 157 , or from 136 to 100 .
There is the same doubt about the effect of subsequent illumination .
If we compare the end of the dark period with the last reading taken in the light the effect is nil .
If we compare reading at the beginning of the light ( 157 ) with that at the end ( 174 ) we get a rise of 100 to 111 .
On the whole it is fairest to take the darkening effect as 136 :100 , the light as 100 : 111 .
The average of the light and dark effects is L/ D = 124/ 100 .

In some cases transpiration is but slightly affected by darkness , as in the ollowing experiments .
The material was supplied by small branches of laurel having , as a rule , four leaves , vaselined and cut ( four incisions per leaf ) in the usual way .
A branch was fitted to a simple form of potometer consisting of a pipette graduated to 0 01 c.c. The pipette was fixed vertically and the branch attached to the lower end by rubber tube ; as the plant absorbs water the descent of the meniscus is read with a lens , by which means errors of parallax are fairly well avoided .
The experiments were made alternately in a dark room and at the north or east window of the laboratory.* Readings were generally continued for an hour before the change from light to darkness , or versa , was made .
The results , i.e. the amounts of water absorbed per hour in light and darkness were corrected for psychometric differences .
The dates of the experiments summarised below were April 21 , 22 , 23 , 28 , 29 , May 1 , 2 , 3 , 1913 .
The results were somewhat irregular and are therefore given in the form of an average .
A single experiment is , however , given in detail .

The room was to the south and care was taken to avoid sunshine .

2.30 " 0-715 0-125 I have usually estimated the transpiration by taking the average of the two last readings in each period , Light ( L ) or Dark ( D ) , as the case may be .
But in Experiment 8 the first L reading should clearly be the average of the last L and the first D reading , i.e. 170 .
The other averages are D 138 , L 134 , D 125 ; they are included in the general average .
The results of the above-named eight experiments show considerable irregularity and no clear impression is gained by inspection .
I have therefore taken the average of 31 readings from the series , 18 representing transpiration in light , and 13 in dark .

The following experiments were made in an improvised laboratory having a bright north light ; but the dark room was not perfect and the plants could not be exposed to absolute darkness .
The potometer used was of the Kohl type , having a horizontal tube 095 mm. internal diameter .
The march of the meniscus was generally timed over half a centimetre .
The meniscus is brought back to zero by turning a tap and allowing water to enter , as in the instrument designed by Prof. Ganong .
The rate of transpiration is corrected for ^ ( relative humidity ) .

The first column gives times of observation .
The second the number of seconds occupied by the absorption of one degree of the potometer , i.e. of FOl c.c. The third column ( R = rate ) gives the reciprocals of the time readings ( Column 2 ) multiplied by 10,000 .
Thus the hourly rate of absorption ( R ) is expressed in units of 0-0036 c.c. The fourth column gives , the rate R corrected for tie .

I Weighing Experiments ( Laurel ) .
In a few experiments the transpiration was estimated by the loss of weight of a cut branch ( laurel ) in a bottle of water covered with a layer of olive oil .
The branches had each six leaves , which were carefully vaselined and cut in the usual way .
The stem and all buds also vaselined with care .
The Effect of Light on the Transpiration of Leaves .
293 The experiments took place in the laboratory above referred to , in which darkness was not absolute .
The specimens weighed from 100 to 130 grin .
, and were only weighed to within 5 mgrrn .

Results .
S 1 .
The method employed was to close the stomata by carefully rubbing the stomatal surface with cocoa-fat or vaseline , the intercellular spaces being afterwards put in communication with the outer air by means of incisions .
In the case of leaves not thus treated , it is well known that the closure of the stomata in darkness greatly diminishes the evaporating surface and vice versa .
In my method the evaporating surface is a constant .

The tables given under S 2 show a remarkable degree of variability : the extreme cases are : April 19 , 1911 , when the result was nil , and May 24 , The Effect of Light on the Transpiration of Leaves .
299 1913 , when the transpiration in light was double that in darkness .
The average ratio for transpiration in light and darkness is : ivy , 136/ 100 ; laurel , 132/ 100 .
But between May 14 and June 16 the laurel gives an average 150/ 100 , and , speaking generally , it cannot be doubted that the laurel reacts to illumination more in early summer than in spring .
The winter experiments are not sufficiently numerous to justify any comparison with those obtained in summer .
It is at present impossible to form any conclusion as to the cause of the increased reaction in June .
I have no evidence as to whether the increased permeability to water is a periodic effect , or connected with the age of the leaf , or with the brightness of the summer sky , as compared with illumination earlier in the year .
S 4 .
With regard to the main fact that transpiration is increased by light or diminished by darkness , we may either accept the view of Wiesner , * viz. , that in light the chloroplasts are warmed by the absorption of radiant energy , or we may believe that light produces an increased permeability of the plasmic membrane to water , a point of view to which the interesting work of Lepeschkin and Trondlef on the increased permeability to dissolved substances produced by illumination may possibly give some support .
Or we may combine Wiesner 's theory with those of the other writers .
It is a pleasure to express my thanks to Miss D. F. M. Pertz for the valuable aid she has given me throughout the research .
