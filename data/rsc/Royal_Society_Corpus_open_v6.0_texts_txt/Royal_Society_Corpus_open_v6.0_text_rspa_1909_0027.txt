On the Wave-lengths of Lines in the Secondary Spectrum of Hydrogen .
By Herbert Edmeston Watson , B.Sc. ( Lond. ) .
( Communicated by Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received February 12 , \#151 ; Read March 11 , 1909 .
) The spectrum of hydrogen is one which has engaged the attention of numerous observers from the year 1851 onwards .
Historically it is of great interest , firstly owing to the part it played in the controversy between o # Angstrom and Wullner on the plurality of spectra , and secondly , because it was the first spectrum in which a relation between the wave-lengths of the lines composing it was discovered .
It is not proposed to discuss the origin of the two hydrogen spectra in this communication , as it has recently been done in a very complete manner by Dufour ; j* the main points at issue , however , may perhaps be briefly stated .
Wtillner , ^ ; who was the first to make detailed observations of the spectra of hydrogerf under different conditions , described three spectra .
The first consisted of three bright lines , the second of a number of bands , and the third of several bright lines mostly in the green .
This was disputed by * The absolute magnitudes of the numbers in the series compared are very different , but this merely depends on the definitions chosen for the several harmonic functions .

On Wave-lengths of [ Feb. 12 , Angstrom , * who maintained that one substance could have only one spectrum .
Hasselberg , f however , showed that though Wullner 's third spectrum was due to impurity , yet the other two could always be obtained from one sample of hydrogen , their relative intensities alone varying .
The results of numerous investigations following this early work have given rise to two hypotheses : firstly , that the primary spectrum is due to atomic , and the secondary to molecular , hydrogen , and secondly , that the primary spectrum arises from the presence of water vapour .
Some observers also maintain that the secondary spectrum is due to impurities .
The above-mentioned paper by Dufour , however , seems to point very definitely to the correctness of the first hypothesis mentioned , inasmuch as he found that hydrogen prepared by several different methods and purified by diffusion through a hot platinum membrane gave the same spectrum in vacuum tubes of glass , silica , and fused boron trioxide .
In all cases , both the primary or stellar spectrum , and the secondary spectrum were seen .
Observations were also made at atmospheric pressure by means of an arc between electrodes of various carefully purified metals .
The results were the same as before , even when the tube was cooled in liquid air .
The primary spectrum alone was produced in an atmosphere of water vapour , but was also found in a tube of dry hydrogen which had been standing in contact with phosphorus pentoxide for a long time , and hence the spectrum is not due solely to water vapour .
Other experiments upon the effects produced on the spectrum by a magnetic field , and the introduction of condensers into the circuit , led to the same conclusion , viz. , that the primary spectrum is due to atomic , and the secondary to molecular , hydrogen .
The above brief abstract will show the stage which has now been reached by experimental work on the origin of the two hydrogen spectra , and though we are not definitely able to assert that the conclusions drawn are correct , yet the data on the subject are extensive and sufficiently complete .
When , however , we look upon the spectrum of hydrogen from another point of view , namely , that of the wave-lengths of the lines comprising it , it will at once be seen that the same completeness does not exist .
The lines of the primary spectrum have , it is true , been measured with accuracy by Ames , $ and Evershed , S but it must be remembered that , in spite of their importance owing to the relation between their wave-lengths discovered by Balmer , || the number so far seen is only 29 , and , of these , two-thirds occur * 'Pogg .

only in stellar spectra .
Moreover , the intensity of nearly all of them is very small when compared with that of many of the secondary lines seen in an ordinary hydrogen vacuum tube , so that in order to eliminate hydrogen from a spectrum , it is equally important to know the wave-lengths of the secondary lines .
The classical research of Hasselberg , * which has given us the most complete list of wave-lengths of the hydrogen lines we possess , is not sufficiently accurate for modern requirements , especially in the red portion of the spectrum .
In the first place , the scale upon which the wave-lengths are based is that of Angstrom , and , in the second place , it is pointed out by Hasselberg himself that the effect of temperature changes was very great , and difficult to eliminate , two prisms of carbon disulphide having been used as the dispersive medium .
However , as will be seen from the following table , the results are remarkably near to those obtained by more refined apparatus .
The only other available measurements are those of Ames , f who gives 61 of the chief secondary lines between the green and ultra-violet regions , and of Frost , | who determined the wave-lengths of 90 lines between A. 4725 and A 4358 , the source being a helium tube which developed the hydrogen spectrum .
These measurements could not be continued owing to the tube running out .
In addition , Dufour gives a list of the wave-lengths of 125 lines from A 4935 to A 3652 , but these determinations were made by means of a grating without a slit , and are only accurate to half an Angstrom unit .
This want of data first attracted my attention when measuring the spectrum of the lighter constituents of the atmosphere , S which consisted partly of hydrogen .
When working with the rare atmospheric gases it is very difficult to remove hydrogen from the electrodes of vacuum tubes , and , moreover , there are cases in which it may be of advantage to have hydrogen present , in order to use its lines as standards .
Consequently , it is highly desirable that the wave-lengths of all the brightest lines in the secondary spectrum should be known as accurately as possible .
With this end in view , the following experiments were made .
The gas to be examined was contained in a vacuum tube with aluminium electrodes , and having a quartz plate sealed on opposite the end of the capillary portion .

Mr. H. E. Watson .
On Wave-lengths of [ Feb. 12 , In one case no hydrogen was put in the tube , but a new electrode was used , and the tube filled with moist air .
It was then pumped empty and a current passed .
A large quantity of hydrogen was produced , which was pumped off until the tube became phosphorescent .
The direction of the current was reversed , and thereby causing a further evolution of hydrogen .
After three exhaustions the tube was sealed off , and it was found that on running for a few hours the quantity of gas did not appreciably increase .
When a series of photographs had been taken with this tube it was evacuated and filled with dry hydrogen made from palladium hydrogen , the pressure being about 1 mm. At greater pressures the brilliancy diminished .
The two series of spectra obtained in this way were very similar , but the first one contained a considerably larger number of lines than the other .
These additional lines were always very weak , and could not be attributed to impurities , so that it seems probable that they were merely made visible because of the slightly greater brilliancy of the first tube used , and no distinction is drawn between them and the others in the following table .
One plate , however , was obtained which showed a number of not very weak lines in the extreme ultra-violet , and several of these appear to be identical with the stronger lines occurring in the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen flame given by Liveing and Dewar.* I was unable to obtain them again .
The secondary spectrum of hydrogen consists of two parts , the first being composed of a large number of lines , which are nearly all sharply defined , and which are particularly intense in the orange and violet regions .
Although plates were used which were sensitive as far as X 8000 , no lines could be detected on the less refrangible side of the C line ; but , on the other hand , a considerable number were measured the wave-lengths of which were less than X 3646 , the theoretical limit of the primary spectrum according to Balmer 's formula .
It is possible , however , that owing to the correspondence with Liveing and Dewar 's values just mentioned , the majority of these arise from the presence of water vapour .
The second part of the spectrum appears to be continuous , and extends from about X4570 to the extreme ultra-violet .
The lines of the primary spectrum were not especially brilliant , the intensity of the F line being about equal to , but certainly no greater than , that of the stronger secondary lines .
Only eight primary lines could be seen at all , whereas Ames was able to measure 13 .
The tubes always contained mercury vapour , which was only very slowly absorbed by the electrodes , so that mercury lines were obtained on all the photographs , and the colour of the incandescent gas was a pale pink .

A current from an induction coil without a Leyden jar was used to illuminate the tubes , and* exposures of 16 hours were given .
This was not really sufficient , as many of the weaker lines were hardly visible , and very difficult to measure , but it was found that not much advantage was to be gained by increasing the exposure beyond this time , as the temperature changes and vibration were apt to produce a blurred image .
All the measurements were made in the first order of the Rowland Concave Grating at University College , the focal length of which is 10 feet , and which is ruled with 14,438 lines to the inch .
A quartz condensing lens was used to focus the image of the capillary part of the tube on to the slit , and an iron arc spectrum was photographed on each plate above the hydrogen .
Wratten Panchromatic plates , 25 cm .
long , were used , except when photographing beyond the C line , in which case Spectrum plates were employed .
Both the hydrogen and principal iron lines were measured twice on each plate , and the wave-lengths of the latter calculated .
The differences of the values obtained in this wray from the known iron wave-lengths were then plotted against the micrometer readings , and a curve thus obtained by means of which the wave-lengths of the hydrogen lines could be corrected for errors arising from the screw , etc. At first , the wave-lengths of the iron lines given by Kayser and Rung * were used as standards .
But it was found that they were not sufficiently accurate , and finally , only the standard iron lines , given by Kayser , f and some of Rowland 's standards were employed .
In several cases where the correction was not quite certain both the spectra were remeasured on a different part of the screw .
No attempt was made to determine the absolute wave-lengths of the hydrogen lines from those of the iron lines because of the probability of a lateral shift between the two spectra , but lines in the gas spectrum were themselves used as standards , those chosen for the purpose being three primary hydrogen lines , and the yellow and green mercury lines .
Prom these , the wave-lengths of some second order mercury lines were determined , and used as standards in the ultra-violet .
The values adopted for the wave-lengths of these standard lines were:\#151 ; 6563 -05 3654 -96 5790 -86 3650 *28 5769 *80 3131 94 5460 -93 3125 -78 4861*50 2655 26 4358 -49 2653 -83 4101 -90 * Watts , ' Index of Spectra , ' App. C , p. 1 , 1888 .

On Wave-lengths of [ Feb. 12 , The C and F lines are Howland 's standard values , and the figure for H is the one recently given by Evershed.* Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining reliable values for the yellow mercury lines , as those given by Kayser and Rungef differed by more than 0*3 A..U .
from the values actually obtained .
Consequently , a redetermination of the wave-lengths of these lines was undertaken , a mercury lamp being used as the source of light , and the preliminary results confirmed those previously obtained with the hydrogen tubes .
However , before the investigation was completed , the required values were found in a paper by Hartmann , J in which the determinations of Fabry and Perot of the wave-lengths of the four chief mercury lines were reduced to Rowland 's scale , and these values were consequently adopted .
The lines 3654 and 3650 are given by Ames , S with whose values mine agree very closely , and the last four lines on the list were measured in the second order .
It must be borne in mind , however , that these so-called standards were really more of the nature of checks upon the values obtained .
Actually all the wave-lengths were calculated from those of the C and F lines by means of the iron standards , and it was only necessary to introduce a slight additional correction amounting at most to 004 A.U. in order to obtain the most exact values .
The error in the measurements is difficult to estimate .
The numbers given in the table are , for the most part , the mean of three values obtained from three different plates , weighted according to the distinctness of the line on the plate , although , as before mentioned , many of the very weak lines could only be seen on one plate , and in consequence , the liability to error of such is considerably greater than that of other lines .
Each plate was measured twice , the readings of one line rarely differing by more than 0*01 mm. , corresponding to 0'05 A.U. , and the agreement between numbers given by different plates being fairly good .
This correspondence really gives the best idea of the errors .
Their extent may be seen from the following table , which 6 55 56 57 2 19 22 22 2 60 59 55 1 92 98 98 2 52 56 49 1 88 91 89 10 01 01 01 1 . .

shows the decimal parts of 20 consecutive lines chosen at random .
The numbers in the first column denote the relative intensities , and it will be seen that the very weak lines are much more liable to error than the others .
The only line which caused difficulty owing to its strength was the C line , but its position was accurately determined by taking a number of readings .
Table I gives a list of the lines measured , together with their relative intensities .
For the sake of comparison , Hasselberg 's values are also given , but as they were on Angstrom 's scale , the corrections given in Watts ' ' Index of Spectra , ' App. B , p. 1 , have been applied to reduce them to Rowland 's standard .
The second place of decimals has , however , not been altered owing to the uncertainty of the amount of such alteration .
Hasselberg 's intensities have also been ranged from 0 to 10 instead of from 1 to 6 .
It will be noticed that Hasselberg gives a considerable number of lines in the yellow-green region which I have not observed .
It seems probable that as his measurements in this part of the spectrum were visual , and the eye has a maximum of sensitiveness in this place , these additional lines were too weak to be recorded photographically , and , indeed , indications of several lines can be seen which are too weak to measure .
It may be , however , that , in view of the way in which the intensities of different parts of the secondary spectrum vary , Hasselberg 's tubes were of such dimensions , and were filled at such pressures , that the yellow portion of the spectrum was brighter than in my experiments .
In the table , the values of Frost and Ames are included , and it will be seen that the agreement is very close .
Table II gives a list of the principal mercury lines which were measured , the values being deduced from photographs in both the first and second orders .
The figures are very near those of Ames , and hence are probably rather more accurate than those of Kayser and Eunge , in spite of the " limit of error " given by these observers .
It will also be noticed that the intensities differ considerably from those previously published , a possible explanation being that my values were obtained for a mixture of mercury vapour and hydrogen .
In conclusion , I should like to take this opportunity of offering my best thanks to Sir William Ramsay for supplying me with a sample of pure hydrogen , and for the constant interest he has taken in this work .
