From every glycol it is possible to obtain two radicals-one monatomic , the other diatomic .
From every glycerine it is possible to obtain three radicals , which are respectively mono- , diand tri-atomic .
The compounds which these radicals form with the metalloids have been long since prepared and thoroughly studied .
Our knowledge of the compounds which they form with cyanogen , whose behaviour so much resembles the metalloids , is not in so forward a state .
At present we are only acquainted with a few of the cyanides of those of them which are destitute of oxygen , and the acids they form when submitted to the action of potash .
The object of the present investigation is to extend our knowledge in this direction .
With this view I propose to myself the following questions Is it possible to prepare also the cyanides of the oxy-radicals of glycol or glycerine ?
And if it be possible , is the action of potash on these cyanides analogous to its action on the ordinary cyanides ?
If the foregoing questions be answered in the affirmative , we shall then be able to obtain in this way , from every glycol , two , and from every glycerine three acids .
A glance at the following Table will make this intelligible : Diatomic Alcohol ( Glycol ) .

0 in the glycerine series , which I succeeded in preparing in the following manner:_ A mixture of ohe equivalent of dichlorhydrine and two equivalents of pure cyanide of potassium , together with a quantity of alcohol , was maintained at the temperature of 1000 Cent. for twenty.four hours in wellclosed soda-water bottles .
At the expiration of this time it was found that all the cyanide of potassium had been converted into chloride .
The contents of the bottles were then filtered , and to the filtered liquor , which no doubt contained the body C6 16 02 Cy , in solution , solid potash was added .
To this , heat was applied in such a manner as to prevent the escape of the alcohol by evaporation ; and its application continued till ammonia ceased to be evolved .
As soon as this was observed , the alcohol was distilled off , and the residue treated with nitric acid , which was afterwards removed by evaporation at a low temperature .
The nitric acid accomplishes two objects .
it destroys in a great measure the tarry matter which is present in large quantity , and at the same time sets free the organic acid combnined with the potash .
The free acid was then separated from the nitrate of potash by means of alcohol .
On evaporating the alcohol a dark-coloured residue was obtained , which was dissolved in hot water and treated with chlorinie .
Finally a silver-salt of the acid was prepared by the following kind of fractional precipitation : About one-third of the neutralized acid was first precipitated by the cautious addition of a solution of nitrate of silver .
The liquor was then filtered , and the remainder of the acid was converted into the silver-salt .
By these meanis I obtained , instead of a browni , a perfectly white precipitate , which yielded an acid in colourless crystals when decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen .
Dried at 1000 Cent. these crystals gave on analysis numbers which agree tolerablv well with the formula C10 It , ?

On evaporating the alcohol anl oily residue was obtainied , which was washed with a solution of carbonate of soda and distilled .

I find , bowever , from the 'Annalen der Chemie und Pharniacie ' of last month that I have been anticipated by Wislicenus , who has succeeded in forming lactic acid in the manner I have just described .
