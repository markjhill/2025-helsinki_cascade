" ; Monthly Magnetic iDeterminiations , from June to November 1866 inclusive , made at the Observatory at Coimbra , " by Professor J. A. DE SOUZA , Director of the Observatory .
Communicated ( with a Note ) by the President .
RXeceived Alay 8 , 1867 .
[ NOTE.-These observations contain the record of the commencemenit of the absolute mragnetic determinations at thie Coimbra Observatorv , with instruments procured by M. de Souza at Kew , and on the system of observation and reduction adopted at the Kew Observatory .
The employment of the photographic continuously self-recording instruments at Coimbra has hitherto been delayed by the works requir:ed for the introduction of gas into the Observatory ; but this has now been accomplished ; and a letter , dated April 20 , 1867 , from the Director states that the plhotographic records were at that date on the point of commencing .
The latitude and longitude of the Observatory are 40ยง 12'-5 N. , and 80 25 ' W.E. S. ] 06servations of De/ fection , Vibration , and Dip taken at the Coimbraz Observatory , 1866 .
The horizontal , vertical , and total forces are calculated to English measure .
The vertical and total forces are obtained from the absolute measures of horizontal force and dip .
The value of log 7r2 K determined at the Kew Observatory is= 1 64829 at temp. 620 Fahr. The value of log , is =6 30487 .
The values of the coefficients q and q ' are respectively 0 000128 , 0 00000030 .
The temperature correction was obtained from the formula q(to-38 ) + q ' ( to38)2 .
The correction for error of graduation of the deflectioni-bar at 1'0 foot is = -0o00006 , at 13 is =-0'00024 .
The time of one vibration has been obtainied from the mean of twenty-four determinations of the time of 100 vibrationis .
The angles of deflection are each the mean of two determinations .
The difference between the angles of every pair was found always less than 40 " .
In deducing from these observations the ratio and product of the magnetic moment m of the magnet , and of the earth 's horizontal magnetic intenisity X , no correction has been required for the rate of the chronometer , or for the initial and terminal semiarcs of vibration , the former having been always less than 2'50 , and the latter less than 70 ' at commencement , and 30 ' at end .
But the induction and temperature corrections have always been applied , and the observed time of vibration has been corrected for the effect of torsion of the suspending thread .
The torsion for 900 was found no less than 5'*18 , and no greater than 8 ' 67 .
In the calculations of the ratio X the third and subsequent terms of the series 1 +.2+ R+ &amp;c. ve been omitted .
The valuie of the constant P was fouiid to be = -0 ) 0022317 , by the meani of thirty-one determinations obtained each frozm two pairs of deflection observa.tions at distanices 10 and 13 foot .
The horizontal force for each day is the mean of those calculated for each pair of deflections at distances 1P0 and 13 foot .
