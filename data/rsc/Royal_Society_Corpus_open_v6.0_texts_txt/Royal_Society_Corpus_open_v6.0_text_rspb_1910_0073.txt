149 The Oxidation of Phenol by Certain Bacteria in Pure Culture .
By Gilbert J. Fowler , Edward Ardern , and William T. Lockett .
( Communicated by Dr. A. Harden , F.R.S. Received September 30 , \#151 ; Read November 17 , 1910 .
) In the course of investigations on the effect of various antiseptic substances on bacterial sewage filters , it was found that solutions of pure phenol could be oxidised on filters of this description .
It was further found that the phenol apparently exerted a selective action on the bacteria present in the filter , only three or four types of organism appearing in the filtrates .
Of these about half were liquefying organisms , identified as B. Jiuorescens .
At first it was thought that the main non-liquefying , or extremely slowly liquefying , organism wras B. Jiuorescens on account of the apparently fluorescent yellow colonies it produced ; subsequent investigation showed that this was not the case ( see note at end of paper ) .
It is therefore referred to in the paper simply as the chromogenic organism .
On passing a current of filtered air through the liquid containing a mixture of these organisms , together with small quantities of phenol , the latter was slowly oxidised , which was , not the case in a control experiment where organisms were absent .
, Preparation of Pure The survival of the particular organisms\#151 ; B. liquefaciens and the chromogenic organism\#151 ; in the experiments referred to , and their constant presence in filtrates from other filters dealing with pure phenol solutions , led to experiments being made on the separate effect of each of these organisms on phenol in solution .
Colonies of the organisms in question were separated ; the liquefying variety was usually grown on gelatine , the chromogenic organism in broth .
Cultures were obtained from different sources\#151 ; from the plates made in connection with the previous experiment , and from plates made from filtrates from different filters .
Later , further cultures were obtained from plates showing colonies of only one organism .
I he culture medium used had the following composition :\#151 ; Broth.\#151 ; Per litre of water .

The preliminary experiments made in connection with the action of each of the organisms on phenolic solutions were carried out in 40-oz .
bottles , fitted with rubber stoppers , tubes , etc. , and arranged in series in a similar manner to the preceding experiment .
The procedure generally adopted was as follows:\#151 ; To a sterile phenol solution ( vol. 500 c.c. ) containing O01 to 002 per cent , of phenol , a quantity of the culture of the particular organism under examination was added , the solution aerated and tested from time to time .
The experiments throughout were conducted in such a manner as to prevent as far as possible any air or other infection .
It was not supposed that the solutions were kept entirely free from infection , the extent of the contamination presumably increasing with the length of duration of experiment .
I. Action of Bacillus liquefaciens fluorescens on Phenol .
Several experiments were made in connection with this organism .
Generally a few cubic centimetres of liquefied gelatine containing the organisms were added to a pure phenol solution , and in one case to a solution of phenol with added nitrate and nitrite .
Practically no change , however , was noted in the phenol content of these solutions after two months ' aeration .
The numbers of organisms present at the commencement of experiments were several millions per cubic centimetre , and after two months a considerable number in active condition were still to be found in the solutions .

Action of the Chromogenie Organism on Phenol .
( a ) Broth Cultures.\#151 ; Experiments were first conducted with broth cultures of this organism .
A few cubic centimetres of a broth culture were added to a pure phenol solution .
For two or three days no change was noted in the solutions ; subsequently , however , the disappearance of phenol was rapid , the whole being completely oxidised in five or six days from the commencement of the experiments .
Typical example:\#151 ; Oxygen absorbed from acid permanganate solution in 3 minutes .

The 3 minutes oxygen absorption test was chosen as the most convenient for the detection of phenol and its approximate estimation .
The accurate determination of phenol in such dilute solutions would be a long and tedious process , while the amount of oxygen absorbed by the constituents of the broth or its products of decomposition bears a very small proportion to the amount taken up by the phenol .
( b ) Diluted Broth.\#151 ; An experiment was made using about 30 c.c. of a diluted broth culture in place of ordinary broth .
Again it was noticed that no change took place for a few days , followed by rapid disappearance of phenol .
The time taken to complete the experiment was eight days , or rather longer than with ordinary strength of broth .
Two experiments were afterwards made with diluted broth cultures ( 35 c.c. ) with the addition of a few cubic centimetres of ordinary sterile broth .
As before , no change was noted in the earlier stage of the experiment , but after four days only , complete oxidation was rapidly brought about in 24 hours .
The air passing through these solutions was previously sterilised by bubbling through mercuric chloride solution .

152 Messrs. Fowler , Ardern , and Lockett .
[ Sept. 30 , It appears , therefore , that the action is accelerated by the addition of further nutrient material .
( c ) Cultures on Special Media.\#151 ; A few cubic centimetres of one of these cultures were added to a phenol solution .
The disappearance of phenol in this case was gradual , commencing in the first day or two\#151 ; the time taken , however , for oxidation was considerably longer than in the case of the broth cultures , viz. 16 days .

Gelatine plates were made from the solutions and it was found , generally , that the numbers of the chrornogenic organism present in the solutions , being several millions per cubic centimetre at commencement , were considerably increased during the experiment .
Proportionally , the number of organisms other than the chromogenic present in the solutions were few .
( d ) Addition of a Culture of the Chromogenic Organism to a Solution previously unacted upon by B. liquefaciens fluorescens.\#151 ; An interesting bottle experiment was made as follows:\#151 ; To a solution of phenol previously unacted upon by a culture of B. liquefaciens as described in the preceding , a broth culture of the chromogenic organism was added .
Within four days of the addition of the second culture almost complete oxidation of the phenol had taken place .

] Oxidation of Phenol by Certain Bacteria .
Flash Experiments.\#151 ; Similar experiments to the preceding were made with cultures of the chromogenic organism under rigid sterile conditions .
Four flasks ( 300 c.c. capacity ) , fitted with rubber stoppers , tubes , etc. , and connected in series , were used in each experiment .
The inlet of the first flask and the outlet tube of the fourth flask were connected with wide tubes drawn out at one end and plugged with cotton wool .
To each of the four flasks at the outset of experiment was added 150 c.c. of phenol solution of required strength ( 10 parts per 100,000 ) .
The inlet tubes were raised in the stoppers so that a short space was left between the surfaces of liquids and the ends of the tubes .
The apparatus connected and complete with the contained solutions was then placed altogether in a steamer and sterilised for three successive days .
A culture of the organism was divided into two equal parts , one half being heated to boiling for a minute or so , and further sterilised by placing in the steamer for three days at the same time as the apparatus described above .
When sterile , the second flask was carefully disconnected from its stopper and sterilised or " dead " culture added , the flask being quickly reconnected .
To the third flask the remaining half of the culture which contained the living organisms was added in exactly the same manner .
The tubes , which had been raised to prevent " sucking back " of the solutions during cooling periods , were then pushed through the stoppers , care being taken that no portion of the tubes which had been previously exposed to the air occupied a position inside the flasks .
The contents of flasks were then as follows:\#151 ; Flask I ... ... . .
Phenol solution alone .
" II ... ... ... " " + dead culture .
\#187 ; 111 \#187 ; " + living " " IV ... ... ... " " alone .
Air was slowly drawn through the solutions by means of an aspirator ( rate 10 to 20 litres per day ) in the direction of Flask I to IY .
By this means the solution containing the living culture was kept free from air infection .
Gelatine plates were made of all the solutions after the experiments , and the following is a general description of the bacteriological results obtained:\#151 ; Flask I.\#151 ; ( Phenol alone .
) Very little contamination and occasionally none whatsoever .
Not more than two organisms per cubic centimetre were present at any time .
Flask II.\#151 ; ( Dead culture .
) Free from air infection .
Plates of 1 c.c. solution usually made .
In one case great numbers of the chromogenic 154 Messrs. Fowler , Ardern , and Lockett .
[ Sept. 30 , organism were found to be present , due to " sucking back " of some of the liquid contained in the third flask ; no other organism found .
Flask III.\#151 ; ( Living culture .
) With one exception the liquid contained only organisms of chromogenic type .
In the isolated case 20 moulds ( per cubic centimetre of liquid ) were found to be present , possibly introduced with the culture , or during plating , whilst many millions of the organism under investigation were found to be present .
Flask IV.\#151 ; ( Phenol alone .
) Generally contained the chromogenic organism .
On one occasion it was entirely free .
The presence of organisms in this flask is due to the carriage of organisms by the air from the flask containing the living culture .
Chemical Results.\#151 ; The following is a typical example of the results I obtained:\#151 ; Oxygen absorbed from acid permanganate in 3 minutes .

While these experiments were not quite so perfectly successful as could be desired , yet sufficient evidence was obtained to show that a pure culture of the organism used was capable of oxidising phenol , whilst no change was noted in the phenol content of solutions containing " dead " cultures .
Similarly , no change has been observed in the phenol content of solutions of pure phenol .
The time taken for oxidation varied from two to several weeks .
It should be noted that the aeration in these experiments was very much less than that obtained in the " bottle " .
experiments .
The amount of aeration appears to make considerable difference in the rate of oxidation .
Both broth and diluted broth cultures were used in these experiments .
The following experiment was , however , conclusive , and confirmed the natural inference drawn from the foregoing .
A solution was made containing approximately 0*01 per cent , of phenol , together with the following ingredients :\#151 ; Per litre .

] Oxidation of Phenol b Certain Bacteria .
155 Four hundred cubic centimetres of this solution were sterilised in a litre flask , plugged with cotton wool , in a steam steriliser for three successive days .
When sterile , a few drops of a broth culture of the organism were added , particular care being taken to prevent contamination .
It was intended to limit the amount of carbon in the media , it being supposed that the phenol on oxidation would supply the deficiency .
The flask and contents were incubated for several days at 20 ' C. , the liquid being aerated by an occasional shake .
The solution was tested after five days with the usual precaution to prevent contamination .
Results:\#151 ; Oxygen absorbed from acid permanganate in 3 minutes .

On the ninth day , before submitting the solution to chemical tests , gelatine plates were made .
Two plates were made taking 1 c.c. of the liquid , and one plate each for 0*01 c.c. , 0*0001 c.c. , and 0*000001 c.c. Bacteriological Results ( 3 days at 20 ' C. ) .

The solution contained 130,000,000 organisms per cubic centimetre , and there was not the slightest evidence of contamination .
It may be safely concluded , therefore , that dilute solutions of phenol are oxidised by the particular organism under investigation .
Experiments are being carried out to determine the exact effect upon the oxidation of phenol by this organism , of the addition of other nutrient substances , Experiment II ( b)having shown that the addition of broth accelerated the action .
Researches have also been in progress on the bacterial oxidation of sulphocyanates , which appears to be more complex , and certainly less rapidly effected than the oxidation of phenol , inasmuch as when a mixture of the two substances is submitted to bacterial oxidation the phenol is invariably the first to disappear .

] A Method for Isolating and Growing the Lepra Bacillus of Man .
( .Preliminary Note .
) By F. W. Twort .
( Communicated by Leonard Hill , F.R.S. Received September 30 , \#151 ; Read November 17 , 1910 .
) ( From the Laboratories of the Brown Institution , University of London .
) For a number of years different investigators have attempted to cultivate the lepra bacillus of man and the allied organisms found in the rat and other animals .
It is not intended in this preliminary note to discuss the numerous papers which have been published from time to time from the various English , Continental , and American laboratories .
These papers deal with non acid-fast bacilli , or with acid-fast bacilli growing quickly on ordinary media , which , in the opinion of the writer , are contaminating organisms , and not the true lepra bacillus .
So far , no one has produced a culture of acid-fast bacilli isolated from a leper , and showing the characters of the lepra bacillus as found in the tissues of man .
It was with the object of obtaining a pure living culture of the lepra bacillus that these investigations were undertaken .
