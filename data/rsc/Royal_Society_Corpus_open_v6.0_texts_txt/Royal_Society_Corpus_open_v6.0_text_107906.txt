-Memoir on the occurrence of Iodine and Bromine in certain Mineral Waters of South Britain .
By CHARLES DAUBENY , M.D. F.R.S. Professor of Chemistry in the University of Oxford .
Read May 6 , 1830 .
TfHIE discovery in sea-water of iodine and bromine , two principles which , although in minute proportions , are said to be generally diffused throughout the present ocean , naturally suggested the inquiry , as to whether these same ingredients might not be found to exist in springs occurring in inland situations when containing a similar saline impregnation .
This accordingly has been already determined by STROMEYER , LIEBIG , and others , to be the case in many of the brine-springs of Germany , France , and Italy ; but at the time my attention was first directed to the subject , I was unacquainted with any trials of the kind having been instituted with reference to those of this country , except by Professor TURNER of the London University , regarding the presence of iodine in the mineral waters of Scotland ; in only one of which , that of Bonnington near Leith , he appears to have detected it .
I was therefore induced in the course of last spring and summer to undertake a pretty extensive survey of such English springs as are known to contain a considerable proportion of common salt ; and having succeeded in detecting in several of them traces of one or both the substances alluded to , I inserted a brief account of the results obtained , in the Philosophical Magazine and Annals of Philosophy for September last .
An article that has appeared in a subsequent number of the same periodical work has , however , been the means of drawing my attention to a little work by Mr. MURRAY , entitled " Experiments on Chemical Philosophy , " which had not before fallen in my way ; and from this it is clear , that the detection of iodine in the Gloucester Spa water had been made by that gentleman some time before I had engaged in the inquiry .
I am unable , however , to discover in his publication , although it bears so late a date as 1828 , any thing that can substantiate the assertion which its author has made in the number of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals referred to , as to his having anticipated me in the discovery of iodine in the springs at Cheltenham* , or in that of bromine in those of Ingestrie .
I consider myself , therefore , still warranted in claiming as my own the first public announcement of the existence of bromine in our English springs ; but I am far from attaching importance to a discovery which had been previously made in so many similar situations abroad , and would wish it to be understood , that my only pretence for offering to the Royal Society the present communication , is the circumstance of my having examined on the spot most of the mineral springs hereafter enumerated , and having undertaken , wherever it appeared practicable , to obtain an approximation at least to the proportion which these principles bore to the other ingredients present , and to estimate their comparative frequency and abundance in the several rock-formations .
To the geologist , the results of such an inquiry may be of interest , as tending to identify the products of the ancient seas in their most minute particulars with those of the present ocean : and to the physician it may be an object of curiosity , to speculate how far the unexplained virtues attributed to certain mineral waters depend on the presence of these ingredients , the energy of whose action may perhaps compensate for the minute quantity in which they are found .
I confess , indeed , that with regard to the former of them , Iodine , we ought to be sceptical as to any medicinal agency that can be exerted by so small a quantity as a single grain diffused through ten gallons of water , the largest proportion in which I have ever detected it .
But with respect to the second , Bromine , after considering the statements of its discoverer M. BALARD , as to its highly poisonous operation upon animals , which my own experience e Mr. AINSWORTH , however , one of the editors of the Edinburgh Journal of Natural and Geographical Science , states , that he had communicated the fact of the existence of iodine in the Cheltenham waters previously to my announcement of it .
of the irritating effects of its vapour tends fully to confirm , I cannot view it as absurd to trace the medical virtues ascribed to such waters as those of Ashbyde-la-Zouch , to the presence of even so small a quantity as a grain of hydrobromate of magnesia ( if such be the combination ) in each pint of the water ; and that the proportion would not fall far short of that , my experiments on this particular spring seem to warrant me in concluding .
It is curious at least , that almost the only two brine-springs , properly so called , which have acquired any reputation as medicinal agents , that of Kreutznach in the Palatinate , and that of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire , both should contain a larger proportion than common of this new principle ; and that in either instance that reputation should have been enjoyed , long before any suspicion as to their peculiar nature could have been entertained .
The objects I had in view in this inquiry being what are above stated , I have chosen to classify the springs noticed in the accompanying Table according to the geological position of the strata from which they issue ; and under the head of each have set down the total amount of their saline ingredients ; the nature and proportion of them as ascertained by former chemists , or , whenever I could not depend upon the results , by myself ; and the proportion which the iodine and bromine , where either of these principles existed , bore to the quantity of water , and likewise to that of the chlorine which the solid ingredients of the spring might contain .
The latter statement has been introduced in order to remove an impression which may have been created in consequence of the detection of iodine , as it is said , even in common pump-water* when very large quantities of it were evaporated ; from which circumstance it might be inferred , that this principle is not only a constant accompaniment of common salt , but that its quantity bears a pretty regular ratio to that of the latter ingredient .
Although I have myself evaporated no less than forty-eight gallons of the Oxford pump-water without finding the slightest trace of iodine in the last portions , I shall not dispute the truth of the former position , which might possibly have been borne out , had still larger quantities been operated uponf ; but that the latter opinion is untenable , will be readily seen from the accompanying Table , which shows that the proportion of iodine to chlorine varies in every possible degree , and that the springs most strongly impregnated with common salt are in some instances those in which I have evaporated the largest quantity without detecting any trace of iodine .
The same remark will equally apply to bromine ; so that the general inference seems to be , that although these two principles may perhaps be never entirely absent where the muriates occur , yet that their distribution is certainly very unequal , and therefore forms a proper subject of scientific research .
The quantity in which the former of these ingredients occurs in mineral waters is commonly so inconsiderable , that I have been unable to determine it by direct analysis , and have been therefore obliged to content myself with obtaining an approximation to its real amount .
In the case of one of the Leamington springs , indeed , I employed the agency of nitrate of silver to precipitate the iodine from the concentrated water , and afterwards separated by means of ammonia the chloride from the iodide of silver obtained .
I have reason , however , to believe , from some comparative experiments , that where the proportion which this latter ingredient bears to the former one is extremely small , it may be taken up either wholly or in part by ammonia ; and I therefore contented myself in other instances with evaporating the water until it began to produce the characteristic blue or violet tinge with starch and sulphuric acid .
This was then compared with the colour imparted by the same test to a solution of hydriodate of potass of known strength ; and the latter , if not of the same shade already , was brought to it by dilution with a measured quantity of water .
Having thus noted the proportion of iodine in the test liquor with which the concentrated solution corresponded , it was easy to calculate what it must have been in the mineral water itself , by knowing the number of times its original quantity had been reduced by evaporation previously to the employment of this re-agent .
The sulphates and muriates present in brine-springs do not appear to interfere with the delicacy of this test ; but where bromine was also present , I have portion of iodine in sea-water , although I have reduced ten gallons of it , taken from the English Channel near Cowes , to less than half an ounce , without being able to detect any in the residuum .
There seems reason , however , to infer , from what is stated in the next page , that the starch test cannot be relied upon to detect very minute quantities of iodine , when a comparatively large proportion of bromine is present in the same solution .
seen the liquor , either at the time or shortly after the operation of the re-agent , assume a pinkish hue , owing , as I suppose , to the reddish tinge of the bromine given out mixing with the blue colour of the iodide of starch .
In stating therefore , as I have done in the Table , the proportions of iodine in several of the waters , I am far from pretending to offer more than an approximation to the relative quantity in which it occurs , and am fully aware of the necessity of more precise experiments , conducted on a different principle , before the points in question can be considered as satisfactorily determined .
The starch test I find will readily indicate a quantity of iodine not exceeding one grain to 7 gallons of water , or one 450,000dth part ; but as in no case that has occurred to me the proportion exceeded one grain to 10 or 12 gallons , and in many appeared scarcely to amount to one-10th of that quantity , I despaired of arriving at more accurate results , by adopting any other method that aspired to greater precision than the one already stated .
In every case in which I have noted that no iodine could be detected , the water had been concentrated at least as far as to one-30th of its original quantity without effect ; so that the proportion of this principle , supposing after all any of it to exist , could not well amount to a grain in 200 gallons .
In some cases , indeed , where the spring was one of weak impregnation , I have carried the concentration much further , as may be seen in the Llandrindod waters , where no traces of iodine appeared , until they had been reduced to nearly one-50th of their original volume .
In my trials for bromine , I have in great measure conformed to the directions of BALARD ; first boiling down the water to about a fourth of its original quantity with a portion of quicklime to prevent the bromine from being dissipated by the heat ; and then , after filtering the residuum , introducing chlorine as long as any sensible yellowness was caused by its addition .
The water was then strongly agitated with ether , which collects on the surface , carrying with it the bromine with which it had combined , and was then poured off into a separate vessel .
[ The bromine , immediately upon being thus removed from the water , was treated with a quantity of a concentrated solution of pure soda sufficient to render the ether containing it colourless ; the latter alkali being employed for this purpose in preference to the vegetable one , as I found that bromine formed with sodium a salt more soluble in alcohol than it did with potassium .
] 227 Unfortunately , however , the salts which are contained in or deposited from the ethereal solution after the addition of the soda , appear to be of a very mixed description , consisting not only of the hydrobromate and bromate of soda , but also of the muriate and chlorate , together with a little uncombined alkali , if the proportion of the sodium to the bromine is not very nicely adjusted .
I therefore began by heating the whole product sufficiently to convert the bromate of soda into the bromide , and the chlorate into the chloride , of sodium ; and afterwards , in order to ensure the union of any alkali which may have been in excess with carbonic acid , I dissolved the whole in water impregnated with that gas .
The solution was then brought to dryness , and strong alcohol added to separate the bromide of sodium as much as possible from the other ingredients ; after which , the alcoholic solution , having been evaporated , was re-dissolved in water , and nitrate of silver added to it in order to form the insoluble bromide of silver , the weight of which , when dried and melted , would determine that of the bromine present , every 100 grains according to M. BALARD indicating 41.1 of this principle .
From the weight of the precipitate , however , I felt myself obliged to make a large deduction , in proportion to the quantity of alcohol employed , for the chloride of sodium at the same time taken up ; having ascertained by a previous experiment how much common salt a given quantity of this menstruum could dissolve .
The latter part of the process , however , being liable to some uncertainty , I should have preferred , had my engagements permitted , re-examining the waters on the spot , and operating on such quantities of them as would have enabled me to extract appreciable quantities of bromine .
This indeed I have done in the case of the Middlewich water , but not with sufficient attention to the quantities employed and obtained , to enable me to calculate in this manner the exact proportions between them : with regard to the other springs , the quantity of water which I could conveniently transport to my laboratory was not such as to enable me to pursue with much hope of success this particular method .
It is therefore with diffidence that I offer provisionally the statements given in the Table , as an approximation to the relative quantities of bromine existing in some of our English springs , calculated according to the scheme of analysis above stated ; and shall hope at some future and not very distant period to obtain results more worthy of reliance , should my further labours on this subject not be rendered in the mean time unnecessary by the investigations of some other chemist .
In cases where the quantity of this principle appeared to be less considerable , as in the Leamington , Cheltenham , and Gloucester waters , I have contented myself with guessing at its proportion by concentrating the water until it assumed a decidedly yellow tinge with chlorine , noting what proportion of bromine in water produced a colour of equal intensity .
The earliest of the rock-formations in this country that come under our consideration with reference to the present inquiry , is the greywacke slate of North Wales , which in the neighbourhood of Bualt in Radnorshire gives out springs containing a notable proportion of common salt .
Those of Llandrindod have long enjoyed some reputation as medicinal agents , but their composition does not appear to have been correctly ascertained ; for the most modern analysis I have seen* assigns to them a considerable proportion of muriate of magnesia , of which I find scarcely a trace .
The more newly discovered springs at Bualt itself , though less celebrated , are similar in point of constitution ; and being double the strength of those of Llandrindod , ought to possess superior medical virtues .
At both places are waters which differ from the rest in containing an unimportant impregnation of sulphuretted hydrogen , but in other respects correspond .
Many of our coal-pits emit streams of salt water ; but the most remarkable spring of the kind is that already noticed , of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire , which for the last few years , especially since the erection of the bat-s , which are now so great an ornament to the spot , has acquired a certain local reputation in the cure of diseases .
Previously to the discovery of bromine , of which I detected in this water an appreciable quantity , Dr. THOMSON of Glasgow had examined its composition ; and I have therefore been satisfied with adhering to the results of his analysis , which is stated in the Table .
The most important , however , of the salt-springs that we meet with in this country are those in the new red sandstone formation of Cheshire ; for an analysis of which I may refer to a paper of Dr. HENRY'S , published in the Transactions of this Society .
In this instance , also , I have adopted the statements of another , merely making a proportionate deduction from the amount of the ingredients given by that able chemist , in consequence of the weaker impregnation of the samples of water I employed , than of those on which he appears to have operated .
It will be seen by reference to the Table , that all the brine-springs of that district contain bromine , and most of them iodine ; indeed it is probable that if I had had time to concentrate larger quantities of the water , the latter would have been detected throughout .
It may be remarked , however , that the rocksalt of Northwich in Cheshire contains no trace of either principle ; a circumstance explicable from the more deliquescent nature of the hydriodic and hydrobromic salts , which would cause them , together with the earthy muriates , to remain in the mother-liquor after the common salt had crystallized , and thus to become distributed through the substance of the marly beds afterwards formed over the rock-salt , from which the brine-springs appear to derive their saline impregnation .
There is a blue variety of rock-salt met with at Ischel near Saltzburg , which , from the resemblance between its colouring matter and that of the compound of starch and iodine , might be suspected to contain this latter principle united with some kind of vegetable matter .
I have been unable to obtain a specimen deeply enough tinged with the colouring matter alluded to , to set the question completely at rest ; but on dissolving a portion of the blue salt , which I obtained through the kindness of Mr. HEULAND , in water , not the slightest tinge appeared to be communicated to the solution , neither did any blueness appear on re-crystallizing the salt .
The specimen alluded to gave no indications of iodine when tested with starch in the usual manner , and was nearly pure from admixture with foreign ingredients , although it appeared to contain a trace of sulphuric acid and of lime .
At present , therefore , I am inclined to attribute the colour rather to some peculiar arrangement of the particles of the common salt itself , than to the presence of any other ingredient .
The springs containing purgative salts , which arise from the lias clay in various places along its whole range from Leamington to Gloucester , appear to be derived from the same source as the brine-springs of Cheshire and Worcestershire above alluded to ; but their saline contents have been modified by the sulphuric acid generated by the decomposition of the sulphuret of iron present in the stratum from which they immediately proceed .
Hence the proportion of earthy muriates is usually greater in them than in the brine-springs properly so called ; because the muriatic acid disengaged by the action of the sulphuric acid upon the common salt has dissolved a fresh quantity of lime or magnesia from the surrounding materials of the rock .
If such be the origin of the sulphates of soda and magnesia which impart to these waters their aperient quality , it would be natural to expect that they should be found in greater abundance on the first discovery of the spring than after it has been long drawn upon ; and hence , perhaps , the remarkable discrepancy between the results of my examination of the Gloucester and some other waters , and those given on the authority of former chemists , may be explained , without impeaching the accuracy of either .
It will be seen by reference to the Table , that I have represented the ingredients of the Leamington waters on the authority of Dr. THOMSON , as stated by Dr. LOUDON in his Practical Dissertation* on these springs ; and those of Cheltenham , with the exception of one lately discovered at Pittville , on that of Dr. SCUDAMORE .
The springs of Tewkesbury and Gloucester I have myself examined ; there being of the former no analysis at all , and of the latter only one by Mr. AccuM , which I had reason to believe , what I in fact found , quite inapplicable to its present composition .
The spring which goes by the name of the Chalybeate Saline is at present destitute of iron , which I am assured it formerly possessed , whilst the Sulphureous contains no trace of sulphuretted hydrogen .
These two springs , which at present appear almost identical , are the ones most strongly impregnated with purgative salts , and therefore approximate more nearly to the character of that analysed by Mr. AccUM , according to his representation , than either of those termed " the pure saline , " which he professed to have examined .
Many of these springs it will be seen contain traces of bromine and iodine ; but they seem to be less common in the aperient waters which are occasionally met with in the chalk and tertiary districts of this country ; for I have examined three-those , namely , of Epsom , of Chad 's Well in Gray's-Inn Lane , and of St. Leonard 's Hill near Windsor , without discovering traces of iodine in any one .
In the Epsom water alone a slight trace of bromine was perceptible .
With regard to the state of combination in which these principles occur , I have only to observe , that they are no doubt combined with hydrogen , forming the hydriodic and hydrobromic acids , and neutralized in all probability by magnesia , both forming with this basis salts decomposable at a low temperature , which seems to be the case with the compounds of both bromine and iodine existing in the waters I have examined .
Even long continued boiling , there is reason to believe , diminishes the quantity of bromine originally present ; and hence it seems advisable , when the object is to estimate the whole of this principle which a mineral water may contain , to combine the hydrobromic acid with lime , in the manner which I have recommended to be done when speaking of the mode of separating bromine from its combination .
I may conclude by observing , that there is little question as to the possibility of procuring a sufficient supply of bromine from our English brine-springs , should a demand be created for this new substance , either for medical purposes or for the arts of life ; for , from a few rough trials of its comparative abundance in the Middlewich and Ashby springs , and in those of Kreutznach in the Palatinate , which affords , it is said , the principal supply for present consumption , I should regard our own quite as highly charged : neither can it be doubted but that the proportion of bromine present in many brine-springs exceeds considerably that contained in the present ocean , which , from experiments recently made by myself on water taken from the English Channel a short distance from Cowes , I have stated in the Table as existing in the proportion of one grain to the gallon .
