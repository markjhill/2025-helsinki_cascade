The following paper is a preliminary account of what is apparently a new method of measuring osmotic pressures .
The account is published now because during the course of the experiments we have unfortunately damaged the only two good semi-permeable membranes that we possess , and it will be some months before the damage can be repaired .
2 .
A word of explanation as to the use of " dynamic " to distinguish the osmotic phenomena we are about to describe seems necessary .
In all discussions of osmotic pressures ( except those involving diffusion ) the locution " osmotic pressure " connotes some form of equilibrium between a solution and its solvent ; in the experiments about to be recorded we have measured the rate at which the solvent flows into the solution , and the essence of the observations lies in the fact that there should be no approach to equilibrium .
Thus the osmotic pressure here involved is substantially that assumed to act in Hernst 's theory of diffusion .
3 .
The experiments described below will be seen to prove that the rate of flow is proportional to , and may be used to measure , the equilibrium osmotic pressures , at all events in dilute solutions .
Moreover , the rate at which water passes through a semi-permeable membrane under a given hydrostatic pressure will be shown to be the same as the rate at which it would pass that membrane , when entering a dilute solution whose osmotic pressure has the same numerical value as the hydrostatic pressure formerly used .
Thus in these experiments the osmotic pressures are directly correlated with hydrostatic pressure .
4 .
Briefly , the method is as follows : A porcelain tube , carrying a copper ferrocyanide membrane on the outside , is set up in the osmotic pressure apparatus , * with water on both sides of the membrane .
The interior of the tube is in communication with a graduated capillary , while the outside water can be subjected to pressure ; the first part of the experiment consists in noting the rate at which known hydrostatic pressures force water through the membrane .
In the second part of the experiment the tube , with its capillary attached , is surrounded with the solution whose " dynamic osmotic pressure " is required , and a measurement is made of the initial rate at which the water is sucked through the membrane into the solution .

It is of the utmost importance that the initial rates be measured ; for very early in the research it was found that the rate at which the water is sucked into a solution varies enormously with the time the tube remains in that solution ; in some cases the velocity of the water is reduced to less than half the initial rate , and in all cases the rates slow down to a minimum , as found by Vegard , * the minimum depending on the previous history of the tube .
A great many experiments were made to elucidate the cause of this phenomenon , but they will not be detailed here as they do not seem to bear immediately on the main object of the research .
6 .
The Experiments.\#151 ; The first method tried was devised so as to find whether the rates of passage of the water into various strengths of cane-sugar solutions was proportional to the osmotic pressure .
A tube was set up in the osmotic pressure apparatus exactly as for a determination of the equilibrium osmotic pressure ; f when equilibrium had been established between the water in the tube and the solution outside ( by means of the mechanical pressure put upon the solution ) , the pressure was suddenly and completely released and the initial rate at which the water flowed into the solution was noted .
The following are examples of the observations .
The first column gives the concentration of the solutions in grammes per litre , and the second and third columns give the observed rates , in millimetres , of the capillary per second , lfor the two tubes N and X. The last column gives the known osmotic pressures:\#151 ; Concentration .

7 .
Thinking that this want of proportionality was due to the solution not being stirred , the experiments were repeated in the following manner:\#151 ; Tube X , fitted with ring stirrers which could be moved up and down , was fixed in a vertical position , and the various solutions were brought up from underneath to submerge the membrane .
The observed rates were practically the * ' Proc. Camb .

same as in the previous case .
It was noticed , however , that an increased speed of movement of the ring stirrers seemed to influence the rate slightly , so a more efficient stirring arrangement was devised .
8 .
In the new apparatus the tube is fixed vertically between two horizontal brass plates by means of dermatine rings and screw couplings , in such a manner that the area of exposed membrane is the same as in the osmotic pressure apparatus proper .
Three four-bladed brass paddles are placed symmetrically round the tube with their axes vertical , and the edges of the blades , which are also vertical , pass within 1 mm. of the membrane when the paddles are rotated .
The edges of the blades extend along the whole length of the membrane .
In the experiments , the number of revolutions of the paddles was between six and three per second , and it was now found that the difference between practically no stirring and these rapid speeds was , in the case of the strongest solution , about 10 per cent , in the water rate .
9 .
Before giving the results of the experiments with the new apparatus , we will record the measurements of the flow of water through the membrane under different hydrostatic pressures .
These were obtained with tube X in the osmotic pressure apparatus , using a Schaeffer and Budenberg standard dead weight pressure gauge to give the pressures .
In the table , the first column gives the pressure on the water , and the corresponding rate of flow is noted in the second column .

It is evident from these figures that the rates ^ may be taken as proportional to the pressure , a conclusion which has some interest of its own ; but we will reserve the discussion of this for another opportunity , when a more detailed account of the whole work can be given .

On setting up tube X in the new stirring apparatus and proceeding in the manner already outlined , we obtained the results tabulated below .
The first column gives the concentration ( grammes per litre ) , the second the observed rate , the third gives this rate divided by 0'00528 ( the average rate per atmosphere hydrostatic pressure found in the last experiment ) .

We are not ready as yet to offer a satisfactory explanation of this discrepancy .
11 .
A similar set of experiments was made with tube N , but unfortunately the membrane was damaged before the rate of flow under hydrostatic pressure could be determined .

] a measurement of the hydrostatic pressure rate , when the tube was known to be slightly damaged , gave a value of 0-00540 mm./ sec. per atmosphere pressure , a value which is not greatly different from that used in the table .
Here , again , the agreement between the last two columns is good for the lower values , and attention may be drawn to the fact that the rates for the two tubes are very similar .
12 .
All the experiments here recorded were carried out at 0 ' C. , or as near as possible to that temperature , but it may be mentioned that some somewhat imperfect experiments show that the temperature coefficient is quite large\#151 ; in fact , a difference of 1 ' ( near 0 ' C. ) may cause a difference in the rates of 10 per cent. 13 .
There are two further points that seem worth mentioning .
One is that we have reason for believing that fairly accurate experiments can be made on more dilute solutions than 2-02 grammes per litre .
This may be of importance as giving an easier way of measuring very small osmotic pressures than that employed in the direct equilibrium method .
The other point is that the determination of the rate of flow under a hydrostatic pressure is a more delicate test of the semi-permeability of the membrane than is the actual measurement of the amount of sugar which comes through during a direct equilibrium pressure experiment.* 14 .
In conclusion , it may be emphasised that these preliminary results show that osmotic phenomena can be measured kinetically ( we do not mean that the kinetic theory of osmotics is thereby inferred ) , and that the results are , for dilute solutions , the same as when measured statically .
The method puts directly in evidence the driving forces or partial pressures which have to be considered in the dynamical theory of diffusion of solutions .
