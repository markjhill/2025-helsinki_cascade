241 ) " On the Effect of the Spectrum on the Haloid Salts of Silver .
' " By Captain W. de W. Abney , C.B. , R.E. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , and G. S. Edwards , C.E. Received November 26 , \#151 ; Read December 12 , 1889 .
In 1881 one of us gave , in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' a paper with the same title as the above .
Since then , however , he has been able to work out a more exact means of measuring the effect of the spectrum on these salts of silver , and it is our desire now to lay the improved results before the Society .
In January , 1887 , one of us read a paper before the Photographic Society of Great Britain , " On the mode of measuring Densities of Photographic Deposits , with some remarks on Sensitometers , " and in it alluded to the possibility of measuring the relative sensitiveness of a photographic plate to the different parts of the spectrum .
The plan there indicated , with some instrumental improvements , has been employed in the present instance .
The method employed consists in throwing an image of the photographed spectrum on a white screen and measuring the density of the photograph at different points .
As the spectrum of sun light abounds in dark Fraunhofer lines , it was evident that the sun would be a very inconvenient source of light by which to form the spectrum .
It was also inconvenient on account of the variation in intensity at different times of the year and day in its different parts .
After trials of various sources of light we came to the conclusion that the most practical source to employ was the light from gas , burnt in an Argand burner .
A somewhat whiter light would have been better , perhaps , since the ultra-violet rays would have been stronger ; but it appeared that , taking all things into consideration , the convenience of gas light more than counterbalanced its disadvantages .
We may mention that the crater of the positive pole of the electric light was used in some instances ; but , as certain minima of action on some of the salts of silver experimented with lay at parts of the spectrum where bright carbon bands were to be found , the main researches were carried out by the aid of gas light .
The apparatus employed for photographing the spectrum was that employed in the previous research already alluded to .
The two prisms employed were of medium dense white flint , each having an angle of 62 " .
The collimating lens was of the same material , and the photographic lens was a rapid rectilinear doublet by Dalmeyer , of 16-inch focal length .
In some cases one of the lenses of the doublet was dismounted , and the other used as a single lens , giving a focal length of about 30 inches .
An image of the gas flame was thrown 250 Capt. W. de W. Abney and Mr. G. S. Edwards .
on the slit of the collimator , producing a bright image when the slit had a width of of an inch- The bottom half of the slifc was closed by a shutter when the gas spectrum was photographed .
To know the locality of the part of the gas spectrum impressed , a second spectrum of the electric arc was photographed below the gas spectrum , lithium and sodium being volatilised , to give a sufficient number of fiducial lines .
The plate was then withdrawn from the slide and placed in an apparatus by which a series of small square portions of the plate lying parallel and below the last-named spectrum could be exposed at will .
The exposures of this series of squares varied between 3\#163 ; seconds and 5 minutes , generally being 3^ , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , and 300 seconds .
The exposure was made to the light from an Argand paraffin lamp placed at 6 feet from the plate .
When the height of the flame was kept constant , no practical difference in illumination was found , and no variation was found during a series of exposures if the lamp were allowed to attain a constant temperature by burning ten minutes .
The plate thus impressed with the various images was developed in the ordinary manner with the pioper developer .
If a gelatine plate were used , ferrous oxalate was usually employed ; whilst acidified sulphate of iron was employed if a collodion wet plate were being experimented with .
It has not been thought worth while to record all the measurements of the various plates , but a selection has been made of the most important results .
It may be remarked that only 5 per cent , addition of bromo-iodide of silver to a bromide of silver emulsion sufficed to shift the place of maximum sensitiveness of the plate from the blue towards the green , as shown in the diagram .
After development the plates were fixed as usua and dried , and were then ready for measuring .
The following diagram shows the apparatus employed for the measurement , the descrip ion of which is taken from a previous paper by one of us .
A is the source of light\#151 ; gas , paraffin , or other lamp ; B is a lens of about 9 inches focus , used as a condenser ; C is a double frame tor carrying the negative , 1ST , which has an upward and side motion , so that any part of the negative may be brought in front of the condenser ; D is a lens on a stand , used to focus the negative on t e screen E , which is black except one small square , as shown , where the image of the part to be measured is thrown ; E is one of a series of diaphragms used with D for the purpose of sharpening the image and reducing its brightness when required ; .
H is the rod used to cast the shadow on the white patch ; G is a flat mirror reflecting a beam also on E ; K is the rotating apparatus placed in the path of the light reflected from G , to diminish it at pleasure ; M is the small electromotor which drives K. The rod H is so placed that the shadows Efect of the Spectrum on the Haloid Salts of Silver .
251 cast by the beam from G , and coming through the negative , just touch , and the two are equalised in brightness by means of opening more or less the rotating sectors K. The negative to be measured was marked with a scale of inches , and , in cases of sudden change of density , to less .
It was then placed in the measuring apparatus and measurements commenced .
When the square patches were measured , a thickish rod was employed , but for the photographed spectrum a knitting needle , ^ of an inch thick , was substituted .
The opacities of the different parts of the film were calculated from where the negative showed " no deposit , " and the opening of the sectors when the direct and reflected light balanced was taken as the standard .
The required opening of the sectors showed but little variation for any of the photographs .
The scale of density corresponding to different times of exposure was plotted from the readings of squares , and the readings of the different parts of the photographed spectra were applied to the curve so derived , and the density corresponding to the times of exposure tabulated .
From the photographed spectrum of the arc the positions of the different measured densities were known and the curve with the reference Fraunhofer lines plotted in the usual manner .
From these curves the curves for the normal or wave-length spectrum were calculated , and it is these curves which are shown in the accompanying figures .
Reverting to the paper to which we have referred ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' No. 217 , 1881 ) , it will be seen that the figures therein shown differ from those here given .
This is caused by the fact that the former curves were only eyp estimations of density , whilst the latter are the comparative sensitivenesses derived from measured densities .
252 Capt. W. de W. Abney and Mr. G. S. Edwards .
That the former are not in great error will be seen by comparing the place of maximum density of the former with the place of maximum sensitiveness of the latter .
It may be well to remark here on one point to which objection might be taken in the results .
It has been assumed in making the scale that length of exposure is equivalent to the intensity of the light .
This is not a hasty assumption , but has been carefully tested .
When the exposure is but the minute fraction of a second , then the substitution of length of exposure for intensity does not apparently hold good ; but , when the exposures are such as are given to the scale , the substitution is perfectly legitimate .
In the following tables the curves of the simple haloid salts of silver are given , as well as mixtures of two or more , and also double salts .
Where double salts of silver are shown they were prepared by mixing the alkaline salts in proper equivalent proportions , and then emulsifying in gelatine or collodion by adding the requisite amount of silver nitrate to them .
Where simple mixtures are shown , emulsions containing the proper equivalent amount of the silver salts were prepared and subsequently mixed .
It has been deemed desirable to give the values for the haloid salts when stained with certain dyes , such as are usually employed in rendering photographic plates what is termed isochromatic .
Attention is called to the fact that a mixture of solutions of two dyes does not render the salts of the same sensitiveness to different parts of the spectrum as do the two dyes if applied separately , washing taking place between the application of each .
For erythrosin Mailman 's well known formula was used to obtain the coloured solution .
The erythrosin was obtained from Germany , and showed only traces of fluorescence .
The cyanin was obtained from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams , and appears to be made after Greville Williams ' formula .
When cyanin was employed , 5 grains was dissolved in 1 oz. of alcohol , and water added to make up to 2 ozs .
This solution was poured over the plate , which was then allowed to dry .
The plate was then washed with equal parts of spirit and water , and finally with water , and then exposed to the spectrum .
Similar results were obtained whether the film was dry or moist .
