Notice respecting a Volcanic iAppearance in the Moon .
In a Letter addressed to the President .
By Captain Henry Kater , F.R.S. Read February 8 , 1821 .
[ Phil. T7rans .

] This volcano was first observed by Captain Kater on Sunday the 4th of February , the moon being then two days old , with a Newtonian telescope of 6 ' inches aperture , and a power of 74 .
The position of the volcano is shown in an annexed drawing ; its appearance was that of a small nebula , subtending an angle of 3 or 4 seconds , and its brightness very variable .
It was again observed on the evenings of the 5th and 6th , but was then more faint , though occasionally exhibiting the appearance of a luminous point , like a star of the 6th or 7th magnitude .
Captain Kater thinks that the distance of the volcano from the edge of the moon was about one tenth of her diameter ; and the angle which it formed with a line joining the cusps on the last-mentioned evening , was about 50 ? .
On the 7th it was scarcely visible , in consequence , probably , of the increased light of the moon .
