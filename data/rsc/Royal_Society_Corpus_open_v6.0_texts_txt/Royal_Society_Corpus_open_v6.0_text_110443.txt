A paper was also read , entitled , " On certain Peculiarities in the double Refraction , and Absorption of Light , exhibited in the Oxalate of Chromium and Potash .
" BySirDavid Brewster , K.H. , L.L.D. , F.R.S. The crystals of the oxalate of chromium and potash are , generally speaking , opakefor at thicknesses not much greater than the 25th of an inch , they are absolutely impervious to the sun 's rays , and their colour , seen by reflected light , is nearly black ; but when powdered , they are green ; and the colour of the smaller crystals , viewed either by reflected or by transmitted daylight , is blue .
One of the most remarkable of the properties of this salt is the difference of colour in the two images formed by double refraction .
At a certain small thick ?
ness , the least refracted image is bright blue , and the most refracted image bright green .
The blue is found by analysis with the prism to contain an admixture of green , and the green an admixture of red ; and by candlelight this red predominating over the green , gives the crystal a pink hue .
At greater thicknesses the blue becomes purer and fainter , and the green passes into red ; and at a certain thickness the least refracted blue image disappears altogether , and the most refracted image is alone seen .
At still greater thicknesses this image also disappears , and absolute opacity ensues .
When the crystal is exposed to polarized light , with its axis in the plane of polarization , the transmitted light is green ; but when the axis is perpendicular to that plane , the transmiited light is blue .
A solution of the salt ex ?
hibits the same general action upon light as the solid , with the exception of double refraction .
This salt has also the peculiar property of exciting a specific action upon a definite red ray , situated near the extremity of the red portion of the spectrum .
