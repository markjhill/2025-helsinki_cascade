Post-tetanic Tremor .
[ Supplementary Note .
) By David Fraser Harris , M.D. , B.Sc. ( London).* Since the publication of my paper on this subject , t my attention has been called to the fact that the phenomenon has been previously noticed by Dr. Sydney Binger .
J I regret that I was unacquainted with his paper until after mine had been published .
Dr. Binger states :\#151 ; " This powerful prolonged faradisation , for one or two minutes , of the sciatic nerve of a cut-off leg of an undrugged frog , causes the limb to remain extended , and if it be held vertically , foot upwards , it falls more slowly than happens after only a momentary stimulation " ; and again : " These fibrillary twitellings and this spastic condition can be produced in normal imprisoned muscle .
" There can be no doubt that what Dr. Binger called " fibrillary twitchings " and I have termed " post-tetanic tremor " are identical phenomena .
In connection with the tremor which occurs in the muscles of the lobster during faradic stimulation , I ought also to have alluded to Professor C. Bichet 's discoveryS of an identical tremor ( " tetanos rythmique " ) in the pincer muscle of the crayfish , but I was unable to obtain a copy of his paper until after my own had gone to press .
