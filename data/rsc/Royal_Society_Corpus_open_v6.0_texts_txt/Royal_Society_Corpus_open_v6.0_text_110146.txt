] The discordancies observed by Mr. South between the sun 's right ascension , as deduced from observation , and those given in the Nautical Almanac , follow a law so simple as not to allow of their being regarded as errors of observation , or arising from any casual cause , but justify us in attributing them to imperfections in the solar tables , with the exception of three days , in which there seems to be some ground to suspect error of computation .
A single inspection of these discrepancies , Mr. Airy observes , suffices to show that they arise almost entirely from an error in the epoch , and an error in the place of the perigee .
From the peculiar form of the tables in Vince 's Astronomy , which give great facility to the introduction of an error in the excentricity , he was induced at first to suspect that one might exist ; but on calculation found the error in the equation of the centre so small as to be entirely insensible .
He then proceeds to detail the process by which , from Mr. South 's observations , he has deduced the amount of the several errors , which consist in regarding the epoch , the mean anomaly , and the equation of the centre , as erroneous by three very small unknown quantities , and forming as many equations of condition for determining them as there are observations .
These combined and resolved , so as to give the most probable result , lead to the conclusions , first , that the correction of the equation of the centre is evanescent ; secondly , that the epochs of the sun must all be increased by 9 " , and the epochs of the perigee each by 1 ' 48 " .
