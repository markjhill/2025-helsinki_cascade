On the Effects of Alkalies and Acids , and of Alkaline and Acid Scdts , upon Growth and Cell Division in the Fertilized Eggs of Echinus esculentus.\#151 ; A Study Relationship to the Causation of Malignant Disease .

) The results of observations previously made in the Bio-chemical Laboratory of the University of Liverpool have shown that free hydrochloric acid is absent from the gastric contents , or greatly reduced , in nearly all cases of malignant disease , no matter where the malignant growth happens to be situated .
In the paper describing these observations it was pointed out that the most probable cause of this absence of the free hydrochloric acid was an increased alkalinity of the blood-plasma , as a result of which the hydrogen ion concentration in the plasma was so far reduced that the oxyntic cells were no longer able to separate an acid secretion from it.* It seemed to us , therefore , desirable to test the effects of alterations in the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions respectively , upon the growth and cell division in some organism in which cell division was proceeding rapidly , and which could be easily subjected directly to changes in acidity or alkalinity of the medium in which it was living .
We selected for this purpose the fertilized eggs of a species of sea-urchin { Echinus esculentus ) , because at the season of the year at which our experiments were carried out ( April , 1905 ) the ripe eggs can readily be obtained from the gonads of the female , and be fertilized by mixing with the sperm similarly obtained from a ripe male .

onward the rate of growth and any irregularities in cell division can be observed , and the effects of the addition of alkali or acid , or alkaline or acid salt , can be compared under exactly similar conditions , and contrasted with a control grown alongside in unaltered sea-water .
The experiments were made , by kind permission of Professor W. A. Herdman , F.K.S. , at the Marine Biological Station , Port Erin , Isle of Man , during the month of April , 1905 .
J. Loeb , * in 1898 , reported experiments on the influence of acids and alkalies on the development of the larvae of sea-urchins , showing that the addition of acids to the sea-water delayed the development , and finally , at a certain concentration of hydrogen ions , inhibited the development completely .
With the addition of alkalies the development during the first 12 hours was not at all hastened , or hastened to a hardly appreciable extent .
On the second day , however , and sometimes alsio even on the third day , the eggs that developed in sea-water which had been made alkaline were occasionally , but not always , in advance of eggs of the same brood which had been raised in normal sea-water .
At the time of the publication of this paper , Loeb held the current view that sea-water had an alkaline reaction , and accordingly drew the conclusion that , for developmental processes , it is necessary to have an alkaline reaction or , in other words , a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions than exists in distilled water .
At a later date Loeb , f however , came to the conclusion that normal seawater must be regarded as a practically neutral solution , and hence ascribed the favouring action of alkalies upon cell-division and growth to the neutralizing action of the alkali added upon acid products formed by the cells in the process of growth which would otherwise cause an accumulation of hydrogen ions and arrest the development .
This opinion is based by Loeb upon the results of the observations of Friedenthal , t Fraenkel , S and Farkas , || which indicate that blood-plasma possesses no higher concentration in hydroxyl ions than distilled water ; upon observations made by Dr. Cottrell at Loeb 's suggestion upon the sea-water of the Bay of San Francisco by means of hydrogen electrodes , which showed * * * S * ' Arch. f.

[ Oct. 9 , that the concentration of hydrogen ions was greater by one power of ten than in distilled water ; and upon the observations of Loeb himself , ( 1 ) that normal sea-water is practically neutral to phenol-phthalein , and ( 2 ) that addition of sodium bicarbonate or of di-sodic phosphate , which from their neutral reaction to phenol-phthalein are regarded by Loeb as neutral salts , produced the same favouring effect upon cell-division and reproduction as the caustic alkalies .
A solution of the mixed phosphates or carbonates in which there is an approximate balance between the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions such that these concentrations are nearly equal , cannot , however , be regarded as neutral in the same sense as distilled water is neutral ; or as being acid or alkaline in the same sense as a solution containing only free acid or free alkali can be regarded as being acid or alkaline .
Nor will such a solution of phosphates and carbonates as is present in blood-plasma or sea-water have a similar action upon living cells to either distilled water or a neutral solution of such salts as sodium chloride of equal osmotic concentration .
Such solutions form a peculiar type of their own , which possess the property of behaving either as an acid or as a base .
Such solutions can behave in this manner to any substances possessing weak acid or basic properties brought into the same solution , and it is for this reason that such solutions behave entirely differently to distilled water in their associating or dissociating action upon coloured indicators , and so indicate at the same time an acid reaction to one indicator and an alkaline to another .
A quantity of acid or of alkali can be added to the solution , which would cause an enormous variation in the relative concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions if added to distilled water , without altering to anything like the same extent the relative concentrations of these two ions .
Therefore blood-plasma , and to a less extent sea-water , possess , on account of the mixed phosphates and carbonates which they contain , a steadying action Upon variations in the concentrations of the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions .
When acid or alkali is added to the plasma , instead of there occurring a corresponding swing in the concentration of the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions , there takes place an alteration in the equilibrium of the ions of the phosphates and carbonates , which neutralizes , in great part , the hydrogen or hydroxyl ions added , and prevents the plasma becoming markedly acid or alkaline .
Without such a controlling action the life of the cells would be rendered impossible , for , as our experiments show , the living cell is most sensitive to even small variations in either hydrogen or hydroxyl ion .
This powerful action of alterations in concentration of hydrogen or hydroxy ] 1905 .
] Effects of Alkalies , etc. , on Eggs of Echinus .
ion , arises from the fact that the constituents of the protoplasm behave like very weak acids or bases , and are affected by variations in hydrogen or hydroxyl ions in a similar manner to coloured indicators .
Very small variations in ionic concentrations compared to those found in even dilute solutions of free acid or alkali , will hence cause the constituents of the cell to become almost completely associated or dissociated , and prevent the chemical reactions from occurring which are necessary for the metabolism and life of the cell .
This is shown in our experiments by the very small amounts of either acid or alkali which suffice to kill the cell .
Within the limits at which life is still possible , but at which the concentrations of the two ions are varied from the normal , profound alterations occur both in the rate of growth , and in the type of the cell divisions .
In the case of malignant growths similar variations in hydrogen and hydroxyl ions occur as shown by the absence of the acid in the gastric juice .
It is from this point of view that we have studied the effects upon growth and cell-division of the addition of acids or alkalies in small amounts to the medium in which such processes are taking place .
The problem before us is that of the effects upon the cell of variations in the hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentration , and for the purposes of such an enquiry it is not neccessary to know what are the actual concentrations of the two ions in normal plasma , nor to discuss which of these two magnitudes is the greater .
If alkali be added to plasma or to sea-water the concentration in hydrogen ions will fall and that in hydroxyl ions will rise , and conversely on adding acid a reverse change will take place .
The experiments we have made show the results of such changes upon cell growth and nuclear division .
A number of other observers have drawn attention to irregularities in cell growth and nuclear division induced by the action of foreign chemical substances upon the dividing cells .
Thus , O. and B. Hertwig * and also Galleottif have shown that pathological mitoses with irregular division in number and amount of the chromosomes may be induced by such substances as quinine , chloral , nicotine , anti-pyrine , cocaine , and potassium iodide .
The derangements in division so produced closely resemble the pathological divisions described in cancer cells by Klebs , | Hansemann , S and Galleotti.|| * ' Jenaische Zeitsch .

[ Oct. 9 , Hansemann recognizes in such abnormal mitoses two general groups , ( 1 ) asymmetrical mitoses , in which the chromosomes are unequally ditributed to the daughter cells , and ( 2 ) multipolar mitoses , in which the number of centrosomes is more than two , and more than one spindle is formed .
Hansemann and Galleotti find in this asymmetry of mitoses an explanation of the well-known fact that in cancer cells many of the nuclei are especially rich in chromatin ( hyperchromatic cells ) while others are abnormally poor ( hypochromatic cells ) .
According to Galleotti , the asymmetrical mitoses which may be artificially produced in the epithelial cells of salamanders by treatment with dilute solutions of anti-pyrine , cocaine or quinine are exactly like those seen in carcinoma .
In these experiments , the drugs used for inducing pathological mitoses are not such as can occur in carcinoma .
A variation of the concentration in hydrogen and hydroxyl ions can , however , occur in the plasma , and , in fact , the observations on the absence of acid in the gastric secretion in cases of carcinoma make it probable that such variations do occur .
It is hence of interest that in our experiments detailed below , in which the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions was artificially varied , we have found that with increased alkalinity , at a point just short of that at which cell growth was stopped , such pathological mitoses do occur .
We have observed both the asymmetrical mitoses with unequal distribution of chromosomes and only two centrosomes , and the multipolar mitoses with three or more centrosomes .
Also , as the alkali was increased above the normal of sea-water , a marked tendency to irregularity in size and shape of the resulting cells was observed similar to that seen in cancer cells .
As the amount of alkali was increased , there occurred also a shortening of the dividing chromatin rods , similar to that seen in most maturation divisions , until the rods became in some cases converted into rounded dots .
In a certain percentage of the divisions , the number of chromosomes was reduced .
The number of chromosomes is exceedingly difficult to count with certainty , but the reduction in many cases amounted approximately to one-half the normal .
Experimental Methods .
We have investigated in our experiments the effects of the following alkalies and acids , and alkaline and acid salts:\#151 ; Sodium hydrate , potassium hydrate , calcium hydrate , ammonia , hydrochloric acid , acetic acid , carbonic acid , sodium carbonate , sodium bicarbonate mono-sodium phosphate ( NaH2P04 ) , and di-sodium phosphate ( Na2HP04 ) .
The stock solutions of the acids and caustic alkalies were made in distilled water , titrated and standardized to normal strength , and from these deci- 1905 .
] Effects of Alkalies , etc. , on Eggs of Echinus .
normal solutions in distilled water were prepared .
The carbonates and mono-sodic phosphate were made up in decimolecular strength , and the di-sodic phosphate in molecular strength , on account of its lower solubility .
A saturated solution of calcium hydrate was prepared in distilled water decanted from the lime , and standardized against decinormal acid , and this standardized solution was used in small measured amounts for addition to the sea-water containing the samples of eggs as in the other cases .
Similarly , in the case of the carbonic acid , a comparatively strong solution of carbonic acid was prepared by passing the gas through sea-water ; this solution was standardized at once with decinormal alkali , using phenol-phthalein as indicator , and immediately added in appropriate small measured quantities to the various measured sea-water and egg-mixtures .
It may be pointed out that there was no appreciable variations in osmotic pressure of the sea-water caused by the addition of the reagent solutions , because the volume added was small in comparison with the volume of seawater and egg-mixture to which it was added ; further the decinormal solutions added , though hypotonic , do not lie very far below the molecular concentration of the sea-water .
If the decinormal solutions had been made in sea-water instead of distilled water , an equal or greater amount of change in osmotic pressure would have resulted on account of their being hypertonic , and also precipitation of constituents of the sea-water would in certain cases have occurred .
The change in osmotic pressure was , however , in all cases quite a negligible quantity .
The experiments involved the use of a large number of vessels on account of the long series of mixtures of sea-water and fertilised eggs with their varying amounts of added chemicals of different kinds , and we had no4'-anticipated this heavy demand when starting upon our expedition .
Hence , we had to make use of such materials as we could find in the Marine Biological Station , or obtain at Port Erin .
The earlier experiments were made in well washed out glass jam-pots such as are used for collecting fresh marine specimens , but later we found ordinary plain tumblers of the usual size most convenient .
The amount of surface for aeration compared to the volume of fluid was the same in each case throughout each series of experiments , and hence the results obtained are strictly comparable with one another .
The method of procedure in starting an experiment was as follows :\#151 ; The shells of a number of Echini were cut open circularly so as to expose the uninjured gonads , until a ripe male and a ripe female had been obtained as shown by examining under the microscope , and ascertaining that the spermatozoa were active , and the eggs of mature size and well formed .
Prof. Moore , Dr. Roaf , and Mr. Whitley .
[ Oct. 9 , Usually two gonads from the female , and about half to one gonad from the male were taken , each in a separate tumbler , gently rubbed up with a small quantity of sea-water , and then separated from debris by filtering through a coarse piece of muslin .
The eggs were somewhat diluted with sea-water , a quantity of sperm added , and a drop of the mixture taken out and examined with the microscope until it was ascertained that the eggs had developed their fertilization membranes .
A number of tumblers corresponding to the number of controls and the total of the various dilutions of the different chemicals to be tested for their effects upon the growth of the eggs had previously been arranged and numbered .
The mixture of fertilized eggs was now diluted to a larger volume with sea-water so as to afford 200 c.c. for each tumbler , and this volume was measured out into each of the tumblers .
As rapidly as possible the desired amount of each chemical was added in each case , and the time of starting noted .
The progress of development was observed and noted a few hours after starting the experiment , again the following morning , and so on .
In a few cases instead of diluting the egg-mixture after fertilization to a large volume , the proper amount of sea-water was measured out into each tumbler , then an equal volume of the egg-mixture was added to each , followed by the desired amount of the chemical solution .
For the purpose of examining the progress of development a dip was taken out by means of a small pipette into a watch-glass and examined under a low power of the microscope .
The state of development of the growing embryo was noted especially with regard to relative rate of growth in presence of the various strengths of the different alkaline and acid solutions .
The number of cells was counted in the earlier stages , or the number of cells in an optical section of the circumference of the blastulse in the later stages ; the commencement of ciliary motion was noted , and the stages in the development of the gastula in those cases where the larvae developed so far .
Also any irregularities in shape and size of cells in the different cases were noted .
In certain cases , the progress of any change in chemical reaction was noted by adding indicators in parallel experiments carried out alongside .
Interesting results as to the action of the indicators themselves were so obtained .
It was found that the reaction to " di-methyl " did not change throughout the experiment , but the reaction to phenol-phthalein , which was faintly alkaline even in normal sea-water at the commencement of the experiment , slowly changed towards the acid side .
As it was found , however , that phenol-phthalein even in very small amounts inhibited and caused irregularities in cell-division , the method was adopted of testing quantita1905 .
] Effects of Alkalies , etc. , on Eggs of Echinus .
tively by titration the reaction to both phenol-phthalein and " di-methyl " at the end of each experiment after growth had stopped .
It was found that even where alkali had been added at the commencement of the experiment the reaction to phenol-phthalein had become slightly acid at the end in most experiments .
Since the amount of alkalinity to " di-methyl " had not altered throughout the experiment , but gave in all cases very approximately the alkalinity of sea-water plus or minus the alkali or acid artificially added , it follows that the change in reaction to phenol-phthalein must be due to a very weak acid given off during the development of the embryos .
Since carbon-dioxide produces exactly the same effects , and respiration must occur in the process of development , it is almost certain that the change in reaction must be due to production of carbonic acid .
On account of this natural production of carbonic acid , the results of the first twenty-four hours ' growth are the most valuable , because here the alkaline reaction to phenol-phthalein persisted , and the production of carbonic acid was small .
After preliminary experiments had determined the range at which the developing embryos were definitely affected by the different chemicals , a few final experiments were made in which only two or three concentrations of each chemical were included lying at about the proper range , and the last such experiment was interrupted when the more advanced sets of embryos had reached the morula or early blastula stage.* The embryos were fixed in Flemming 's and Hermann 's fluids , embedded and cut in paraffin , and stained for nuclear division by Heidenhain 's iron-alum and hsematoxylin staining , following Flemming 's description .
The drawings illustrating the paper were made from this series of preparations , with the exception of fig. 18 , which was drawn from the fresh growing cells .
Reaction of Sea- Water of Port Erin Bay.\#151 ; One hundred cubic centimetres of sea-water was taken and titrated against decinormal caustic soda solution , ( a ) with di- methyl- amido- azo- benzol as indicator , and ( ) with phenol-phthalein as indicator .
With the " di-methyl " in a first trial 2*35 c.c. were required , in a second 2'37 , therefore the alkalinity was = 000236 normal .
With the phenol-phthalein 0-24 c.c. and 022 c.c. were required , alkalinity = 000023 normal .
* After cutting sections , it was found that many of the cells described in Table XI ( pp. 123 , 124 ) in the fresh condition as morulse really possessed in section a small central cavity , and so are termed blastulse in the descriptions of the drawings .
The organisms described as blastulse in the tables showed in the fresh condition an outer layer of cells .

119 Experiments with Acid and Alkaline Salts .
In preliminary experiments the range of concentration of each salt was determined at which the developing eggs were affected , as in the experiments with alkalies and acids recorded above , and afterwards a few concentrations were selected for comparison at about this range .
In order to make the results comparable as between the different salts , and to gain a comparison also with the action of alkalies and acids , a combined series with the same brood of eggs was made including alkali , acid , and the alkaline and acid salts/ two or three concentrations only being used of each substance .

Summary of Results on Rapidity of Growth .
The following conclusions may be drawn from the observations on the developing eggs in the living condition recorded in Tables I to XI , which are also illustrated by figs. 1 to 17 , drawn from sections of the eggs developed in the experiment described in Table XI .
The sections were drawn under a low magnification ( 61 diam. ) with the Zeiss Zeichen-ocular .
The eggs shown in the drawings had all developed , for the same period ( 8 hours ) in the different media specified , from the same brood of eggs , and the eggs were subsequently fixed and stained as described above .
1 .
The extreme limits of variation of hydrogen and hydroxyl ion within which growth is possible are very narrow .
Addition of 0-0015 M. of caustic alkali ( see figs. 3 and 7 ) on the one hand or of OOOl M. of acid ( see fig. 4 ) practically stopping all cell-division .
2 .
A slight increase in alkalinity favours growth and cell-division and at the same time tends to produce irregularity in size and shape of the resulting cells ( contrast fig. 1 with figs. 2 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 18 ) .
3 .
In the case of small additions of acids no such favouring action is observable , but from the beginning cell-division and growth are inhibited ( see Tables ) .
4 .
Increase in alkali above the optimum amount leads to increased and irregular nuclear division unaccompanied by complete cell-division .
As a result the cells become multi-nucleated .
The cells also become excessively irregular in size and shape ( see figs. 3 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ) .
5 .
On the other hand increased acidity leads in many cases to action upon the chromatin of the nuclei , so that in the sections the nuclei stain faintly and are comparatively few in number , and there is no proliferation of nuclei in the undivided cells , similar to that seen in the case of alkali { see figs. 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 ) .
6 .
The primary factors affecting the rate of growth appear to be the variations in concentration of hydroxyl and hydrogen ions .
Thus all the caustic alkalies are of approximately equal power and there is little or no action of the Kation ( see Tables and contrast figs. 2 and 3 with figs. 6 and 7 ) .
But in the case of the phosphates of the alkalies where the hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations are comparatively low , there appears in addition to be a specific factor .
See the marked action of 0,0025 M. NaH^PCh in practically stopping cell division , while ( H)050 M. of Xa2HP04 has a favouring action ( contrast figs. 13 and 14 with figs. 15 , 16 , 17 ) .

) Pathological Nuclear Divisions .
The irregularity of growth in sea-water to which alkalies or alkaline salts have been added is accompanied by characteristic irregularities in the mitotic divisions , which are illustrated in figs. 19 to 30.* Multiple Nuclei.\#151 ; The divisions in the cytoplasm occur less frequently than in the nuclei , so that the cells become multi-nucleated ( see figs. 2 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 15 , 19 , 20 ) .
This occurs both in undivided and divided eggs .
In many cases two or more such active dividing nuclei are found in the same cell ( fig. 19 ) .
Multipolar Mitosis.\#151 ; This occurs both in single-celled eggs and in the later stages ( see figs. 20 and 21 ) .
The chromosomes are unequally distributed to the different spindles .
Asymmetrical Mitosis.\#151 ; This frequently occurs in the various alkaline solutions , and gives rise to unequal nuclei .
The cause of the unequal number of chromosomes appears to be that some of the chromosomes are carried to * The figs. 19 to 30 were drawn with the Zeiss Zeiclien-ocular , the finer details being filled in as realistically as possible , under a Leitz yy oil immersion objective .

( See fig. 22 , and lower spindle in fig. 19 .
) Changes in Chromosomes and Reduction in Number.\#151 ; The short , rod-shaped chromosomes of the organism which we have been examining ( .
esculentus ) do not show typically in its normal maturation or maiotic divisions the appearances described by Farmer and Moore* and others in maiotic division , and by Farmer , Moore , and Walkert in cancer .
According to Bryce , j the main changes in Echinus esmlentus during maturation consist in a marked shortening and thickening of the chromosomes with reduction in number .
Each chromosome divides into two short curved rods with spherical enlarged ends , giving rise to an appearance similar to tetrads .
But at no time are there any rings or other irregular figures , as described in so many other organisms , and there is no true tetrad formation .
R. HertwigS has observed in the case of Echinus a formation of bodies described as resembling tetrads , as a result of addition of dilute poisons .
In our specimens of eggs grown in dilute alkali , we have observed appearances in many cases similar to those shown in the drawings illustrating Bryce 's paper .
As the amount of added alkali is increased , there occurs both a shortening and thickening of the chromatin rods and a reduction in their number .
In some cases the appearance of rods is lost entirely , and the chromatin becomes arranged in minute masses resembling tetrads .
These changes are illustrated in figs. 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , and 28 .
Thus in the three strengths of di-sodium phosphate solution a shortening of the chromosomes in fig. 25 is seen as compared with fig. 24 , and in the strongest solution , fig. 26 , the rods are reduced to dots and the number is decreased to approximately one-half .
In fig. 28 some of the chromosomes present a tetrad-like appearance .
These changes , while frequent in occurrence , are not seen in all the dividing cells in any strength of solution , but occur in increased number in the stronger solution .
A peculiar appearance is represented in fig. 27 , in which a decided protrusion of one pole of the spindle in two adjacent cells of a blastula was observed beyond the cell margin , as if a polar body were being formed .
Although it is difficult to count the chromosomes accurately , the reduction in number is obvious on contrasting the weaker and stronger solutions .
In a fair number of cells , especially in the di-sodium phosphate solutions , a peculiar arrangement of the chromatin is observed , which is illustrated in * ' Q. J. M. S. , ' vol. 48 , 1905 , p. 489 .

The entire chromatin of the cell is seen to be arranged in two groups of circles at a distance apart corresponding to the usual distance of the centrosomes of a spindle , and in some cases , as in fig. 29 , the remains of achromatic fibres are indistinctly seen between the two groups of circles .
The cytoplasm surrounding each group of circles is distinctly lighter and freer from granules than the rest of the cytoplasm .
In structure each circle consists of a thin ring of chromatin showing distinct thickenings , about four in number , arranged approximately about equidistant around the circumference .
The interior of the circle is clear , and both the outer and inner border are clearly marked .
In some cases this arrangement of the chromatin in circles is also seen where there is only one group of circles as in fig. 30 .
Discussion of Results and Summary .
Our attention was attracted to the study of the effects of small variations in reaction upon the growth of cells from the bio-chemical point of view , as a result of the observation that in malignant disease no hydrochloric acid is in general secreted by the gastric glands , no matter where the malignant growth is situated , which pointed to an increased alkalinity of the plasma .
In the course of our investigations upon the rate of growth of the cell , when microscopic examination was made of the cells in the fresh condition , we were struck by the marked irregularities in size and shape of the developing cells in the alkaline media illustrated in fig. 18 , which is drawn from cells in the fresh solution developing in sea-water , to which di-sodium phosphate has been added , and also by the marked tendencies to nuclear proliferation .
This led us secondarily to a cytological investigation of the cells when fixed and stained to show nuclear division , as a result of which we have found the irregular forms of mitosis described in the text .
These atypical divisions , which have been produced by variations in the medium similar to those which occur in the blood in cases of malignant disease , closely resemble the pathological divisions seen in the growths of malignant disease .
The results of our experiments and their relationship to the processes in malignant growths may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
In nearly all cases of malignant disease the secretion of hydrochloric acid by the gastric glands is stopped or greatly reduced , and this effect is not due to local conditions in the stomach , since it occurs wherever the growth is situated ; but is due to a change in the distribution of salts in the plasma whereby the alkalinity is increased or the concentration in hydrogen ions diminished .

Addition of small amounts of alkalies or alkaline salts , such as di-sodium phosphate , to the medium in which cells are growing and dividing , 1905 .

causes at first an increase in rate of growth and division , but as the amount is increased , there appears a marked tendency to irregularity in size and shape of the resulting cells .
Nuclear division becomes in advance of cytoplasmic division , so that the cells become multi-nucleated .
As the alkali is further increased , both cell division and nuclear division are stopped .
3 .
Accoinpaning the increased stimulus to nuclear division given by the dilute alkali , there are seen many of the atypical forms of mitosis described in malignant growths .
The variations from the normal illustrated in the drawings are : ( 1 ) multiple nuclei in the same cell in active division ; ( 2 ) multipolar mitosis , occurring both in the single cell stage , and later in the development of the organism ; ( 3 ) asymmetrical mitosis , leading to unequal distribution of chromosomes to the two daughter cells ; ( 4 ) reduction in length of the chromosomes as the strength of alkali is increased until the chromosomes appear as rounded dots , and accompanying the reduction in length there is also a reduction in number to about one-half the normal ; ( 5 ) in certain cases the chromatin becomes arranged in circles , each of which shows a number of thickenings .
The circles are arranged in groups in the cell , and appear to represent a stage in the anaphase , the groups being placed at about the usual distance apart of the centrosomes , and traces of the achromatic fibres being occasionally visible .
4 .
No such increased growth or stimulus to nuclear division is given by varying the normal reaction of the medium in the opposite direction , by the addition of equal small amounts of acid .
From the beginning the minutest amount of added acid has an inhibitory effect upon growth and nuclear division .
There is no nuclear proliferation as the amount of acid is increased , and at a very slight amount of increased acidity all attempt at cell-division ceases .
In the fixed and nuclear stained preparations cell-division figures are absent , and in the resting nuclei the staining power of the chromatin is decreased , so that the nuclei present a washed-out appearance contrasted with the normal nuclei or those of organisms grown in dilute alkaline solution .
5 .
The extreme limits at which life and cell-division are possible lie close together , indicating that the cell is very sensitive to even slight changes in the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentration .
Thus the addition of so little as 0-0015 M. of either alkali or acid to sea-water practically stops all growth .
On account of the presence of phosphates and carbonates in the sea-water the change in hydrogen and hydroxyl ions caused by such additions cannot be large .
[ Note added October 24.\#151 ; Since the paper was written we have had an opportunity through the kindness of Messrs. J. E. S. Moore and C. E Walker L 2 136 Effects of Alkalies , etc. , on Eggs of Echinus .
of the Liverpool Cancer Research , of examining the appearances represented in figs. 29 and 30 under a specially high magnification of about 3000 diameters .
The magnification was obtained with a 10-inch tube , 3 mm. Zeiss apochromatic objective , 27 compensating ocular , and with monochromatic green illumination .
Messrs. Moore and Walker have pointed out to us that these bodies , which appear as described in the text when seen with an ordinary -yL-inch oil immersion , are , when seen with the 3000 diameter magnification , really spheroidal bodies consisting of an inner mass or vesicle which scarcely stains at all , over which ramify filaments of deeply staining chromatin .
Further examination with this magnification also demonstrates that the chromosomes represented as dots in fig. 28 are , in reality , also vesicular chromosomes .
Even with the -j^-inch oil immersion we had been able to see a well-marked black line around the periphery of each dot , but had been unable to determine whether or not this was merely an optical effect .
The 3000 diameter magnification , however , clearly shows that the structure is the same as that of the larger masses in figs. 29 and 30 .
It is interesting that these minute chromosome masses occur upon the spindle in exactly similar fashion to the normal rod-shaped chromosomes , and that wherever they occur there is a diminution in the number of chromosomes .
In many cases an occurrence of both rod chromosomes and spheroidal chromosomes is observable upon the same spindle as if conversion had only partly taken effect .
Where conversion of the entire number of chromosomes into the spheroidal variety is seen upon the spindle , the number of such chromosomes is usually approximately half the normal number , as in fig. 28 .
But when they are found after separation has taken place , as in figs. 29 and 30 , the number is very variable , and as the number diminishes there is a corresponding increase in size in the individual chromatic vesicles .
We are informed by Messrs. Moore and Walker that bodies presenting a similar appearance are seen in malignant growths , and also under other pathological conditions , and in certain normal tissues .
The question of the relationship , if any , of the diminution in number when such spheroidal chromosomes are formed , to the reductions occurring in normal maiotic division , and in cancer cells , we prefer to leave at the present entirely open , since we have no evidence that the diminution in number is effected by the same means ; and we merely point out the diminution of the number of chromosomes -upon the * spindle as a result of increasing the alkalinity of the medium , as an interesting and suggestive fact .

In the cases here in question the opsonic index of the blood is continually varying .
The range of its fluctuation is from considerably under the normal to twice or more the normal height .
Striking examples of the variation of the opsonic index in connection with acute tubercular phthisis are furnished in the paper of our fellow-worker , R. H. Ur wick , already referred to.* The following are instances of similar variation occurring in the subjects of other forms of tubercular infection:\#151 ; * i British Medical Jcuraa !
