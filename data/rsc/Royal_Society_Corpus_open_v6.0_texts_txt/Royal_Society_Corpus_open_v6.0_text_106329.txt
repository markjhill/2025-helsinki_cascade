2d , The height of the thermometer , according to FAHRENHEIT'S scale .
thermometer belonged to Mr. RUSSELL , and hung in the open air in the balcony .
3d , including four columns , contains the register of the marine barometers which , as well as the thermometers , were made by NAIRNE and BLUNT : those R and D are quicksilver , of the kind usually made by them .
That marked S is comp of quicksilver , and of a lighter fluid , for the purpose of making the alteratior visible , which is a very great convenience at sea ; a quicksilver thermometer being it for the sake of correcting its height , the heat by which is set down in the marked Th. next to that marked S. 4th , The weather and winds in four lines ; 1st line from noon to 6 P.M. ; 2d , 6 P.M. to midnight ; 3d , from midnight to 6 A.M. ; 4th , from 6 A.M. to noon .

The dip was observed with a dipping-needle belonging to the hon .
Mr. CAVE made by SISSON .
The following remarks on the dipping-needle and observations are by Mr. CAVENI The ends of the axis of the dipping-needle are made conical , and turn in ~ of bell-metal , in the manner of Mr. LORIMER'S needle , described in Phil. Trans. ~ p. 79 .
The dip was constantly observed both with the face of the instrument to ~ and to the West , and the poles were changed twice during the voyage , in order whether the needle continued well balanced .

~ ich case it is correction is as follows .
By the observations on July 12th , when the poles were ~ ~ corrected marked end of the needle was too heavy , so as to make that end ~ of the Moon , too low at that place ; and therefore , if we suppose that the force ~ ~ of each strong in all parts of the earth , the error produced thereby in ~ ~ of land or 15/ 16ths of a degree as the consine of the dip to the radius .

Some swallows and other land birds , who seem very tired .
In the after~ noon , during the calm , when the ship 's head was to the Southwestward , there was , for a little time , a counter current visible ; it made like a wake on the ship 's larboard beam , as if she was going broadside foremost .
Light airs of wind throughout .
P.M. saw two three-mast vessels with latin sails ; they were supposed to be Barbary cruizers , but did not come near enough to let us know what they were .
Some swallows about the ship .
An increasing breeze from the Northward .
In the morning ~ there were many petrils in the ship 's wake : they continued throughout the day .
~ Fresh breezes , with some squalls .
At noon saw Porto Santo from the mast-head , W by S. per compass .
In Funchal road .
Major SEARS informed us , that Mr. SEARL , in consequence of our request , tried the therm. for 10~ in a cool cellar , and found it 68~ .
N. B. Captain ALCOCK informed me , he observed the therm. on May 14 , 1776 , at 6 A.M. at Funchal 68~ , and in the cellar 61~ : and Mr. SEARL wrote to Mr. CAVENDISH , that on the 16th of May the therm. which stood at 69~ , was carried down at 1 P.M. to a cellar , where it remained till 4 o'clock , and then was found to be at 62~ , so that Major SEARS'S account was probably erroneous .
First part , light airs .
Middle and latter , pleasant breezes and smooth weather ; several boats came off from Funchal .
These 24 hours pleasant breeze from Eastward .
