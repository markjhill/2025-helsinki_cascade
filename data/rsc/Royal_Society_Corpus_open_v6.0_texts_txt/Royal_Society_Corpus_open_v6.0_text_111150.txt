" Note on instantaneous Photographic Images .
" By H. F. Talbot , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. " Having recently met with a photographic process of great sensibility , I was desirous of trying whether it were possible to obtain a truly instantaneous representation of an object in motion .
The experiment was conducted in the following manner .
A printed paper was fixed upon a circular disc , which was then made to revolve on its axis as rapidly as possible .
When it had attained its greatest velocity , an electric battery , kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Faraday , was discharged in front of the disc , lighting it up with a momentary flash .
A camera containing a very sensitive plate of glass had been placed in a suitable position , and on opening this after the discharge , an image was found of a portion of the words printed on the paper .
They were pe fectly well-defined and wholly unaffected by the motion of the disc .
" " As I am not aware that this experiment has ever succeeded , or indeed been tried , previously , I have thought it incumlbent on me to lay an early account of it before the Royal Society .
