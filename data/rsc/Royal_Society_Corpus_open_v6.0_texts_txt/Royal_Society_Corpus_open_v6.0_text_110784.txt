" Experimental Researches on the Elliptic Polarization of Light .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
This paper contains an experimental investigation of the phenomena of elliptic polarization resulting from the reflexion of polarized light from metallic surfaces , and the theory on which they are explicable ; the analytical results being given in a tabular form , and applied to the cases of the experiments themselves .
