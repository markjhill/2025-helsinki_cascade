By W. H. L. RUSSELL , F.R.S. Received January 20 , 1870 , being made up of two Papers received December 30 , 1869 , and January 6 , 1870 .
The principles laid down in my former paper will enable us to integrate a proposed differential equation , when the solution can be expressed in the P form e ' , where P , Q , w are rational and entire functions of ( x ) .
Let ( ao + aiX + Z , x2 + , + ant 3 dn , ym ) + dx " ( O+o +a2 + ... + ?
, + xm ) d-y + d7t lie ( o , +/ 3 +3 + ... +~~m )a+ dn-'2y ( yo+ YI3+ '2x+. .
+y^ ' 'm ) d.l'-2 + +(Xo+X +x2x++. .
+Xm , x)y=O be the general linear differential equation of the nth order , where none of the indices of ( x ) in the coefficients of the succeeding terms are greater than those in the coefficients of the two first .
Then if the equation admit of a solution of the form -/ J( ) d , where oq(x ) , 02(x ) are rational and entire functions of x , and 0k(x ) and a+ ax ... +acxm have no factors in common , and if the degree of the coefficients of the two first terms is the same , y=E(x ) e-JPd where p is a reot of the equation pn"m--pn-I3mPn-2ym ... X 0 ; and if a , = O , -fdE lm-1 Um n2m X-1 y=E(x)rs 2 +am _1i and if am , = a , = 0 , y=E(x ) -rd 3m-2 Ym am-3m 3m am-43m +ml Mn m-3m ) m+ n ' 2n _fd m-2 Am 2a a2 am2 a_2 m-2 m-2 _m n--2 and so on , where the value of y is to be substituted in the proposed equation , which then becomes a linear equation to determine the rational and entire function E(x ) .
When , however , am=/ Pm= , or , in other words , when the degree of the coefficients of the succeeding terms of the proposed equation exceeds the degree of the coefficients of the two first , some modification is required ; thus if Y y(a + die ( a +P : ) d+ ( ac ++ P+ ( +"+ r+ 'Y Y+ ( +PX1F+ ItI + +ZX)d +(a " +13"'x+ y"'2 + B " ' " 3 + rx+ I"'x')y = 0 , y=E(S)e-vMf { " r6r ll " L +X'3 } where E(x ) is to be determined as before .
But now let Opx and , + ax + o , x ?
+ ... a^ , ,x " have factors in common .
We have the two equations , P ___ PQ die Q'-PQ+Pw ' , qsx l=~ ; dx dx hence , since 2_ is a fraction in the lowest terms , any common factors of qix f1x and ao0+ ax + ... + mxm must be factors of P or Q ; hence if x-a be one of the factors of ao+a , + ... + CXmm , we may ascertain if it is a factor of P and Q by putting in the proposed differential equation y=An(x-a)m+Am+ , ( x-a)m+l +Am+2(-a)m+2+ ... , and shall thus obtain an equation to determine the index ( nm ) ; and we must treat the other factors of ao+aL ++ x a+ ... a , ,xm in the same way , and thus ascertain those which are also factors of P and Q. I shall illustrate these remarks by applying them to the well-known differential equation d2u i(i ?
+l ) 2u u ( fu = O* dx2 X'2 We have 2d-u i(i + )u-qu=O .
dLe I , et u= Ax + Bx+ ' + Cx+-2+ ... Substituting p/ ( tt-l)-i(i+l)=0 , whence t=-i ; putting then u d"z .
dz 2 0 ; d2c dx P hence z=E(x ) eq ' , if the equation can be integrated in the form y= Qe , which gives us d2E dE Putting E(x)==a-a + ax + +. .
we have m(m-2i1)m+ 2q(m-i1 )am= 0 , s which determines the function E(x ) , a rational and entire function of the ith degree .
I conclude this paper with a proposition of much importance in the theory of linear differential equations , Let d2J_y dn-'y d'2y nx ~ +%n1 IX-_cx +d %_2xdx ; +..* ?
+ ?
oy=O be any linear differential equatidn .
Then in general this equation will not admit a solution of the form y=f(e ' ) .
For then , putting for ( x ) successively x+ 27ri , x-47ri ... , we should have J d'A ' ) ?
2n-2/ lp^ ( ) +d ` !
f(e ) d1n-1J( , X ) dnd ( x2 ) -"dx+ _n-lx dxr-l + z-2Xd-+ ... =0 , dlnf(E i ) dn-1f(px ) / /7( ?
-+2n a on-l ( x + 2i ) 1 , 1 + ' " =0 , pn( +4 47i)d ?
^ +qn-1( x+47r.i ) d +..=0 .
And these equations can be indefinitely continued .
It will be observed p u. that this solution does not comprise integrals of the form ev , where is a rational function .
