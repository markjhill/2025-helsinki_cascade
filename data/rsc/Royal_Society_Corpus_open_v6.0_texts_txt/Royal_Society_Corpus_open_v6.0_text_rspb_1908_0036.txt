) By an ultra-microscopical stage in the development of a micro-organism is meant a stage in which the parasites are so small as to he invisible to the highest powers of the microscope , and to be capable of passing through the pores of a porcelain filter .
For example , a drop of South African horse-sickness blood will give rise to the disease if injected under the skin of a healthy horse .
If a similar drop is examined under the highest available powers of the microscope , nothing in the shape of a micro-organism can be seen .
If this blood is filtered through a porcelain filter , the virus passes through , and the filtrate is found to be as infective as the original blood .
Horse-sickness is therefore looked upon as a disease caused by an ultra-microscopical micro-organism .
For some time it has been reported by various workers that an ultra-microscopical stage exists among the trypanosomes .
For example , Plimmer informs us that he found the filtered blood of nagana animals to be infective .
Salvin Moore and Breinl write that the blood of animals suffering from Trypanosoma gambienseinfection , although apparently containing no trypanosomes at all , and even if properly filtered , is still capable of infecting other animals into which it may be introduced .
MacNeal also makes a similar statement in regard to Trypanosoma lewisi .
He states that " in culture , on blood-agar , T. lewisi may give rise to much smaller forms , and that such cultures , after passage through a Berkefeld filter , still infect rats .
" Finally , it may be noted that the late Dr. Fritz Schaudinn , whose too early death we all lament , expressed the belief that trypanosomes may multiply by longitudinal division so rapidly as to become small enough to pass readily through a Chamberlain filter .
This subject is an important one , as the discovery of an ultra-microscopical stage in these trypanosomes might throw light on the causation of some diseases in which no parasite can be found .
In kala-azar , for example , the intra-corporeal form is small , and the extra-corporeal a fairly large flagellated organism .
Let us imagine that the Leishman body lying inside the splenic cells had still further subdivided and become ultra-microscopical , then we would have an invisible parasite causing a serious disease in man and Have Trypanosomes an Ultra-microscopical Stage ?
395 developing outside the body into a clearly visible flagellate .
It is evidently important , then , in studying such diseases as South African horse-sickness , to try the effect of planting out the blood on various media , and looking for a visible stage of development in different insect hosts .
The following experiments were made to test the truth of the statement that trypanosomes have this invisible stage .
The filters used were Berkefeld 's ordinary filters for laboratory use .
They were tested before use and found to readily keep back Micrococcus melitensisfrom the filtrate .
The apparatus was attached to a Sprengel 's pump :\#151 ; To ascertain if the Filtered Blood of Babbits suffering from Nagana is infective .
Experiment 23 .
March 20 , 1908.\#151 ; A rabbit which was inoculated on the 7th February , 1908 , with Trypanosoma brucei , was killed to-day in an advanced stage of nagana .
On microscopical examination of the peripheral blood and blood from the heart , no trypanosomes were seen .
Portions of the heart , lungs , liver , spleen , kidneys , and bone-marrow were pounded up in a mortar with 1 per cent , sodium citrate in normal saline .
The resulting emulsion was then filtered through a Berkefeld filter , and 1 c.c. of the filtrate injected subcutaneously into each of two white rats .
April 30 , 1908.\#151 ; Both rats healthy .
No trypanosomes have appeared in their blood .

Conclusion .
From these five experiments it would appear that the blood or organs of rabbits suffering from nagana does not contain ultra-microscopical forms of T. brucei .

Experiment 40 .
December 17 , 1907.\#151 ; A white rat , suffering from nagana , and whose blood was swarming with T. brucei , was killed to-day .
The organs and bone-marrow were made into an emulsion with 1 per cent , sodium citrate in salt ' solution and filtered in the usual way .
Half a cubic centimetre of the filtrate was then injected into the peritoneal cavity of a white rat .
March 16 , 1908.\#151 ; This rat has never shown trypanosomes in its blood .
Experiment 41 .
December 1-7 , 1907.\#151 ; This rat was also injected with the same quantity of filtrate as in Experiment 40 .

Experiments 42 and 43 .
December 24 , 1907.\#151 ; A nagana rat , whose blood was swarming with trypanosomes , was killed and the organs , etc. , emulsified and filtered .
One cubic centimetre of the filtrate was injected intra-peritoneally into two white rats .

Experiments 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , and 50 .
This procedure was repeated seven times in exactly the same way and always with a negative result .
Conclusion .
From these 11 experiments it would appear that the blood of nagana rats filtered through a Berkefeld filter is not infective .
To ascertain if the Filtered Blood of TFhite Bats suffering from Nagana or Surra , and treated for various Periods with Antimony , is infective .
It was thought that the effect of treatment on animals suffering from nagana might lead to the development of small resting forms of the Trypanosoma brucei which might be capable of passing through a Berkefeld filter .
The effect of certain drugs on animals suffering from nagana is marvellous .
The blood may be swarming with trypanosomes , yet within an hour of the injection not a single one can be seen .
They may remain out of the blood for weeks or months , in some out-of the-way place , and , perhaps , in some resistant form .

A white rat , whose blood was swarming with brucei , was treated with \#163 ; c.c. of a i-per-cent , solution of sodium antimonyl tartrate .

Organs emulsified and filtered and 4 c.c. of the filtrate injected into a white rat .
March 26 , 1908.\#151 ; This rat 's blood is found to be swarming with trypanosomes .
It is evident that something has passed through the filter capable of infecting a rat with nagana ; but it is possible that the filter has become defective on account of wear .
It was tried again with a cultivation of Micrococcus melitensis in broth and failed to keep back the micrococci from the filtrate .
It was , therefore , concluded that the filter was defective , and this experiment null and void .
Conclusion .
From these experiments it may be concluded that the blood of white rats suffering from nagana and treated for varying times with antimony salts does not contain ultra-microscopical forms of brucei .

Conclusion .
From these experiments it may be concluded that cultures of T. lewisi on blood-agar do not give rise to ultra-microscopical forms which are capable of passing through a Berkefeld filter .
The final conclusion arrived at is that neither T. brucei nor evansi develop in the body of animal forms so small as to be capable of passing through the pores of a Berkefeld filter , and that in cultures of T , .
lewisi on blood-agar such small forms are also absent .
