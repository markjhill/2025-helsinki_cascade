By ROBERT BOYD , M.]D .
, F.R.C.P.L. , Physician to the Somerset County Linatic Asylbm .
Coimmunicated by Dr. SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. Received February 7 , -Read February 28 , 1861 .
THESE Tables have been compiled from notes of 2086 examinations made at St. Marylebone Infirmary , between 1839 and 1847 ; and of 528 examinations in cases of insanity made at the Somerset Lunatic Asylum , between 1848 and the end of December 1860 , comprehending in all a period of twenty-one years .
The calculations alone have been the labour of many months ; a task , which , owing to the pressure of daily duties in a large establishment , I could not now have completed but for the able assistance of my relative Major BOYD .
The Tables are submitted with a hope that they may aid in forming a standard of the weight of the human organs from early infancy to old age .
The cases are arranged at eighteen periods of life , under eighteen different heads , showing the average height and weight of the body ( the measurement of the head , and weight of the spinal marrow in No. 2 ) , the average weight of the encephalon and its several parts ; also of each lung , of the heart , and of all the abdominal viscera .
The assigned causes of death are given in the margin ; also the variations in weight of the lungs , heart , and liver .
TiABLES OF THE WEIGHTS TABLE I. Showing the maximum , minimum , and average height and weight of the human body , and weight compiled from 2086 cases , 1025 males and 1061 females , examined in the St. Marylebone and mean weight of the lungs in health and disease ; of the hearts and livers above and also shown .
NOTE .
The weights are given in pounds , ounces , and decimal parts of an ounce avoirdupois .
The following method was pursued in examining the body:-It was measured from the vertex of the head to the inside of the foot behind the ball of the great toe ; after being weighed , the spinal canal was opened , the cord with its membranes removed from below upwards , as high as possible , and weighed .
The measurements of the head were next taken : the circumference around the occipital protuberance to the centre of the forehead ; the antero-posterior from the former to the space between the eye-brows ; and the transverse from the opening of one ear , over the vertex , tohe opening of the other .
The brain was then examined : the right and left cerebral hemispheres were each removed in slices to the tentorium , and weighed ; the tentorium being divided on each side , the cerebellum , with pons and medulla , were raised ; the crura cerebelli being divided close to the pons , each part was weighed , the pons and medulla together .
The thoracic organs were next examined : the lungs having been taken out , the heart was removed by dividing the great vessels inside , and close to the pericardium ; the cavities were opened , cleansed , and the organ weighed .
The abdominal organs were weighed in the order in which they are : set down in the Tables .

45 45 iI5Il I No. I.-Assigned causes of death .
In diseases of the digestive organs the disproportion between the sexes was great , 98 females to 45 males ; there were 13 cases of infantile jaundice , 2 cases of imperforate anus , and 1 of malposition of the viscera in a new-born male .
Diseases of the genitourinary organs were more frequent amongst females than males , 33 to 15 .
Above half the mortality was owing to diseases of the respiratory organs ; the per-centage amongst the male adults was 64'5 , and amongst the females 47'6 .
In infants from 3 months to 4 years , pneumonia , frequently combined with eruptive fevers , prevailed ; from 4 to 60 years pulmonary phthisis was most prevalent ; and after 60 years pneumonia again prevailed .
Of phthisis , there were 253 males and 140 females .
Under diseases of the vascular system have been included those of the heart and blood-vessels , diseased state of the blood , purpura , hoemorrhage , dropsy , cachexy , scrofula , and cancer , which in the advanced periods of life , after 50 years , fell most heavily on females ; the numbers were 85 males , and 120 females .
Diseases of the nervous system were most fatal in infancy and old age , especially amongst male infants and aged females ; the total numbers of all ages were males 167 , females 187 .
Under the head " locomotive organs " are included accidents , diseases of bone , skin , and cellular tissue , of which there were 36 cases in both sexes .
Of fevers , about 50 cases of the eruptive form occurred in infancy , and of ordinary fevers about 50 in adults .
There were 43 " inquest cases , " of which 23 were infants , mostly new-born , found exposed , and 20 were adults .
There were 51 " causes unknown , " viz. 47 still-born and new-born infants , and 4 females upwards of 80 years .
Results .
The general results obtained from a review of the foregoing cases among the poor of the parish of St. Marylebone , appear to be that , with few exceptions , the body and internal organs arrived at their full size in both sexes between 20 and 30 years .
In children especially , the body was attenuated from disease : for example , one scrofulous female child , aged 3 years , weighed only 8lbs .
, and the numbers about that age were insufficient to counterbalance the effect of such cases on the mean result , and form a standard of comparison for children of the same age under more favourable circumstances .
The average weight of the males was greatest at from 70 to 80 years , which is to be accounted for by the large proportion cut off at earlier periods by pulmonary phthisis .
The mean weight of the male brain was , at all periods , above that of the female , which was the probable cause of the large number of still-born male infants as compared with females , 51 to 32 , and the necessity of resorting to craniotomy in five instances in the males only .
The highest average weight of the brain in both sexes was from 14 to 20 years ; the next highest was in the males from 30 to 40 , and in the females from 20 to 30 years ; but it will be observed that the number of cases were much fewer in these than in other later periods .
The weight of the lungs was so much , and so frequently increased by disease , that healthy lungs were exceptions : it 260 therefore appeared advisable to introduce in the margin their weights in various states ; also the weights of the heart and liver , which were subject to great variations .
The " Thymus gland , " an organ which disappears with infancy , was so large in the f &amp; tus in fourteen cases , that it appeared to have formed a fatal impediment to respiration .
The abdominal organs were generally heavier in the male than in the female ; the spleen in both was subject to considerable variations in size , and the mean weight of the left kidney was generally found greater than that of the right .
TABLE No. II.-Assigned causes of death .
Diseases of the digestive organs , principally peritonitis , enteritis , and dysentery , were found in 18 males and 41 females , and most frequently in females from 30 years of age and upwards .
In 1 male and 2 females there was disease of the kidneys ; diseases of the respiratory organs in 147 , one-half of the males , and in 98 females ; 44 were cases of pulmonary consumption in males and 37 in females ; 91 were cases of pneumonia in males and 55 in females .
Of diseases of the vascular system , 11 occurred in males and 17 in females ; 5 were cases of pericarditis , 4 in males ; 13 of dropsy , 8 in females ; and 11 of cachexy , of which 7 were females .
Diseases of the nervous system were found in 109 males and 66 females ; viz. cerebral apoplexy in 9 males and 8 females ; meningitis in 22 males and 11 females ; disease of brain in 55 males and 36 females ; myelitis in 23 males and 11 females ; so that 37 per cent. of males and 28-3 per cent. of females had organic disease of the cerebral organs .
In Table I. the proportion is only 12'3 per cent. in the males and 17 6 per cent. in the females .
There were 3 deaths from lumbar abscess , 1 from cancer , 1 from erysipelas , 4 from fever , and 3 were inquest cases .
Results .
The average height of the adult male varied from 67 8 to 65 inches , of the female from 63-2 to 61*6 inches ; while the mean weight of the former varied from 112'12 to 91-5 lbs. , and of the latter from 95*2 to 76*9 , showing a preponderance in the insane male of 6 lbs. , and in the insane female of 8 lbs. , as compared with the sane adults dying at the same period of life .
The average weight of the right cerebral hemisphere varied in the males from 20'89 oz. to 18-97 oz. , and in the females from 19-21 oz. to 17'20 oz. ; the left varied in the males from 21*05 oz. to 18 62 oz. , and from 19'51 oz. to 17 39 oz. in the females .
It is a singular fact , confirmed by the examination of nearly 200 cases at St. Marylebone , in which the hemispheres were weighed separately , that almost invariably the weight of the left exceeded that of the right by at least the eighth of an ounce .
In the Med. Chir .
Trans. vol. xxxix .
, several cases of inequalities of the cerebral hemispheres which came under my notice are given .
The average weight of the cerebellum varied in the males from 5 42 oz. to 5 06 oz. , and from 5 to 4s74 oz. in the females ; that of the pons Varolii and medulla in the males from 1'15 oz. to 1'02 oz. , and from 1'05 to -95 oz. 261 .
in the females ; and that of the encephalon in males from 48'17 oz. to 43*87 oz. , and in females from 44*55 oz. to 40'55 oz. ; in the sane , at the same period of life , the average varied in the male from 48*2 to 45'34 , and in the female from 43'7 to 39'77 .
The general average weight of the lungs is shown in the Table , and the exceptions in the margin .
The average weight of the heart did not reach its maximum until an advanced period of life .
In the abdominal organs nothing was observed differing essentially from those in FTable NTo I.
