" On the Connexion between the State of the Sun 's Surface-and the Horizontal Intensity of the Earth 's Magnetism .
" By Balfour Stewart , F.R.S. Received December 6 , 1882 .
1 .
The late John Allan Broun , in a paper published in the " Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh " ( vol. xxii , Part 3 ) , has compared together the daily changes of the earth 's horizontal magnetic force at the four stations\#151 ; Makerstoun ( Scotland ) , Trevandrum ( India ) , Singapore , and Hobarton , and has come to the following conclusions:\#151 ; ( 1 .
) The daily mean horizontal force increases at the same time at all the stations , and diminishes at the same time at all the stations .
( 2 .
) The proportional amounts of increase and diminution at the stations are not very different from each other .
( 3 .
) If this holds for all the points of the earth 's surface , we may infer that the intensity of the magnetism of the whole earth is variable , increasing , or diminishing from day to day .
2 .
It is easy to see that the selection by Broun of the horizontal force component in preference to the vertical force or the declination was a happy choice .
For since the magnetic system of the earth has two pairs of force-foci , one pair of which is , perhaps , chiefly affected by transient changes , the variations of declination at different stations might not possess that uniformity which those of horizontal force might be expected to exhibit ; and in like manner the changes of vertical force might have opposite signs at opposite sides of the equator of the variable magnetic system .
On the other hand , at all stations in ordinary latitudes the horizontal force might be expected to increase or diminish at the same time , and nearly in the same proportion , whether the cause of this change were due to only one of the two magnetic systems , or whether it were shared by both .
3 .
Assuming , therefore , as the most probable conclusion that these changes of horizontal force represent changes in the intensity of the magnetism of the whole earth , let us now endeavour to ascertain whether they depend in any way on the state of the sun 's surface .
In order to determine this point , I have taken the daily means given by Broun for the four stations above mentioned .
These are for the years 1844 and 1845 , the unit being the same fraction of the horizontal force for each station .
The next step has been to take the mean of these four daily means , and to assume that this represents approximately at least the value from day to day of the relative intensity of the magnetism of the earth .
1882.1 On the Sun 's Surface and the Earth 's Magnetism .
407 Here it is necessary to remark that the indications recorded , by Broun are those of a differential instrument ( the Bifilar ) , which is not well adapted for recording long-period variations of the horizontal component in a trustworthy manner ; but is , on the other hand , admirably suited for short-period variations .
As it is with this latter species of change we have now to deal , we may therefore trust without hesitation to the instrumental records given by Broun .

The state of the sun 's surface as regards spotted area for the years 1844 and 1845 , will be found in an appendix to the Report of the Solar Physics Committee .
The information there .
given is derived from Schwabe 's sun pictures , and the whole amount of spotted area for each observation day is expressed in millionths of the sun 's visible hemisphere . .
5 .
The value of the comparison of these two records , terrestrial and solar , is lessened by the fact that in the four observatories Sunday was always a blank day , while bad weather caused the catalogue of Hofrath Schwabe to present many blank days , and even groups of days , during which it would be hazardous to estimate the spotted area by interpolation .
_ The comparison has been made in the following manner .
The various days exhibiting a maximum of horizontal force have been taken as central epochs and compared with two days before and two days after , and this comparison has been extended to sun-spots , as well as to magnetic force .
The method will be seen from the following specimen .

390 594 420 270 270 Prom what we have said , it will be inferred that the central dates represent the dates of ( 3 ) , whether for horizontal force or sun-spots .
The method is analogous to that adopted by Professor Loomis , when comparing together sun-spots and disturbances .
A comparison precisely similar was next made for days of magnetic minima . .
6 .
The following results have been obtained from this comparison .
Por magnetic maxima there were in all 59 cases in which the comparison was reasonably good , while for magnetic minima there were 49 such cases .
The mean of these is expressed as follows:\#151 ; 2 e 2 408 On the Sun 's Surface and the Earth 's Magnetism .
[ Dec. 2 ] Table I.\#151 ; Horizontal Force Maxima .
Horizontal force = a constant quantity plus the following expression , the unit being one hundred-thousandth of the whole Spotted area in millionths of the horizontal force , increasing numbers de- aim 's visible hemisphere , noting increasing force .

It will at once be seen from these results that high values of the horizontal force correspond to large sun-spot areas , and low values to small sun-spot areas .
Thus the mean value of the horizontal force for the first or maximum series is 318*4 , while for the second or minimum 1882 .

409 series it is 302-5 .
Again , the mean snn-spot value for the first series is 328 , while for the second series it is 277 .
A difference in mean spotted area of 51 millionths of the visible disk would therefore appear to correspond to a difference in terrestrial magnetic intensity equal to 15'9 hundred thousandths of the whole .
The results of Tables I and II are exhibited graphically in the diagram .
8 .
If we refer to this diagram we shall see that the appearance of the curves representing magnetic change is very similar to that of the curves representing solar change , but that the epoch of maximum or minimum for the latter slightly precedes the corresponding epoch for the former .
The magnetic means recorded by Broun , from which these results have been ' derived , are for the Gottingen astronomical day ( 0 h. to 23 h. ) , while the sun-spot observations were made by Schwabe and Dessau , at times not far distant from noon ( 0 h. ) .
Had the two sets of curves , terrestrial and solar , marched exactly together , we might thus have inferred that in reality the terrestrial ( corresponding to 12 hours ) , was behind the solar ( corresponding to times not far distant from Oh .
) .
But in addition to this , the curves denote a decided precedence of the solar over the terrestrial .
There is thus considerable evidence in favour of a lagging behind on the part of the terrestrial results , and hence in this respect these magnetic phenomena of very short period form no exception to other magnetic phenomena , such as those connected with daily range , which exhibit a lagging behind the corresponding solar changes in a very unmistakable manner .

" By William Huggins , D.C.L. , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received December 13 , 1882 .
Problems of the highest interest in the physics of our sun are connected , doubtless , with the varying forms which the coronal light is known to assume , but these would seem to admit of solution only on the condition of its being possible to study the corona continuously , and so to be able to confront its changes with the other variable phenomena which the sun presents .
Unless some means be found , says Professor C. A. Young , " for bringing out the structures round the sun which are hidden by the glare of our atmosphere , the progress of our knowledge must be very slow , for the corona is visible only about eight days in a century , in the aggregate , and then only over narrow stripes on the earth 's surface , and but from one to five minutes at a time by any one observer."* * " The Sun , " p. 239 .
