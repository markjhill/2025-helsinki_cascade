" On the peculiar cooling effects of Hydrogen and its compounds in cases of Voltaic Ignition .
" By W. F. Stevenson , Esq. , F.R.S. In this communication the author gives several theorems which he considers to be established by the experiments cited in a pazmphlet which he published , entitled " The Non-decomposition of Water distinctly proved .
" He then states , that when we apply the principle of these theorems to Mr. Grove 's discovery of the cooling properties of hydrogen , it will be found to admit of a most simple solution : " for instance , when the coil of platinum wire is connected with the poles of the electric battery , and the current is established , it is evident that the electric matter thus passed through the wire must escape at the contrary end ( the air with which the wire is surrounded not being a conductor of electricity ) , and as the quantity of electric matter thus transmitted is considerable , and its exit from the wire confined but rapid , that commotion before noticed ( in one of the author 's theorems ) necessarily ensues and causes the ignition of the wire ; but when the coil of wire is immersed in hydrogen , which is a conductor of electricity , it is evident that the electric matter must be , at the same moment , abstracted or conducted from every portion of the wire , and consequently the commotion or rush of the electric matter at the extremity of the wire , which causes the ignition , is suspended and the comparative coolness of the wire is the necessary result .
