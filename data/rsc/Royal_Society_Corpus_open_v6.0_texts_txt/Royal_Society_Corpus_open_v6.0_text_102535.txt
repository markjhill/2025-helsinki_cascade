Part of a Letter from Dr. Ash , Lord Bishop of Cloyne , dated March the 26th 1687 .
concerning the Effects of Imagination the Virtues of Mackenboy , &amp;c. LAst January in the County of Kilkenny I observed a very remarkable Instance of the Force of Imagination upon the Faetus , it was a Girl called Elizabeth Dooly , of about Thirteen Years of Age , whose Mother being with Child of her , was frighted by a Cow as she milked it , and hit with the Teat on the left Temple within One Eighth of an Inch from her Eye , in which very Place the Girl has a piece of Flesh growing exactly like a Cows Teat in Bigness , Shape , &amp;c. except that it has a Bone in the Midst of it , which reaches above half the length , this Piece of Flesh is perforated , and she weeps through it , when she laughs it wrinkles up , it grows in Proportion to the rest of her Body , she is as sensible there as in any other Part .
March the Third in the Evening we had very much Thunder , and that and the next Day the Mercury in the Barometer was much lower than ever I observed it , viz. but ~ above Twenty Eight Inches .
On Friday Night , the 18th of this Month , I observed here the Occultation of Saturn by the Moon , which happened at 12h .

it passed directly under the ~ of the Moon 's Discus , the spightful Clouds hindered our Emersion .
Dr. Mullen tried lately an Experiment upon the famous Irish Herb called , Mackenboy , or ~ Hibernicus , which is by the Natives reported to be so strong a Purge , that even the carrying it about one in their Cloaths is sufficient to produce the Effect : this fabulous Story which has long prevailed , he proved false , by carrying its Roots for Three Days in his Pocket , without any Alteration of that sort .
A Quarry of white Marble is lately discovered in the County of Antrim , a Specimen of which was brought to us ; it is of an extremely fine Grain , soft at first , but grows very hard afterwards , like your Portland Stone .
