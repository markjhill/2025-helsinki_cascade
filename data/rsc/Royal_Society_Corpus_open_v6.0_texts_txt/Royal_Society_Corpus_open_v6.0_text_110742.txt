" Additional Note on the Contraction of Voluntary Muscles in the living body .
" By Wiliiam Bowman , Esq. , F.R.S. , Demonstrator of Anatomy in King 's College , London , and Assistant Surgeon to King 's College Hospital .
This communication contains a short account of some recent examinations made by the author on the human muscular fibre affected by tetanus .
The effect of the violent contractions which characterize this disease , is to produce , in many parts of the muscles , considerable ecchymosis , which gives the contiguous portions a pale and gray aspect .
In other places the muscles lose , in a great mea ?
sure , their fine fibrous character , and exhibit a soft mottled surface , which is easily torn .
The primitive fasciculi , when microscopically examined , present indications of strong contraction , appearing swollen into a fusiform shape , and having their transverse striae in some parts much more closely approximated , and in others separated to much greater distances than in the natural state , or even altogether obliterated , in consequence of the whole texture being broken up into those primitive elements of which the discs are constructed ; and frequently they are broken across without a corresponding rupture of the sarcolemma .
The author is led from his observations to the conclusions , ?
1st , that the contraction of a muscle is the essential cause of its rupture , 2ndly , that there is no repellent force between the contractile elements of muscular fibre ; and , lastly , that the contraction of volun ?
tarry muscle is not a sustained act of the whole congeries of contrac ?
the elements composing it , but a rapid series of partial acts , in which all duly share , becoming by turns contracted and relaxed .
The paper is accompanied by drawings cf the microscopic appearances therein described .
