Effect of Mineral [ Nov. 4 , backwards through the history of our planet , we probably come to a time when the rigidity was so small that the stable configuration of equilibrium would be unsymmetrical .
At this time the earth would be pear-shaped , and the transition to the present approximately spherical form would take place through a series of ruptures .
It is suggested that the earth , in spite of this series of ruptures , still retains traces of a pear-shaped configuration .
Such a configuration would possess a single axis of symmetry , and this , it is suggested , is an axis which meets the earth 's surface somewhere in the neighbourhood of England ( or possibly some hundreds of miles to the south-west of England ) .
Starting from England , we find that England is at the centre of a hemisphere which is practically all land : this would be the blunt end of our pear .
Bounding the hemisphere we have a great circle of which England is the pole , and it is Over this circle that earthquakes and volcanoes are of most frequent occurrence .
Now , if we suppose our 1 pear contracting to a spherical shape , we notice that it would probably be in the neighbourhood of its equator that the changes in curvature and the relative displacements would be greatest , and hence we should .expect to find earthquakes and volcanoes in greatest numbers near to this circle .
Passing still further from England we come to a great region of deep seas\#151 ; the Pacific , South Atlantic , and Indian oceans : these may mark the place where the " waist " of the pear occurred .
Lastly , we come almost at the antipodes of England to the Australian continent : this may mark the remains of the stalk-end of the pear .
uExperiments on the Effect of Mineral Starvation on the Parasitism of the Uredine Fungus , Puccinia on species of Bromus .
" By H. Marshall Ward , Sc. D. , F.R.S. , Professor of Botany in the University of Cambridge .
Received November 4 , \#151 ; -Bead November 27 , 1902 .
I have shown in previous publications that the parasitic Uredine Puccinia dispersa , growing on grasses of the genus Bromus , is usually very closely adapted to the species of host-plant selected : that although no morphological differences can be detected between the fungus as met with on different species of A , B , C , \amp ; c.\#151 ; it by no means follows that spores from the parasite , as found growing on A , will infect B or C , or that spores from the fungus as reared on B or C will infect the species A. On the whole , it has so far appeared probable that the fungus growing on a given species\#151 ; -e.g .
, B. mollis\#151 ; infects most readily those Starvation on the Parasitism of 1902 .
] species which are most nearly related to B. , less and less readily species more remote from B. mollis , but in the same sub-genus , and least readily , or not at all , species in other sub-genera .
In the attempt to obtain some insight into what causes are at the bottom of this remarkable phenomenon\#151 ; the predisposition to , or immunity from , infection of the host by the parasite\#151 ; it was shown that anatomical differences on the part of the host-plants , such as the sizes and numbers of stomata , hairs , and so forth , do not suffice to explain it , since no relation could be detected between the curves expressing the percentage of infection and those expressing the sizes , numbers , \amp ; c. , of the hairs , stomata , \amp ; c. On the other hand , the evidence suggested some such assumption as the following .
The fungus , when growing on a species of Bromus A , may refuse to infect another species B , either because B secretes some body of the nature of an enzyme or , anti-toxin which effectually keeps the mycelium of the fungus at bay , or because the fungus habituated to the peculiar nutritive or other conditions afforded it by the host-plant A , cannot immediately adapt itself to the very different conditions offered by the species B. Although the attempts to isolate any such anti-toxin failed , and experiments of a preliminary character to test the effect of differences of nutrition yielded little or nothing of a positive nature , I showed in the discussion of the probable factors concerned that some subtle relations between host and parasite must be assumed to account for the curious facts of immunity and predisposition on the part of the former , and of capacity and incapacity for infection on the part of the latter , in each case in various degrees according to the species of host .offered for infection , or on which the fungus has hitherto been reared .
During the past year I have attempted to pursue this subject further , and limit myself for the present to the following theme .
If the varying infective power of the fungus towards different species of kost-plant is derived solely from the " nutritive conditions " afforded it by the host-plant it has hitherto been growing upon , two cases are possible\#151 ; ( 1 ) these " nutritive conditions " may be simply the expression .of the power of the tissues to yield certain food-substances to the parasite in proper proportions and in sufficient quantity , or ( 2 ) they may imply some more subtle relations between the mycelium of the fungus and the living contents of the host-cells .
For instance , it may be not sufficient that the food-substances suitable to the fungus should \#166 ; exist in the cells of the host , but they must be there in a certain superabundance , or presented in a certain manner , and so on ; or , it may be that the fungus must be vigorous up to a certain standard before it can obtain a hold on such food , and so on .
In order to test some of the possibilities here referred to I planned 140 Prof. H. Marshall Ward .
Effect of Mineral [ Nov. 4 , experiments to see whether starving the host-plant of one or other of its necessary food-materials would ( 1 ) affect its predisposition to infection , or ( 2 ) affect the capacity for infection of the fungus grown on the starved plants , or ( 3 ) in any other way affect the fungus or its host .
On July 7 , 1902 , fourteen beakers were selected and filled with equal quantities of a clean coarse-grey sand , carefully washed and dried , but still containing traces of ingredients which the root-hairs of such grasses as the Bromes are capable of selecting .
This was not to be avoided or regretted , since my object was not to attempt to grow seedlings totally deprived of necessary salts , resulting in their premature death , but to bring up plants so starved of certain such ingredients that while they could go on living long enough for the purposes of the experiment , they would nevertheless exhibit the effects of the deficiency , and possibly re-act on the parasite .
The beakers of sand were lettered A to 0 , and treated as follows:\#151 ; The beaker A received 200 c.c. of distilled water only , so that the only mineral supplies available to the seedlings\#151 ; after exhausting the traces in the endosperm\#151 ; would be such as the root-hairs could dissolve from the sand grains .
Another beaker received an equal quantity of a cold water-extract of fresh horse-dung , representing a liquid of high manurial value .
A third beaker received an equal quantity of a normal nutritive mineral solution containing nitrates , phosphates , and sulphates of potassium , calcium and magnesium ; and a fourth the same with the addition of five drops of a dilute solution of ferric chloric .
One each of the remaining beakers received a similar solution of the nutritive salts , but in each case with the omission of one element , viz. : calcium , magnesium , nitrogen , phosphorous , or potassiumwhile the other beaker of each pair received the same , together with traces of iron salt .
By these means I had prepared a soil in each beaker which was of suitable consistency for growing such sand-loving grasses as Bromes , but which was in each case deficient in one or other of the necessary ingredients for normal nutrition-\#151 ; except in so far as I added such ingredients\#151 ; but in no case absolutely devoid of these necessary salts , as otherwise the seedlings could not be expected to live long enough for the purposes of the experiment .
On July 8 , having allowed the solutions to soak completely into the sand , seven grains of Bromus , carefully cleaned and selected , were sown in each beaker , and the whole left under large bell-jars to germinate in a suitably lighted position in the laboratory .
Germination followed in due course , though somewhat slowly , as the sand was rather wet , and on July 15 , from two to five seedlings about 30\#151 ; 50 mm. high were showing above ground in each beaker except 1902 .
] Starvation on the Parasitism 141 one , and the whole were now placed in a sheltered situation in the open , the bell-jars being raised on large blocks so that their rims just covered the rims of the beakers ; thus permitting a free circulation of air , but protecting the whole from beating winds or rain .
An awning was also provided , and carefully adjusted during hot days as necessary .
Growth proceeded fairly rapidly , though of course some retardation was inevitable owing to the impervious nature of the beakers as contrasted with pots having porous sides , and by July 18 each beaker had from two to seven satisfactory seedlings .
On July 23 , ten of the beakers had from five to seven excellent seedlings each : three had but four each , and one had only two successful seedlings .
So far there was but little difference observable between the different seedlings , each of which was unfolding its third leaf .
Nevertheless , there was evidence that the stores of food-materials in the indosperm were now being exhausted , and that the root-system was beginning to feel the effects of the differences in mineral supplies .
Consequently , I fished out the remains of dead or un-germinated grains , and proceeded to infect certain of the seedlings in each beaker with Uredo-spores of Puccinia obtained from Bromus squarrosus .
This species was selected because I had an abundant stock of vigorous spores at hand , and had already satisfied myself that they readily infect Bromus secalinus .
The infection was effected by placing equal doses of the fresh spores on each leaf chosen ; the bell-jars were then lowered in order to keep the plants in a moist atmosphere for 24 hours , and then raised again on blocks for another 24 hours , after which the bell-jars were removed each morning , and only replaced at night or during rain .
The results of infection were already evident on one or two plants on July 31 and August 1 , increasingly so on August 3 , and by August 5 the pustules were as prominent as they ever became during the period of the experiment\#151 ; i.e. , up to August 29\#151 ; except in so far as some of the larger ones ran together or produced more spores .
The results are summarised in Table I , but it should be noted that it has been impossible to compress into the table the details of the observations from day to day as to the stature , robustness , colour , number and breadth of leaves and so on , or as to the rate of development of the plants and of the flecks and pustules of the parasite .
In order that the reader may gather an impression of the appearance of these seedlings during the progress of the experiment , however , I append photographs* of one set of the beakers in fig. 1 , and of a representative series of the plants themselves , carefully extracted * I have to thank my son , F. 3L Ward , for the preparation of these photographs .

The plants in A had received distilled water only ; in B nutritive solution minus ; phosphorus ; in E no nitrogen ; in K no magnesia , and with five drops of ferric chloride ; in ST normal mineral solution with iron salts .
L had no nitrogen , but five drops of iron solution .
The facts recorded in this table and in the legend to these figures speak for themselves , but the following details may be noted .
The effects of the deficiency of all salts ( A ) of phosphorus ( B ) and of nitrogen ( E ) are distinctly observable in the poor development of the roots , as well as of the feeble and narrow leaves ; but although the opposite effects of the rich manurial action of the horse-dung decoction ( 0 ) and the normal mineral solution ( G ) are plain , the differential results of the solutions minus calcium and potassium are by no means obvious , nor did the addition of the five drops of dilute ferric chloride seem to make much difference .
Apart from an error in regard to the calcium ( c , Table I ) , I attribute this to the circumstance that it is extremely difficult to starve such 1902 .

145 were apt to show early yellowing and withering , as well as some degree of stunting .
When we come to examine the results of infection , it is clear that no great differences were observable between the various seedlings .
The first flecks\#151 ; i.e. , pale patches indicating the presence of the fungus in the tissues\#151 ; were visible on July 31 and August l , that is to say , on the eighth or ninth day after infection , and by August 3 pustules were developed on all the plants except those starved of phosphorus , while two days later even these were definitely pustuled in one of the two beakers ( h , Table I ) , though the other remained free of them to the end ( b , Table I ) .
As will be seen from further experiments , however , we can lay no stress on this latter case , and must conclude that:\#151 ; Lack of minerals in no way secured immunity from , though seedlings deficient in phosphorus or in nitrogen tended to show retardation of infection .
When we look into the matter from another point of view , however , the conclusion seems inevitable that there are considerable differences in the quantity of fungus mycelium , and consequently of Uredo-spores , developed from the latter , which the various seedlings were able to support .
Taking the extreme cases , and comparing the sizes of the infected areas on the phosphorus-free plants ( , Table I ) and those on the plants supplied with normal mineral solution ( and n , Table I ) , the latter were found to be much the larger , and similarly with the pustules themselves : the numerous large well-developed pustules on g and n bore many hundred times as many spores as did the few small pustules on f , and similar results were observable in less marked degrees on others .
It must therefore be concluded that:\#151 ; Mineral starvation makes itself felt quantitatively in the number of uredospores which can be produced by the fungus in the tissues of the starved leaves .
Now arose an important question:\#151 ; Are the spores on the small starved pustules in any way different from those produced by the large well-developed pustules of normal or richly-manured plants 1 For instance , can any differences in size , colour , or marking , or in capacity for germination , be detected in spores from the small and few pustules of a , e , h , or l ( Table I ) , and those from the large well-developed pustules of g , n , or o 1 As regards the morphological features , direct examination showed that no differences were to be detected ; the properly ripened spores in all cases were normal .
As regards their capacity for germination , I proved by sowing them in separate watch-glasses of distilled water that in every case the pustules yielded spores capable of normal , and that in proportions which showed no relation to the degree or kind of starvation of the seedling which bore them ( see Table II , col .
4 ) .

Effect of Mineral [ Nov. 4 , It now remained to test the further question :\#151 ; Are such spores equally capable of infecting other seedlings In order to test the capacity for infection , or virulence , of the spores developed on the experimental plants , I employed tube-cultures of seedlings as described in a previous communication , * with a slight modification in detail , as follows ( see fig. 4 ) :\#151 ; Picked grains of Bromus secalinus were sown singly in test-tubes of sand , to which the normal mineral solution was added , and sterilised .
When the seedlings were well up , and nine days old , on August 14 , each having one good green leaf , a sowing was made on each from the uredo pustules on one of the plants of Experiment 47 ( Table I ) , as shown in the annexed tabular summary ( p. 147 ) .
It will be seen that in every case the results of infection were positive .
Those spores which had been reared on seedlings starved of phosphorus ( h ) , and on those starved of all salts ( a ) , were behind the others in their rapidity of effect ; hut we cannot lay much stress on this , because the same was true of spores reared on what should have been the calcium-starved plants ( c ) , which accidentally received a dose of calcium by mistake .
On the other hand , the most vigorous spores were those reared on plants to which horse-dung decoction had been added .
I am not disposed to lay stress on these latter points , however , but am content at present to regard the positive results as amounting to proof that spores even when reared on starved seedlings are capable of normal germination and infection when placed on the leaves of other\#151 ; normal\#151 ; seedlings .
A second experimental series of sand-cultures was started on July 10 , 1902 , in sixteen beakers , arranged as before , but with the following differences in detail .

Effect of Mineral [ Nov. 4 , f chemically purified by acid and washing , and stronger doses of the mineral solution were employed .
Each beaker received an equal !
weight of the sand ( 1500 gr. ) , and of soluton ( 300 c.c. ) , and 8 grains 1 of a species of Bromus , received under the name of B. \ were sown in each .
This species\#151 ; which differs little , if at all , from B. patulus\#151 ; has been thoroughly investigated with regard to its S predisposition to attack by the uredo of Puccinia and was chosen because it has proved to be the most sensitive to infection of all the forms I have in culture .
The grains were hand-picked and clean , but were not specially sterilised in any way .
The beakers were treated as before , and on July 15 seedlings were showing in all but one of the beakers , and by the 18th each of thirteen had from seven to eight seedlings , two had four each , and one none .
By July 30 every beaker had from six to eight excellent seedlings , except one , and this remained barren to the end , possibly owing to drowning of the grains , or too deep sowing .
By this date there were marked differences in stature , and some in colour , between the various pairs of sets ; the smaller seedlings in the beakers deprived of all added salts , or deficient in nitrogen or in phosphorus being particularly noticeable .
Not only were the leaves of these fewer and shorter but also narrower , and the whole plantlet looked feebler in each case than corresponding specimens in other beakers .
Most of the latter had three or four leaves fully expanded , with the fourth or fifth just peeping through , but these feebler seedlings only showed two mature leaves and a third one just beginning to unfold , or three leaves with as yet no signs of the fourth .
On July 30 I infected , chiefly on the second leaf , * with Uredo-spores of the fungus grown on Bromus patulus , a form known from experiments to infect this species of seedling very readily .
The infected plants were then placed under moist bell-jars , lifted in due course , and treated as before .
On August 8 several of the plants showed pustules , indicating successful infection , and by August 12 it was possible to estimate the degree of attack in each case , and to compare the relative virulence or vigour of the pustules and spores developed .
The essential facts are summarised in Table III .
Here , again , certain concordant facts come prominently to light .
As before the infection is generally successful on just those plants , and at just those spots where the inoculation occurred .
In the apparent exceptions ( e.g. , in g and i , Table III ) , I have no reason to doubt that the extra-infection was due to the almost unavoidable spluttering of spores , or the contact of inoculated leaves with others , a particularly easily incurred danger with this extremely susceptible species .

] Control cultures have shown over and over again that these seedlings do not incur the disease unless the spores are placed on the leaves , and I cannot accept these one or two apparent exceptions as evidence for a spontaneous outbreak of the disease .
The severity of the attack , as indicated by the size of the pustules and of the infected areas , and by the relative number of spores developed , followed much the same order as in the previous experiment , except that the nitrogen-free plants seemed to bear larger pustules than before .
The minute and poorly-developed pustules on the seedlings starved of phosphorus ( land m , Table III ) or of all minerals ( a ) were particularly evident ; as also were the severe attacks of the manured specimens .
And , again , the magnesium-free seedlings showed premature yellowing and withering of the leaf-tips .
Again , also , there was decided retardation of infection pustules in the phosphorus-free , distilled water , and , to a less extent the magnesium-free specimens .
But\#151 ; again concordant\#151 ; none of the plants were rendered immune from infection ; and , as will be seen in the sequel , all the pustules , however minute , yielded spores with normal morphological characters , and perfectly capable of germinating and of reinfecting other seedlings of the Bromus in question .
Meanwhile , I had started a third complete series of sand-cultures of Bromus pendulinus , arranged as in the last series , but with two small variations in detail , viz. , ( 1 ) in order to diminsh the risk of drowning or asphyxiating the seeds , I sunk a tall thistle-head funnel to the bottom of each beaker of sand , and poured the solution in each case down to the bottom of the beaker , allowing it to soak upwards and gradually moisten the upper layers from beneath ; and ( 2 ) only 5 grains of the Brome ( B. pendulinus ) were sown in each beaker .
The results were very good .
The grains were sown July 23 .
On July 29 seedlings were up in all but three of the beakers .
On August 1 these also had seedlings showing , and by August 5 most of the seedlings were 25\#151 ; 30 mm. or more high .
On August 9 all but three of the beakers had four or five excellent seedlings , each with the second leaves showing , and the effects of the mineral starvation were beginning to be visible .
In order to emphasise this effect , if possible , by preventing the further development of the second and later leaves at the expense of materials stored in the first leaves , I now cut off the latter from each seedling with a pair of sharp fine scissors , and left the seedlings to grow further .
During the next week the second leaf in each case attained its full size , and the third leaf began to appear ; and I now proceeded to devote this series of seedlings to test the effect of sowing the spores reared on the seedlings of the last series ( see Table III ) , and which had been affected as to their numbers by the starving or other 150 Prof. H. Marshall Ward .
Effect of Mineral [ Nov. 4,1 treatment of the seedlings , on the leaves of the seedlings of this series , " 1 similarly starved or otherwise .
As we have seen ( Experiment series No. 47 , Table I , and series 60 , I Table II ) , spores from a seedling starved of phosphorus , however few I in number , are perfectly capable of infecting the leaf of a normal seed- i ling .
Can such spores also infect another seedling similarly starved of 1 phosphorus ; and can spores reared on calcium-starved or nitrogen- 9 starved seedlings , \amp ; c. , infect seedlings similarly starved of calcium I nitrogen respectively , and so on 1 On August 18 , therefore , I infected the third leaf of each of several 1 seedlings in each beaker of series 55 ( Table IY ) with the spores ] developed on the corresponding seedlings ( which had been similarly j treated ) of series 50 ( Table III ) .
The results are summarised in Table IY .
As the table shows , practically all the infections were successful , 1 showing that not only does mineral starvation nut prevent the develop- 1 meant of virulent spores on the seedling so starved\#151 ; if the latter is 1 inoculated with normal spores\#151 ; but such starvation is also incapable of I incapacitating the corresponding seedling fc/ r infection by means of spores 1 grown on similarly starved seedlings .
We must therefore conclude for the present that ( 1 ) the starvation 1 of mineral food-substances , although it reduces the size of the host- 1 plant and seriously diminishes the quantity of spores which the myce- I lium can give rise to on its leaves , does not affect either the virulence \#166 ; of such spores or the predisposition to infection of the leaves of the ] Brome concerned .
Moreover ( 2 ) , in view of the results with the highly-manured seed- 1 lings to which horse-dung decoction or normal mineral solution was 1 added , it seems hopeless to expect that high cultivation of this kind 1 will diminish the predisposition of the plant to infection\#151 ; or , what would 1 amount to the same thing in practice\#151 ; increase its resistance or confer a immunity .
The effects of manurial treatment are clearly quantitative only , so 1 far as this question is concerned .
1 If the host-plant is highly fed , its tissues yield more food materials 1 for the fungus ; the latter can develope a larger mycelium , and pro- I duce a larger crop of spores .
But so long as the host-plant is capable I of living at all , it is a perfectly satisfactory prey for the fungus in its 1 tissues , so far as quality of fungus food is concerned .
1 It seems to me that these results throw some new light on the prob 1 lem of infection and parasitism , in so far as they bear out the view 1 that the Uredine mycelium taxes the leaf\#151 ; robs it of a share of its fl food-supplies\#151 ; rather than destroys the protoplasmic machinery , at any j rate during the vigorous period of growth and of production of Uret o 1 spores ; and also in so far as they suggest that whatever may be the 9 1902 .
] Starvation on the Parasitism 151 causes at work in the living cell which confer immunity or predisposition on the species of host-plant , or which confer virulence or impotence on the spore , they lie deeper than riutrition , reminding us once more of the significant resemblances which , as I pointed out in a previous paper , * exist between the phenomena of infection and those of pollination .
It is in the highest degree improbable that the pollen-tube of a given species , A , is incapable of growth in the style and the ovule of an allied species , B , simply because the tissues of B do not contain suitable food-materials , while the pollen-tube of a species , C , readily fertilises a more distant species , D , simply because the latter does contain suitable nutritive materials , especially as in both cases we may be able to germinate such pollen in artificial sugar-solutions .
All the evidence points to the existence , in the cells of the fungus , of enzymes or toxins , or both , and in the cells of the host-plant of anti-toxins or similar substances , as the decisive factors in infection or immunity , although I have as yet failed to isolate any such bodies .
Moreover , I regard the results here given as furnishing strong evidence , on the whole , against any hypothesis which assumes the existence of a latent or lurking source of disease in the plants themselves , and as supporting the view that every patch of pustules originates from a definite infection spot due to the entrance of a germ-tube from a spore which has there germinated on the leaf .
