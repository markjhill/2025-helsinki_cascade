A general Method for exhibiting the Value of an Algebraic Expression involving several Radical Quantities in an Infinite Series : Wherein Sir Isaac Newton 's Theorem for involving a Binomial , with another of the same Author , relating to the Roots of Equations , are demonstrated .
By T. Simpson F. R. S. AMONG all the great improvements , which the art of computation hath in these last ages received , the method of series may be justly one of the most considerable ; since not only the doctrine of chances and annuites , with some other branches of the mathematics , depend almost entirely thereon , but even the business of fluents , of such extensive use , would , without its aid and concurrence , be quite at a stand in a multitude of cases , as is well known to mathematicians .

It is for this reason , that the celebrated binomial theorem , for converting radical quantities into series 's , is ranked , by many , among the principal discoveries of its illustrious author ; seeing , by means thereof , a vast number of fluents are found , that would otherwise be impracticable : nor is there any case , however complex , to which it may not be extended .
It is true , when two or more compound radical quantities are involved together , the operation , by having two or more series 's to multiply into one another , becomes very troublesome and laborious ; and , what is worse , the Law of continuation , whereby a part of the labour might be avoided , is exceedingly hard , if not impossibe , this way to be discovered .
In the following paper something is attempted towards obviating the said inconveniences ; but whether the success has been answerable , I shall not take upon me to determine .
PROBLEM I. To find a series exhibiting the value of 1+ x/ a m x1+ x/ b nx1+ x/ c px1+ x~d q &amp;c. in simple terms ; x being indeterminate , and a , b , c , d , m , n , p , &amp;c. any given numbers , whole or broken , positive or negative .
Put u=1+ x/ a m , w=1+ x/ b n , y=1+ x/ e p , z= 1+ xq d &amp;c. Also let ~=uwy z , &amp;c. ( = the quantity proposed ) Then , in fluxions ~=uwy z , &amp;c. +uwy z , &amp;c. +uwy z , &amp;c. +uwy z , &amp; c &amp;c. Which equation , divided by the preceding one , gives ~/ ~ = u/ u + w/ w + y/ y + z/ z &amp;c. But , since u=1+ x/ a m , we have u=mxx1+ x/ a m-1 ; and therefore u/ u = mx/ a x1+ x/ a -1 = mx/ a x 1 x/ a + x2/ a2 x3/ a3 + x4/ a4 &amp;c. by Division .
And in the same manner it appears , that w/ w = nx/ b x1 x/ b + x/ b &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence , our equation , by substituting these values , becomes m/ a mx/ a2 + mx2/ a3 mx3/ a4 &amp;c. ~~=xx n/ b nx/ b2 + nx2/ b3 nx3/ b4 &amp;c. pc px/ c2 + px2/ c3 px3/ c4 &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Put P= m/ a + n/ b + p/ c + q/ d &amp;c. Q= m/ a2 + n/ b2 + p/ c2 + q/ d2 &amp;c. R= m/ a3 + n/ b3 + p/ c3 + q/ d3 &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Then it will be ~/ ~ =xxP Qx + Rx2 Sx3 + Tz4 Vx5 &amp;c. Assume ~=A+ Bx + Cx2 + Dx3 + Ex4 , &amp;c. let this value , with that of ~ , be substituted in the last equation : from whence , by comparing the homologous terms , there will come out B=PA C=P B-Q A/ 2 D= PC-QB-RA/ 3 E= PD-QC+RB-SA/ 4 F= PE-QD+RC-SB+TA/ 5 G= PF-QE+RD-SC+TB-VA/ 6 &amp;c. Where the law of continuation is manifest , and where it is also evident , that the value of ( A ) the first term of the required series , must be an unit ; because , when x=0 .
then the given expression bem np comes 1 x1 x1 = 1 .

If a be taken = 1 , and n , p , q , &amp;c. each = 0 ; then will P= m , Q= m , R= m , &amp;c. And therefore A=1 B=m 2C= mB mA 3D= mC mB + mA = mC 2C 4E= mD mC + mB mA = mD 3D &amp;c. Consequently C= m. m 1/ 2 , D=Cxm 2/ 3 = m.m 1 .
m-2/ 2 .
3 , E= Exm-3/ 4 = m.m-1.m-2.m-3/ 2 .

4 &amp;c. Hence , in this case , 1+ mx + m.m-1/ 2 x2 + m.m-1.m-2/ 2.3 x3 &amp;c. ( = A+ Bx + Cx2 &amp;c. ) = 1+ xm : which series is the same with that given by Sir Isaac Newton .
CORO L. 2 .
If a be taken = 1/ a , ~= 1/ b , ~= 1/ c , &amp;c. and z= 1/ x then will the proposed expression be transformed to 1+ ~/ zm x1+ ~/ zn x1+ ~/ zp x1+ ~/ zq &amp;c. Also P= m~ + n~ + p~+ &amp;c. Q= m~2 + n~2 + p~2 + &amp;c. R= m~3 + n~3 + p~3 + &amp;c. &amp;c. And consequently 1+ ~/ zm x1+ ~/ zn x1+ ~/ zp x1+ ~/ zq &amp;c. =A+ B/ z + C/ z2 + D/ z3 &amp;c. where A=1 , B= =P A , C= PB-QA/ 2 &amp;c. as before .
Which equation or theorem answers in case of a descending series .
CORO L. 3 .
Hence , if each of the quantities m , n , p , &amp;c. be taken equal to unity , and their number be denoted by v ; then will 1+ ~/ z x1+ ~/ z x1+ ~/ z x1+ ~/ z &amp;c. =A+ B/ z + C/ z2 + D/ z3 &amp;c. Which equation , multiplied by zv , gives z+~ x z+~ x z+~ x z+~ &amp;c. = Azv + Bzv-1 + Czv-2 + Dzv-3 &amp;c. Whence it appears , that z-~ x z-~ x z-~ x z-~ &amp;c. is =A zv Bz v-1 +Cz v-2 Dz v-3 &amp;c. Where A= 1 , B=P A , C=P B-Q A/ 2 , D= PC-QB+RA/ 3 , &amp;c. ( as before ) ; P being in this case = sum of all the quantities ~ , ~ , ~ , ~ , &amp;c. Q= the sum of all their squares ; R= the sum of their cubes , &amp;c. &amp;c. CORO L. 4 .
Since ~ , ~ , ~ , ~ , &amp;c. are the roots of the equation , zv Bzv-1 + Cxv-2 Dzv-3 , &amp;c. = 0 ; it follows , that , if B , C , D , E , &amp;c. be given ; the sum of those roots ( P ) ; the sum of their squares ( Q ) , and the sum of their cubes ( R ) &amp;c. will also be given from the foregoing equations : whence will be had P=B Q=+P B-2C R=-PC+QB+3D S=+PD-QC+RB-4E T=-PE+QD-RC+SB+5F &amp;c. &amp;c. where the law of continuation is obvious .
These values are the same with those given ( without demonstration ) by Sir Isaac Newton , in his Universal Arithmetic , for finding when some of the roots of an equation are impossible .
PROBLEM II .
To find a series expressing the value of 1+ x/ am x1+ x2/ bn x1+ x3/ cp x1+ x4/ dq , &amp;c. By putting u=1+ x/ am , w=1+ x2/ bn , &amp;c. ; and proceeding as in the last problem ; there will be had u/ u = mx/ a x1 x/ a + x2/ a2 x3/ a3 &amp;c. w/ w = 2uxx/ b x1 x2/ b + x4/ b2 x6/ b3 &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Whence , Whence , making P= m/ a , Q=m/ a2 2n/ b , R=m/ a3 + 3p/ c , S = m/ a4 + 2n/ b2 4q/ d , T= m/ a5 + 5r/ e , &amp;c. and assuming A+Bx+Cx2+Dx3+Ex4 , &amp;c. to express the series sought , the several values of A , B , C , D , &amp;c. will be exhibited by the very equations brought out in the resolution of the preceding problem .
