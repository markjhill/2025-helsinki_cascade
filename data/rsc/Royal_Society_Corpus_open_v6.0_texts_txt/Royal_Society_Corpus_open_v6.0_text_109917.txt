] This paper is intended as an appendix to a former one on the same subject .
The author extends his investigation to a few more of the principal fixed stars .
He divides the results of any one star into two parts ; first , alternately or accidentally , and also according to the law of parallax ; and as no greater difference is observable in the latter than in the former case , it is demonstrable that parallax has had Lno sensible effect on the observation .
He next inquires what may be the magnitude of the parallax that might be concealed by the accidental error of observation .
Without entering into a rigorous computation on the laws of probability , he conceives that it may be inferred by inspection , that it is almost impossible that the longer axis of the ellipse , described by the brightest fixed star , can exceed 0"'6 , and it is very improbable that it should amount to half as much ; and as this quantity can never derange the mean place of a star 0 ' -1 in declination , it is evident that all attempts to determine the parallax by a meridian instrument of any description must be utterly hopeless .
