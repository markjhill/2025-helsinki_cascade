For the solution of mechanical problems , two methods in general present themselves j the one furnished by the variation ofparameters , or constants , which complete the integral obtained by the first approximation , ?
the other furnished by the integration of the differen ?
tial equations by means of indeterminate coefficients , or some equi ?
valent method .
Each of these methods is applicable to the theory of the perturbations of the heavenly bodies , and they lead to expressions which are of course substantially identical , but which do not appear in the same shape except after certain transformations .
The object of the author in the present paper is to effect transform ?
ations , by which their identity is established , making use of the developments given in his former papers , published in the Philosophical Transactions .
The identity of the results obtained by either methods affords a confirmation of the exactness of those expressions .
Sir Charles BelPs paper " On the Organs of the Human Voice " was then read in continuation .
