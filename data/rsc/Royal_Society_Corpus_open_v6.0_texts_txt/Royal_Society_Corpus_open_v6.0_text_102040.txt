A Postscript to the Publisher , containing a short account of two Human Calculi of unusual form and bigness , from the same F. S. M. D. SIR , I Here send you the Figure of a Stone , Fig. 1 .
of a prodigious ~ and as rare a shape , somewhat resembling indeed the Kidney , for that was quite worn away , and this stone sill 'd up the place , it weighed indeed somewhat more when I took it out of the Body , than it does now , for it then weighed seven ounces and a half ; there is no History that relates any account of a stone generated in the Kidney , that does near parallel this .
Without breaking it asunder , I can find it does consist of several laminae laid over one another , as that of the Bladder does : I took the Circumference , and found it to measure seven Inches upon the round .
That taken out of the Body of the late Duke of Norfolk 's Father , Fig. 2 .
was brought not loug since to the R.Society by Sr. Theodore de Vaux , who gave meleave to send you the Figure of it , which you see is branched , and seems to have spread some branches into great Vessels , whether Arteries , Veins or into the Ureter I cannot determine , tho these as well as the Pelvis seem to have been filled up by this great stone : yet this comes far short of that before mentioned , since it weighs but four ounces and a half : a stone indeed of an incredible size to be found in the Kidney .
The measure longwise from one extreme to the other made four Inches complete : the extension of the Branches from one to the other measured croswise or transversly , 3 Inches and a half .
This is deservedly laid up in the R.pository of the Royal Society , as a great but sorrowful Rarity , having caused the death of so ~ great a Patron of Learning .
