The President then addressed the Society as follows:\#151 ; In the month which intervened between our last anniversary and the end of the year , the Society lost four of its Fellows .
In addressing the Fellows last year , I referred to the loss which science had sustained through the death of the illustrious Kirchhoff , and before three weeks were out , one followed him to the grave whose researches on the connexion between the emission and absorption of radiant heat and light were closely akin to those of Kirchhoff .
I refer to Balfour Stewart , who , shortly after landing in Ireland , whither he had gone to spend the Christmas with his family , was suddenly carried off after only a few hours ' illness , shortly after he had entered on his sixtieth year .
His name is widely known on account of his scientific work in heat , magnetism , and solar physics .
He has been a member of the Council , and the Rumford Medal of the Society was awarded to him for the particular research to which I alluded at the outset .
The other three of our ordinary Fellows who died before the month was out were all far advanced in years .
Two of them were eminent in the medical world , Sir George Burrows and Dr. Arthur Far , both of whom served on our Council .
Early in the year we lost one of our 1888 .
] President 's Address .
Fellows who , while not a man of science , was eminent in literature and jurisprudence .
While our ranks are mainly recruited from men of science , we gladly welcome among us men who , like Sir Henry Sumner Maine , have proved their ability and earned their distinction in other branches of knowledge , whose connexion with us we look on as honourable to the Society , while , as the very fact of their joining us shows , they regard the Fellowship as honourable to themselves .
Admiral Sir Cooper Key , who was highly distinguished as a naval officer , and was at one time Director of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich , was another who served on the Council .
Philip Henry Gosse , who died at an advanced age , is well known for his charming popular works on natural history .
These are some of the Fellows on the home list who died since the last anniversary ; but , besides these , we have lost no less than three of our foreign members .
Professor Anton de Bary , so well known for his researches on the cryptogams , and the eminent naturalist , Professor Asa Gray , who not very long ago was over in this country , both died in January .
Comparatively recently we have lost Professor Clausius , so eminent as a physicist , especially in the department of thermodynamics .
The year of the Society , which terminates to-day , has shown no flagging in scientific activity .
Since the last anniversary , thirty-three memoirs have been published in the ' Philosophical Transactions , containing a total of 1,010 pages and 91 plates .
Of the 'Proceedings , ' nineteen numbers have been issued , containing 1,008 pages and 17 plates .
In addition to this , a Monograph of the Horny Sponges , by Dr. R. von Lendenfeld , which was accepted for publication by the Council , and which when completed will extend to about 1,000 pages , is now nearly through , the press , A large amount of work connected with the Library has been done since the last anniversary .
A special effort has been made to complete imperfect series of scientific periodicals , and by means of exchange , or by the generosity of our corresponding Societies , some hundreds of deficient numbers have been obtained .
The Lists of Institutions entitled to receive gratis the 4 Philosophical Transactions and 4 Proceedings9 have also been carefully revised by the Library Committee , In December last , Mr. Arthur Soper was engaged as a special Assistant to continue the formation of the Shelf-Catalogue , and the revision of the Catalogue of MSS .
, and for other work .
The Shelf-Catalogue of the Upper Library is now completed\#151 ; a work involving the re-arrangement or removal to the lower storeys of several thousands of volumes .
Considerable progress has been made in collating and cataloguing the Archives and other manuscripts belonging to the Society , and an instalment of slips have been written towards a Catalogue of the Miscellaneous Literature in the Library .
VOL. XLV .
Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , in the course of this work many duplicate scientific hooks , and literary works of little value to the Society , have been thrown out , and these have been presented , by order of the Council , to the libraries of the Universities and some of the chief Scientific Societies .
The cataloguing of the titles of scientific papers for the decade 1874 to 1883 is now complete , and the work is ready for the press .
The amount of matter is estimated to require , if printed , three quarto volumes of the usual size .
The extraction of the titles , the preparation of the work for the press , and the correction of the proofs of this work , which is really of international importance , have all along been done at the sole charge of the Royal Society ; but the printing of the volumes which have already been published has been done at the Stationery Office , by authority of the Lords of the Treasury , and the , proceeds of the sale have been paid in to the Treasury .
The Council have applied to the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty 's Treasury to sanction the printing of the last decade in a similar manner , and it is hoped that the application may be favourably entertained .
In the year 1882 a change was made in the amount and mode of administration of the Grant , which for a considerable time before had been voted annually by Parliament for scientific research .
Since that year the annual grant has been one of \#163 ; 4,000 , which has been administered by the former Government Grant Committee , with the addition of certain ex-oficio members , mostly the Presidents of certainr scientific Societies .
Meetings of this large Committee , consisting usually of about 50 members , have been held twice a year , the various applications for aid from the Grant to enable the applicant to carry out investigations explained by him having been previously discussed in meetings of three , or latterly two , Sub-Committees , into which the whole Committee was divided , and then been submitted to the General Committee for confirmation or modification .
In the discussion of these Grants , the Government received the benefit of the gratuitous services of a large number of men of the highest distinction in science .
In the large Sub-Committees , however , it necessarily happened that of the members present only a fraction would be likely to be conversant with the particular branch of science to which any particular application belonged ; and the Council thought that the time of the members might be economised , and at the same time a more efficient discussion of the Grants secured , by arranging the applications under a number of sub-divisions , and assigning the discussion of these to a corresponding number of Boards formed out of the General Committee .
It was thought that a good ?
deal of the discussion of the applications in the several branches might be carried on by correspondence among the members of the respective Boards , so that one or two meetings of each Board might suffice .
If s.ome trouble ^vere thus saved to the members of the , Presidents .
1888 .
] Committee in regard to personal attendance at long meetings , there would probably be more expenditure of time in the way of correspondence , and it was thought that one meeting of the General Committee in the year would in most cases suffice .
To meet pressing cases in the interval , it was suggested that a limited sum might be placed by the General Committee at the disposal of the Council of the Royal Society .
There are farther provisions for forming a reserve fund of not more than \#163 ; 2,000 to meet special objects involving unusual expenditure , and for holding in reserve out of the money available for any one year enough to meet annual grants of limited amount made for a period not exceeding three years , the future grants being contingent on the receipt by the Committee of satisfactory evidence of progress in the inquiry .
The new regulations , of which t have merely given a slight sketch , have been communicated to the Treasury , and will come into operation next year .
The Krakatoa Committee have now completed their work , and the volume which is the outcome of their labours is in the hands of the public .
It has been favourably noticed in more than one quarter .
The Society is much indebted to those Fellows and other gentlemen who discussed and reported on the different subjects into which the whole inquiry was divided , and to Mr. Symons , who was the first to propose that the materials should be collected , and to whose unwearied labour as Chairman of the Committee , director of the correspondence , and editor of the volume , the successful accomplishment of the undertaking is largely due .
A comprehensive and digested account of that extraordinary volcanic explosion , remarkable both for its magnitude and the striking disturbances and other phenomena attending or following it , is now placed within easy reach of the ordinary reader , and will go down to posterity , whereas , had the various accounts remained in their isolated form , they would many of them have perished , and the remainder could not have been brought together without a most laborious search .
It must be a great satisfaction to my predecessor in this chair to remember that he urged upon the Council the importance of collecting the facts before the materials should have become dissipated , and while the freshness of men 's recollection of the event kept up a lively interest in all that belonged to it .
The Royal Society is in possession of some important standards for the safe keeping of which we are responsible .
Parliamentary copies of the standard yard and standard pound have been entrusted to our custody ; and we have also a standard measure of length known as Sir George Schuckburgh 's scale , with reference to which the length of the seconds ' pendulum for Greenwich has been determined by Rater and Sabine .
This length , as determined by experiment , has been defined with reference to the interval from the 0 to the 39 and E 2 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , 40-inch graduations on the scale ; but no exact comparison has hitherto been made between the length of this portion of the scale and the national yard , and such a comparison is no easy matter .
It happens that Commandant Deforges has been engaged in determining the length of the seconds ' pendulum at Greenwich with reference to the French standard metre ; and just before his return to Paris he came to our meeting , and offered to take charge , of tho scale , bring it with him to Paris , and there determine the length of the part of the scale used by Kater and Sabine with reference to the metre , for doing which he has all the requisite appliances ; and as we know the ratio of the metre to the yard , the length of the seconds ' pendulum as determined by Kater and Sabine would thus be known accurately with reference to the standard yard .
It seemed to me that so important a scale should hardly be sent away , even though in the care of so experienced a physicist , without the authority of the Council , and without an outer case being made for its box , which there was not time to get ready .
The authority of the Council has since been obtained , and it fortunately happens that one of the assistants at the Greenwich Observatory is going to Paris , who will take charge of thd scale .
Thus by the kind proposal of Commandant Deforges , we may shortly hope to have an authentic comparison of the length of the seconds ' pendulum as measured by Kater and Sabine with the standard English yard .
At the time of the anniversary last year , some of the reports of the observers who went to Grenada to observe the Total Solar Eclipse of August , 1886 , had been sent in , and I mentioned that it seemed desirable , for convenience of reference at a future time , that the different reports should come out together , instead of being published in a scattered form , provided at least that the waiting for the later reports should not cause too much delay .
I regret to say that the completion of the reports has been delayed in part by the illness of one of the observers , but I have every hope that they will all be in by Christmas , and I do not anticipate that any long time will elapse before they will be in some form in the hands of the public .
The time is well within our recollection when the occurrence of the solar prominences seen in total eclipses first attracted the attention of astronomers , and when , for observations bearing on their nature , we had to wait for the rare and brief glimpses which , clouds permitting , were afforded by total eclipses .
Now , however , thanks to the method of observation devised independently by Lockyer and Janssen , they may be studied at any time .
It would obviously be a great advantage if a similar study could be made of the corona ; for though we cannot expect to obtain a picture of it equal to that which may be got during a total eclipse , yet if a fairly good picture could be obtained from time to time , we might thereby be enabled to learns President 's .
1888 .
] more about the history of its changes than could be got by observations extending over a lifetime if restricted to total eclipses .
Some observations were made during the partial phases of the last total eclipse with the view of throwing light on the prospect of success .
Notwithstanding the unpromising nature of the results obtained ) I have reason for hoping that the desired object may yet be accomplished .
In addressing you last year , that year which will be memorable as the Jubilee of the reign of our beloved Sovereign , I alluded briefly to the progress which science had made in the last half century , and ventured to indicate one or two directions in which it seemed to me possible that a very great addition to our physical knowledge might some day be reached .
I will not to-day venture to look so far ahead ; but the mention of a total eclipse leads me to refer to some theories now before the scientific world which are likely to undergo full discussion and further examination in the near future , with the probable result of a pretty general agreement as to their acceptance or rejection .
It is now many years since Dr. Huggins discovered the peculiar character of the spectra of the nebulas , spectra which he found to consist mainly of bright lines , indicating that what we see is an incandescent gas .
The natural supposition to make at the time was that those distant masses of matter consisted of incandescent gas , of which the luminosity was in some way kept up , probably as a result of condensation .
But the researches of Mr. Lockyer , as described by him in the Bakerian lecture which he delivered last spring , and in part in a previous paper communicated shortly before the last anniversary , have led him to take a different view of the constitution of nebulas .
According to the theory advanced by him , the mass of a nebula consists mainly of meteorites , which are constantly coming into collision here and there ; and the glowing gas the existence of which the spectroscope reveals , is merely a portion of the matter , volatilised by the heat of collision .
According to the former view therefore , the nebula consists of glowing gas , not yet condensed into a solid or liquid form , possibly in a condition even more elementary than that of the so-called elements that we know on earth ; according to the latter it consists mainly of discrete portions of solid matter , and the glowing gas does not consist of the same matter permanently glowing , but is continually supplied afresh by fresh collisions .
A similar theory is applied to explain the self-luminosity of the nucleus , and sometimes the very root of the tail , of comets .
A comet is regarded as a swarm of meteorites , moving in orbits not greatly differing from one another ; and as the swarm approaches the sun collisions become more frequent , .
, and individually more potent , from an increase in the velocities differential as well as absolute ; and 54 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , a portion of matter is volatilised and rendered incandescent .
As to the tail , the theory long ago suggested by Sir John Herschel has always seemed to me by far the most probable of those that have been advanced , namely , that it is due to the propulsion of excessively attenuated matter , owing to a repulsive force , probably of electrical origin , emanating from the sun .
This view seems to be adopted both by Mr. Lockyer and Dr. Huggins ; and the latter gentleman in an earlier Bakerian lecture has suggested a new theory of the corona\#151 ; the corona as distinguished from the prominences-\#151 ; namely , that it is projected from the sun by molar forces due to the tremendous state of turmoil , in which we have very strong reason for believing that the matter composing the sun exists , but of matter actually propelled from the sun by a repulsive force in the manner of the bails of comets .
Daring as some of these speculations may appear to be , there seems a great deal to recommend them , and the whole subject is one of extreme interest at the present day .
But I must not take up your time longer by dwelling on so special a subject ; I proceed to matters more particularly connected with the occasion on which we are assembled .
The Council have awarded the Copley Medal of the year to my predecessor in this chair , Mr. Huxley , for his investigations on the morphology and histology of vertebrate and invertebrate animals , and for his services to biological science in general during many past years .
These subjects lie so entirely out of the range of my own studies that I need hardly say that in attempting to give some idea of the more salient features of his investigations I am dependent upon the kindness of biological friends .
During the fifteen or twenty years which preceded the publication of Darwin 's famous work , the ' Origin of Species , ' the views and methods of comparative anatomists underwent a most marked change .
Without that change biologists would have been far less prepared to accept Mr. Darwin 's work , and , what is even more important , would have been unprepared to make use of that work as a light enabling them to carry on the remarkable researches which have so brilliantly characterised the progress of biology during the last quarter of a century .
That change was effected chiefly by the labours first of Johannes Muller , and subsequently of Huxley in this country , and of Gegenbaur in Germany .
The labours of these men opened out the right road of morphological inquiry .
It is not , perhaps , too much to say that Mr. Huxley 's treatment of his subject in his ' Morphology of Cephalous Mollusca ' was to many young morphologists little short of a revelation , and all his other works of the same period , such as that on the hydrozoa and on tunicates , and latter still his treatment of the vertebrate skull and skeleton , and arthropoda produced in varying degree a like effect .
President 's Address .
1888 .
] Closely allied to , or rather forming part of , his morphological labours are his numerous palaeontological researches , carried out for the most part while he was palaeontologist to the Geological Survey , researches characterised by the same clear moiphological insight , researches which have been , as profitable to animal morphology as useful to the geologist .
The most important are perhaps those on the remarkable reptiles of the Elgin Sandstones and on the Dinosauria ; but many others have great value , and his Anniversary Address to the Geological Society , in 1870 , made its mark .
Though his career has been in the main that of a morphologist , he has through the common ground of histology given considerable help to physiology .
An early paper by him 'On the Cell-Theory , ' did much to clear away erroneous notions concerning the relations of structure to the actions of living beings .
His article on ' Tegumentary Organs ' was a great step onward as regards both morphology and histology , and still remains a classical work ; while , by other papers and in various ways , he has contributed to the progress of histology and physiology .
' But however important Mr. Huxley 's original contributions to the advancement of our scientific knowledge have been , we should form a very inadequate idea of his benefits to the cause of science if we did not bear in mind also his singular ability and effectiveness as an expositor of science to the people , and the powerful influence he has exerted in the improvement of the teaching of biology in its widest sense in this country .
Indeed , it is not too much to say that the remarkable improvement which has taken place within the last few years must be ascribed either directly or indirectly to his influence , and has been in many cases due to his initiation .
The Rumford Medal has been awarded to Professor Pietro Tacchini for important and long-continued investigations , which have largely advanced our knowledge of the physics of the sun .
Professor Tacchini occupies a foremost place among those who have paid special attention to the physics of the sun .
Since 1870 he has unceasingly observed , first at Palermo , and afterwards at Rome , the solar prominences .
The information at our disposal at the present time , both as regards their distribution , their spectra , and the changes which take place in them , and their connexion with other solar phenomena , rests to a large extent upon his individual efforts .
His memoirs on this subject are very numerous .
He has been engaged in the observation of four total solar eclipses , and from some of the phenomena therein observed has drawn the important conclusion that many of the so-called prominences are really descending currents .
A Royal Medal has been awarded to Sir Ferdinand von Mueller for his long services in Australian exploration , and for his investigations of the flora of the Australian continent .
Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , For more than forty years von Mueller has been working , without intermission , at scientific botany and its practical illustrations .
As a botanical traveller and collector , he has , to quote the words of Sir Joseph Hooker , " personally explored more of the Australian continent than any other botanist , except Allan Cunningham .
" No one has investigated the Australian flora and the geographical distribution of its components with so much perseverance and success , and no one has enriched our herbaria , laboratories , and gardens with materials for study to so great an extent .
The eleven volumes of the 'Fragmenta Phytographias Australia ' contain the descriptions of a great series of new plants , and the unrestricted communication of his collections and observations to the late Mr. Bentham rendered possible the preparation of the ' Flora Australiensis , ' in seven volumes , the only account of the vegetation of any large continental area which has at present been completed .
He has especially devoted himself to the elucidation of the most difficult , though most characteristic groups of the Australian flora ; and as a result of his labours in this direction , his ' Eucalyptographia ' may be more particularly mentioned , a work which will always be the standard of nomenclature for the intricate genus Eucalyptus .
Of a similar character are his .
descriptions and illustrations of the ' Myoporineous Plants of Australia , ' and his * Iconography of the Genus Acacia .
' To him is also due the foundation of the Government Herbarium at Melbourne , the first great botanical collection formed in the southern hemisphere , and the future centre of all scientific work on the Australasian flora .
A Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Osborne Reynolds for his investigations in mathematical and experimental physics , and on the application of scientific theory to engineering .
Professor Reynolds was among the first to refer the repulsion exhibited in that remarkable instrument of Mr. Crookes 's , the radiometer , to a change in the molecular impact of the rarefied gas consequent upon the slight change of temperature of the movable body due to the radiation incident upon it .
and in an important paper published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1879 , he deduced from theoretical considerations the conclusion that similar phenomena might be expected to be observed in bodies surrounded by a gas of comparatively large density , provided their surfaces were very small .
He verified this anticipation by producing on silk fibres , surrounded by hydrogen at the atmospheric pressure , impulsions similar to those which in a high vacuum affect the relatively large disks of the radiometer .
In an important paper published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1883 , he has given an account of an investigation , both theoretical and experimental , of the circumstances which determine whether .the Presidents Address .
1888 .
] motion of water shall be direct or sinuous , or , in other words , regular and stable , or else eddying and unstable .
The dimensions of the terms in the equations of motion of a fluid when viscosity is taken into account involve , as had been pointed out , the conditions of dynamical similarity in geometrically similar systems in which the motion is regular ; but when the motion becomes eddying it seemed no longer to be amenable to mathematical treatment .
But Professor Reynolds has shown that the same conditions of similarity hold good , as to the average effect , even when the motion is of the eddying kind ; and moreover that if in one system the motion is on the border between steady and eddying , in another system it will also be on the border , provided the system satisfies the above conditions of dynamical as well as geometrical similarity .
This is a matter of great practical importance , because the resistance to the flow of water in channels and conduits usually depend mainly on the formation of eddies ; and though we cannot determine mathematically the actual resistance , yet the application of the above proposition leads to a formula for the flow , in which there is a most material reduction in the number of constants for the determination of which we are obliged to have recourse to experiment .
There are various other investigations of Professor Reynolds 's which time would not allow me to enter into , and I therefore merely mention his investigation of the relation between rolling friction and the distortion produced by the rolling body on the surface on which it rests , that of the efEect of the change of temperature with height above the surface of the ground on the audibility of sounds and his explanation of the effect of lubrication as depending on the viscosity of the lubricant .
The Davy Medal has been awarded to Mr. Crookes for his investigations on the behaviour of substances under the influence of the electric discharge in a high vacuum .
Mr. Crookes 's remarkable series of researches which conducted him to the invention of the radiometer led him to work with excessively high vacua .
In connexion with this he found that an electric discharge in such vacua is capable of exciting effects of phosphorescence apparently quite different in their origin from those produced in the ordinary way by such discharges .
The latter are clearly referable to the action of the ethereal undulations which are propagated from the seat of the discharge .
But the former involve in some way the effect of the actual transference of the molecules of ponderable matter .
These phenomena , in the hands of Mr. Crookes , opened up a new means of discrimination between different bodies , and he has applied them as a test for the discrimination of groups of rare earths , not yet fully investigated .
The test went hand in hand with processes of chemical separation .
But here a great difficulty Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , presented itself .
So very closely allied in their chemical properties are the members of the groups , that it was only by an excessively tedious and laborious system of fractional precipitation that Mr. Crookes was able to effect a pretty fair separation .
Even still , the separate existence of some members of the groups is more or less problematical .
It is for these most painstaking researches that the medal has been awarded .
The existence , or apparent existence , of so many earths of such close chemical relationship led Mr. Crookes to speculate on the possibility that after all the molecules of what is deemed a chemical element may not be absolutely alike , as chemists have almost universally believed , but only very approximately so , and that what is deemed the molecular weight of the substance may really be that of the average of its molecules .
Should such groups exist , it is conceivable that by processes of very delicate chemical separation they might be split up again into sub-groups , the molecules of which still more nearly match one another ; so that according to this view the number of groups into which an element , or what is deemed such , might be split up , not , be it observed , by any dissociation , but merely by a sorting of the molecules which are very nearly alike , may be somewhat indefinite .
Chemists will not probably be disposed to give up the idea of the perfect similarity of the individual molecules of elementary bodies ; but it is surely legitimate for one who has worked so assiduously at these difficult separations to suggest , merely as a matter for chemists to think about , a possible view of the nature of elements different from that to which they have been accustomed .
The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were then read , and Sir James Coekle and Professor Rucker having been , with the consent of the Society , nominated Scrutators , the votes of the Fellows present were taken , and the following were declared duly elected as Council and Officers for the ensuing year:\#151 ; President.\#151 ; Professor George Gabriel Stokes , M.A. , D.C.L. , LL.
