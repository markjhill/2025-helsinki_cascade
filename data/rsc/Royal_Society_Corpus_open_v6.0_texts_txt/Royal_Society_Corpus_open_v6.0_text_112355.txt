seemed to be a tower of rose-coloured clouds .
The colour was most beautiful more beautiful than any rose-colour I ever saw ; indeed I know of no natural object or colour to which it can be , with justice , compared .
Though one has to describe it as rose-coloured , yet in truth it was very different from any colour or tint I ever saw before .
This protuberance extended from the right of the upper limb , and was visible for six minutes .
In five seconds after this was visible , a much broader and shorter protuberance appeared at the left side of the upper limb .
This seemed to be composed of two united together .
In colour and aspect it exactly resembled the long one .
This second protuberance gradually sank down as the sun continued to fall behind the moon , and in three minutes it had disappeared altogether .
A few seconds after it had sunk down there appeared at the lower corresponding limb ( the right inferior corner ) a similar protuberance , which grew out as the eclipse proceeded .
This also seemed to be a double protuberance , and in size and shape very much resembled the second one ; that is , its breadth very much exceeded its height .
In colour , however , this differed from either of the former ones .
Its left edge was a bright blue , like a brilliant sapphire with light thrown upon it ; next to that was the so-called rose-colour , and , at the right corner , a sparkling ruby tint .
This beautiful protuberance advanced at the same rate that the sun had moved all along , when suddenly it seemed to spread towards the left , until it ran around one-fourth of the circle , making a long ridge of the rosecoloured masses .
As this happened , the blue shade disappeared .
In about twelve seconds the whole of this ridge vanished , and gave place to a rough edge of brilliant white light , and in another second the sun had burst forth again .
In the meantime the long , rose-coloured protuberance on the upper right limb had remained visible ; and though it seemed to be sinking into the moon , it did not disappear altogether until the lower ridge had been formed and had been visible for two seconds .
This long protuberance was quite visible to the naked eye , but its colour could not be detected except through the telescope .
To the naked eye it simply appeared as a little tower of white light standing on the dark edge of the moon .
The lower protuberance appeared to the naked eye to be a notch of light in the dark edge of the moon-not a protuberance , but an indentation .
In shape the long protuberance resembled a goat 's horn .
As I have not time to attempt an elaborate drawing of these objects , I content myself with enclosing to your Lordship two pages from my rough note-book , showing the sketches taken at the moment .
Though the darkness was by no means so great as I had expected , I was unable to mark the protuberances in my note-book without the aid of a lantern , which the sailors lit when the eclipse becane total .

One planet ( Venus ?
) was very brilliant .
Its altitude at 11 3111 0 was 30§ 32 ' ( Carey 's Government Sextant , no error ) , and its distance from the nearest limb of the moon was 37§ 28 ' .
The altitude of the lower limb of the moon at 1 32 " 08 was 66§ 30 ' .
On board the ' Rifleman ' the fowls and pigeons went to roost , but the cattle showed no signs of uneasiness ; they were lying down at the time .
Whatever interest the foregoing observations may have for men of science , I am happy to be able to report that Capt. Reed has added to his public services by seizing this opportunity for determining the exact longitude of Barram Point .
Navigators have long been anxious to fix the precise longitude of some point along the coast of Borneo , and the event of yesterday has probably accomplished this .
When Capt. Reed 's calculations have been finally reduced , he will , no doubt , communicate them to the head of his department ; and in the meantime he has kindly undertaken to place in a cover , directed to your Lordship , the true time as worked out from the observations , so that the times given in this despatch may be corrected before the despatch is used .
The time given in this despatch was taken from one of Parkinson and Frodsham 's Government pocket chronometers , No. 1887 .
As I believe we were the nearest group of observers to the Equator , and as the other conditions were unusually favourable for our work , I venture to hope that even the inadequate and very unscientific account I have given may prove to be of some interest to your Lordship and to the men of science in England .
Before closing my despatch I received from Capt. Reed the error of the chronometer-watch used for taking the time .
It was fast on the mean time at Barram Point oh 41 8s7 .
I have the honour to he , My Lord , Your Lordship 's most obedient humble Servant , ( Signed ) J. POPE IHENNESSY , Governor of Labuan , and Consul-General in the Island of Borneo .
T'o the Right Honourable Lord Stanley , M.P. , Secretary of State for Foreign jffairs .
[ Note.-The phenomenon of the sun 's crescent reflected on to the disk of the moon would seem to have been something accidental , perhaps ( if seen by the writer only ) a mere ghost , depending on a double reflectio.n between the glasses of his instrument .
The figure represents the " reflected " image as in the same position as the crescent itself , not reversed , indicating either a refraction or a double reflectiono The slender beams of light or shade shooting out from the horns of the crescent would seem to admit of easy explanation , supposing them to have been of the nature of sunbeams , depending upon the illumination of the atmosphere of the earth by the sun 's rays .
The perfect shadow , or umbra , would be a cone circumscribing both sun and moon , and having its vertex far below the observer 's horizon .
Within this cone there would be no illumination of the atmosphere , but outside it a portion of the sun 's rays would be scattered in their progress through the air , giving rise to a faint illumination .
When the total phase drew near , the nearer surface of the shadow would be at no great distance from the observer ; the further surface would be remote .
Attend in the first instance to some one plane passing through the eye and cutting the shadow transversely , and in this plane draw a straight line through the eye , touching the section of the cone which bounds the shadow ; and then imagine other lines drawn through the eye a little inside and outside this .
In the former case the greater part of the line , while it lay within the lower regions of the atmo- .
sphere , would be in shadow , the only part in sunshine being that reaching from the eye to the nearer surface of the shadow ; but in the latter case the line would be in sunshine all along .
In the direction of the former line , therefore , there would be but little illumination arising from scattered light , while in the direction of the latter the illumination would , comparatively speaking , be considerable .
In crossing the tangent there would be a rapid change of illuminiation .
Now pass on to three dimensions .
Instead of a tangent line we shall have a tangent pla.ne , and there will of course be two such planes , touching the two sides of the cone respectively .
Each of these will be projected on the visual sphere into a great circle , a common tangent to the two small circles , which are the projections of the sun and moon .
In crossing either of these there will be a rapid change of illumination ( feeble though it be at best ) which will be noticed , According as the observer mentally regards darkness as the rule and illumination as the feature , or illumination as the rule and darkness as the feature , he will describe what he sees as a beam or a shadow .
The direction of these beams or shadows given by theory , as just explained , agrees very well with the drawing sent by Governor Hennessy , which does not represent the left-hand beam so distinctly divided as it appears in the woodcut .
The times mentioned in the above despatch have not been corrected for the error of the chronometer-watch .
In the following Tables , furnished by Staff Commander Reed , the corrected mean times alone are printed .
The observations of time by Capt. Reed , Mr. Ray , and Mr. Doorly were made by Government pocket chronometer No. 1887 , which was fast on mean time of place oh 4m 8's7 ; those by Mr. Ellis by a gold pocket watch , compensation balance , which was fast on mean time of place 011 17m 2S7 ; those belonging to the meteorological observations with a pocket watch , which was fast on mean time of place O0 2 " 47S'9 .

made August 18th , 1868 , along the coast of Borneo , in a Letter addressed to H.M. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by His Excellency J. PorE HENNESSY , Governor of Labuan .
" Communicated by the Right Hon. Lord STANLEY , F.R.S. Received October 8 , 1868 .
Government Ilouse , Labuan , 19th August , 1868 .
MY LORD , -Seeing the interest which Her Majesty 's Government and the scientific public in England have shown in the remarkable eclipse which occurred yesterday , I took steps to make such observations as I could along the coast of Borneo , and I have now the honour of laying them before your Lordship .
After passing from the Gulf of Siam across the China Sea , the line of total eclipse passed across the Island of Borneo , touching the colony of Labuan on the east , and stretching not far from the River Bintulu on the west .
Having ascertained that the precise centre of this band of total eclipse would be found at Barram Point ( a place within my jurisdiction as ConsulGeneral in the Island of Borneo ) , I made arrangements with Capt. Reed , of H.M.S. 'Rifleman , ' to take my observations at that spot .
As that well-known officer has been for years in charge of the important survey of the China seas , his ship afforded special facilities for such an expedition .
We left Labuan on Monday at noon , and arrived off Barram Point at five o'clock next morning , Tuesday the 18th .
A tent was fitted up on an open space between a Casuarina-plantation and the sea , and the following corps of observers landed at ten o'clock : Captain Reed , Lieutenant Ray , Lieutenant Ellis , and myself , our four telescopes being securely adjusted on large tripod stands manufactured for the occasion .
Four 6ther officers landed with us:-Dr .
O'Connor to note the physiological phenomena , Mr. Wright to watch the magnetic needle , and Mr. Doyley and Mr. Roughton to mark the time .
A few intelligent sailors were in attendance to assist the observers , if necessary .
Mr. Petley and the other officers left on board the ' Rifleman ' had charge of the barometrical and thermometrical observations , and they were also directed by Captain Reed to watch the vibrations , if any , in the magnetic compasses .
Before leaving the ship I made some observations upon the solar spots .
At 8 A.M. I found some spots in a line from east to south b. The upper * It did not seem necessary to reproduce the sketch sent by the author , as the position of the spots may be represented by conceiving the next figuire to be turned round through about 65 ?
in the direction of the hands of a watch .
Governor Hennessy 's Observations on the spot was surrounded by a penumbra stretching towards the centre of the sun , the second spot was small and sharply defined , the third spot , or group of spots , had a penumbra , and the fourth spot was surrounded by a space of very brilliant light .
These spots I subsequently refer to as Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .
Moving with the rotation of the sun , the line of spots gradually became horizontal , and at 12 o'clock ( noon ) they lay thus ( see fig. 1 ) .
Fig. 1 .
IX the moon with the penumbra of spot No. 1 .
At 121 25m 25`'5 contact with left of No. 1 spot .
At 12 " 26m " 58s the spot was completely covered .
During all this time no vibrations or change of any kind was noticed in the magnetic needle .
At 12n 44dm 15S the moon 's limb had advanced to the sun 's centre .
At 1 " 10 " 47'*5 spot No. 2 was passed , and at I " 18 ' " 6 ' spot No. 3 was passed .
All this time not the smallest magnetic change could be noticed .
At Lh 2"7 22s the total eclipse took place , and lasted for 6 minutes and 13 seconds ; the first appearance of the sun 's limb from behind the moon being at 1 " 33 ' 35s .
The spots reappeared as follows : No. 1 at lh 4d1 " 128 2 , , 2 33 14 3 , , 2 39 48 4 , ,2 48 7 ; and at 21 52 " 39s'8 the last contact of the edge of the sun and moon was noticed .
During the 6"m and 13 of total eclipse not the slightest change of any kind could be observed in the magnetic needle , nor did it move or vibrate in any way on the appearance of the solar spots .
To complete the negative results of our magnetic observations , I have only to add that the officers who had been directed to watch the ship 's compasses report that they could not detect the slightest movement of any kind .
I now proceed to describe the general phenomena of the eclipse ; and in doing so I confine myself to copying from the rough notes I took at Barram Point , and from the note-books of Capt. Reed and his officers , also taken on the spot .
As the mail closes for Singapore to-morrow morning , I have not time to arrange the materials before me in anything like scientific order ; and the absence of any works of reference ( we have not even this year 's supplement to the Nautical Almanac ) renders me still less able to do justice to the facts we collected .
We were very fortunate in the weather .
The day was bright and clear ; not a cloud was near the sun .
A few round white clouds that lay on the horizon hardly moved .
There was a slight breeze from W.S.W. The sea was breaking heavily on the shore , and it had a slight brownish bluish tinge all over , except where the white breakers approached the land .
The grove of Casuarina trees behind us had the same deep-green colour which they always exhibit on a fine day in the tropics .
A few swallows were skimming about high in the air .
We also noticed some dragonflies , butterflies , and a good many specimens of a large heavy fly like a drone-bee .
When we left the ship at 10 o'clock the barometer was 30'00 ; the mean of the two thermometers in the deck chart-room ( in the shade ) was 85 ?
; the dry thermometer exposed to the sun was 91 ?
, and the wet thermometer exposed to the sun was 83 ?
'5 .
During the progress of the eclipse the barometer fell steadily .
At 121 0O ' 15s , first contact , it was 29-98 .
At 12h 26 " ' 0 it fell to 29-96 in .
, 12 44 15 it was 29-96 , ,1 0 0 , 29-94 1 15 0 , , 29-93 Total , , 1 27 22 , , 29-92 eclipse .

, without any change whatever from 10 o'clock till the close of the eclipse .
At the close of the eclipse , 2 " 52 " 39S'8 , it rose to 86 ? .
The dry-bulb thermometer , hung in the sunlight , stood at 91 ?
at the first contact .
G At 12 " 44 " 15s it fell to 900 , ,1 0 0 , 88 1 , 15 0 , 87 Total f1 27 22 , , 85 eclipse.l , , 1 33 35 , , 85 , 20O itroseto 91 , , 2 30 0 , 96 , 2 52 39-8 , 96 It thus appears that the thermometer fell from 91 ?
to 85 ?
as the moon was covering the sun , and that it rose from 85 ?
to 96 ?
as the sun was reappearing .
The wet-bulb thermometer fell from 80 ?
'5 to 83 ?
at the total eclipse , and rose to 89 ?
at the termination of the whole eclipse .
Ten minutes before the total eclipse there seemed to be a luminous crescent reflected upon the dark body of the moon .
In another minute a long beam of light , pale and quite straight , the rays diverging at a small angle , shot out from the westerly corner of the sun 's crescent .
At the same time Mr. Ellis noticed a corresponding dark band , or shadow , shooting down from the east corner of the crescent ( fig. 2 ) .
Fig. 2 .
/ I. / .
At this time the sea assumed a darker aspect , and a well-defined green band was seen distinctly around the horizon .
The temperature had fallen * See note at the end .
and the wind had slightly freshened .
The darkness then came on with great rapidity .
The sensation was as if a thunderstorm was just about to break , and one was startled on looking up to see not a single cloud overhead .
The birds , after flying very low , disappeared altogether .
The dragonflies and butterflies disappeared , and the large drone-like flies all collected on the ceiling of the tent and remained at rest .
The crickets and Cicadre in the jungle began to sound ; and some birds , not visible , also began to twitter in the jungle .
The sea grew darker , and immediately before the total obscuration the horizon could not be seen .
The line of round white clouds that lay near the horizon changed their colour and aspect with great rapidity .
As the obscuration took place they all became of a dark purple , heavy looking , and with sharply defined edges ; they then presented the appearance of clouds close to the horizon after sunset .
It seemed as if the sun had set at the four points of the horizon .
The sky was of a dark leaden blue , and the trees looked almost black .
The faces of the observers looked dark , but not pallid or unnatural .
The moment of maximum darkness seemed to be immediately before the total obscuration ; for a few seconds nothing could be seen except objects quite close to the observers .
Suddenly there burst forth a luminous ring around the moon .
This ring was composed of a multitude of rays , quite irregular in length and in direction ; from the upper and lower parts they extended in bands to a distance more than twice the diameter of the sun .
Other bands appeared to fall towards one side ; but in this there was no regularity , for bands near them fell away apparently towards the other side .
When I called attention to this , Lieut. Ray said , " Yes , I see them ; they are like horses ' tails ; " and they certainly resembled masses of luminous hair in complete disorder .
1 have said these bands appeared to fall to one side ; but I do not mean that they actually fell or moved in any way during the observation .
If the atmosphere had not been perfectly clear , it is possible that the appearance they presented would lead to the supposition that they moved ; but no optical delusion of the kind was possible under the circumstances .
During the second when the sun was disappearing , the edge of the luminous crescent became broken up into numerous points of light .
The moment these were gone , the rays I have just mentioned shot forth , and at the same time we noticed the sudden appearance of the rose-coloured protuberances .
The first of these was about one-sixth of the sun 's diameter in length , and about one-twenty-fourth part of the sun 's diameter in breadth .
It all appeared at the same instant , as if a veil had suddenly melted away from before it .
