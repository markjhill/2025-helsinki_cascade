On a Method of Freezing at a distance .

[ Phil. Trans. 1813 , p. 71 .
] The method here described by the author , is performed by means of an instrument , to which he gives the name of Cryophorus , expressing its office of frost-bearer .
It consists of a tube , which may be two or three feet long , or even more , terminated by a ball at each end .
One of these balls contains a small quantity of water to be frozen , and the rest of the instrument is as complete a vacuum as can be obtained .
In making this instrument , one of the balls terminates in a capillary tube ; and when water has been admitted into the other , it is boiled over a lamp till all the air is expelled ; and while the stream is still issuing with violence through the capillary extremity , the end of it is held in the flame of the lamp , till in proportion as the force of the steam diminishes , the heat acquires power to seal the tube hermetically .
When such an instrument has been successfully exhausted , if the empty ball be placed in a freezing mixture of salt and snow , the water contained in the opposite ball will be frozen solid in a very few minutes .
The first vapour being condensed by the common effect of cold , is immediately succeeded by a fresh emission , with proportional reduction of temperature ; so that heat is continually withdrawn , or cold generated at a distance by the freezing cause .
