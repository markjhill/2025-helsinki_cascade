The author has found that the constant battery , of which he described the construction in a former communication to the Royal Society , might be rendered not only perfectly steady in its action , but also very powerful ; as well as extremely efficacious and convenient for all the purposes to which the common voltaic battery is usually applied .
With this view he places the cells which form the battery in two parallel rows , consisting of ten cells in each row , on a long table , with their siphon-tubes arranged opposite to each other , and hanging over a small gutter , placed between the rows , in order to carry off the refuse solution when it is necessary to change the acid .
Having observed that the uniformity of action may be completely maintained by the occasional addition of a small quantity of acid , he is able to dispense with the cumbrous addition of thedripping funnel ; an arrangement which admits with facility of any combination of the plates which may be desired .
