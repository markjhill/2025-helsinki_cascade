This is also in agreement with the equation , since the tangent at the point of inflection cuts the X axis at the point \#151 ; \#177 ; n0 , a quantity which is independent of the specific properties of the scattering material .
From similar considerations to those given above , it is possible to calculate the scattering of a-particles in gases , and to deduce the scattering coefficients .
This question is of interest , since for substances of atomic weight comparable with that of the a-particle , the amount of scattering may not be proportional to the atomic weight , a relation which seems to hold fairly well for the heavier atoms so far examined .
A discussion of this will , however , be postponed until the necessary experiments have been carried out .

The Effect of Temperature upon Radioactive Disintegration .

Introduction .
Within the last few years the influence of high temperature on the activity of radium emanation , of the active deposit , and of radium C has been examined in detail by several authors .
The conclusions arrived at have been conflicting , some workers affirming a positive effect of temperature , others denying it .
This lack of agreement is due , however , to a difference in the method of measurement of the active matter under investigation .
Those workers who measured the activity by 7-rays are all agreed that temperature has no effect whatever , while those who measuied by / 3-rays found always an effect of some kind , in many cases of considerable magnitude , and often , indeed , of a very surprising nature .
While , however , the fact that there is a / 3-ray effect is admitted by all , there is still a lack of agreement between the results of the experiments of different workers , and even of different experiments of the same worker , which is hardly to be expected if the effects were due to a definite change in the properties of the disintegrating atoms at high temperatures .
In view , therefore , of the uncertainty which has arisen on a point of such Temperature upon Radioactive Disintegration .
great theoretical importance , a systematic investigation was necessary to obtain definite results , whether positive or negative .
This the author , at the request of Prof. Rutherford , has carried out .
Work on ( 3-Rays.\#151 ; The original experiments of Curie and Danne* showed that the rate of decay of radium C could be altered by subjecting it to temperatures above 630 ' .
Bronson , however , foundf that the more volatile radium B had a longer period of change than radium C , instead of the contrary as previously supposed , and showed that , when this fact is taken into consideration , the anomalies in question are capable of a complete explanation .
Makower , } working with radium emanation inside tubes of sealed quartz , found , however , that the / 3-radiation from radium C was reduced in intensity from 4 to 15 per cent , by heating the tube to temperatures over 1000 ' , the measurements being conducted in the cold .
The effect was temporary only , the normal activity of the tube being reached again after it had been left for an hour at room temperature .
In later experiments with RussS the same author found that , while the / 3-activity of the emanation was distinctly lower at high temperatures than at room temperature , it decayed at 1100 ' at the normal rate .
The / 3-activity of the active deposit on a wire inside a sealed quartz tube showed also a somewhat irregular diminution of from 3 to 15 per cent , for temperatures between 900 ' and 1500 ' .
As a result , measurement of the decay of the active deposit , with the tube at first cold , and subsequently subjected to a high temperature , showed an apparent increase in the rate of _ decay , and vice versed .
Engler , || working on the same lines as Makower and Russ , measured the / 3-activity both of the emanation and of the active deposit during heating and cooling , as well as when a steady temperature had been reached .
With the emanation itself in the quartz tube , a rapid increase in the activity was always observed on heating .
Cooling brought the activity at first below the room temperature value , but after an hour in the cold the activity regained its original value .
In some experiments , cooling did not cause a decrease of the activity below the normal value at all .
Heating the active deposit to 1100 ' or 1200 ' caused a decay more rapid than the normal , which gradually became normal as the heating was maintained .
On cooling , the decay was at first less than , but later increased to , the normal .

Effect of [ Dec. 19 Schmidt and Cermack , * * * S using radium itself as a source of / 3-ray activity showed that , while there is no permanent effect of high temperature on the / 3-radiation , the rays show a somewhat complex sequence of variations of activity , which is explained as being due to changes in their absorption by the preparation itself , ( a ) The first effect of heating to 1000 ' is to liberate the occluded emanation and to volatilise the products radium A , B , and C from the preparation , causing a lessened absorption and consequent sudden increase of / 3-radiation .
( b ) On cooling , the products , all except the emanation , are suddenly absorbed again by the preparation , with a consequent sudden return of the / 3-radiation to its initial value , ( c ) Three hours afterwards a new set of products is produced on the walls of the containing tube from the liberated emanation , which causes the ^-radiation gradually to return to the higher value .
( d)Then over a period of three weeks the liberated emanation decays , while fresh emanation is produced within the solid preparation , producing a gradual decay of the / 3-rays to their initial value .
The explanation ( b ) seems , however , very unlikely , and it will be shown later that the effect described in ( 5 ) and part of the effect described in ( a ) may be obtained in a sealed tube in which no solid matter whatever is present .
Work on y-ltays.\#151 ; The experiments of Bronsonf on the 7-rays from a source of radium , of EnglerJ and of SchmidtS on the 7-rays from radium emanation , from the active deposit and from radium C itself , show conclusively that there is no detectable effect of high temperatures on the intensity or nature of 7-rays .
Eutherford and Petavel|| showed also that the 7-radiation from radium emanation exposed momentarily to a pressure of about 1200 atmospheres and a temperature not lower than 2500 ' , produced by an explosion of cordite , was not altered at the moment of explosion .
A 9 per cent , temporary reduction of the activity found after the explosion was due to a change of distribution of radium C inside the bomb , caused by its volatilisation and subsequent condensation , and was of the amount to be expected theoretically .
It is seen that the point at issue concerns itself entirely with the / 3-rays .
The one abnormality , upon which all experimenters are agreed , is that a temporary increase or decrease of activity takes place at high temperatures , * 'Phys .

] Temperature upon Radioactive Disintegration .
243 the departures from the normal activity disappearing entirely after the source has been kept at room temperature for three hours .
The results of this paper show that this effect is due to a change of distribution of the active matter in the tube .
The conclusion is reached that neither the / 3- nor the 7-ray activities of radium C , of the active deposit , or of the emanation , suffer any change , either in amount of activity or in rate of decay , at high temperatures .
The author has succeeded in obtaining all of the abnormal effects of the workers whose experiments he has repeated .
They can be completely explained by taking into consideration the change in average path of the / 3-rays through the quartz tube containing the active source caused by :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Changes of distribution of radium C inside the tube , arising from the volatilisation of radium C and radium B from the hotter to the cooler part , at all temperatures greater than 300 ' , and especially from 650 ' upwards .

Experimental Disposition .
The electroscope used was of lead , 7*5 cm .
cube , and of 0*3 cm .
wall thickness .
One side , through which the rays passed , was of aluminium , 0*01 cm .
thick .
For 7-ray measurements a thick plate of lead ( 1*8 cm .
) or of iron ( 0*6 cm .
) was placed against this aluminium window .
The furnace consisted of a silica tube 12*5 cm .
long , 2*2 cm .
inside diameter , open at both ends , round which was wound a platinum wire , the whole being jacketed with kieselguhr for thermal insulation .
Temperatures were measured with a Ft\#151 ; Pt-Kh thermo-couple .
Measurements were not carried usually beyond 1150 ' C. , which was reached without any difficulty .
The active material under investigation was in tubes of sealed quartz and mounted centrally in the furnace by means of thin nickel wire .
When thus mounted , there was an unintercepted path between every point of the tube and the electroscope .
Their distance apart was 40 to 60 cm .
3 .
Experiments on Radium C. Pure radium C was deposited on nickel by v. Lerchs method , and the nickel sealed in a thin quartz tube .
The decay of the radiations over a period of three hours was measured , the tube being kept at a temperature of 1150 ' for the first 90 minutes , and at room temperatures for the second .
The / 3-rays were measured over the whole period , the 7-rays only at the high temperatures .
The radiations , whether / 3 or 7 , at high temperatures and 244 Mr. A. S. Russell .
The Effect of [ Dec. 19 low temperatures alike , decayed exponentially , falling to half value in about 19*4 minutes .
In a second experiment the decay of the / 3-rays was measured for 65 minutes at a temperature of 1220 ' , but no difference in the value of the half-value period was obtained .
Neither the / 3- nor the 7-rays of radium C are thus affected by high temperatures .
4 .
Experiments on the Active Deposit .
Purified emanation was forced into a little quartz bulb 0*3 cm .
outside diameter , 0*25 mm. wall thickness , left there four hours , and then pumped out and the bulb sealed off .
Measurements of 7-rays were started after 20 minutes , and continued at intervals for three hours .
Measurements of / 3-rays were started after 85 minutes , and continued for five hours after sealing off .
All the 7-ray observations lie on a continuous curve , the points at high temperatures being in no case abnormal .
Of the 33 points observed , 29 agree with the theoretical values within 1 per cent. , and the other 4 within per cent. The theoretical curve was plotted on the assumption that 11 per cent , of the 7-radiation , capable of penetrating the iron plate 0*6 cm .
thick placed before the electroscope , comes from radium B. This result was kindly supplied me by Messrs. Moseley and Makower , who have been investigating the 7-radiation of radium B in detail .
The radium B 7-rays affect chiefly the initial part of the curve , over which no measurements were taken .
The / 3-ray activity also decays at the theoretical rate at high temperatures ( 1150 ' ) and low temperatures ( 200 ' ) alike , and the amount of activity is unaltered with temperature .
Of the 35 points observed , 2 are within 3 per cent. , 2 within 2 , and the rest within 1 per cent , of the theoretical values .
The rest of this paper deals with the behaviour of the active deposit inside sealed tubes containing radium emanation .

Volatilisation of Radium C inside Quartz Tubes .
A tube of clear quartz , 7*2 cm .
long , diameter of section 0*5 cm .
, and wall thickness 0*04 cm .
, was filled with about 25 millicuries of emanation at a pressure of 20 cm .
of mercury .
It gave a very uniform fluorescence on a zinc sulphide screen , which could be seen even in a fully lighted room when the screen was held in the shadow of the observer .
The tube was then inserted in the furnace , so that one end was just inside , while the other end was in the centre .
The hotter end was at 700 ' , and the cooler about 500 ' .
After live minutes the tube was r* j|P| - . .

' taken out , and its fluorescence on the screen again examined .
The fluorescence was now almost entirely concentrated as a bright green spot not more than a couple of millimetres in diameter at the cooler end , while that from the rest of the tube could only just be seen in the dark room .
The tube was then replaced in the same position as before , but reversed .
After five minutes the whole of the fluorescence was now at the other ( the cooler ) end .
The wrapping of 0-5 mm. lead round the tube did not effect any change in the position of maximum fluorescence .
It must therefore be concluded that radium C is capable of complete volatilisation inside the tube at 700 ' .
This experiment has been repeated with the hotter end of the tube at different temperatures varying from 15 ' to 1000 ' .
With increasing temperatures from 320 ' , the radium C shifts more or less completely to the cooler end of the tube , and the higher the temperature the more quickly is this accomplished .
An exposure for half an hour at 320 ' is sufficient to produce the maximum change .
Below this temperature the fluorescence is not continuous , but consists of bright and dark patches , the cooler half of the tube being always more fluorescent than the other .
The time required to produce a marked change in the fluorescence at these low temperatures is from two to three hours , and therefore makes it difficult to prove whether the radium C is itself volatilised , or whether it is produced in situ by volatilised radium B. Quantitative results were also obtained by means of y-ray measurements .
Let A be the leak in divisions per minute when the cooler ( and therefore more active ) end is nearer the electroscope , B the leak when the activity has been driven by heat to the other end , so as to be about 7 cm .
farther away from the electroscope , then the ratio A/ B serves as a measure of the amount of radium C capable of volatilisation at a given temperature .
For each temperature the leaks A and B were determined twice , so that the radium C was moved bodily along the whole length of tube four times .

The Effect of [ Dec. 19 of experiment gave a value of 1-71 for A/ B. Between 450 ' and 600 ' therefore , a large and increasing percentage of radium C can be volatilised while from 650 ' upwards the volatilisation is complete .
The ratio A/ B for / 3-rays at 650 ' is 6-6 , a result to be expected when it is considered that in addition to a mere distribution change , there is a large effect due to a change in the average path of the rays through the quartz .
The y-ray activity of the tube with the radium C concentrated at one end ( the nearer , let us say ) , measured over a period of three hours in the cold , falls to the normal value to be expected if radium A , radium B , and radium C are iu equilibrium at one end , and the rest of the tube contains emanation only .
Experiments have also demonstrated clearly that from 450 ' onwards the radium C itself is volatilised and not merely grown from radium B. It thus appears that at 650 ' radium B and radium C , and very probably radium A , are completely volatilised in quartz tubes .
Radium B commences to volatilise at room temperature .
Results of a similar character have been obtained with tubes Nos. 1 and 2 : described in the next section .
For the former the ratio A/ B ( / 3-rays ) at 700 ' was 2-78 , at 500 ' 219 , and at 350 ' 118 .
At 700 ' the ratio A/ B for y-rays corresponded to a total shift of the active matter from one end of the tube to the other .
For the latter tube A/ B ( / 3-rays ) was F29 at 700 ' although from its size and shape ( it was a sphere , outer diameter 3 mm. , of uniform wall thickness ) so large a distribution effect is at first sight unexpected .
These results on volatilisation are entirely at variance with those of previous authors , who found that at temperatures of about 900 ' , 600 ' , and 1200 ' , radium A , B , and C respectively are completely removed from a platinum wire .
No explanation of these discordant results need be attempted here , but the lack of agreement between the two sets of experiments is probably due to differences in pressure , and to the shape and nature of the surface on which the active material is deposited .

Experiments with Emanation .
A series*of experiments on the activity of the radium emanation at high temperatures , made in the beginning of the investigation , will now be described .
Two shapes of tubes were used .
They are shown in fig. 1 as they appear after being sealed up .
No. 1 was conical in shape , made of clear quartz , 1 cm .
long , sectional diameter of narrow end 0T cm .

No. 2 was made of quartz , spherical in shape , of outer diameter 0'3 cm .

reached .
It was then kept at this temperature half an hour , cooled to 300 ' over an interval of 45 minutes , and then from 300 ' to 15 ' in about three hours .
The / 3-ray activity was measured every minute .
It was found that the / 3-ray activity increased continuously from room temperature to 600 ' no less than 25 per cent. , decreased sharply between 600 ' and 700 ' to a value 9 per cent , greater than at 15 ' , and remained unchanged from 700 ' to 1100 ' , no matter how long the heating was continued .
The tube was then cooled slowly in the furnace .
The activity remained constant till 700 ' , increased rapidly between 700 ' and 600 ' to its old value 25 per cent , greater than at 15 ' , remained there till 300 ' was reached , and then fell slowly in the course of three hours to the room temperature value .
These processes of heating and cooling were repeated several times .
It was estimated that the critical temperature at which the sudden change in activity occurred was 650 ' .
Measurements of 7-rays in a similar experiment lasting live hours were also carried out .
Details of the heating and cooling , with values of the leaks , are tabulated in Table I. Table I. Leak in divisions per minute .

The Effect of [ Dec. 19 , The emanation tube ( AB nearer the electroscope ) was next supported exactly in the centre of the cross-section of the furnace tube and near one end of it .
It was then heated for an hour at the highest temperature attainable at that point , and cooled slowly over an hour to 250 ' or 300 ' , / 3-ray measurements being made every two or three minutes .
The whole furnace was then turned round , the part C D of the emanation tube being now nearer the electroscope , and the experiment repeated .
The tube was then pushed down the furnace cylinder , and the whole procedure given above ' exactly repeated .
This was done for ten points along the furnace tube .
Let a be the leak with the tube cold , b when the tube attains 300 ' after cooling from the highest temperature , and c when the highest temperature has been reached , then for different distances along the furnace tube ( 12*5 cm .
long ) the following results were obtained , the origin of length being the end of the furnace tube to which the broader end of the emanation tube is nearer , and a being put at 100 throughout .

peratures , from 200 ' to 1100 ' .
The results showed that the hottest part of the furnace from 200 ' to 1100 ' was not in the centre ( i.e. at 6*3 cm .
) , but at a point 7*5 cm .
, identical with the point at which b = c in Table II .
At 1100'* 2 cm .
on either side of this point had a very constant temperature , but this 4 cm .
of very constant temperature decreased to 1 cm .
as the temperature fell to 300 ' .
If , therefore , the centre of the active tube were not situated at this point , but , say , at 0*5 cm .
on either side of it , it would have a constant temperature at 1100 ' .
As this temperature is reduced , however , one end would tend to become hotter than the other , though the differences in temperature would be only of the order of 10 degrees .
When the tube is-placed at greater distances than 2 cm .
from the centre , the difference in temperature between the ends , when the tube has been heated a long time at 1100 ' , is much smaller than it is when it has been cooled to 300 ' , owing to the way in which the furnace cools .
Now it is a fact that radium C concentrates in the cooler end of a tube between 320 ' and 1100 ' , and the more easily the greater the temperature difference between the two ends* The results , therefore , for b and c of Table I receive a full explanation when this volatility is taken into account .

The difference in temperature between AB and CD is less at 1000 ' than at 500 ' .
Therefore b \lt ; c. With CD now nearer , same consideration applies as above , CD is cooler .
Therefore b \gt ; c. It is still conceivable , however , that a real change of / 3-ray activity exists at high temperatures , but that it is masked by this relatively large distribution change .
At points 7*5 and 7*7 cm .
, however , b = c no matter in which direction the emanation tube points towards the electroscope , so this supposition is entirely excluded .
We therefore conclude that , between 300 ' and 1100 ' , there is no effect of temperature upon the / 3-radiation of the emanation .
In general , the order of results whether ct^\gt ; b , b^\gt ; c , etc. , depends not only on the length of the tube , and how it is placed in the furnace , but also on 250 Mr. A. S. Russell .
The Effect of [ Dec. 19 , the winding of the furnace , and whether it is heated quickly or slowly .
It is not at all difficult , even with the tube near the centre of the furnace , to obtain conditions whereby , on heating to 1100 ' and cooling to room temperature , the activity passes through two maxima and minima .
The author has been able to repeat all of the abnormalities in the activity of the emanation found by Engler , and to obtain even some which Engler himself could not repeat .
Moreover , for every experiment in which the activity apparently increases when subjected to a temperature change , an experiment may be devised in which the activity decreases , and vice versa .
7 .
Partition of Homogeneously Distributed Activity .
It still remains to explain why the leaks a and c of Table II differ , which correspond to the / 3-ray activities of the emanation tube at 15 ' and 1100 ' respectively .
It may be seen from Table II that , when the tube is near the centre of the furnace , the leaks differ by a constant amount ( 8 per cent , approximately when AB points towards the electroscope , and about 3 per cent , when CD does ) .
These differences may be explained by a consideration of the partition of radium C inside the tube between the walls and the contained volume .
When an emanation tube has stood at room temperature for three hours , the partition of radium C has attained a steady state .
The larger part of the active material is known to be on the walls , but a small part must be distributed throughout the volume of the tube .
This partition gives the ionisation denoted by a. Heating the tube uniformly beyond 650 ' volatilises radium B and C , so that the partition of radium C is changed .
Prolonged heating at 1100 ' cannot effect the partition further .
This gives the ionisation c. If , now , the tube be suddenly cooled to room temperature , by tipping it out of the furnace on to a cold porcelain plate , the volatilised products are precipitated entirely on the walls , and quite uniformly , as there is no reason , if the tube be properly cooled , why the products should concentrate at one end rather than at another .
7-ray measurements confirm this .
This gives a third partition of radium C ; let it be called d. Each of these partitions gives a different ionisation effect due to / 3-rays , because , under ordinary conditions , the average path of the / 3-rays through the quartz depends upon the character of the partition .
Consider , for example , these types of partition inside a sphere of uniform wall thickness ( 0*025 cm .
, say ) , and internal radius r ( say , 3 mm. ) , mounted symmetrically with regard to the electroscope 30 cm .
away .
We are concerned only with the passage of rays through the hemisphere facing the electroscope .
In partition d , the particles of radium C lie on a sphere of radius r. 1911 .
] Temperature upon Radioactive Disintegration .
251 Partition c , in which the radium C is distributed uniformly throughout the volume , may be approximately represented by a uniform distribution of particles of radium C on an ellipsoid of revolution about a major axis 2 r , the minor axes of length 2 r " lying in a horizontal plane at right angles to the side of the electroscope through which the / 3-rays enter .
Partition a may be represented by a distribution of radium C on a similar ellipsoid with minor axes 2 r ' ( r\gt ; / \gt ; r " ) .
If a section be now cut at right angles to the major axis , and the average distances through the quartz of lines joining all points for the circle and for the two ellipses to the electroscope respectively measured , it is found that the lines from the circle make the largest average intercept on the quartz and those from the ellipse corresponding to the ellipsoid of minor axis 2 r " the least .

D applies to this section applies to any section parallel to it , and therefore to the whole sphere .
Thus , the particles of partition d are intercepted most by the quartz , and those of partition c least .
From this it follows that for tube 2 ionisation c is the greatest of the three , and d the least .
In fig. 2 this is shown more clearly .
AOB represents a horizontal section of the sphere through the centre , CD ( mid-point E ) the electroscope .
The circles inside the sphere a , c , and d , represent the three partitions respectively .
For convenience of making calculations the active matter is supposed concentrated on the circumference of the circle at 12 equidistant points .
In the figure the inner diameter of the section is 3 mm. , the wall thickness 0-25 mm. , and the diameters of circles a , e , and are 2'2 mm. , 252 Mr. A. S. Russell .
The Effect of [ Dec. 19 1-5 mm. , and 3'0 mm. respectively .
CD at its distance from 0 corresponds to the breadth of the electroscope ( 7'5 cm .
) at a distance of 30 cm .
From the point 1 of circle d , three lines are drawn to C , E , and D respectively , and the distance intercepted by the quartz in each case measured .
This is done for all the points of one circle and for all three circles .
Putting now the sum of the 36 distances intercepted by the quartz as 100 for circle a , we get 83 for circle c , and 145 for circle d. This graphical method of solution is , of course , only rough .
It takes no account , for instance , of scattering of the rays by the quartz , which must be not inconsiderable , but it serves to bring out the main result that the average path through the quartz is greatest for the particles on circle d , and least for those on circle c , and to give an idea of the magnitude of these differences .
As regards tube 1 , a change of partition can only effect the ionisation when the axis of the tube points towards the electroscope , and here also When the axis of the tube is at right angles to the line joining the tube to the electroscope , it follows from geometrical observations that ionisations a , c , and d should be equal .
This is what is found by experiment .
Eepetition of the experiment by which ionisation d is obtained does not alter the value of d. Now , if the difference between a and d were due to an atomic change , one would expect that the difference would be proportional to the number of times the experiment had been carried out .
If the tube be heated to temperatures below the volatilisation point of radium C ( 650 ' ) instead of to 1000 ' , the difference between d and a is reduced .
This is simply because partition d is the result of the precipitation on the walls of the tube of completely volatilised radium C. If the tube at 1000 ' be cooled , the partition c is not affected until temperatures of about 300 ' are reached , though probably all of the radium O is solidified at this temperature .
From 300 ' to 15 ' it commences to settle on the walls , and partition results For tube 1 ( parallel to its axis , AB nearer to the electroscope ) a : c : d =100 : 108 : 90 , and for tube 2 a : d = 100 : 84 .
These results explain why Makower and Buss found that , although the activity of the emanation was less at high temperatures than at low , it decayed at the same rate .
They were simply measuring the decay of the particles in partition d in one case and in partition a in the other .
Both partitions are perfectly definite for any one tube , and therefore afford consistent results .
They explain also the result of Schmidt and Cermack ( mentioned above , 1911 .
] Temperature upon Radioactive Disintegration .
253 ' p. 242 ) , that , when the volatilised products were cooled quickly , the / 3-ray activity suddenly diminished .
They attributed this to a sudden absorption of the products by the radium itself .
It is due , however , to their precipitation on the walls of the containing tube and consequent alteration of the partition of radium C. Summary .
( a ) The effect of temperature upon the rate of decay , and the amount of / 3- and 7-ray activity , of radium emanation , active deposit , and radium C have been investigated .
The results are entirely negative .
( b ) Radium B and radium C , and very probably radium A , may be completely volatilised inside sealed quartz tubes at a temperature of 650 ' .
Radium B commences to volatilise at room temperatures .
( 1c ) All abnormalities of activity of / 3-rays obtained by previous authors , and by the author in this paper , can be completely explained on two simple grounds , a change of distribution and a change of partition , of radium C inside quartz tubes , produced by changes of temperature .
I take the opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to Prof. Rutherford for all he has done for me throughout the work .
