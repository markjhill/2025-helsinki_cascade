]\gt ; in the theory of Abelian integrals and functions , as its integral us to a form which , when operaed on by , leads us to a nn algebraic equation , which again leads to another by a second tion of the operator .
By this method I obtain a number of ing results , many of which are now given for the first time , as far sm I am aware .
I then define Abelian funcions and , by a method of treatment depending on what precedes , show that they are periodic functiom and detel'mine their periods .
We have at first sight 2 independent periods , and I them to 2 by an easy application of the oing theory .
The above is a short 'bstract of what my paper contains , the nosl important portions of it being ( a ) the determination of the gsbmio integrals in a rational and integral form ; ( b ) the easy proof of the periodicity of Abelian functions .
I omit from this paper a discussion of the in which number of variables exceeds , as likely to make my communicaW too lengthy .
