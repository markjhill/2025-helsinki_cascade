A Demonstration of the 11th Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton 's Treatise of Quadratures , By Mr. Benjamin Robins .
THIS Proposition consists of two Parts : The first is as follows .
Let there be any Curve AD I , whose Abscisse AB shall be denoted by z , and its Ordinate BD by y ; which may be related in any manner to the Abscisse .
And calling this the first Curve , let other Curves AEK , AFL , AGM , AHN , &amp;c. be formed to the common Absciffe A B , or z , by making the Ordinate BE of the second Curve always equal to the Area ABD of the first divided by Unity ; the Ordinate BF of the third equal to the Unity ABE of the second divided by Unity ; the Ordinate BG of the fourth equal to the Area ABF of the third divided by Unity ; and so on continually .
Suppose now , that other Curves AO S , AP T , AQ V , ARE W , be described to the same common Abscisse AB or z ; in which Curves the Ordinate BO of the Curve AOS shall be equal to z y , the Ordinate BP of the Curve APT equal z2 y , the Ordinate BQ of the Curve AQV equal to z3 y , the Ordinate BR of the Curve ARW equal to z4 y , &amp;c. And let the whole Area ACI be denoted by A , the Area ACS by B , the Area ACT by C , the Area ACV by D , the Area ACW by E , &amp;c. Then the Series of Curves AD I , AE K , AF L , AG M , AHN are thus measured : The Area of the first Curve ADI is =A of the second AEK is =zAB of the third AFL= zzA 2zB + C/ 2 of the fourth AGM = z3A 3z2B + 3zC + D/ 6 of the fifth AHN = z4A 4z3B + 6z2C 4zD + E/ 24 and so on perpetually .
Here in all the Curves following the first , the Index of the highest Power of z is always the Number which expresses the Distance of the Curve from the first , and afterwards decreases regularly by Unity ; the first Term is multiplied into A , the second into B , the third into C , the fourth into D , and so on ; the Coefficients are the same as in a Binomial raised to the highest Power of z , and the Divisor is so many Terms of this Progression 1~2~3~4~5~6 &amp;c. as is expressed by a Number equal to the highest Index of z. Otherwise supposing n to represent the Distance of the Curve to be measured from the first ; then the Area sought will be found by extending ~z1~n into a Series , and multiplying the first Term by A , the second by B , the third by C , the fourth by D , &amp;c. and dividing the whole by n~~n1~~n2 &amp;c. continued to Unity .
SECONDPAR T. Supposing the first , second , third , &amp;c. Curves to be the same as before : Let t denote the whole Abscisse AC , and put x for B C : Then describe the Curves CXA , CYA , CZA , CTA , where BX shall be equal to x y , BY= x2 y , BZ= x3 y , B~ = x4 y , &amp;c. This being done , and in the Series of Curves CIDA , CXA , CYA , CZA , CTA , &amp;c. the first Area CIDA being put equal to P , the second CXA equal to Q , the third CYA = R , the fourth CZA = S , the fifth CTA = T , &amp;c. the whole Areas of the aforesaid Series of Curves are also determined as follows .
The first AIC =P The second AKC =Q The third ALC = 1/ 2 R The fourth AMC =~ S. The fifth ANC =~ T. Here the Area 's P , Q , R , S , T are divided by Numbers produced by multiplying as many Terms of this Series 1~2~3~4~5 &amp;c. together , as in the former Case .
Demonstration of the First Part .
Let the Area ABD be denoted by a , the Area ABO by b , ABP by c , ABQ by d , and ABK by c. Then it is evident , that The Fluxion of the Area ABD is = ~z ~BD= ~z y= ~a The Fluxion of the Area ABO is = ~z ~ BO = ~zzy = ~b The Fluxion of the Area ABP is = ~z ~BP= ~z z2y = ~c &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence z~ ~a is ( = ~z z y ) = ~b z2 ~ ~a is ( = ~z z2 y ) =z ~b = ~c z3 ~ ~a is ( = ~z z3 y ) = z2 ~b =z ~c = ~d .
Or generally , zn ~ ~a = zn-1 ~ ~b = zn-2 ~ ~c = zn-3 ~ ~d , &amp; ~ .
Now as ~x ABD or ~xa is = Fluxion of ABE , if you add to the first Part ~xa ( = ~~ y ) and its Equal b to the other Part , it follows , that ~x a~~ = Fluxion of ABE +b +~ x a~~ And taking the Fluents zxa= ABE +b or ABE =zx a-b ; and when z or AB becomes = AC , then ABE becomes ACK , and a and b become A and B ; therefore ACK is =zx A-B .
Again , The Ordinate BF of the next Curve is equal to ABE , which has been proved equal to zxa b. Consequently the Fluxion of ABF is =~~a~ b ; and if you add to the first Part of this Equation 1/ 2 ~2 xa~b ( = 1/ 2 ~2 ~y~ ~2 y= 1/ 2 ~ ~2 y ) and its Equal 1/ 2c on the other , it follows , that ~~a~b = Fluxion of ABF 1/ 2c .
+1/ 2~ ~a~b And taking the Fluents 1/ 2 z2 a-z b= ABF-1/ 2c ; or by transposing ABF = z2a-2 z b+c/ 2 ; or supposing z equal to AC , ACL=z2A-2 zB+ C/ 2 .
The Ordinate BG is equal to ABF , which has been proved equal to ~a2zb+ c/ 2 : Therefore the Fluxion of ABG is equal to z z2 a2 zz b+z c/ 2 And adding ~ z3a-1/ 2 z2 b+ 1/ 2 zc ( = 1/ 6 z z3 y -1/ 2 z z3y + 1/ 2 z z3 y =1/ 6 zz3 y ) on one side , and its Equal 1/ 6 d on the other , it will be 1/ 2 ~ ~2 a~~ b+1/ 2 ~c = Fluxion of ABG+ 1/ 6 d +~ ~3 a-1/ 2 ~2 b+1/ 2 ~c And taking the Fluents ~ z3 a 1/ 2 z2 b+ 1/ 2 zc= ABG +~ d ; and transposing , ABG=z3 a3 z2 b+3zc d/ 6 ; or supposing z equal to AC ; then ACM = z3 A-3 z2 B+ 3z C-D/ 6 .
In the same manner the Fluxion of ABH is equal to ~ ~3 a3~ ~2 b+3~~c~ d/ 6 ; and adding on one side 1/ 24 z4 a 1/ 6 z3 b+ 1/ 4 z2 c~z d , and its Equal 1/ 24 e on the other , it becomes ~~ ~3 a-3/ 6 ~ ~2 b+3/ 6 ~~ c-1/ 6 ~d = Fluxion of ABH-~ e +~ ~4 a-1/ 6 ~3 b+1/ 4 ~2 c-1/ 6 ~d And taking the Fluents 1/ 24 z4 a 1/ 6 z3 b+ 1/ 4 z2 c-1/ 6 zb= ABH1/ 24 e : therefore ABH=z4 a-4 z3 b+6 z2 c-4 z d+e/ 24 ; Or ACN=z4 A-4 z3 B+6 z2 C-4 z D+E , supposing z equal to AC .
In like manner you may proceed to measure any of these Curves : and you will always find their Value the same as is expressed in the Proposition .
Demonstration of the Second Part .
Suppose any Curve whose Distance from the first is denoted by n ; then the Curve whose Abscisse is BC or x , and its Ordinate xn y divided by nx ~n-1 x ~n-2 x ~n-3 &amp;c. continued to Unity will be equal to it , when x is equal to AC or t. It is evident , that when the Areas ABD , ABO , ABP , ABQ , ABR , &amp;c. decrease , the Areas BCID , BCSO , BCTP , BCVQ , BCWR increase respectively ; and consequently the Decrements of the Areas ABD , ABO , ABP , &amp;c. or their Fluxions with a negative Sign , are the Increments or Fluxions of the Areas BCID , BCSO , BCTP , &amp;c. that is , calling the Area BCID , ~ ; the Area BCSO , ~ ; the Area BCTP , ~ ; BCVQ , ~ ; BCWR , ~ : then ~=a , ~=-b , ~=-c , ~= -d , ~=-e .
Now the Fluxion of the Curve , whose Abscisse is = x , or BC , and its Ordinate = xn y is x xn y ; that is , equal to xyx t-~~n ; x being =t -z ; or since the Increment of x , or x is equal to the Decrement of z , or ~ , the Fluxion of the same Curve is equal to-~ yx t-~~n =-~ y in tn nx tn-1 z+nx n-1/ 2 tn-2 x z2 &amp;c. =-tn z y+n tn-1 zzynx n-1/ 2 tn-2 z z2 y , &amp;c. that is , = tn xan tn-1 xb+nx n-1/ 2 tn-2 x c , &amp;c. or = tn ~n tn-1 ~+nx n-1/ 2 tn-2 ~ , &amp;c. and taking the Fluents , the Area of the Curve , whose Abscisse is x , or BC , and Ordinate xn y , is equal to tn xn tn-1 ~ +n xn-1/ 2 tn-2 ~ &amp;c. But when x is equal
