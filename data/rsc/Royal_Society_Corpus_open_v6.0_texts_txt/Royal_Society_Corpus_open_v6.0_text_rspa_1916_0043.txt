Introduction .
In seeking to solve the problem of the structure of atoms , especially of the more complex ones , it is of great importance to know what are the simplest or fundamental spectra which such atoms are capable of emitting .
Information regarding such fundamental frequencies for the atoms of some metals has been obtained from investigating the characteristics of both the absorption and emission spectra of vapours of these metals .
For example , McLennan and Edwards* have shown that , with the non-luminous vapours of mercury , zinc and cadmium , narrow absorption bands are obtained , using moderate vapour densities , with lines whose frequencies are given by v = ( 1'5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , ^2)\gt ; f and v = ( L5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 2 , P ) , The first of these is the frequency of the first member of Paschen'sJ combination series v = ( 2 , p2)\#151 ; ( m , S ) , and the second is the first member of the singlet series v = ( 1*5 , S ) \#151 ; ( m , P ) .
Moreover , oneS of us has also more recently shown from absorption experiments that for magnesium atoms the frequencies v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) , v = ( 1*5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 3 , P ) , and possibly also'those of still higher members of the series v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( m , P ) , are the fundamental ones .
With this metal the frequency v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; \gt ; ( 2 , p2 ) , does not appear from experimental evidence as yet available to be fundamental .
c It has also been shown by McLennan and Henderson|| that the simplest spectrum which the vapours of mercury , zinc , and cadmium in a vacuum can be made to emit under bombardment by electrons consists with each of the metals of the single spectral line whose frequency is given by V ' * McLennan and Edwards , 'Phil .

On the Bunsen Flam , e Spectra of Metallic Vapours .
585 v == ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , p2)- With magnesium , on the other hand , one of us* still later has shown that the simplest spectrum which can be obtained of magnesium vapour in a vacuum by means of electronic bombardment is given by v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) .
For mercury , zinc , and cadmium vapours , then , the frequency v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , p2)\#151 ; and probably also = ( P5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 2 , P)\#151 ; appears to be the fundamental one , while with magnesium it is in all probability v = ( 1/ 5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) .
As the electrical conditions in flames are probably simpler than those which obtain in the electric arc or spark ; one should expect that , in flame spectra of the elements , the fundamental frequency would come out relatively with specially strong intensity .
Charles de Watteville , f in a number of papers on flame spectra , has pointed out that , if a Bunsen flame be fed with the spray of salt solutions of a number of different elements , the spectrum of the flame with some of the elements consists of a single strong line , and with others of a single strong line accompanied by a number of very much fainter ones .
These strong lines for the different metals , with their frequencies , are given in Table I. Table I. Element .

This Table , it will be seen , emphasises the view that for mercury , zinc , and cadmium , the fundamental frequency is given by v = ( 1*5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 2 , p2)\gt ; while for magnesium , and probably also for calcium , strontium , and barium , it is given by v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) .
Some earlier experiments made by Gouy , J with salts sprayed into a flame , also confirm this view with respect to zinc and cadmium .

Observations have also been made by Hartley* and by Ramagef on the Bunsen and the oxy-hydrogen flame spectra of some nineteen of the elements .
With mercury no characteristic lines were observed with either of these flames .
With zinc , cadmium , and magnesium , spectra consisting of a number of lines came out with the oxy-hydrogen flame , but no characteristic spectra were obtained when the Bunsen flame was used .
With calcium , strontium , and barium , however , the single spectral line whose frequency is given by z/ = ( l*5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 2 , P ) , i.e. the fundamental frequency , came out strongly with the Bunsen flame , while the same line and several others in addition came out when the oxy-hydrogen flame was used .
In the experiments of Hartley and of Ramage , the vapours of the pure metals as well as of the salts of these metals were used in studying the flame spectra .
De WattevilleJ reports that he was unable to detect any characteristic line of the mercury spectrum in photographs taken of the spectrum of the flame of a Bunsen burner into which there was blown the spray from solutions of metallic mercury in nitric acid .
The only investigators who appear to have observed the line X = 4571*38 A.U.\#151 ; frequency^ = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , p2)\#151 ; in the flame spectrum of magnesium are Living and Dewar , S and Eder and Valenta.|| The former found in the spectrum of the light from magnesium burning in air a number of lines , among which those of the wave-lengths X = 4571*38 A.U. and X = 2852*22 A.U. came out with relatively strong intensity .
The first-mentioned line they state was always narrow and sharply defined .
Eder and Valenta in their experiments found that a Bunsen flame fed with magnesium emitted a spectrum consisting of the lines X = 5183*79 , 5172*87 , 5164*49 , 4571*38 , 3336*82 , 3332*33 , 3330*04 , 3097*00 , 3093*09 , 3091*11 , and 2852*22 A.U. , together with other lines which they attributed to magnesium oxide and to impurities in the magnesium .
In their Atlas of typical spectra , IT however , they give a spectrum of the flame from a magnesium-fed Bunsen burner which shows but the single line X - 4571*38 A.U. of the magnesium spectrum .
As the Bunsen flame would appear to be the simplest possible means of exciting the fundamental frequencies in the atoms of easily volatilised metals the failure of Hartley , Ramage , and de Watteville to bring out these * * * S * Hartley , 'Phil .

On the Bunsen Flame Spectra of Metallic Vapours .
587 frequencies by means of this agency in the case of the metals mercury , zinc* cadmium , and magnesium seemed rather remarkable .
It is not clear from the papers of Hartley and Eamage whether more than a casual examination was made of this point , but before accepting as final the conclusion which may be drawn from their results as to the probable impossibility of stimulating the fundamental frequencies , of these elements by means of Bunsen flames , especially in regard to mercury , zinc , and cadmium it was thought desirable by the writers to subject this matter to a closer inquiry .
This has now been done , with the result that it has been found possible to obtain with the Bunsen flame the fundamental frequencies mentioned of the spectra of mercury , cadmium , and magnesium , but up to the present it has not been found possible to obtain such with zinc .

Apparatus .
In the experiments two types of Bunsen burner were used .
One , shown in fig. 1 , consisted of an ordinary burner A , to which was attached at the top a steel close-fitting tubular cap BB , provided with a conical shaped cover C. * Fig. l. Fig. 2 .
Prof. J. C. McLennan and Mr. A. Thomson .
The metal to be vaporised was placed in the cup BB , and when the cover C was replaced and the burner lighted the flame of a blow^-pipe was directed against the cup .
The vaporised metal in escaping was thus made to pass directly into the flame of the burner .
The second form of burner used is shown in fig. 2 .
To the top of an ordinary Bunsen burner Q a brass cylinder KL , 3 8 cm .
in diameter and 8 cm .
high , was soldered .
The top was closed by a lid containing an aperture in the centre 1*8 cm .
in diameter , to which a small tube 0*5 cm .
high was attached .
Another brass cylinder , 2*8 cm .
in diameter and 7 cm .
in length , was supported in the centre and coaxially with KL by means of three asbestos plugs .
This inner cylinder contained a quartz tube F , 1 cm .
in diameter and about 8 cm .
in length , drawn off to a neck about 0*5 cm .
in diameter at the upper end .
A coil of manganin wire MN was wound round this tube , and the ends were led out through two openings fitted with small porcelain plugs in the bottom of KL .
A layer of asbestos paper was placed round the wire and then the whole space between the tube and the brass cylinder next to it was filled with plaster of Paris , which on solidifying kept everything rigid .
The top of the quartz tube F came just level with the mouth of the burner .
When the gas was lighted a large clear Bunsen flame was easily maintained above the mouth of the burner .
The metals to be vaporised were placed within the quartz tube F and the furnace was raised to whatever temperature was desired by supplying a current of suitable intensity to the circuit MN .
With each metal a fresh quartz tube was used and care was taken to thoroughly clean the burner before taking the photographs .
The photographs of the flame spectra were taken first with a small Hilger quartz spectrograph , type A , and afterwards with a larger one of the type C. 3 .
Bunsen Flame Spectra .
The spectrograms taken of the different spectra are shown in the plate at the end of the paper .
No. 1 is a reproduction of the spectrum of the clear Bunsen flame free from all metallic vapours .
No. 2 was obtained with mercury vapour .
In addition to the ordinary Bunsen flame spectrum this spectrogram shows that the mercury line X = 2536*72 A.U. came out strongly .
No. 3 is a spectrogram of Bunsen flame spectrum of cadmium vapour and was obtained with the flame burning very gently .
It shows the characteristic line X = 3260*17 A.U. No. 4 is the Bunsen flame spectrum of magnesium .
It shows the line X = 2852*22 A.U. faintly but clearly in addition to the free flame spectrum .
No sign of the line X = 4571*38 A.U. was found in any of the spectrograms taken with this metal .
No. 5 is the spectrum obtained with thallium vapour .
In this case the only characteristic On the Bunsen Flame Spectra of Metallic Vapours .
589 lines of the thallium spectrum which came out were X = 3775*87 A.U. and X = 5350*65 A.U. The former line was always much the stronger , but this may have been because the plates used were less sensitive to the green than to the ultra-violet .
No. 6 is a. reproduction of the spark spectrum of cadmium , and No. 7 the Bunsen flame spectrum of cadmium vapour obtained when the draught was slightly forced and the flame was burning vigorously .
As No. 7 shows that the line X = 2288*79 A.U. came out faintly on the plates in addition to the line X = 3260*17 A.U. under these circumstances .
With zinc vapour no characteristic lines were obtained .
Numerous modifications in the form of the burner were made and exposures were taken with them of varying duration , with the flame burning with different intensities , but in no case did the flame spectrum show any trace of the lines X = 3075*99 A.U. and X = 2139*3 A.U. or of any other of the zinc lines .
Just why the zinc vapour failed to show any spectrum when results were obtained so easily with the other metals is not very clear .

Discussion of Results .
" In view of the line X = 2288*79 A.U. coming out in strong flames with cadmium vapour , it was thought that possibly the analogous line in the mercury spectrum X = 1849*6 A.U. might come out as well .
No trace of it , however , was found on any of the plates .
It is known that both of these lines are strongly absorbed by the vapours of their respective metals , but , since the one came out , the other might have been expected to appear as well .
However , it must be remembered that the line X = 1819*6 A.U. is in the spectral region where the air begins to absorb very strongly , and it is possible that this effect combined with the action of the cool vapour in the flame to cut off all radiation of this wave-length which may have been emitted .
It is of interest to note that with magnesium no trace of the line X = 4571*38 A.U.\#151 ; frequency v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , p2)\#151 ; was obtained .
Since the line X = 2852*22 A.U.\#151 ; frequency v = ( 1*5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P)\#151 ; came out on the plates but feebly , it was scarcely to be expected that the line X = 2026*46 A.U. \#151 ; frequency v = ( 1*5 , S ) \#151 ; ( 3 , P)\#151 ; or others of higher frequency in the same series would have been obtained .
With thallium , as stated above , the lines X = 5350*65 A.U. and X = 3775*87 A.U. were the only ones which came out .
They are the first members of the second subordinate doublet series given by v = ( 2 , pi ) \#151 ; ( m , s ) , and v = ( 2 , _p2)\#151 ; ( ^ , s ) , and are therefore analogous to the doublet yellow lines in the spectrum of sodium .

Bunsen flame , in so far as these experiments go , is exactly similar to the well known behaviour of sodium .

Results .
1 .
The results with mercury and cadmium vapours go to confirm the view that the frequency v = ( T5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , p2 ) , is a fundamental one .
The fact that the cadmium line X = 2288-79 A.U. came out in strongly burning flames also gives support to the view that the frequency v = ( T5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) , possesses fundamental characteristics for cadmium atoms .
2 .
The experiments tend to support the view that , in the magnesium spectrum , the fundamental frequency is given by = ( 1'5 , S)\#151 ; ( 2 , P ) .
It is the one most easily stimulated in the spectrum of magnesium .
When the line X = 457P38 A.U. has been observed by other spectroscopists , it has always been accompanied by other lines , including in some cases that of wave-length X = 2852-22 A.U. 3 .
The results obtained with thallium failed to give any indication of the fundamental frequencies in the spectrum of this element .
It is probable that , with thallium , the fundamental spectral lines come far down in the ultra-violet region .
In conclusion , we wish to acknowledge the kind help of Mr. J. F. T. Young in taking some of the photographs .
