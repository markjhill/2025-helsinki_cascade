On the Rate of Elimination of Chloroform from the Blood after Ancesthesia .
By George A. Buckmaster , Assistant Professor of Physiology , University College , University of London , and J. A. Gardner , Lecturer on Physiological Chemistry , University of London .

) In a paper* on the rate of assumption of chloroform by the blood , we showed that the percentage of chloroform rises very rapidly to a maximal value .
This is the cause of an early danger-point in anaesthesia .
Subsequently a rapid fall takes place , followed by a more or less rapid rise towards a maximal value , which is maintained during the rest of anaesthesia .
The following remarks will illustrate our conception of the anaesthetic process .
The blood at first rapidly becomes charged with chloroform , which is held almost entirely by the red corpuscles .
The respiratory centre or centres in the cat become affected quite early , and discharge impulses less frequently than the normal .
As a result of this the intake of chloroform is lowered , and consequently the percentage of chloroform in blood falls , either owing to the tissues rapidly storing up the drug at the expense of the blood , or because the elimination of chloroform is as rapid or more rapid than the assumption , or to both these causes .
If the first danger-point is safely passed , the respirations improve in frequency and become rapid .
It is known that many chemical substances , for instance , the group of alcohols , ether or chloroform , which are lethal , primarily act as exciting agents on living cells .
Thus those bodies which in a given concentration are lethal for protoplasm , in lower amounts check its activities , but in still less , amount , so long as this is above the indifferent point , inversely will act as a stimulus and augment the energy-discharges of protoplasm .

[ July 19 , chloroform it would seem that there is an initial stimulating effect which may approach the lethal value , but that if this is not actually attained the stimulating effect , which was masked , persists as a recognisable after-effect when the first danger-point has been passed .
Thereafter the chloroform-content of the blood approximates to a maximal value , which is maintained until asphyxia takes place ( maximum value ) .
If the rate of elimination were more rapid than the rate of intake , or even equal to this , it would not be easy to understand why this maximal value is so rapidly reached or maintained , and for these reasons it appeared important that we should study the rate at which chloroform was eliminated during anaesthesia .
Method .
All the experiments were performed upon cats , which were anaesthetised by ether , and the necessary operations performed after an injection of hirudin into the femoral vein in quantity sufficient to delay the coagulation of the blood during the time of the experiment .
After the animal had so far recovered from ether that the reflexes had reappeared but it was still under the influence of the drug , chloroform of about 2 to 3 per cent , was administered from a Woulffs bottle of the form described in our former papers .
The inhalation was stopped in some cases when the asphyxial point was reached , and in other cases at an earlier point during the period we have ( described as the second stage of anaesthesia .
Immediately the inhalation of chloroform was stopped , samples of blood were abstracted from the central .end of one carotid artery or from the cephalic end of the external jugular vein , or from the side tube of a short T-piece connecting the cephalic and thoracic end of the vein , or by the introduction of a tube several inches in length along the vein , so that a sample of blood could be taken from the right auricle at definite intervals of time .
In some experiments only arterial blood was examined , in others only venous , and in other cases samples were taken simultaneously from both the artery and vein .
The methods of collecting and analysing samples of blood were those fully described in our former papers .
In some experiments , however , it was found more convenient to abstract the venous blood from the cannula by means of a syringe .
During the entire course of any experiment the respirations were recorded by a tambour plaeed on the ensiform cartilage .
From all our experiments we have selected five typical examples , details of which are given .

In the following Tables IY and Y we give the results of two types of these experiments .
When the blood was taken without much disturbance to the circulation ( Table IY ) and was really a sample of particular venous blood coming partly from muscles and partly from the brain , obvious variations in the chloroform-content of the blood occur which may be due to variations in the rate of discharge from the tissues but .

General Conclusions .
The rate of elimination appears to depend upon the physiological state of the individual animal , but when all the experiments described in this paper are considered generally and compared with those in our previous papers , the rate of output is found to be at first comparatively rapid , and then subsequently becomes slower .
The initial rates of elimination are , however , much less rapid than the initial rates of the intake of chloroform , and , therefore , on the whole , elimination is a much slower process than assumption , a view which is borne out by a comparison of the times at which the various reflexes disappear and reappear .
As the results of his experiments on dogs , Nicloux* shows that the arterial blood loses about half its chloroform-content five minutes after inhalation is stopped , and at the end of one hour about one-third to one-quarter of what the blood originally held is ' eliminated .

] Rate of Elimination of Chloroform from the Blood .
587 588 Messrs. G. A. Buckmaster and J. A. Gardner .
[ July 19 , seven hours the blood still may contain 1 to 2 milligrammes per cent , of chloroform .
He also observed that the palpebral reflex reappeared within 1^ to 2 minutes after anaesthetic periods which lasted 38 and 67 minutes .
In one experiment he mentions that the animal got up and walked off the table 30 minutes after the chloroform was stopped , and the animal appeared to be quite normal , though at this period there were 10 milligrammes of chloroform per cent , in the blood .
In the case of cats , the curves for arterial blood show a general similarity in form to curves which w~e have constructed from the data given in Nicloux 's paper .
The initial falls in our curves are not so rapid as in the case of the dog , and the chloroform-content of arterial blood was only reduced by 50 per cent , in about 15 to 20 minutes .
In our longest experiments , about three-quarters of the chloroform was eliminated in about 30 minutes , when the animal was breathing normally .
When , however , an increased ventilation of the lung is brought about by artificial respiration , a very much shorter space of time is required , as is evident from the analyses quoted in former papers .
Eeflexes in our experiments reappear later than was noticed by Hicloux for dogs ; but though the pinna reflex , corneal reflex , tendon reflex , and tail reflex were noted , there is no definite order in which they reappear , though as a rule the tail reflex is the last .
Hot infrequently an animal goes to sleep during recovery from anaesthesia , but we have never noticed the rapid recovery of volition to which Nicloux has drawn attention .
According to Tissot 's observations , it would appear that during recovery from anaesthesia the amount of chloroform in venous blood constantly exceeds the amount in arterial , as may be seen from the following table constructed from his paper .
He also considers that a study of the chloroform-content of arterial blood should be made during the induction of anaesthesia and of venous blood during the disappearance of anaesthesia .

] Rate of Elimination of Chloroform from the Blood .
589 For the sake of argument , we will assume that during recovery from anaesthesia the blood circulates in the body , and that no exchange of chloroform takes place between the blood and tissues .
Under such conditions it is clear that , given a steady elimination at the surface of the lungs , the amount of chloroform in arterial blood would be constantly less than in venous , and this difference would probably be a decreasing one .
During the initial rapid elimination , this difference would conceivably be marked and easily detectable by experiment ; but in the later stages , where the elimination is slow , the difference would possibly lie within the errors of experiment .
But during recovery from anaesthesia there will be superimposed on this simple conception of the circulation a discharge of chloroform from the tissues into the venous blood .
If this took place steadily , it would tend to increase the difference between arterial and venous blood .
The problem , however , appears to be more complex .
First of all , the blood comes from regions such as the muscles , viscera , etc. , which are probably not charged to any great extent with chloroform , compared to what is believed to be the case for the central nervous system .
The nerve centres are differently affected , and doubtless discharge at different rates , as the evidences of their activity or paralysis appear and disappear irregularly .
Further , it is not inconceivable that during the elimination one region may be discharging chloroform while other cell-districts are relatively inactive in this respect , or even actually continuing to absorb chloroform .
The question will be further complicated in a very marked degree by the nature of the respiration at any moment , for the depth and frequency of respirations naturally govern the elimination at any particular moment .
On the whole , therefore , we should expect the chloroform-content of venous blood to be higher than that of the arterial , but this difference would be slight in the later periods of elimination .
In actual experiments one would expect the result would depend markedly on the particular source whence the venous blood was taken .
A comparison with Curves A and B shows a general similarity in the rate of elimination both in the case of arterial and venous blood .
Both curves show irregularities in the rate .
In Curve C , the chloroform-content of arterial blood is contrasted with the general venous blood of the body ( sample taken close to the heart ) .
At the moment of cessation of respiration , the arterial blood is markedly higher than the venous , but after regular respiration is established , the two curves are practically identical , the difference being within the errors of experiment .
The work has been carried out with the help of a grant which was made to us by the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society , for which we now express our thanks .
