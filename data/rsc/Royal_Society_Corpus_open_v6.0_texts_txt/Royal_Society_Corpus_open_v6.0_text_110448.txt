Continuation of a former paper " On the twenty-five feet Zenith Telescope , lately erected at the Royal Observatory ; " by John Pond , Esq. , F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal .
For determining the place of any star passing the meridian near the zenith , at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich , three different methods may be employed : first , by means of the mural circles ; secondly , by the zenith telescope , used alternately east and west ; and lastly , by means of a small subsidiary angle , as described by the author in a former paper .
The details of computations made according to each of these three methods are contained in the present paper ; from which it appears that they all give results nearly identical ; and that , when the observations with the two circles are made with sufficient care , the greatest error to be apprehended does not exceed the quarter of a second .
