" On a new and practical form of Voltaic Battery of the highest powers , in which Potassium forms the positive element .
" By John Goodman , Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , A.M. , Sec. R.S. The author succeeded in constructing a voltaic arrangement of some power by fixing a piece of potassium to the end of a copper wire , placed in a tube containing naphtha , and bringing it in contact with a small quantity of mercury , held by a layer of bladder closing the lower end of the tube , which was itself immersed in acidulated water immediately over a piece of platinum , and then completing , the circuit by establishing a metallic contact between the copper wire and the platinum .
This battery acted with energy on the galvanometer , and effected the decomposition of water .
A series of twelve pairs of similar plates exhibited a sensible attraction of a slip of gold leaf .
Thus it appears that the substance which possesses the highest chemical affinity manifests also the greatest power of electrical tension .
