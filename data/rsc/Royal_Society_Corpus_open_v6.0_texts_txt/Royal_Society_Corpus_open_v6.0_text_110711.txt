Description of a Calculating Machine invented by Mr. Thomas Fowler , of Torrington in Devonshire .
By Augustus De Morgan , Esq. Communicated by F. Bailey , Esq. , V.P.R.S. The arithmetical operations performed by the machine are those of multiplication and division ; the factors and product in the for ?
mer case , and the quotient , dividend and divisor in the latter , being expressed in digits of the ternary scale of notation , every digit be ?
ing either ยง 1 , 0 , or + 1 .
In this system , unity being , in multiplication , only an index , the rules for multiplication and division must consist entirely in directions for the management of the signs of unity ; and it is on this principle that Mr. Fowler 's machine is made to act .
A short account is given of the principal parts of the machine , and of the mode in which they bring out the final results .
It is necessary , however , in applying it to use , to have recourse to tables , both for converting the factors and reconverting the result ; o]Derations which introduce both labour and risk of error .
