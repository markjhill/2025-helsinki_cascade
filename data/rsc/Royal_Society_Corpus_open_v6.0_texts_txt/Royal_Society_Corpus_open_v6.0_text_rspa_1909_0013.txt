145 thousand times the diameter of a molecule , the thickness of a 7-pulse is about equal to the diameter of a molecule .
Summary .
Part of the cathode radiation from a plate exposed to the 7-rays of radium consists of very soft rays which are absorbed in 1 or 2 cm .
of air .
The softness of the radiation is practically independent of the thickness of the radiator , and previous sifting of the 7-rays through a thick screen .
The radiation appears to be considerably softer on the side of the radiating plate where the 7-rays emerge than on the side where they enter .
Measurements of the softness of the radiation for radiators of different materials on the side where the 7-rays entered showed that it is practically independent of the nature of the material of the radiator .
The soft radiation produced by the j3- and 7-rays of radium together is of a more penetrating character than that produced by the 7-rays alone .
The penetrating cathode rays produced directly by the 7-rays have been shown to possess different velocities .
It was found that the penetrating-power of the cathode radiation from a plate decreases with the increase of absorbability of the 7-radiation which produces it .
The velocity of these secondary rays as a whole is , as a first approximation , equal to that of the / 3-rays of radium .
It gives me great pleasure to thank Prof. Thomson for his interest and advice during this research .
