The object of this preliminary note is to indicate a method by which the tissue fluid in man may be measured , thus enabling the observer to ascertain the conditions under which it is effused and disposed of .
In the course of some observations made with the view of eliminating tissue fluid as a cause of variability in the ; samples of blood obtained for examination , I found that the rolling of a tight rubber ring over the finger from the tip to beyond the interphalangeal joints will , as a rule , considerably raise the percentages of the blood corpuscles , and of the haemoglobin .
I could not arrive at any other conclusion , than that the ring not merely empties the vessels , but likewise clears away any tissue fluid present In the skin and subcutaneous tissues .
The needle , in puncturing the capillaries , liberates a certain portion of lymph from the areolar tissue which surrounds them , and this dilutes the blood .
When , however , both fluids have been dispersed as much as possible by the compression of the firm rubber ring , a puncture made just before removing the ring yields blood per se ; for the blood instantly returns to the vessels , whereas an appreciable interval must elapse before the lymph reappears , or is exuded afresh .
I , therefore , inferred that the leading of the difference in the percentage of the corpuscles , or of the haemoglobin , before and after the use of the ring , provides a measure of the tissue-lymph , and makes : the study of the .
circulation of it in man possible .
This simple method having furnished .

Inasmuch as the uiethod did not provide results which were exceptional or erratic or eodtra dictory and unaccountable , reliability on it became gradually'establisM by the mere repetition of the observations .

In this note I limit myself , however , to a statement of results obtained in the former class of subjects only .
The numerous observations which this inquiry necessitated on the corpuscles , and on the haemoglobin , were made by the haemocytometer tubes , and the hsemoglobinometer , which were described by me before the Physiological'Society Some few years ago , * and the specific gravity of the blood was determined by Roy 's method .
The blood-pressures ( arterial , capillary , and vekous ) were read by the hsemodynamometerj and Hill and Barnard 's sphygmometer , and Professor Gartner 's tonometer , were also occasionally used in determining the arterial pressure . .
Some of the general conclusions afforded by the observations may be thus epitomised :\#151 ; ; 1 .
The amount of tissue fluid varies , at different times in the course of the day ; and each variation is of short duration .
2 .
The ingestion of food produces a rapid flow of lymph into the tissue spaces , which in an hour after the meals acquires its maximum development , and then it slowly subsides , and only ceases to be apparent after the lapse of from 3\#151 ; 4 hours .
3 .
The digestive curve of variation always follows the same general type ; the rise being rapid , the acme short , and the subsidence gradual .
The variations were observed to follow this well-defined order in all the healthy subjects so far submitted to observation .
The curve of variation is , therefore , rhythmical\#151 ; the wave abruptly rising to an acme , and then somewhat slowly subsiding .

The amount of lymph is proportionate to the rise of the mean arterial and capillary pressures , and these pressures have been found to follow exactly the same prolonged rhythmical course after the ingestion of food , as does the effusion of lymph .
The following example shows the agreement between the blood-pressures and the amount of lymph:\#151 ; Percentage Mean arterial of lymph .

None 100 The method devised for observing the capillary pressure is not quite so delicate for the smaller variations as I could wish , and I am hoping to improve it ; but it is sufficiently definite to show that the capillary blood-pressure is raised throughout the digestive circulatory disturbance , and especially so at the acme of it , and falls again at the close of it .
When the mean arterial pressure is 100 cmm .
Hg .
before a meal , as in the above example , the capillary blood-pressure will read , 20 cmm .
Hg .
; and in an hour after the meal , when the arterial pressure rises to 115 cmm .
Hg .
, or so , the capillary pressure will rise to at least 30 cmm Hg .
Though this is a large relative rise , my observations show that it is hot less than this , and that it is often more .
