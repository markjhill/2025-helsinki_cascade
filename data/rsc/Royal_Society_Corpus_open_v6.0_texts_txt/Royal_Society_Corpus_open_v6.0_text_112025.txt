" On Mauve or Aniline-Purple .
" By W. H. PERKIN , F.C.S. Conmunicated by Dr. STENHOIUSE .
Received August 19 , 1863* .
The discovery of this colouring matter in 1856 , and its introduction as a commercial article , has originated that remarkable series of compounds known as coal-tar colours , which have now become so numerous , and in consequence of their adaptibility to the arts and manufactures are of such great and increasing importance .
The chemistry of mauve may appear to have been rather neglected , its composition not having been established , although it has formed the subject of several papers by continental chemists .
Its chemical nature also has not been generally known ; and to this fact many of the discrepancies in the results of the different experimentalists who have worked on this subject are to be attributed .
The first analysis I made of this colouring matter was in 1856 , soon after I had become its fortunate discoverer .
The product I examined was purified as thoroughly as my knowledge of its properties then enabled me , and the resultst obtained agree very closely with those required for the formula I now propose .
Since that time I have often commenced the study of this body in a scientific point of view , but other duties have prevented me from completing these investigations ; but , although unacquainted with its correct formula , its chemical characters have necessarily been well known to me for a considerable time .
When first introduced , commercial mauve appeared as an almost perfectly amorphous body ; but now , owing to the great improvements which have been made in its purification , it is sent into the market perfectly pure and crystallized .
On adding a solution of hydrate of potassiunm to a boiling solution of commercial crystallized mauve , it immediately changes in colour from purple to a blue violet , and after a few moments begins to deposit a crystalline body .
After standing a few hours , this crystalline product is collected on a filter , washed with alcohol once or twice , and then thoroughly with water .
When dry , it appears as a nearly black glistening substance , not unlike pulverised specular iron ore .
This substance , for which I propose the name Mauveine , is a powerful base .
It dissolves in alcohol , forming a blue violet solution , which immediately assumes a purple colour on the addition of acids .
It is insoluble , or nearly so , in ether and benzole .
It is a very stable body , and decomposes ammoniacal compounds readily .
When heated strongly it decomposes , yielding a basic oil , which does not appear to be aniline .

Platinum-.salt.-Mauveine forms a perfectly definite and beautifully crystalline compound with bichloride of platinum .
It is obtained by mixing an alcoholic solution of the above hydrochlorate with an excess of an alcoholic solution of bichloride of platinum ; from this mixture the new salt separates as a highly crystalline powder .
I have generally preferred to use cold solutions in its preparation ; but if moderately hot solutions be employed , the salt will separate as crystals of considerable dimensions .
This platinum-salt possesses the green lustre of the hydrochlorate , but , on being dried , assumes a more golden colour .
It is very sparingly soluble in alcohol .

It separates as a crystalline precipitate , which , when moist , presents a much less brilliant aspect than the platinum derivative ; it is also more soluble than that salt , and when crystallized appears to lose a small quantity of gold .

In preparing this salt from the base , it is necessary to use hydriodic acid which is colourless , otherwise the free iodine will slowly act upon this salt .
It crystallizes in prisms having a green metallic reflexion .
It is more insoluble than the hydrobromate .

56 1206 02 ... 32 6'94 464 100'00 Carbonate of M1auveine.-The tendency of solutionis of mauveine to combine with carbonic acid is rather remarkable .
If a quantity of its solution be thrown up into a tube containing carbonic acid over mercury , the carbonic acid will quickly be absorbed , the solution in the mean time passing from its norrmal violet colour to purple .
To prepare this carbonate , it is necessary to pass carbonic acid gas through boiling alcohol containing a quantity of mauveine in suspension .
It is then filtered quickly , and carbonic acid passed through the filtrate until nearly cold .
On standing , this liquid will deposit the carbonate as prisms , having a green metallic reflexion .
A solution of this salt , on being boiled , loses part of its carbonic acid and assumes the violet colour of the base .
When dry this carbonate rapidly changes , and if heated to 100 ?
C. loses nearly all its carbonic acid and changes in colour to a dull olive ; therefore , as it cannot be dried without undergoing a certain amount of change , its composition is difficult to determine .
However , I endeavoured to estimate the carbonic acid in this salt by taking a quantity of it freshly prepared and in the moist state , and heating it in an oil-bath until carbonic acid ceased to be evolved .
The residual base was then weighed , and also the carbonic acid , which had been collected in a potash bulb , having been previously freed from water by means of sulphuric acid .
The following results were obtained I. 1 '88 residual base obtained ; '190 carbonic acid evolved .
II .
1'375 residual base ; '1385 carbonic acid evolved .
'190 of CO3 is equal to *268 of H , CO3 ; this , added to the residual base , will give the amount of substance experimented with , viz. 2'148 .
The amount of CO , obtained from this quantity , therefore , is 88 per cent. Calculating the second experiment in a similar manner , the amount of carbonate operated upon would be 157,02 grm. ; the percentage of CO , obtained is therefore equal to 8'8 .
A carbonate having the formula ( C27 a124 N4)2 H1 COl would contain 5'1 per cent. of CO , , and an acid carbonate having the formula 027 n11 , N Ha CO , would contain 9'4 per cent. of CO. Considering that this salt when prepared begins to crystallize before it is cold , probably the first portions that deposit are a muonocarbonate , while the larger quiantity which separates afterwards is an acid carbonate .
Hence the deficiency in the amount of CO , obtained in the above experiments .
I hope to give my attention to this remarkable salt at a fuiture period .
In the analysis of the salts of mauveinle great care has to be taken in drying them thoroughly , as most of them are highly hygroscopic .
I am now engao , ed in the study of the replaceable hydrogen in mauveine , which I hope will throw some light upon its constitution .
From its formula I believe it to be a tetramine , although up to the present time I have not obtained any definite salts with more than 1 equiv. of acid .
When mauiveine is heated with aniline it produces a blue colouring matter , which will doubtless prove to be a phenyle derivative of that base .
A salt of mauveine when heated alone also produces a violet or blue compound .
These substances I am now examining , and hope in a short time to have the honour of communicating them to the Society .
