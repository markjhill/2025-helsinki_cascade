) Introduction .
In a previous paper* the morphology of this interesting species of trypanosome was described , and it is now proposed to give an account of its action on animals .
One of the first interesting points to be noted about this species is that , as far as is known , the warthog ( Phacochcerucetheopicus ) is the only animal among the wild game of this district which harbours it.f It is probable that it will also be found in the blood of the bush-pig , but not a single specimen of this animal has as yet been obtained by the Commission .
The warthog is numerous in the low country in this neighbourhood , which accounts for the large number of tsetse flies found to be infected with Trypanosoma simice .
X It is to be regretted that this species was not named after the warthog instead of the monkey , but at the time the name Simice was taken the Commission was ignorant of the close connection which exists between the former animal and this parasite .
Another interesting feature in regard to this trypanosome is the virulence it displays towards monkeys and the domestic pig , killing these animals in an incredibly short period of time , whereas it is harmless to oxen , antelope , dogs , and the smaller experimental animals .
Curiously enough , this trypanosome also infects goats and sheep , although oxen and antelope escape .
The rapidity with which the virulence of T. simice becomes modified is also remarkable .
When a cage containing wild Glossina morsitans is placed on a monkey and a goat , both animals take the disease , and the monkey in such an acute form that the average duration of life is only a few days .
But if it is attempted to pass T. simice from an infected goat to a healthy monkey by the inoculation of the goat 's blood , the experiment usually fails , showing * ' Roy .

49 that a short sojourn in the blood of the goat has almost nullified the virulence of the parasite for the monkey .
T. simice belongs to the same group as and it is curious that in the latter species this loss of virulence also occurs .
If T. which is usually more or less infective to the monkey , dog , and rat , lives for some time in the blood of the goat , it loses its power of infecting the other animals .
This has given rise to the erroneous idea that a separate species\#151 ; T. nanum\#151 ; exists .
T. nanum is in truth nothing but a strain of T. pecorum which has lost its virulence for these other animals by its passage through the goat .
T. simice is also like T. pecorum in general appearance , and in fact it is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between a short individual of the former species and a long one of the latter .
The average length of T. simice is 17 5 microns , with a minimum of 14 ; the average length of T. pecorum is 14 microns , with a maximum of 18 .
When the coloured plates of the two species are compared this resemblance is at once seen .
There is the same well-developed undulating membrane , the same oval nucleus , situated about the middle of the body , and the same eccentrically-placed micronucleus , often appearing to project beyond the margin , as noted in the description of the morphology of T. simice .
These two species , however , differ essentially in their action on animals .
Whereas T. simice expends its virulence on monkeys- and pigs , T. pecorum is especially fatal to cattle , goats , sheep , and dogs .

Action of T. simise on Horses , Oxen , and Antelope.\#151 ; There has been no opportunity of testing the action of T. on equines .
Four oxen were inoculated , two from an infected monkey and two from a goat , but all four remained in good health .
Five antelope in confinement were also inoculated without result , and it would seem that these animals are really refractory , since in no instance has T. simice ever been found in the blood of antelope .
Disease set up in Goats and Sheep by T. simise.\#151 ; Thirty-one goats and one sheep were infected by this parasite , as the result of various experiments .
Fifteen of these were used in wild G. feeding experiments , three had warthog blood injected into them , and 14 were inoculated with the blood of infected experimental animals .
It has already been remarked that this species of trypanosome varies rapidly in its virulence or power of setting up disease in animals .
Its virulence would appear to be exalted by passage through the " fly , " or , at least , to have reached its highest virulence after passage through the " fly , " and lowered by passage through certain animals .
For example , of the 15 goats infected by the bite of the " fly , " 13 died , on an average , in 46 days , and only two recovered .
The three goats which were infected by the direct injection of warthog blood all recovered ; this is curious when it is remembered that in all probability the " fly " must get its infection solely from this animal .
Six goats were injected with the blood of " fly " -infected monkeys ; only one died , four recovered , and one proved refractory .
Sir D. Bruce and others .
Trypanosomes of Six goats were also infected from goats ; of these , three died and three recovered .
This variation in virulence may also be expressed , for the sake of clearness , in the following table:\#151 ; Table II.\#151 ; Mortality among Goats infected in Various Ways by Mode of Infection .

Monkey blood , injection of .
Gl-oat blood , 1 injection of .
Percentage of deaths 86 -7 t 0-0 16-7 50-0 No. of goats employed 15 3 6 6 What does this table show ?
It is meant to show that if goats are infected with T. simice directly by the bite of the " fly , " most of them will die , whereas if the parasite is passed for a generation or two through goats , monkeys , or the warthog , the rate of mortality for the goat will fall .
But it may be objected that the six goats which were infected with goat 's blood have a mortality of 50 per cent. , which is almost as large as the wild G- .
morsitans feeding experiments .
But if Table I be referred to , it will be found that the three fatal cases were inoculated with blood from a goat which had only recently\#151 ; some 10 days\#151 ; been infected by the bite of the " fly , " and ought , on account of the shortness of the time , to be included in the first , or " fly " -feeding , column ; the other three , non-fatal cases , from goats infected by the injection of warthog 's blood , should be included in the second column .
If this were done , then the table would appear as follows:\#151 ; Table III .

Percentage of deaths 90-0 o-o 16 7 No. of goats employed 6 6 It must be confessed , however , that the numbers are small and subject to a large margin of error , but the figures seem sufficiently remarkable to merit record .
It may also be remarked that the matter is of little practical the Domestic Animals 55 importance , as under natural conditions goats will always be infected by the bite of the " fly " ; but it is interesting as showing the fallacy of judging from the action of laboratory strains as to what will occur in nature .
Among the goats infected by wild there are many cases of mixed infection .
On referring to Table I it will be seen that there are 15 cases of infection by wild G. morsitans among the goats .
Of these , only three were cases of pure infection with T. the remaining 12 were mixed infections .
These three died , on an average , in 32 days .
There were 12 cases of mixed infection ; of these , one recovered and the remaining 11 died , on an average , in 49 days .
From this it would appear that T. simice , acting alone , is as rapidly fatal to goats as it is when occurring in various combinations with T. T. pecorum , or T. caprce .
T. simice infection , when the result of the bite of the " fly , " must therefore be looked upon as a fairly deadly enemy to goats .
During life this disease of goats is not marked by any special symptoms .
There are neither swellings of the body , limbs , or face , nor corneal opacities , as is sometimes the case in other trypanosome diseases of goats : the animal merely becomes more and more anaemic and emaciated , and finally dies of exhaustion .
Disease set up in the Domestic Pig by T. simise.\#151 ; In the whole range of the trypanosome diseases of animals there is surely nothing so striking as the rapidly fatal action of T. simice on the .
domestic pig .
In nine experiments the average duration was only 5'3 days .
This , not from the time of the appearance of the trypanosomes in the blood , but from the date of infection .
Further , this rapid action is not the result of an exaltation of virulence by numerous passages through the pig , but natural to the trypanosome .
In regard to the symptoms of the disease during life , nothing noteworthy happens owing to the rapidity of the disease .
Disease set up in the Monkey by T. simise \#151 ; This trypanosome is also remarkably fatal to the monkey .
In 20 experiments with wild G. morsitans 17 monkeys died , the duration , on an average , being only 9*5 days from the day the flies were fed .
Three are still alive after 318 , 159 , and 74 days , and have evidently recovered .
When a monkey is inoculated with blood from an infected monkey the result is the same , the duration in five cases being 10'6 days .
It will be seen , however , from Table I , that these five monkeys were all inoculated with blood from monkeys which had only very recently been infected by the bite of the " fly .
" On the other hand , when a monkey is inoculated with blood from a goat infected with T. simice , the result , as a rule , is negative .
Ten monkeys were inoculated with blood of .
56 Sir D. Bruce and others .
Trypanosomes of " fly ''-bitten goats and only one became infected ; the other nine remained negative although the trypanosome had only been in the goats an average of 23 days .
From this it would appear that loses its virulence for the monkey if exposed to the action of the living goat 's blood for even so short a period as 12 or 14 days .
Action of T. simile on the Dog.\#151 ; The dog appears to be immune to this species of trypanosome .
Many experiments were made by feeding wild G. morsitanson dogs and by inoculating the blood of infected goats and monkeys .
In not a single case did the trypanosomes appear in the blood nor did the dogs appear to be affected in any way .
But in two " fly feeding experiments ( 211 and 436 ) , although T. simice did not appear in the blood of the dogs on microscopical examination , yet the injection of their blood into monkeys gave rise to an infection with T. simice , showing that the parasite was present although in numbers too small to be detected by the microscope .
It is possible , then , that the dog may act as a reservoir of this disease , but most improbable that it does so to any practical extent .
Action of T. simise on Babbits.\#151 ; The rabbit seems also to be practically immune to this disease .
The injection of blood from infected goats , pigs , and monkeys has no effect .
But on two occasions after feeding wild G. morsitans on rabbits , T. simice appeared in their blood , in one case ( Experiment 1714 ) in large numbers , in the other ( Experiment 1827 ) only rarely .
Both these were examples of mixed infection , the former of T. simice and T. pecorum , the latter of T. simice , T. and T. brucei .
It was attempted to infect a rabbit by feeding on it a fly which was known to be infective with pure T. simice , but with no result .
This susceptibility , or non-susceptibility , of rabbits to T. simice is perhaps not a very important matter , but the experiments go to show that the natural mode of infection of trypanosome diseases by means of the " fly " is probably the most effective .
Action of T. siiniee on Guinea-pigs and Bats.\#151 ; Both these species of animals appear to be refractory .
