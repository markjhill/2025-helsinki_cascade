In 1877* I had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society the results of some determinations of the specific inductive capacity of glass , the results being obtained with comparatively low electromotive forces and periods of charge and discharge of sensible duration .
In 1878 Mr. Gordon !
presented to the Royal Society results of experiments , some of them upon precisely similar glasses , by a quite different method , with much greater electromotive forces and with very short times of charge and discharge .
Mr. Gordon 's results and my own are compared in the following table :\#151 ; Gordon .

I have now repeated my own experiments with greater battery power , and with a new key for effecting the connexions of the condensers , and have obtained substantially the same results as before .
Two hypotheses suggest themselves as to the physical properties of glasses which might , if true , account for the diversity of results :\#151 ; ( i. ) In my own earlier experiments a considerable time elapsed , during which some have thought residual charge might flow from the glass condenser and go to swell the capacity determined .
Sir W. Mdccclxxxi .
* Phil. Trans. , 1878 , Part I. t Phil. Trans. , 1879 , Part I. 3 A DR. J. HOPNlNSON ON THE ELECTROSTATIC Thomson had informed me that experiments had proved that the capacity of a good insulating glass is sensibly the same , whether the period of discharge be the ten- or twenty-thousandth of a second , or say one-quarter of a second .
This statement has been verified , ( ii .
) It appeared plausible to suppose that specific inductive capacity of glass was not a constant , but was a function of the electromotive force\#151 ; in other charge of glass condenser words , that the ratio L was less when the electromotive force was difference of potential great than when it was small .
This surmise gains some force from Dr. Kerr 's electro-optical results , which show that electrostatic and optical disturbance of a dielectric are not superposable .
It has , however , been submitted to a direct test , with the result that , within the limits tried , specific inductive capacity a constant , and that it is not possible that the discrepancy of experimental results can be thus explained .
Finally , I have made a rough model of Mr. Gordon 's five-plate balance , and used it to make determinations of specific inductive capacity .
Firstly , a brass plate was tried , and its capacity was found less than unity instead of infinite .
Secondly , by varying the distances of the plates of the balance from each other , different values of the specific inductive capacity of the same glass were obtained .
In fact , it has been shown that the five-plate induction balance cannot be freely relied upon to give correct values of specific inductive capacity .
I conclude that the values I published in 1877 are substantially accurate , whether the period of discharge be -20000 or i second , whether the electromotive force be one volt per millimetre or 500 volts per millimetre , and that Mr. Gordon 's different result is to be explained by a defect in the method he used .
( I. ) To prove that a condenser of well-insulated glass may he almost completely discharged in 2"ocToo second .
For this experiment it is essential that the effect of conduction over the surface of the glass should be insensible .
A jar , such as that used in Sir W. Thomson 's electrometer , is unsuitable .
The proper form for the condenser is a flask with a thin body and a thick neck , filled with strong sulphuric acid to the neck .
Such a flask of light flint glass was prepared , and was instantaneously discharged in the following manner :\#151 ; The interior of the flask was connected to a metal block , A. Upon this block rests a little L-shaped metal piece , B , which can turn on a knife edge , C. A and C are carried on a block of ebonite , and are therefore insulated .
D is a piece of metal connected to earth , and rigidly attached to the extremity of a pendulum .
The pendulum is drawn aside and let go ; the piece D strikes B and puts the jar to earth , and instantly afterwards breaks the contact with A , and drives away the piece B. In all cases the pendulum was drawn aside 4 5 ' , and in all the experiments but one mentioned below it made 93 half-oscillations per minute .
The duration of the discharge was CAPACITY OF GLASS , AND OF LIQUIDS .
determined by the following method , which I arranged for myself , unaware that a similar method had been used by Mr. Sabine.* A condenser of known capacity is connected to A through a known resistance ; the condenser receives a known charge whilst connected to the electrometer ; the piece B is struck by the pendulum , and the Fig. 1 .
remaining charge is observed .
Two experiments were made ; in each the condenser was of tinfoil and paraffin , such as are used by Messrs. Clark , Muirhead , and Co. for telegraph purposes , and had a capacity of 0*29 microfarad .
The resistances were respectively 512 ohms and 256 ohms .
The results gave respectively duration of discharge 0 0000592 second and 0*0000595 second .
We may take it that the duration of discharge was less than 0*00006 second .
The condenser was now replaced by the flask .
The flask was charged for some seconds from the battery , was insulated and discharged by the pendulum , and the remaining charge read off on the electrometer so soon as the image came to rest .
In a first experiment the charge was from four elements ( =444 divisions of the scale ) , and the charge remaining gave deflection 34 divisions .
In a second experiment the charge was from eight elements ( = 888 divisions ) , and the remaining charge was 61 divisions .
Even this small residual charge is largely due to the inductive action of the needle of the electrometer on the quadrant connected to the flask .
To prove this , the experiment was varied by beginning with the quadrant separated from the flask , and only connecting these after discharge had been made .
With eight battery elements , the remaining charge in the flask was found to be 25 divisions ; with 20 elements , 61 divisions .
From these experiments we may conclude that , if a flask of light flint glass be charged for some seconds and be discharged for 0*00006 second , the residual charge coming out in the next three or four seconds is certainly less than 3 per cent , of the original charge .
It * Philosophical Magazine , May , 1876 .
was important to learn if this 3 per cent , was sensibly diminished if the time of discharge was somewhat increased .
For this purpose the time of oscillation was increased , and the arrangement of piece B and knife-edge C was duplicated , so that the flask was twice discharged within an interval of about -g1^- second between .
The result was , with charge from eight elements and the flask initially connected to the Fig. 2 .
quadrant , a remaining charge of 61 divisions , exactly the same as when the discharge only lasted tjoWo second .
I conclude that , with this glass , it matters not whether the discharge of the flask last ttooo second or ^ second ; its capacity is the same .
This is in precise accord with what Sir W. Thomson told me before I began the experiments for my former paper .
( II .
) Determinations with the guard ring condenser * It has been suggested that my former results were liable to uncertainty from the small potentials used and from the comparatively long time of discharge .
The main purpose of the present experiments has been to ascertain the force of the objections .
As the principle of the method is the same as in the earlier paper , it is only needful to explain the alterations the apparatus have undergone .
The battery.\#151 ; A chloride of silver battery of 1000 elements was constructed and very carefully insulated , both as regards cell from cell and tray from tray .
Each tray contained 50 cells and the set of 20 trays was conveniently enclosed in a wooden case provided with suitable terminals .
As my experience of the battery is but short * The cost of the additional instruments used has been defrayed by a Royal Society Grant .
The battery and some of the other instruments were made by Messrs. L. Clark , Muirhead , and Co. , the remainder by Mr. Groves .
CAPACITY OP GLASS , AND OP LIQUIDS .
I shall not now minutely describe its details , it is sufficient to say that by connecting its middle to earth two condensers can be charged to equal and opposite potentials of 500 elements .
The guard-ring condenser.\#151 ; This is the instrument of my former experiments , with the switch removed and some slight improvements in mechanical detail .
It is by no means perfect in workmanship , and the irregularities of the results now to be given are to be attributed to such imperfections .
It was not worth while to make a new instrument , as , for any present interest , determinations of capacities of glasses , correct to 1 per cent. , are as valuable as if they were absolutely accurate .
The sliding condensers.\#151 ; Two sliding condensers were constructed possessing together a very considerable range of capacity .
Each has a single scale and is used as before merely as a balance to the guard ring condenser , excepting in one experiment , the subject of the next section .
The switch.\#151 ; The switch formerly used performed the following operations:\#151 ; Initially , the quadrant of the electrometer was to earth , the guard ring and the plates of the guard ring condenser were connected to one pole of the battery , the sliding condenser to the other pole .
On turning the handle the quadrant and the condensers were insulated ; next , the charges of the condensers were mixed , the guard ring being put to earth at the same time ; and , finally , the connected condensers were connected to the quadrant of the electrometer ; they remained so connected until the handle of the switch was turned back into its first position .
This instrument could not be used to Pig .

The new switch was arranged to effect the further operation of breaking contact between the condensers and the quadrant immediately after the contact was made .
It is also arranged for much higher insulation , the old switch being quite useless for the greater battery power used .

The connecting wires are insulated with gutta-percha , covered with a metallic tape as an induction shield , this tape being of course connected to earth .
The mode of experiment was substantially as before .
A glass plate was introduced in the guard ring condenser , and the sliding condenser adjusted till the capacities were equal ; the glass plate was removed and the guard ring condenser , with air as its only dielectric , was adjusted till its capacity was equal to that of the sliding condenser .
In every case the battery was reversed and the mean taken .

hopkinson on the electrostatic Remark.\#151 ; On account of the small thickness of the equivalent plate of air , -3T- inch , this result is subject to a greater probable error than the others .
No inconvenience or uncertainty was experienced from the effect of residual charge .
If the screw ( m , figs. 3 , 4 , pp. 359 , 360 ) be lowered so that contact with the electrometer is not broken , observation becomes at once impossible .
These results show that my former experiments require no material correction , except in the case of plate glass , for which an accurate experiment was formerly impossible .
They also show that electrostatic capacity does not depend on electromotive force up to 200 volts per centimetre for double extra-dense flint , and a somewhat higher electromotive force for the other glasses .
It is desirable to show that the same is true for a wider range .

In this case the guard ring condenser was always charged with 700 elements , the slide with 300 in order that the same sliding condenser might be used .
Boltzmann gives 2'32 for paraffin for short times of discharge .
( III .
) To show that K is a consta , is generally assumed .
Dr. De La Rue very kindly allowed me to try a few preliminary experiments last February with his great chloride of silver battery .
A flask of extra-dense flint glass was used , insulated with sulphuric acid precisely as in my experiments on residual charge .
The comparison was made with a large sliding condenser having a scale graduated in millimetres .
Taking one division of the scale ( = about 0'0000026 microfarad ) as a temporary unit of capacity , I found it impossible to say whether the capacity of the flask was greater or less than 390 divisions , whether the charge in each condenser was 20 elements or 1800 elements .
Subsequently a similar experiment was tried with my own battery and a flask of light flint , with the following results , each being the mean of four readings :\#151 ; CAPACITY OF GLASS , AND OF LIQUIDS .
Charge to each condenser Capacity in millim. divisions in Ag .

10 27375 100 274-00 200 27375 300 274-5 400 273-0 500 273-5 The mean of these is 273"75 , and the greatest variation from the mean 0'28 per cent. The conclusion has some considerable importance , for some conceivable molecular theories of specific inductive capacities would lead to the result that capacity would be less when the charge became very great , as is actually the case with the magnetic permeability of iron ( vide Maxwell , vol. ii .
, chapter vi .
) .
The flasks tried are about 1 millim. thick .
I intend to try a very thin glass bulb , testing it to destruction .
[ In order to extend the limits of this test , a thin bulb 29 millims. diameter was blown on a piece of thermometer tube and its capacity compared with the sliding condenser with varying charge , as follows :\#151 ; 100 battery elements to each condenser , capacity of bulb was 297 scale divisions .
300 elements , capacity=297 divisions .
500 elements , capacity=2 9 7-| divisions .
The bulb was afterwards broken and the thickness of the fragments measured ; they ranged from 0"05 to 0"15 millim. , the major portion being about 0"1 millim. We may conclude with confidence that the value of K for the glass tested continues constant up to 5000 volts per millimeter.\#151 ; Dec. 9 , 1880 .
] An experiment was subsequently tried to ascertain if specific inductive capacity varied with the temperature of the dielectric .
Accurate results could not be obtained , owing to the expansion of the acid , causing it to rise in the neck of the flask .
The result of the single experiment tried was , however , that the flask at 14 ' C. had a capacity equal to 275 divisions of the sliding condenser ; at 60 ' C. it was equal to 280 divisions .
Having regard to the increase of capacity due both to the expansion of the glass ( which may safely be neglected ) and to the expansion of the acid ( which is material ) , we can only conclude that the capacity of glasses certainly does not change rapidly with temperature\#151 ; that consideration of temperature cannot be expected to reconcile Professor Maxwell 's theory with the results of experiment .
I have repeated the temperature experiment with greater care .
The flask was cleansed , filled a little short of the shoulder with acid , and arranged for heating and testing as before .
In order to avoid the effect of rising of the level of the acid from expansion , the flask was heated to its highest temperature before any observation .
3 b 2 It was assumed that on cooling the surface of the flask would continue to conduct to the level at which the acid had been .
The following table gives the results of the experiment:\#151 ; Temperature Centigrade .

We may conclude , 1 think safely , that the specific inductive capacity of light flint does increase slightly , but that the increase from 12 ' to 83 ' does not exceed 2|- per cent. The conductivity of the same glass* increases about 100-fold between the same temperature , and the residual charge also increases greatly .
( IY .
) Examination of the method of the five-plate induction balance .
The theoretical accuracy of this method rests on the assumption that the distance between the plates may be considered small in comparison with their diameter .
When this condition is not sufficiently considered , it is easy to see that it is not likely that correct results will in all cases be obtained , for suppose that in lieu of the plate of glass a thin sheet of metal of considerable size is interposed between the fourth and fifth plates of the balance , it ought to be needful to withdraw the fifth plate by an amount equal to the thickness of the sheet .
One can apprehend that it will be actually necessary to push it in , but to an extent which it would not be easy to calculate .
Some doubt is also thrown upon the practical accuracy of the method by the fact that Mr. Gordon has arrived at the very unexpected result that the specific inductive capacities of glasses change with the lapse of time .
In order to satisfy myself on the point I had a rough model of a five-plate induction balance made .
The instrument is far too rough to give minutely accurate results if the method were good , but I believe it is sufficient to show rapidly that it cannot be used with safety .
The insulation was not perfect , and no attempt was made to enclose the instrument or shield the connexions from casual inductive action .
The plates are all 4 millims. thick ; they are , as in Mr. Gordon 's apparatus , 6 and 4 inches diameter .
Each plate is suspended in a vertical plane by two rods and hooks from * " Residual Charge of the Leyden Jar , " Phil. Trans. , 1877 .
CAPACITY OF GLASS , AND OF LIQUIDS .
two of a set of four horizontal rods of varnished glass .
The plates can thus be placed parallel to each other at any distance apart that may be desired .
The distance between the plates was measured by a pair of common callipers and a millimeter rule to the nearest \ njillimeter .
For convenience , let the plates be named A , B , C , D , E , as Fig. 5 .
Half full size .
in the accompanying diagram .
In a first experiment B and D were respectively connected to the quadrants of an electrometer of which the jar was charged in the usual way .
A and E were connected to one pole of a battery of 20 AgCl elements , C to the other pole through an ordinary electrometer reversing key , E was adjusted till the disturbance of the image was a minimum , when the key was reversed .
This method was unsatisfactory , probably because in the act of reversing all the plates A , C , E were momentarily connected to one of the poles , and also because the insulation of the plates B , D was imperfect .
The experiments , however , sufficed to prove beyond doubt that the instrument gave diminishing values to the specific inductive capacity of glass , as the distance of the five plates from each other was increased from 12 millims. to 32 millims. , also that it gave values less than unity for the specific inductive capacity of brass in the form of a plate 3*5 millims. thick .
More satisfactory working was attained by approximating , so far as my instruments admitted , to the methods of Mr. Gordon .
B and D were , as before , connected to the quadrants , C was connected to the interior of the jar and to one pole of an ordinary induction coil ; A and E to the case of the instrument and to the other pole of the induction coil .
The plate E was adjusted till the working of the coil caused no deflection of the image on the scale .
In each case the plate examined was placed approximately half-way between D and E. The following table gives results of a plate of double extra-dense flint 24*75 millims. thick and 235 millims. diameter , and on a plate of brass 3*5 millims. thick and 242 millims. diameter .

Electrostatic Capacity of Liquids .
" Received January 6 , \#151 ; Read January 27 , 1881 .
The number of substances suitable for an exact test of Professor Maxwell 's electromagnetic theory of light is comparatively limited .
Amongst solids , besides glass , Iceland spar , fluor spar , and quartz have been examined by Romich and Nowak , t giving results for specific inductive capacity much in excess of the square of the refractive index .
On the other hand , the same observers , with Boltzmann , obtain for sulphur a value of the capacity in reasonable accord with theory .
On liquids the only satisfactory experiments are those of SilowJ on turpentine and petroleum oil , in which the capacity is precisely equal to the square of the refractive index for long waves .
Silow finally obtains for long waves and capacity\#151 ; / t oo .

1-482 1-483 A comparison of the whole of the substances which have been examined indicates the generalisation that bodies similar in chemical composition to salts , compounds of an acid , or acids and bases , have capacities much greater than the square of the refractive index , whilst hydrocarbons , such as paraffin and turpentine , cannot be said with certainty to differ from theory one way or the other .
It seemed desirable to test this conclusion by experiments on animal and vegetable oils and on other paraffins .
It was probable that the compounds of fatty acids and glycerine would have high capacities .
Samples were tested of colza oil , linseed oil , neatsfoot oil , sperm oil , olive oil , castor oil , turpentine , bisulphide of carbon , caoutchoucine , the paraffin actually in use for the electrometer lamp , and three widely different mineral oils kindly given to me by Mr. F. Field , F.R.S. , to whom I am indebted for the boiling points given below .
The method of experiment was very simple .
The sample was first roughly tested for insulation .
It was found that it was useless to attempt the samples of colza or linseed oils , of caoutchoucine , or of bisulphide of carbon , but that the rest had sufficient insulation for the tolerably rapid method I was able to use .
The fluid condenser consisted of a double cylinder to contain the fluid , in which an * The abstract of this paper is published in the Proceedings under the title " Dielectric Capacity of Liquids .

insulated cylinder could hang ; three brass rods suspended the latter from an ebonite ring which rested on three legs rising from the outer cylinder of the annular vessel .
The position of the insulated cylinder was geometrically determined by three brass stops ( a , a , a ) which abutted against the legs which carried the ring , six points being thus fixed .
A dummy ebonite ring with three brass rods , but without the cylinder , was provided for the purpose of determining the capacity of all parts and connexions not immersed in fluid .

Half full size .
The condenser was balanced against a sliding condenser , first with air and then with fluid .
The key which was used for experiments on plates was used here also , leaving the piece connected to the guard ring idle .
The capacity of the sliding condenser was first tested with the result that to the reading of the slide 82*2 must be added to obtain the capacity in terms of the millimeter divisions of the scale .
The capacity of the fluid condenser empty , with its connexions , was 106*5 divisions .
The capacity of the dummy and connexions was 7*7 , so that the net capacity of the fluid condenser was 98*8 .
In all cases 1000 AgCl elements were tried , these being divided between the two condensers .
The following tables give the results obtained :\#151 ; Column I. is the number of elements charging the fluid condenser , the complement being used on the sliding condenser .

Two determinations of this oil were made some days apart ; at the time of the first determination the oil was slightly turbid .
In the interval before determining the refractive index the upper portion became clear , the heavier particles having settled down .
The capacity of the clear oil was then determined , and the results are given in the second table .
It is possible that if the oil remain quiescent for a longer time a further reduction may be observed .

Turpentine .
A satisfactory determination for turpentine was not obtained .
The turpentine seemed to act on the material of the vessel .
After being in the condenser a short time its insulation was much reduced .
When the charge had a potential of about 600 elements the condenser discharged itself disruptively through the turpentine .
However , with a charge of 100 elements on each condenser a balance was obtained at 228"2 , indicating a specific inductive capacity 2'23 .
The refractive indices were determined from the same samples as the capacities in the usual way by the minimum deviation of a fluid prism .
The spectrometer was the same I had previously used for experiments on glass ( Proc. Roy .

It must , however , never be forgotten that the time of disturbance in the actual optical experiment is many thousands of million times as short as in the fastest electrical experiment even when the condenser is charged or discharged for only the -30000 second .
