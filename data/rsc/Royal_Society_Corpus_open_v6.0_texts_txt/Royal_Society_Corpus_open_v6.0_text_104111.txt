An Account of an extraordinary Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the Month of March , in the Year 1730 , extracted from the Meteorological Diary of that Year at Naples , communicated by Nichol .
Cyrillus , M. D. R. S. S. THE Thermometer used in this Diary , was made by Mr. Hauksbee , in which the Freezing-Point is marked at 65 Degrees under the Point extreme Hot ; but the Doctor observes , that at Naples Water will freeze when this Thermometer stands at 55 Degrees only : Which , he is of Opinion , seems to argue , that there is something else besides an intense Degree of Cold required for freezing Water ; that the Air of Naples abounds in it , more than the Air of London ; and that this may probably be of a saline Nature ; because when we turn Water into Ice by the Help of Snow , it is necessary to mix Salt with it .
