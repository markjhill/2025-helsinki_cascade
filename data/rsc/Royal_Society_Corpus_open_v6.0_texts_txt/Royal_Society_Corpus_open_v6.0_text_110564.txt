" Note on the Fluctuations of the Height of High-water due to changes in the Atmospheric Pressure .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , F.R. 4KG The author verified , both at Liverpool and at London , the exist ?
ence of a fact similar to that which M. Daussy had ascertained at Breast , namely , the rise of the ocean when the barometer is depressed ; and remarks that the correction due to changes in the atmospheric pressure is by no means inconsiderable .
He suggests the question whether the surface of the ocean rises in narrow seas simultaneously with the depression of the barometer , or otherwise .
With a view to the solution of this question , he gives atabular diagram showing the correspondence between the calculated and the observed heights , in their relation to the heights of the barometer at Liverpool and at London , from which it would appear that the effect of changes in the atmospheric pressure on the tide is immediate .
