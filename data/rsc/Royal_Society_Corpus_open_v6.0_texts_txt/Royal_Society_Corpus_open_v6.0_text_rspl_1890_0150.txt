The ordinary method of isolating chromatin employed in chemical and physiological laboratories cannot be readily applied in testing the correctness of this supposition .
It is conceivable that this substance absorbs and retains tenaciously iron-holding compounds as readily as it does some of the dyes used by the histologist .
It is not easy to remove such compounds without , possibly , decomposing the chromatin , and , when the latter is prepared in any quantity , one cannot be certain that the iron which is present may not be an impurity .
To overcome this difficulty , one must prepare chromatin from organs which are free from haematin or like substances , or from inorganic iron compounds , and , for this purpose , fairly large quantities would be necessary for chemical manipulation .
There is , apparently , no organ , animal or vegetable , which offers such an opportunity .
There consequently remains but one other way by which the view , that iron is constantly present in chromatin , can be put to the proof , and that is the micro-chemical one .
I have found that a certain method of employing ammonium sulphide as a reagent for iron shows the presence of the latter in the chromatin of the nuclei of a very large number of species of cells hardened in alcohol .
The iron in this case does not occur combined as an albuminate , but rather in a condition which , as regards the firmness of the combination , is comparable to that present in potassium ferrocyanide or haematin .
That the iron found is not due to the presence of haematin is shown by the results of experiments made with vegetable cells , and with animal cells which one would not naturally expect to contain haematin , as , for example , those of the corneal epithelium in Amphibia .
In support of this may also be mentioned the fact that where chromatin is very abundant the iron reaction is very marked , while it is feeble in cells poor in chromatin .
In the chromatin loops and filaments of karyokinetic figures the iron reaction is intense and sharply confined to these structures .
I forego , for the present , any expression of opinion as to the general application of the results obtained .
I would not even maintain that the chromatin of every cell essentially contains iron , although my studies have , so far , not furnished an instance which can support the contrary view .
