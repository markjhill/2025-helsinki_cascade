" Notice relative to the form of the Blood-particles of the Ornithorhynchus hystrix .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. A portion of the blood of the Ornithorhynchus hystrix , mixed when fresh with a strong solution of common salt , being examined by the author , exhibited a few globules of irregular shape .
Another portion , preserved in syrup , contained numerous globules , most of which had an irregular form , but many were circular ; none , how* ever , were elliptical , like those of birds .
Hence the author concludes , that in form they accord more with those of Mammalia .
