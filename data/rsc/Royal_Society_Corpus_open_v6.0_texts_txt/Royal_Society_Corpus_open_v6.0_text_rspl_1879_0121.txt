( Abstract .
) .
Refe\#153 ; g to a former Part ( " Phil. Trans , " 1858 , p. 43 ) the author gives , m the present , descriptions of subsequently received fossils of Megalama prisca , advancing the knowledge of that species of large extinct lizard .
Characters of the dorsal , sacral , and caudal vertebne , with those of a considerable portion of the skull , are detailed .
So much of the upper jaw as is preserved shows the species to have had that part sheathed with horn , as in the tortoise .
Upon the head were seven horns , three in pairs and one single ; they are defined as the " supraparietal , " " supratemporal " and " post-orbital " pairs ; the single and symmetrical horn is " nasal .
" In the comparison of this character with the known srenera of lizards , the author finds the closest correspondence in the diminutive existing .Australian species , Aloloch howidus , Gray .
He concludes with lemarks on the probable habits and conditions of extinction of the subject of his two papers .
The cranial fossils were discovered by George Frederic Bennett , Esq. , Corr. Member of the Zoological Society of London , in the bed of King s Creek , ' Queensland , Australia ; and were transmitted to the author by George Bennett , M.D. , F.L S.
