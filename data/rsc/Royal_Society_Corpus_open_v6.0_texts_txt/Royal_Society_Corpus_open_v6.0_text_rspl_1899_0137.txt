A.\#151 ; Thermo-electric difference between free wires and wires previously subjected to longitudinal extension and lateral , by drawing them through the holes of a draw-plate ( SS 1\#151 ; 7 ) .
S1 .
In Part I of this paper , read to the Society on 2nd February , 1899 , the object of the experiments was stated to be the determination of the magnitude of the thermo-electric effects , obtained from any one metal strained and unstrained .
The results then given were obtained from two wires of the same material , one wire being previously drawn through a draw-plate , so as to reduce it in size from No. 18 standard gauge ( 0'122 cm .
diameter ) to about No. 24 standard gauge ( 00559 cm .
diameter ) .
