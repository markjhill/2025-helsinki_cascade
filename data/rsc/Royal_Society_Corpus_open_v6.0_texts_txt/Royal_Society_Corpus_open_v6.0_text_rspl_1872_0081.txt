" On a tendency observed in Sun-spots to change alternately from the one Solar Hemisphere to the otherBy Warren De La Rue , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , Balfour Stewart , LL. D. , F.R.S. , and Benjamin Loewy , F.R.A.S. Received June 12 , 1873 .
1 .
Hitherto in our reductions we have summed up the spotted areas of the various groups occurring on the sun 's surface on any day , and have regarded their sum as a representation of the spot-activity for that day .
It has occurred to us to see what result we should obtain by taking instead for each day the excess of the spotted area in the one solar hemisphere above that in the other .
2 .
On adopting this method , it soon became evident that during periods of great disturbance there is a tendency in spots to change alternately from the north or positive to the south or negative hemisphere , and vice versa , the period of such change being about 25 days .
When , on the other hand , the solar disturbance is inconsiderable , the spots do not present any such systematic oscillation .
3 .
We have graphically represented on the annexed diagram the results derived from this method during three of the most considerable periods of solar disturbance .
In this diagram the observed values of hemispherical excess are marked with an asterisk , and a curve is drawn so as to equalise their smaller irregularities .
The northern hemisphere is reckoned positive , and the southern negative .
The unit of area is , as before , the one millionth of the sun 's visible hemisphere .
4 .
The first of these three periods extends from the beginning of August to the end of December 1859 .
We derive from our diagram the following Table , exhibiting the maximum amounts of hemispherical excess , with their respective dates :\#151 ; Hemispherical excess .

We do not profess to have discovered the cause of these oscillations , but we would nevertheless suggest that the observational facts here brought to light may perhaps be connected with two other observational facts , the one of which was first brought to fight by Carrington , and the other by ourselves , Mr. W. K. Parker on the Structure [ June 19 , The first of these is the fact that , generally speaking , spots in the north hemisphere have much about the same latitude as those occurring at the same , or nearly the same , period in the south , both sets widening or contracting together .
We may perhaps , therefore , suppose , by applying this law , that the latitude of the spots which cause the positive extremes in the above series is not greatly different from that of those which canse the corresponding negative extremes .
The second observational law is that which tells us that spots about the same period have a tendency to attain their maximum at , or near , the same ecliptical longitude .
Now , if we suppose that in the foregoing three series the greatest positive extremes were caused by the positive spots attaining their greatest size , and the greatest negative extremes by the negative spots attaining their greatest size , it would follow that the two sets , positive and negative , must have taken their rise at places on the sun 's surface 180 ' of longitude different from each other , inasmuch as the one set about 12 or 13 days before , or after , passed ( let us say ) the same ecliptical longitude as the other .
But if the positive set have the same latitude as the negative , and if the one is 180 ' of solar longitude different from the other , it would mean that the two outbreaks are at opposite ends of the same solar diameter .
This conclusion is an interesting one ; but , of course , it requires to be verified by further observation before it be finally received .
Meanwhile we are engaged in mapping out systematically the positions of the various outbreaks upon the sun 's surface , and we shall soon , therefore , be able lo find whether or not there be any truth in this conjecture .

" On the Structure and Development of the Skull in the Pig ( Sus scrofa ) By W. K. Parker , F.B.S. Received May 17 , 1873 .
( Abstract .
) I have for some years past determined to concentrate my attention on some one type of Mammalian Skull , so as to be able to present to the Royal Society a paper similar to those which have already appeared other Vertebrate Skulls .
I was led to work out this medium type , and not a more generalized form , such as the Gruineapig ( see " On the Developing\#174 ; of the Prog 's Skull , " Phil. Trans. 1871 , p. 203 ) , through the circumstance ot an offer from my friend Mr. Charles Stewart to put some seventy embryoMg the Common Pig into my possession .
In the present communication I hnv\#174 ; had the invaluable help of advice and oversight from Professor whilst the labour of my hands has been lightened by my son , J. Parker , who prepared for me all the more delicate sections .
embryos ranged in size from two thirds , or less , of an inch in with the head only equal in size to a pea , whilst the head 0 largest specimen was the size of that of the Common Squirrel .
