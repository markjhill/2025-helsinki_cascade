) ( Abstract .
) The authors comment on the importance of the work done on the flora of the Palaeozoic period , and the botanical interest that would attach to similar petrifactions of plants from all ages of the Mesozoic period .
They have had the good fortune to find excellently preserved material from the Cretaceous of Northern Japan .
In the present paper they describe 18 plants from this material , which is extraordinarily rich .
As hitherto there has been very little known from anatomical material of plants of this age , the present paper is by no means final , but is in the nature of a pioneer chart of the ground .
The petrifaction of the cells of the plants is often extremely good , though the fragments are not so complete as could be desired .
The plant structures include stems , roots , leaves , cones , fern sporangia , and even an Angiospermic flower , the first petrifaction of a flower to be described .
The debris lie together in the nodules in much the same way that the ddbris lie in the Coal-balls of the Palaeozoic , though they are mixed with fragments of shells .
The latter are largely Ammonites and serve to determine the age of the petrifactions .
The flora as a whole represents an interesting mixed flora such as has not hitherto come to light among petrifactions .
Roughly speaking , the flora seems to have consisted of about one-third Angiosperms , slightly more than one-third Gymnosperms , and the rest of ferns and lower plants .
The anatomy of the early Angiosperms being such a desideratum in botany , their presence in the petrifactions renders them doubly interesting , and particularly when they are found in so evenly balanced a mixed flora .
All the specimens described in this paper were cut in Tokio in the botanical department by the authors .
The plants described are as follows:\#151 ; Petrosphceria japonica , gen .

The stem and petiole of a fern with a dictyostelic anatomy .
Probably allied to the Dicksoniacece .
Fern rootlets , in excellent state of preservation , showing the diarch stele of the leptosporangiate ferns .
Zamiophyllumcordaitiforme , gen .
et spec .

The leaf of what appears to be some plant of Cvcadean affinity , the anatomy bearing considerable resemblance to that of Cordaites .
Yezonia vulgaris , gen .
et spec .
nov .
A Gfymnosperm , of which stems , unthickened twigs , leafy axes , are all very plentiful .
It is the commonest plant in the material , and at the same time the most unique .
In the anatomy of both main axis and foliage it is not like any known type .
Yezostrobus Oliverii , gen .
et spec .
nov .
The fructification of a Gymnosperm , the cone hearing simple scales with seeds , one on each , which are like those of Cycads in some respects , but have a nucellus standing up entirely free from the integument with a well marked epidermis between .
Though continuity is lacking between these two plants , there seems considerable ground for suspecting them of belonging to the same plant from anatomical points of likeness .
Araucarioxylon tankoensis , spec .
nov .
Secondary wood , showing remarkably clear pittings in the transverse sections .
Cedroxylon Matsumurii , spec .

Well preserved secondary wood .
Cedroxylon Yendoii , spec .

Secondary wood , with traumatic resin canals .
Cunninghamiostrobus yubariensis , gen .
et spec .
nov .
A cone , as its name implies , belonging to the family of the Cunninghamias , with its external appearance partly .preserved and the cone scales and axis fairly well petrified .
The seeds have apparently been scattered .
Cryptomeriopsis antiqua , gen .

nov .
Stem with leaves attached , the foliage very like that of a Cryptomeria .
Saururopsis niponensis , gen .

The stem and attached roots of an Angiosperm , probably to be included in the Saururacese .

The secondary wood of an Angiosperm .
Sabiocaulis Sakurii , gen .

Minute stems , and older twigs of an Angiosperm , with cortex , and well preserved and characteristic anatomy .
Cretovariumjaponicum , gen .

The flower of an Angiosperm , of which there are several specimens .
Of this list of plants , the commonest , those which have yielded the greatest number of specimens in the course of the work , are Yezonia , Sabiocaulis , and Cretovarium .
It is noteworthy that these are among the most unusual and the most interesting of the plants .
The authors acknowledge much assistance in the work from the Eoyal Society Government Grant Committee , which made it possible for one of them ( M. C. S. ) to attempt the work ; and from the various departments of the Imperial Government of Japan in the course of collecting and preparing the material .
