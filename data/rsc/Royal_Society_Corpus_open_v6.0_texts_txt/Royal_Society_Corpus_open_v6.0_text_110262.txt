A paper was read , " On the effect of Water , raised to Tempera ?
tures moderately higher than that of the Atmosphere , upon Batrachian Reptiles .
" By Marshall Hall , M.D. , &amp;c. Dr. Edwards had found , by a series of experiments , that the batrachian reptiles , when immersed in hot water , live for a shorter time in proportion as the temperature of the water is higher ; and that at 108 ?
of Fahrenheit they die almost instantaneously .
The author of the present paper observes , that the extinction of life in these cases is owing to a cause of a more immediately destructive agency than the mere suspension of respiration : he finds that if only the head of the animal is placed under water of 120 ?
, the animal struggles , but soon ceasesto move j but if the spine as well as the limbs be immersed , convulsions supervene , and the muscles become rigid : in both cases the action of the heart continues .
If one of the limbs , which after the extinction of sensibility still remains flexible , be separated from the body , and placed in water of 120 ?
, its muscles contract and become rigid 3 this effect taking place first in the superficial , and next in the deep seated muscles .
When the nerve , separated from the other parts , was alone placed in hot water , the muscles were not affected : and when the muscles had been made to contractby hot water , they were no longer capable of being affected by irritations applied to the nerve .
The heart removed from the body , and placed in hot water , gradually contracted and remainedrigid .
Hencetheauthorconcludes that the death of the animal , when occasioned by the sudden application of heat to the surface , is not owing to asphyxia , but to a positive agency , destroying the functions of the nervous and mucular systems ; the muscles of involuntary motion being affected in like manner with those of voluntary motion .
