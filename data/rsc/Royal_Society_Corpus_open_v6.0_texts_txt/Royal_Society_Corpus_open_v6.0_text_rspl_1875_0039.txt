The results of the observations made by Piel.re and Kopp upon the boiling-points , specific gravities , and thermal expansibilities of the trichlorides and tribromides of phosphorus , arsenic , and money have led Kopp to suppose that the specilic volumes of phosphorus , arsemc , and antimony , in their liquid combinations , be identical .
The same condusion has been drawn with respect to tin , titanium , and silicon from Pierre 's observations upon the tetrachlorides of these elements* . .

In his original paper ICopp ) specific volume of antimony , from his observations on the the bromide , , is decidecUy larger than that of phosphorus arsenic .
But the la ] value is in to the atomic weight of antimony being takcu ns 129 If tho 284 .
T. horpe on the [ Feb. 1 The common value of , As , and Sb wouId appear to be about 27 ; of Si , Ti , and Sn about 35 .
But on examining the details of the observk tions , it bec.omes evident that this conclusion is not strictly borne out the results ; the lumbers obtained for the individual members of th4 group differ in many cases considerably from the common value , divergences being far wider than could arise from errors of either in the determination of the physical constants or in the estimatiol of the atomic veights of the constituent bodies .
In fact the order ol the divergences would seem to render it probable that the specific volume of the several members of family of elements increase with their atomie eights .
In a former communication to the Royal Society I given the resulh of a series of observations on the cific gravities , boiling-points , rate of expansion of certain liquid chlorides of phosphorus* .
Since Boscoo has that vanadium is a member of the phosphorus group of elea ments , it has appeared to me that comparison of the specific volumej of the nalogously oonstituted phosphoryl and vanadyl trichlorides might serve to throw additional light on this questiou of the relation of specific volumes of the members of a family of elements to their atomic weights .
JJethods of vation .
detailed ccount of the methods of observation of reduction and calculation employed in this series of researches is for a subsequent communication ; but in order to lender certain of the in this more intelligible , it be desirable to state that ] of nsion of the various liquids have been determined iu thermometer-shaped vessels ( dilatometers ) , graduated and tely e The rdings were made with a telescope with a micrometer eyepiece .
Three series of thermometers were employed , of which were obtained from Mr. Casella , and the third from Dr. Geissler , of Bonn ; for a description of these instrllments I refer to the pnper by Prof. Rucker and myself on the " " Expansion of -water by \ldquo ; All observntions of ture , unless otherwise stated , are converted into air-thermometer degrces by means of 's Tables the determination of the boiling-points the bulb of the thermometer as ] aced in the pour of the liquid .
