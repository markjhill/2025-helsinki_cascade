) ( Abstract .
) The principal aim of this paper was to test the nearness of possible approach to complete osmotic efficiency for strong solutions .
To this end the experimental verification of the exact physical equation given by A. W. Porter* was undertaken , a membrane having been constructed which could withstand osmotic pressures of calcium ferrocyanide up to 150 atmospheres without any sensible percolation of the solution .
It was found , notwithstanding many precautions , that the formula would not verify within about 3 per cent. But further consideration showed that this formula must refer to osmotic pressures in vacuo , whereas the experiments were necessarily conducted in air at atmospheric pressure .
Reconstructing the argument in terms of ideal osmotic partitions impermeable to air but permeable to the solution , the equation was modified so as to apply strictly to the quantities involved in the experimental determinations , which required the addition of the atmospheric pressure to the limits in the first and third of the integrals concerned in it .
The final results are given in the following table :\#151 ; I. W eiglit concentration .
