[ Jan. " Note on the Spectrum of / .i Centauri .
" By Sir Norman Lockyer , K.C.B. , LL. IL , Sc. D. , F.R.S. , and F. E. Baxandall , A.R.C.Sc .
Received January 4 , \#151 ; Read February 9 , 1905 .
An investigation of Pickering 's reproduction of this spectrum*\#151 ; which apparently consists of the spectrum of an Orion star + bright hydrogen lines and certain other bright lines of minor intensity___ suggested that the latter are radiation lines corresponding to some of the stronger absorption lines of a Cygni .
These a Cygni lines have previously been attributed to the enhanced lines of certain metals , chiefly Fe , Ti , Cr\gt ; Mg , and Si .
A close investigation has now shown that nearly all the most marked bright lines in / x Centauri\#151 ; other than those of hydrogen\#151 ; occupy positions closely corresponding to those of the most conspicuous enhanced lines of iron .
The wavedengths of some of the bright u Centauri lines are compared with those of the enhanced lines of iron and a. Cygni lines in the table at the end of this note .
The close agreement is very noticeable .
It is worth while , then , to analyse in detail Pickering 's statement in his notef on the p- Centauri spectrum .
He states : " Lines 49224 and 5015*8 are bright on the edge of greater wavedength .
" The lines whose wavedengths he gives are the helium-Orion absorption lines .
The only two enhanced iron lines in this region are at AA 492441 and 5018*63 , which occupy exactly the positions relatively to the helium lines which Pickering notes as being bright in the / x Centauri spectrum \#151 ; that is , they border the helium lines on the edge of greater wavelength .
Again , he says : " The two most conspicuous ( bright lines ) are at wave-lengths 4232 and 4584 approximately .
" Two of the most marked lines in the a Cygni spectrum are at AA 4233*25 and 4584*02 , and these undoubtedly correspond to the two most conspicuous enhanced lines of iron between Hs and Hp .
Again .
" Line 4387*8 is bright on the edge of shorter wave-length .
" In a Cygni there is a well-marked line at A 4385*55 , which agrees in position with another enhanced iron line .
Also : " A diffuse bright band appears on the side of shorter wavelength of the dark line 4531 *4 .
" There is a distinctive group of a Cygni \#151 ; enhanced iron lines at AA 4508*46 , 4515*51 , 4520*40 , 4522*69 , which , thrown together into an irresolvable group in / x Centauri , may well correspond to the diffuse line quoted by Pickering .
Further : " The dark line 4553*4 is superposed on a bright band .

[ Jan. 26 This bright band may very well correspond to the a Cygni enhanced iron lines 4549-64 and 4556-06 thrown together in the Centauri spectrum .
It is possible , though , that the dark line 4553-4 , quoted by Pickering , is only the dark interspace between the bright 4549-64 and 4556*06 lines .
It may be here remarked that among the brightest lines in the spectra of Novae at their initial stages are lines agreeing in position with the most marked a Cygni and enhanced Fe lines , and in this way we trace a resemblance between the minor bright lines of Centauri and the most conspicuous bright lines\#151 ; other than those of hydrogen \#151 ; in the early spectra of Novae .
Lines corresponding to these bright lines in Centauri also occur in the spectrum of y Cassiopeiae , but they are far less well-defined in the case of the latter star .
The wave-lengths of the p Centauri lines given in the table were reduced , by means of Hartmann 's formula , from measures made on Pickering 's reproduction , the fiducial lines used being 4121-0 ( He ) , Hyv and Hj3 .
" On Europium and its Ultra-violet Spectrum .
" By Sir William Crookes , D.Sc .
, F.B.S. Beceived January 26 , \#151 ; Bead February 9,1905 .
Europium was discovered in 1901 by Dema^ay , * accompanying samarium , from which he separated it by fractional crystallisation of the double nitrates of magnesium and the earths .
Dema^ay considered that his new earth was identical with De Boisbaudran 's Ze and Z\#163 ; , and was the same which I had announced in 1885f as giving an extremely sharp red line in the phosphorescent spectrum at wave-length 609\#151 ; an earth which in 1889J I said was a new one , and designated by the name of SS .
I detected the earth SS during an examination of the phosphorescent spectra given by some of the fractions of samaria and of yttria , neither of the earths being pure .
Europium is the first member of the terbium group , gadolinium being the second member .
On the other side it comes next to samarium , the last member of the cerium group .
Assuming the oxide of europium to be EU2O3 , the element has an atomic weight of 151*8 , from the analysis of its sulphate , Et^SO^SHgO .
