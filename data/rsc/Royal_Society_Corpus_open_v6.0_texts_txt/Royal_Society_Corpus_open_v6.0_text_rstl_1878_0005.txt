] Part I.\#151 ; THE DISCHARGE AT ORDINARY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURES .
In the 'Journal of the Chemical Society/ November , 1868 , * we first published an account of the chloride of silver battery , which we had devised as one of great constancy and well suited for studying the discharge in exhausted tubes ; we shortly afterwards carried the number of cells to 200 , and presented a battery of 100 , part of the 200 , to our friend the late Mr. Gassiot , who at that time was in search of a constant battery suitable to his investigations .
Mr. Gassiot did not , however , adopt the chloride of silver battery , and it remained unemployed until 1874 , when , in pursuance of a suggestion of our friend Mr. Spottiswoode , we put together for his use 1080 cells , but soon found that in order to effectually study the phenomena of the discharge it would be necessary to carry the number of cells much higher , this we have gradually done , and now possess 8040 cells in actual work , and 2680 more completed but not charged with fluid f. Amongst the 8040 cells in actual use are the first 1080 constructed in 1874 , so that the constancy of the battery is thereby fully established .
In the course of the increase of numbers , experience has led to many modifications of the details of the battery , but we reserve for the latter part of this communication a description of them .
On the 24th February , 1875J , we gave an account , in conjunction with our friend Mr. Spottiswoode , of some experiments made with 1080 cells , and on the 28th April , 1875 , we made a verbal communication to the Society of Telegraph Engineers , when the battery of 1080 cells was exhibited .
S Subsequent to that meeting , our friend Mr. Latimer Clark , called our attention to and lent us a small work entitled ' The Electric Telegraph in British India/ by W. B. O'Shaughnessy , M.D. , F.E.S. , London , 1853 , where , at page 14 , the author describes an experimental cell of fused chloride of silver , and in justice to him we * Journ. Chem.

W. DE LA RUE AND H. W. MULLER ON THE mention this circumstance ; at the same time , we must say that the use of chloride of silver for a battery was an independent thought on our part .
Dr. O'Shaughnessy does not appear to have developed the idea into a workable battery , although he stated in his book that it would be of value for local circuits in signalling .
In October , 1875 , * we made a communication to the Acad6mie des Sciences of Paris , including some photographs of the stratified discharge obtained the 3rd of the previous month of August ; f also a further communication to the Royal Society in 1876 , | on the length of the spark with 600 , 1200 , 1800 , 2400 rod cells , and subsequently , in May , 1877 , a short statement of the relative length of the spark in different gases at the ordinary atmospheric pressure .
S Although we do not pretend to have solved the problem of the cause of stratification in tubes exhausted to a great extent of the gases they originally contained , we venture to think that an account of our experiments will to some extent limit the field of future inquiry , and that they may have present interest for the electrician .
We propose in the first place to deal with the discharge at ordinary atmospheric pressures , and in order that the requisite data for comparison with the results of other experimenters may be at hand , we here give the electro-motive force of our battery .
The following value was obtained by balancing a battery of 10 chloride of silver rod cells against 1 Latimer Clark standard mercurial cell|| ( 1-457 volt .
) .
The chloride of silver battery was kept continuously working through a high resistance , and the standard cell only opposed it when the comparison had to be made .
The zinc of a battery of 10 rod chloride of silver cells , and the zinc of a Latimer Clark cell were connected together and to one end of a resistance of 9270 ohms .
The silver of the battery of 10 cells was connected to the other end of the resistance coils .
The mercury of the Clark cell was connected to one terminal of a Thomson galvanometer , the other terminal of which was connected to a shifting contact plug .
It was found that there was no deflection of the galvanometer when this plug was inserted at 1275 .
Consequently EMF of 1 Ag Cl cell _ 9270 __ EMF of 1 Lat. Clark cell " " 1275 X 10 " Or , EMF of 1 Ag Cl cell = 0'7271 X 1'457 = 1'059 volt .

The internal resistance of the battery depends partly on the distance between the zinc rod and the chloride of silver , but mainly upon the circumstance of the chloride of silver being used in the form of powder or fused into rods ; we have 3240 powder-cells and 4800 rod-cells in work ; gradually and after many months the internal resistance increases in consequence of a hard skin of oxychloride of zinc forming on the zinc rods .
We have taken 5 ohms for the internal resistance of the rod , and 15 ohms as that of the powder-cells in the succeeding calculations .
We have determined the electro-motive force of the two other haloid compounds of silver , and find it to be as under for the three haloids\#151 ; volt .

.0*758 To measure the striking distance at ordinary atmospheric pressures , we have used the discharger figured below , which was made from our drawings by our assistant , Mr. James Fram , who has aided us materially during this investigation by his intelligent interpretation of our wishes , and his mechanical skill in carrying them out .
The frame work is of ebonite , and its construction sufficiently obvious ; the screw S having a ygth of-an-inch thread , has a cylindrical recess ab the lower end into which is inserted one of the terminals to be used in the experiments ( in this case a point P ) ; the end of the screw has four slits cut through it , in order that it may be contracted and made to pinch tightly any terminal inserted in it by means of the binding-nut N , working on the end of the screw , which is slightly conical but still has a full thread cut upon it .
The nut fixed in the cross head at the top of the frame through which the screw works is in metallic communication with the clamp C , and is divided horizontally into two parts which are pressed asunder by three spiral springs in order to prevent shake or play of the micrometer screw .
At the base of the instrument is a fixed holder with a screw and binding-nut like that for the upper terminal , this is in metallic communication with the clamp C ' , and holds in the above figure a terminal in the form of a disc D. To the top of the screw is fixed the ebonite wheel A , to which is fastened a metallic ring divided into 20 parts , each representing -j-oVoth of an inch ; as the divisions are O'35 inch apart at the outer periphery \#174 ; f the disc , it will be obvious that the yo o o o ' may be approximately estimated without difficulty .
On the top of the right-hand pillar is a vertical scale by which the number of whole revolutions of the screw is read off .
Before comFig .

mencing an experiment the discharger is connected with a battery of 10 cells through a detector-galvanometer , and the terminals approached cautiously until the motion of the galvanometer indicates contact ; the length of the spark of 10 cells is so small that the reading of the micrometer is taken as zero .
The screw is run up for a greater distance than the anticipated length of the spark to be measured , and when the micrometer has been connected with the battery it is gradually approached by steps .
The connexion between the micrometer-discharger and the battery is effected by means of the discharging key , shown in the figures 2 and 3 , which we have designed specially for our battery , as the ordinary form of doubly reversing key , even when made much larger than usual , was found not to answer for the high potentials we employ , in consequence of the voltaic arc continuing the current after metallic contact had been broken .
The battery is connected to the discharging key at the insulated standards in ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE O SILVER BATTERY .
which the horizontal ebonite axis A Z works , to this is fixed the ebonite handle H ; there are metallic collars A and Z , carrying the pivots , fitted on the ebonite axis .
These pivots are in metallic communication , by means of leading wires inserted in the ebonite axis , respectively with the spring pieces S and S ' , in which are inserted renewable platinum wires held in their places by binding-nuts .
The four bracket standards B B , B ' B ' , are connected with the apparatus through which the discharge Fig. 2 .
Fig. 3 .
is to be made by means of the wires N ' and P ' .
The bracket standards , B B , and B ' B ' , are connected together respectively by means of diagonal wires below the top ebonite plate E , the middle ebonite plate E ' , half an inch thick , intervening between them .
These bracket pieces have adjustable platinum contact wires screwed through their heads and held in position by binding-nuts .
The horizontal axis carrying the spring contact pieces S S ' , is held in its place by a strong spring I 2 ending in a V piece , underneath and parallel with it , which falls into one of three notches to hold it out of contact when the handle H is upright , as in fig. 3 , or in contact to the right , or to the left as shown in fig 2 .
After the adjustment of the distance between the terminals of the discharger , fig. 1 , the current was usually sent alternately so as to make the upper terminal positive or negative by means of the discharging key just described , so that the striking distance was obtained for the current in both directions ; on breaking contact with this key there is no fear of the voltaic arc continuing the current , as was found to be the case with the ordinary form of the doubly reversing keys as soon as the battery reached Fig , 4 .
4000 cells , because the double distance of B ' to S ' and S to B amounts to 2^ inches ; and it has been found that the arc will not extend after separation of the terminals to more than 1^ inch even when the battery consists of 8040 cells .
All the wires leading from the batteries are 0'0625 ( y^th ) inch diameter , and are covered with a coating of gutta percha 0'125 ( |-th ) inch thick ; the wires as they run round the laboratory are supported on ebonite supports in order , as far as possible , to prevent leakage .
The batteries are arranged in cabinets standing on ebonite feet ( E , fig. 4 ) , and each tray of 20 .
also stands on ebonite feet .
Fig. 4 shows a cabinet 4 feet 7\ inches ( 140*9 centims. ) high , 3 feet 6 inches ( 106*7 centims. ) wide , and 17 inches ( 43*17 centims. ) deep , inside measurement , containing a battery of 1200 rod-cells , each tray holding 20 cells ; all the wires represented are covered with gutta percha , and when they connect shelf to shelf they pass through ebonite cylinders fixed in the shelves .
Inside the case on the right is fixed a switch , as represented in figs. 5 and 6 .
Fig. 5 .
Fig. 6 .
The frame work and the levers H and IT are of ebonite ; the terminal wires from the battery are connected to the axes of the lever handles A and Z respectively ; when the battery is not required the levers rest in the position shown in the figures , when it is to be brought into circuit the handle H is elevated so as to bring the brass spring pieces in contact with the brass rods Z/ and which pass to the outside of the cabinet , the outer ends of the rods are hollow in order to admit of the insertion of contact plugs ( h and h ' , fig. 7 ) .
Fig. 6 shows that face of the switch which is screwed against the inside of the case .
Fig. 7 shows the means of connecting up the several batteries .
The battery on the left being represented in circuit by the insertion of brass plugs with ebonite handles h , h\ into the cylindrical hollow ends of the switch rods ; when this battery is not in use the plugs are withdrawn and inserted into the supports shown in the figure attached to the end of the case , it being understood that the handle of the switch Eig .

has been depressed to throw the contact springs out of gear .
The conducting wire has moreover to be rendered continuous by inserting the plug C between the jaws Z and A of the insulated plug-connector , which has a space of '625 ( f-th ) inch between the nearest points of the jaws , a distance absolutely necessary with batteries of such high tension as those we have in action .
For special experiments we have found it necessary to design and have constructed a commutator capable of reversing the current many times in a second , that shown in fig. 8 represents the form we have found most convenient to employ ; it is capable of reversing the current 352 times in a second when the handle is turned 240 times in a minute , which it is not difficult to do .
It will be seen that each ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
revolution of A , B , C , D reverses twice .
This piece of apparatus follows the discharging key , figs. 2 and 3 , in order from the poles of the battery , the wire A being in connexion with the bracket B , and the wire Z with B of the contact key , fig. 2 .
The figure is so distinct as scarcely to require any description ; it will he seen Fig. 8 .

Besides this we have a contact breaker very similar in appearance , and shown in situ in fig. 9 on the top of the dwarf cabinet of battery No. 1 , containing 1080 powder-cells ; this cabinet top is of ebonite and forms our ordinary working bench .
The contact breaker , B B , is placed in a position preceding the discharging key in order from the poles of the battery ; we have several revolving discs belonging to this piece of apparatus which make and break from 352 to 2112 times in a second .

S S ' is a short contact key used when a condenser is employed , and it is wished to charge it up without causing the current to pass through any resistance .
In the circuit we have a set of coil-resistances from 1 to 1,000,000 ohms ; these are specially insulated , the wires running in grooves on insulating cylinders made of paraffined cardboard , in order that they may be kept at a distance ; besides this set of resistances we have fluid resistance tubes like that represented in fig. 10 ; all but one have adjustable wires in order to vary the resistance ; two are charged with equal parts of water and glycerine , two with distilled water ; each has a plug P to throw the resistance out of circuit .

We have two tangent galvanometers of different degrees of sensitiveness specially insulated , which can be put in circuit by the withdrawal of two plugs , and also an induction coil , the primary of which may be brought into circuit ; it is No. 819 of Apps 's make , the particulars of which are as follow :\#151 ; ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .

The secondary wire of the coil is led to a delicate Thomson galvanometer .
All these pieces of apparatus can be plugged out of circuit , when not required , in a few seconds , and each battery can be as readily brought into or thrown out of action without inconvenience or danger to the operator .
Not without fear of being prolix , it has appeared to us desirable to commence by giving the preceding details , as it will facilitate the understanding of the varied experiments we have to describe hereinafter .
We will commence with\#151 ; ls\#163 ; .
Discharge at ordinary Atmospheric Pressures .
The discharge from a point presents many interesting features , which do not occur with other shaped terminals , which we will describe later on , page 88 , and at once proceed to the discharge from spherical surfaces , first premising that we have found that the nature of the metal employed for terminals in most cases makes no difference whatever in the length of the spark ( distance explosive ) of the battery .
Whatever may be the theory of the electric discharge , our experiments show that with the same terminals and the same number of cells the results have a remarkable constancy , notwithstanding the length of the interval between the experiments , and the consequently varying internal resistance of the battery from the gradual formation of the skin of oxychloride of zinc before referred to , and hereinafter to be specially discussed .
The length of the spark evidently depends essentially on the number of cells and their electro-motive force .
The spherical surfaces we have employed are of brass , 1*5 inch in diameter and having a radius of 3 inches .
The discharging-micrometer ( fig. 1 ) does not permit larger terminals to be used , but there is no reason to suppose that their diameter materially affects the results , because we found that spherical surfaces smaller in diameter gave nearly the same numbers .
In evidence of the constancy of the results , we give the following numbers , some of which will be dealt with in deducing the length of spark for a given number of volts K Striking distance between two spherical surfaces each 1*5 inch in diameter , the radius of curvature being 3 inches .

as more nearly representing a true mean curve , the judgment being guided by an inspection of the several curves representing the individual observations ( Plate 6 ) .
Curve VIII .
, it will be seen , runs very smoothly and tends to show that up to a difference of potential of 8000 cells there is not any common factor which can be used as a multiplier to furnish the striking distance for a given number of cells ; for the differences between the striking distances of consecutive equal numbers of cells is an increasing quantity , the increment of increase is , however , very small after 4000 cells have been reached .

In December , 1859 , and in the first four months of 1860 , experiments were made under the direction of Sir AVilliam Thomson with the object of determining the electro-motive force required to produce a spark .
" An account of these experiments was presented to the Royal Society by Sir William Thomson , and published in the Proceedings . !
It appears from this account that a condenser was used which might be * This agrees with Sir William Thomson 's conclusion ( Proc. Roy .

For the readiness of comparison with our own results , we have reduced into volts ( Table IV .
) Sir William Thomson 's numbers , contained in his most recent communication on the subject , and given in electro-static measurements , taking for v ( the ratio of an electro-magnetic to an electro-static unit ) the value of 3 X 1010 , and for a volt the value 108 C.G.S. unit of potential .

But the accordance of some and the discordance of others of our results with those of Sir William Thomson is best illustrated by the curves on Plate 6 , representing on a reduced scale ( the abscissae to Sths , the ordinates to -i ) the curves as originally laid down .

are again given in curves VIII.\#174 ; and IX.\#174 ; , in the upper part of the plate , on the original unreduced scale .
Sir William Thomson 's first observation was made with a difference of potential of 690 volts , and his result agrees very closely with our own .
This accordance holds good up to 1690 volts , his lengths of spark rising a little more rapidly for definite increments of electro-motive force than our own ; but between 1692 volts , which gave a length of spark equal to 0*011 inch , and 1854 volts , which gave a spark of 0*016 inch , there is a remarkably sudden rise in Sir William Thomson 's results , which is quite at variance with our experiments ; from that point ( 1854 volts ) , however , the two curves are sensibly parallel up to the limit of his observations .
It must be remarked that , notwithstanding the accordances in the distances between the terminals , when the spark jumped in our oft-repeated experiments , it seldom occurred actually at the point of nearest approach , although it usually did so in close proximity with it .
The distances observed for successive increments in the number of cells are , it will be seen , considerably less with spherical surfaces ( not so much as a fourth in many cases ) for high tensions than with a point and a disc , and moreover the increase of increment with spherical surfaces does not conform to the ratio of the square of the number of cells , as before referred to in a communication to the Society , and published in the Proceedings , vol. xxiv .
p. 167 , 1876 .
The difference in our results with spherical surfaces of three inches radius of curvature and those of Sir William Thomson with very slightly curved surfaces , induced us to make other experiments , with some so nearly flat that at their peripheries ( 0*687 inch from the centre ) the distance was about 0*004 inch when the centres touched .
The following three series of observations were made , viz.:\#151 ; ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE O SILVER BATTERY .

The striking distance is very little more for 8000 than eight times ( 8*487 ) that given for 1000 , which may be too great for the reason stated in page 85 .
On the suggestion of Professor E. Mascart , of the College de France , Paris , who honoured us with a visit to our laboratory in April , 1877 , we have determined the striking distance between two concentric cylinders ; fig. 11 shows the arrangement of the apparatus .
S S , S ' S ' are two ebonite stands supporting the outer cylinder A A of brass , 2'5 inches long , and bored with a perfectly true hole , 0*4895 inch diameter ; B is the inner cylinder , also of brass , which was turned at first nearly of the diameter of the hole of the outer cylinder ; on its axis , of one piece with the cylinder , are fitted two ebonite cylinders E E , exactly fitting the hole ; their outer ends have a groove Fig. 11 .
turned in them , in which the string of a hand-bow works to turn the cylinder on its centres c , c when it is wished to reduce it in size ; C , C ' are clamps for connecting the outer and inner cylinder respectively with the battery .
When it is wished to make the inner cylinder less in size , the clamp C is removed , and the cylinder is put on dead-centres , and made to rotate with the hand-bow , and reduced by turning off a very small quantity at a time between each trial of the striking distance ; the quantity removed between each trial was generally 0*001 inch or less , and by this means the striking distance was ascertained to 0*0005 inch .
In the first instance the same cylinder was reduced to determine the limit of the striking distance for the several numbers of cells employed ; on a repetition of the experiment , seven inner cylinders were turned to the size at which the spark just passed and retained ; this delicate work was executed with great care and skill by Mr. Fram .

In taking the striking distances the current was reversed after a first trial , so as to ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
make the outer cylinder positive and negative alternately ; in the majority of cases the longest spark was obtained with the outer cylinder positive .
For the first 1200 cells the striking distance between two concentric cylinders is less , but after that number greater than between nearly flat surfaces , as will be seen by comparing the numbers given in Table VI .
with those in Table VIII.* From curve XI .

, pp. 115 to 118 , has investigated the striking distance between two concentric cylinders , using , however , much higher potentials than we have employed .
His experiments show that if the inner cylinder is kept constant and the number of elements and the diameter of the outer cylinder are increased or diminished , the density required to produce a spark does not change at the moment of the spark jumping .
If the inner cylinder is increased or diminished in diameter , then the density is lessened or increased .

We now give some numbers to show that the striking distance between a point and a disc is remarkably constant for the same number of cells , provided that attention is paid to the shape of the point , for we have found by numerous experiments that much depends on its actual outline ; for example , a conical point of 20 ' angle gives a spark of considerably less length than one of the same base and altitude , but paraboloidal in form ; thus , when the point is positive , with 5640 cells , the ratio of the striking distance when the conical point is employed to that of a paraboloidal point is as 0*7764 , and with 8040 cells as 0*7784 to 1 .
With high tensions , 5000 to 8000 cells , the spark is longest when the point is positive , but with low tensions up to 3000 cells it is generally longest when the point is negative , as will be seen from the following numbers :\#151 ; ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .

The first ordinate was taken as 1*33 to the first abscissa 1 .
A diagram was laid down with 120 such ordinates to a scale of four feet for the length of the point , and then reduced by successive steps with a pantagraph to the size shown in fig. 13 , X , this , with a certain modification* served as a guide for a cutting-pantagraph to shape a cutting tool to be used in a lathe for forming the point of the size Y , fig. 13 , to be actually used as Fig. 13 .

Experiment proved that all the points made with this tool gave the mean length of spark obtained previously , namely , with 8040 cells , 0 340\#151 ; 0 350 inch .
The greater part of the curve of the point so laid down corresponds to a paraboloid or more correctly to intersecting parabolas .
We were induced to construct a second tool to make a truly paraboloidal point such as is shown in fig. 14 at X ' and Y ' ; this new point gave precisely the same length of spark , although it will be seen that the extremity of it ( X ' ) does not terminate in an actual point like in fig. X. Subjoined are the lengths of spark between a point positive and a disc negative , which we quote to show the constancy of the results under the same conditions .
* As the guiding arm of the pantagraph carries a point which works in a groove , whilst the cutter to form the tool is a cylinder , a guide line parallel to the curve of X , but distant four times the radius of the cutter , has to be laid down to guide the tracing point , the reduction being to one-fourth .

, to be discovered by future experiment .
A comparison of the numbers obtained when spherical or flat surfaces were used as terminals with those when a point and a disc or two points were used , will show that for low tensions the striking distance is fully as great , and in some cases greater , with spherical or flat terminals , than when one terminal was a point or when both were points .
From the curves laid down on Plate 8 , which represents the original plotting reduced to |ths in each direction , we have deduced the numbers given in Table XI .
But , in the first instance , a mean curve was drawn for each of the irregular curves representing the actual observations ; these mean curves are not given in Plate 8 , in order to avoid confusion .

ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
87 With a Muirhead condenser of 13 microfarads ' capacity , the 8040 cells gave a spark of 0-265 inch between a blunt point , positive ( it is impossible to retain a good point with such heavy discharges , as metal is carried off at each explosion ) , and a flat surface 0425 inch diameter , negative .
The actual jump of the spark when a point and disc or two points are employed as terminals is preceded by a luminous discharge ( streamers ) , presenting phenomena of an interesting character , an extremely minute quantity of electricity passing as compared to that when the spark jumps and forms the arc , but still it is sufficient when caused to pass through a vacuum tube to illuminate it strongly* In illustration of this we quote the following numbers based on the statement before made , namely , that the electro-motive force of the battery per cell is taken at 1'03 volt , and the internal resistance at 4800 X 5 + 3240 X 15 = 72,600 ohms .

Many determinations were made of the current passing between a paraboloidal point and a disc at various other distances beyond the striking distance .
In order to make these measurements , the point was connected with one terminal of the battery , the other terminal being to earth ; .
the opposed disc was connected to one teiminal of a Thomson galvanometer , whose constant had been accurately determined ; the other terminal of the galvanometer was to earth .
Every care was taken to prevent leakage , and the shunts were adjusted to suit the current .
A danger to be guarded against was the jump of the spark , as the current which would then pass would injure the galvanometer .
From the above figures it will be seen that the streamer-discharge from a paraboloidal * Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. xxiv\ p. 169 , 187b , point at 0'36 inch distance from a plate diminishes the potential of the battery of 8040 cells by only iwoth part , or less than two cells .
This discharge from the point when positive has mainly to the naked eye a streamlike appearance , consisting of a waving line of light surrounded by a very faint sugar-loaf luminosity and producing a rattling or strong hissing sound ; from the point when negative it consists of a glow of light paraboloidal in form and extending from the point to the disc , but much more brilliant at the point , the noise of the discharge being much less than when the point is positive .
The disc , especially when positive , soon becomes covered with a peach-like bloom , and the deposit assumes the appearance of Newton 's rings .
Small as this current is , it is , nevertheless , very manifest from its brightness and the rattling or loud hissing noise it produces ; it frequently continues for some minutes before the spark actually jumps between terminals placed at the striking distance asunder ; the streamer-discharge becomes brighter just before the jump and formation of the arc , and this suggested the possibility of particles being carried off in increasing quantity from the point to the disc , and thus contributing to the production of the spark .
In order to test this hypothesis , the terminals were placed at the striking distance and a continuous blast from a blowpipe bellows sent between them ; Fig. 16 .
this did not , however , have any effect on the length of the spark , but it deflected the arc when once it had formed .
Under the microscope the discharge , from the point when positive , is seen to consist of several streams of light , which twist round each other like loosely-bound strands , as shown in fig. 16 , representing the discharge between the terminals in a horizontal discharger .
Part of the discharge from the point negative is shown in fig. 17 .
In order to study these discharges , we had constructed for us a microscope ( fig. 18 ) with a revolving mirror placed at an angle formed by the two tubes composing the ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
body of the microscope , which is bent for the convenience of observation .

The screw S7 is used to approach or recede the microscope in order to adjust to focus ; S7/ to bring the point horizontally , and S to elevate or depress the microscope by means of a pinion and rack to adjust the point vertically in the field .
0 is the object-glass and E the eye-piece ; W , a multiplying-wheel giving five revolutions of the mirror for one turn of the handle , which may be rotated with ease 200 times in a minute , so that the mirror can be caused to make 1000 revolutions in a minute , or about 17 revolutions in a second .
The whole framework of the stand is of ebonite to ensure insulation .
N When the revolving mirror is set in motion it is seen that the streamer-discharge is in reality to a great extent intermittent .
At times a moderate rotation-velocity of the mirror serves to show this by the production of a number of distinct images , as seen in the left-hand drawing in fig. 19 ; at others it requires the full speed of the mirror .
The discharge appears much more continuous with the point negative , so much so that the image is generally seen in the microscope as a sheet of light brightest near the point , and nearly uniform in a direction at right angles to the axis of the mirror ; the right hand drawing shows the appearance when the point is negative .
The difference in the sound emitted when the point is positive and negative respectively appears to afford an additional proof of less continuity in the case of the positive , see also page 118 .
Fig 19 .
When a high resistance , 4 megohms for example , is inserted in the circuit , the character of the discharge is completely changed , instead of jumping across and forming an arc , a series of brilliant snapping sparks pass between the terminals at more or less rapid intervals , exactly like the sparks from a small Leyden jar ; these pierce a piece of writing paper interposed between the terminals producing minute holes .
The spark does not jump at the full distance when the 4 megohms ' resistance is inserted ; and , to produce an almost continuous succession of intermittent sparks , it is usually necessary to approach the point to 0'30 inch , when , without resistance , the spark with 8040 cells would jump and form the arc at 0\34 inch .
When a point and a disc are used as terminals , and a piece of glazed writing paper , say 0'00425 inch ( 0-01079 centims. ) thick , is laid on the disc , a very strong adhesion of the paper to the disc takes place , and it requires a strong pull to draw it along ; this phenomenon was first noticed by our assistant , Mr. Fram .
In order to measure this force of adhesion we used a spring dynamometer , with a clip to hold the strip of paper , inch wide ( the width of the disc ) .
Under ordinary states of moisture of the atmosphere , with 8040 cells it required a pull\#151 ; When the point was positive , grains , of 1300 1300 1100 When it was negative , grains , of 2900 2800 3200 Mean 1233 Mean 2933 ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
to draw the paper along the disc , presenting a surface of 1 *767 square inch ( 11-401 square centims. ) a flat plate laid on the paper required to be loaded , in order to indicate the respective pulls , to 5,200 grains when the point was positive , and 8,900 grains when negative .
This strong adhesion arose evidently from the charging up of the upper surface of the paper with the opposite electricity to that of the disc , and hence it appeared probable that by making the paper thoroughly dry the upper surface ought to take a higher charge and cause a stronger adhesion , and this was found to be the case .
In order to measure the force of adhesion when the paper was well dried , we had successively made two new .
dynamometers , as the first only ranged to 4000 grains ; the pull so much exceeded our anticipations , that the second\#151 ; from 3000 to 10,000 grains\#151 ; was found to be insufficient .
Ultimately , one ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 grains was employed .
The strain required to pull away the paper was\#151 ; These strains were reproduced when the paper was under the pressure of 129,690 grains ( 8403*8 grms. ) and 53,530 grains ( 3468-6 grms. ) respectively .
On the hypothesis of two parallel plates ( the upper surface of the paper and the disc-terminal ) each of area ( A ) = 11*401 square centims. , at a distance ( D ) = 0-01079 centim. , the thickness of the paper , between which there is a force of attraction ( F ) = ( gW ) = 8403*8 grms.

The value obtained for the point positive does not differ very greatly from the number of volts ( 8281 ) actually employed ; but that for the point negative is in the ratio of 1*67 to 1 .
In calculating the force of attraction , it has been assumed that it was the upper surface of the paper which was charged to the highest negative or positive potential , according as the point was negative or positive , but it is possible that a zone of almost full potential was at some nearer distance from the metallic disc .
It has been suggested that the whole mass of the paper serves as a conductor , resting on only a few points on the lower disc , and that .the intervening film of air is the insulator ; against the correctness of this hypothesis is the fact that the adhesion is much stronger when the paper is made to insulate better by being dried .
With paraffined paper black-leaded on the upper surface the adhesion was with point N 900 and with point P 400 grains , and it was almost inappreciable when the upper surface of the slip of paper had a disc of tin-foil pasted on it .
There is no measurable adhesion when a spherical surface is substituted for the point : this was to be expected , for there is scarcely a visible glow , and consequently little transference of electricity before the jump of the spark .
The only effect observed was that the slip of paper was attracted diagonally to both terminals , forming a bridge through which a minute current passed when the terminals were separated beyond the striking distance.* When one of the terminals consists of a very fine platinum wire 0*002 inch diameter , and about 0*56 inch long , held in a holder like that used for holding needles in a mathematical instrument box , but adapted to go into our discharger , the wire takes up a straight , circular , or elliptical oscillation , the glow at the point forming a continuous line of light marking its course ; with the point positive the excursion is less than when negative , being with a potential of 8040 cells , and a distance between the terminals of 0*32 inch , about 0*375 inch , while with the point negative it is much more brilliant and about 0*8 inch .
By interposing a resistance of 4 megohms the statical discharge takes place from the extremity of the wire , frequently producing a beautiful and brilliant figure by the apparent crossing and interlacing of the bright lines of discharge from different points in the path of the oscillating wire ; these occur at such short intervals that the discharge looks like a persistent pattern of intricate engine-turning .
By approaching the wire cautiously it is generally possible to cause the end of it to fuse into a minute globule , and the discharge then becomes much more striking .
With 4 megohms ' resistance the static spark is longest and brightest when the wire is negative ; if the wire is very straight the oscillations take place in a cycloidal curve in a vertical plane , the discharge occurring at equal distances from the middle of the path as the minute globule at the end of the wire attains the limit of the greatest discharge from either side , so that two streaks of light are seen continuously ; if the wire is slightly * Professor Stokes , to whom we communicated these results , has favoured us with some remarks , which we insert with his permission in Note A. ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
93 bent the oscillation is conical or elliptical , and the figure produced by the discharge is then much more continuous and beautiful , because the distance from the point to the plate remains nearly constant .
The difference of the amount of excursion of the wire when positive or negative is one of the many instances of the difference of .the positive and negative electric force .
In the foregoing account of the length of the spark no mention has been made of the atmospheric conditions in relation to pressure , temperature , or hygrometric state , because it was found that it was not affected thereby to any appreciable amount , the laboratory being warmed during the cold period ; but it is nevertheless certain that some effect must be produced by variations in temperature , as it was found that a very high temperature , such for example as that produced by the flame of an insulated spirit lamp , caused a much greater jump between the terminals , for instance , with 8040 cells , the length of spark between a point and a ball 1 inch in diameter was 1 inch , and between two points 1*375 inch ; the length of the spark is somewhat influenced by the position of the flame , find is greatest towards the point or oxidising part of it .
When the terminals are placed opposite to two gas jets emanating from the same gas pipe in metallic communication with the gas main , and consequently to Earth , the flame opposed to the negative terminal is attracted , and that opposed to the positive repelled , as was observed to be the case with static electricity by M. Neyreneuf , at whose request we have made the experiment .
Fig. 20 shows the arrangement and effects observed .

We have already stated that in most cases the nature of the metal makes no difference in the length of the spark , and this applies to brass , copper , silver , steel , platinum , magnesium , and zinc ; but there is a striking exception , namely , aluminium , which gives a considerably longer spark when used for a terminal in the shape of a point ; thus , when the point was positive , with-\#151 ; * Annals de Chemie et de Physique , 5e serie , t. ii .

99 0-340 0-414 1-217 Mean 1*242 The length of the spark differs in various gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures , as we anticipated that it would do from our experience with vacuum tubes ; but the difference in the length of the spark does not bear any precise ratio either to the specific gravity of the gas or its viscosity in reference to mechanical impulse ; we therefore propose to ascribe it , at all events provisionally , to a difference of electric viscosity .
In order to make experiments on the discharge in different gases , we placed the discharger , already described page 58 , fig. 1 , under a bell glass G G ' ( fig. 21 ) , open at the top and covered with a glass plate , P. Fig. 21 .
The glass plate has two screw-clamps , which are connected at its under surface with wires led from the screw-clamps c and c ( fig. 21 ) of the discharger .
In connexion with these , on the outside surface , are two other screw-clamps c c ' with which the terminals of the battery T T ' are connected .
Through a stuffing box in the glass cover a ELECTRIC DISCHARGE WITH THE CHLORIDE OF SILVER BATTERY .
95 steel rod R passes ; this , below the glass , carries a crutch M , with two ebonite pins , which drop into corresponding holes made to receive them in the micrometer wheel A , fig. 21 ; the rod has on the top , outside the jar , a cross handle h of ebonite for turning it .
The distance of the terminals is easily regulated by means of this rod , as the micrometer can be read through the bell glass .
Before admitting any gas into it , the hell glass was exhausted by the mercurial pump to a pressure of less than a millimetre , then filled with dry gas , and again exhausted and recharged .

If the current were greater , as would he the case with larger cells , the arc would no doubt be much longer .
The arc presents the ordinary characters , as shown in fig. 22 ; but that which takes place when the terminals are vertically one over the other , as in our discharger , is different , on account of its being undisturbed by upward air currents which deflect the arc .
The appearance of the arc is different in different gases , as will be seen in fig. 23 , where 1 represents the arc in air ; this when examined with the microscope presents an evidently stratified appearance , especially in the barrel-shaped surrounding of the central bright spindle ; the laminae are extremely close , and seen with very great difficulty , even with the revolving mirror of the microscope , which must be caused to revolve at different velocities to render them apparent ; with a moderate magnifier , a hand lens , the barrel-shaped surrounding appears as if shaded with lines across it .
As one examines the arc with the mirror revolving at a great velocity , evidence of the carrying of minute particles is given by streaks of bright light , which cross the field .
The arc in hydrogen , with the point positive , is shown in 2 , fig. 23 ; the central spindle is surrounded by a beautiful blue halo , like a glass shade illumined by Fig. 22 .

With 4 megohms ' resistance in the circuit , the streaming discharge from the point positive , at 0*502 inch distance , was carmine in colour .
This distinctive colour is a proof that the gas in which the discharge takes place is the carrier of electrification in the streamer discharge .

The arc in nitrogen is reddish-violet , the jump with 8040 cells being 0*402 inch when the point is positive , and 0*272 inch when negative , or in the ratio of negative to positive of 0*677 .
In oxygen the arc presents a similar appearance to that in air , the mean jump with 8040 cells being 0*216 inch with the point positive , and the mean when negative 0*137 inch , the ratio of negative to positive being 0*634 to 1 .
The arc in carbonic anhydride is shown in 3 , fig. 23 .
From the foregoing observations , it would appear that hydrogen in a residual , together with the employment of aluminium for terminals , present the most favourable conditions for the passage of the voltaic current .
The spark with 8040 cells jumped 0*5 inch between two points placed vertically one over the other in a tube containing absolute alcohol , and provided with a vent to permit of the alcohol vapour escaping as soon as the arc is formed .

W. DE LA RUE AND H. W. MULLER ON THE we merely recall what has been stated by Dr. Bleekrode , that fluids such as bisulphide of carbon ( CS2 ) , benzine ( C6 He ) , tin tetrachloride ( SnCl4 ) , hydrochloric acid ( HC1 ) , cyanogen ( C2 N2 ) , zinc ethyl ( Zn ( C2 H5)2 ) , are all strongly agitated when the current passes , but there is no electrolytic decomposition .
The fluid is repelled by the negative and attracted by the positive pole , as shown in fig. 24 , giving proof of a molecular motion taking place during the passage of the current , this has been found to occur even when the current passes slowly from one plate of a condenser to the other .
We cannot , however , refrain from observing in reference of Dr. Bleekrode 's experiments , that it is most remarkable that fused chloride of lithium ( LiCl ) is readily decomposed by four Bunsen cells , and fluid hydrochloric acid ( HC1 ) resists a potential of 5640 cells ; the accepted notions of electrolysis evidently requiring reconsideration .

The coil condensers we have found useful in certain cases , as for example those already communicated to the Royal Society.t The Varley condenser is of very great value for experiments with vacuum tubes , for when once charged up , and then disconnected from the battery , and the charge allowed to run down through a tube , it maintains a current frequently for ten minutes without replenishing , the phenomena varying as the potential falls ; when any particular phase in the stratification occurs , it may be sustained by connecting the condenser with the battery through a suitably-adj usted resistance , which permits of the inflow being exactly equal to the outflow .
The potential at each end of the tube and at different points in the circuit may be ascertained for * The condenser of 47'5 m.f. , described Proc. Roy .

o 2 each phase by means of an electrometer ; from these observations , data may be derived with respect to the current and the apparent resistance of the tube at each epoch .
In using a condenser of this capacity certain precautions are necessary , for it several times has happened that there is no indication of a current until a sudden jump takes place which destroys the vacuum tube ; this was remedied by placing a safety wire of platinum , 0*002 inch in diameter and 10 inches long , between the tube and one terminal of the condenser .
Such a wire was found to permit of only 4 per cent , of the charge passing , and though frequently deflagrated by this amount of charge during the course of the experiments , it has effectually protected the tube by thus breaking off* the connexion .
We are indebted to our friend Professor Stokes for the suggestion of the introduction of resistances during the charging of the condenser and also for that of the safety wire .

When K is raised , the charged condenser supplies the current .
We have already stated* that a charge of 47*5 microfarads , with 1080 cells , deflagrates 10*5 inches ( 26*67 centims. ) of platinum wire , 0*005 inch ( 0*127 millim. ) in diameter ; when the condenser of 42*8 microfarads is charged up , with 3240 cells , the charge deflagrates the same length of wire , but 0*0125 inch ( 0*317 millim. ) in diameter .

electric discharge with the chloride of SILVER BATTERY .
101 The condenser of 42*8 is to that of 47*5 as 0'9434 to 1 ; the sectional area of the larger to the smaller wire is as 6*25 to 1 ; so that the effect of the disruptive discharge of 42-8 microfarads , with 3240 cells , as compared with that of 47*5 microfarads , with 1080 cells , is as 6'62 to 1 for the same capacity .
As the relation of the electric energy in the two cases is that of the capacity multiplied by the square of the potential , the quantity of wire deflagrated should be 0*94 34 X 32 = 8*5 to 1 .
When 21 inches of the same size wire , 0*0125 inch , of either platinum , gold , silver , copper , iron , zinc , or aluminium , is strained across and kept in close contact with a piece of plate glass , perforated with two holes to admit of screw clamps to press the ends of the wire tightly against it , and the charge sent through it , the wire is dispersed with a strong explosion , like that of a pistol , the metal being driven into and strongly adhering to the glass for some distance from the wire .
The stain presents the appearance of lines of force , recalling magnetic lines , in consequence of the cloud or smoke-like stain being furrowed with lines converging towards the clamps .
On examination with the microscope , it was seen that minute globules of metal existed at the termination of the furrows , which they had evidently ploughed up through the cloud-like deposit , leaving a line of unstained glass .
Several of these globules , of gold , were measured under the microscope with a spider-line micrometer , and the following diameters were obtained among others:\#151 ; 0*00004 , 0*00386 , *00463 , 0*009 inch , they are all smaller than that of the wire exploded .
The greater number were exceedingly minute , ending in a cloud-like stain too small to admit of measurement .
All along the path of the discharge the deposit appears in cross striae , which remain visible on the disintegrated surface of the glass when the film of metal is dissolved ; the greatest dispersion is not close to the ends of the wire , but towards the middle , and was found to be\#151 ; With gold , 0*5 .

of the total length of the wire from the positive pole .
The plate when gold has been deflagrated exhibits the metal in the several varieties of ruby , green , and violet .
The appearance of the stain of an exploded wire , suggested the thought of a stress at right angles to the path of the discharge ; and experiments were made in order to ascertain whether a wire was either shortened in consequence of an expansion of its diameter , or lengthened by the particles b\amp ; ng driven away from each other in the direction of its length by the discharge of 42*8 microfarads charged with 3240 cells , but the results were entirely negative .
The diagram , fig. 27 , shows the arrangement of the apparatus .
To the short end of a steel-yard L L ' , whose relative lengths on each side of the fulcrum are 1 and 13*6 , was hung a brass wire W , 8 inches long and 0*2 inch diameter , by means of an insulated hook with a'clamp for connexion with one plate of the condenser C. The wire was strained down in opposition to a small weight on the long arm of the steel-yard by means of the insulated screw-hook S connected with the contact-key K ; when the charge is to be sent through the wire , this key has to be pressed down .
To the metallic support of the lever is attached one terminal of a Fig. 27 .
single cell A Z , the other terminal being connected through a Thomson-galvanometer G to the adjustable metallic fork It .
If contact between the long arm of the steelyard and either the top or bottom of the fork takes place , then a current passes and the movement of the galvanometer indicates that the wire has either shortened or lengthened .
When the long arm of the lever was adjusted to 0'001 inch from touching the top or the bottom of the fork , as the case might be , and the charge in the condenser was sent through the wire , contact was not made , showing that no shortening or lengthening to the extent of tWoo in'h occurred at the time of the discharge .
When 8 inches of platinum wire , 0'0125 inch diameter , was experimented with , no instantaneous shortening of the wire took place at the moment of its deflagration .
Wlien 8 inches of iron wire , 0'03 inch diameter , was experimented with , a downward movement of the long arm of the lever to the extent of 0'375 inch occurred , showing an elongation by the heating effect of the discharge of ^ 3 765 = 0'02786 inch ; the contraction of the wire in cooling brought the long arm of the lever to nearly , but not quite , its normal position ; the elongation indicates a temperature of about 300 ' C. , but it is most probable that it was higher , so that it may be safely concluded that the elongation of the wire was solely due to the heat .
We have made experiments to ascertain the amount in chemical equivalents required to fully charge the 42'8 microfarads accumulator by connecting a voltameter in the circuit to one of its plates , from one terminal of the battery , the other terminal to the other plate .
The connexion in every case was continued for two minutes , although the evolution of the mixed gases in the voltameter had nearly ceased in thirty seconds ; a very minute quantity , indeed , of gas continues to be liberated , however long the accumulator remains in connexion with the battery ; this we attribute to a leakage .

The quantity of electricity which flows into an accumulator to charge it fully , is in direct ratio of the number of cells ; the potential also is proportional to the number of cells in series used to charge it , so that the electric energy is in the ratio of the capacity multiplied by the square of the potential .

As occasionally we have accidentally been exposed to shocks , it appeared to us permissible , in self-protection , to ascertain whether life or health was in any way endangered by them ; we therefore made an experiment on a rabbit , with the condenser of 42 8 microfarads charged with 2160 cells ; the discharge was passed from the inside of one ear to the throat , but produced no other effect than to paralyze the fore paws for about an hour ; it appeared , however , that but a very small portion of the charge had passed through the rabbit , inasmuch as afterwards , when the condenser was discharged , the report was nearly as loud as when the condenser is at full potential .
Professor Stokes accidentally received the charge of this condenser , with 3240 cells , without injury ( like the rabbit , he got only a small fraction of the charge ) , and one of us ( De La Rue ) has had a shock from the whole battery , without a condenser , of 8040 cells ; the shock was severe , and its numbing effects were felt for some hours ; in every case the skin is pierced by a number of minute holes and cauterised where the charge enters .
Experiments were made to test the portion of a charge that passed from a condenser when the opposite plates were connected by a certain length of platinum wire of a definite diameter .
In order to measure the fall in potential of the condenser , one of its plates is placed in connexion with the cage ( fig. 28 ) , consisting of a glass shade lined with tinfoil , and having a hole in the top to permit of the insertion of a test plane , T , for taking a charge from the mushroom , M , in connexion with the other plate of the condenser , C. The shade rests on a glass disc , also coated with tinfoil , except at the centre , where a space 3 inches in diameter is left uncoated .
For the suggestion of this arrangement , having for its object to insure that the test charge shall be always at the full potential , we are indebted to Professor Stokes .
The cage is quite close to the quadrant electrometer , which we charge always to the potential of 2400 cells ; it is rendered much less sensitive than usual by the separation of the suspension threads .
The test plane we use up to 3240 cells is a brass disc 2 inches in diameter.* * Recently we have found it to be more convenient to use a quadrant electrometer furnished with an induction plate placed above one of the quadrants and adjustable in distance from it.\#151 ; Dec. 13 , 1877 .

105 42-8 microfarads were charged with 2160 cells , and gradually discharged by connecting the opposite plates many times in succession through a platinum wire of 0*002 inch diameter and 12 inches long , the wire being deflagrated by each discharge .

c The potential of the condenser was measured from time to time by the quadrant electrometer , and from these measurements the quantity passing at each discharge was deduced ; they were as follows :\#151 ; Divisions .

Secondary Current induced by a Primary Current of High Potential .
Our experience with the detector-coil already described , and other smaller coils , all of which gave very long sparks in relation to the current , under the conditions about mdccclxxviii .
p to be described , led us to make experiments with one of Apps 's usual coils for 6-inch sparks .
The diagram ( fig. 29 ) shows the arrangement of the apparatus : A Z , the battery , is Fig. 29 .
,6 A COIL connected 'permanently with the condenser C , A to one plate , Z to the other ; the A terminal of the battery is also connected to one terminal of the primary of the coil , the Z terminal to a make-and*break-wheel B , to be worked by hand , thence to the key K , which is connected to the other terminal of the coil.* Jf the key K is pressed down , and the wheel B is made to rotate , it is evident that a current will pass , or not pass through the primary of the coil , according as a conducting or a non-conducting tooth of the break-wheel is in connexion with the contact spring ; but the battery is never disconnected from the condenser by the rotation of the break-wheel ; therefore , when the make-and-break-wheel permits of the current passing through the primary of the coil , it is the accumulated charge of the condenser which actually passes through it , and hence produces a very exalted effect in comparison to that of the battery alone .

107 On one occasion , with coil 815 , in connexion with coil C of 350 yards , 0*028 microfarad , as a condenser , and 3240 powder cells , which evolved 0*3 cub. centim. mixed gases per minute in the voltameter , 3-inch sparks were obtained , with a moderate rotation of the contact breaker .
Apps 's No. 821 coil , either with its own condenser or fths of Ladd 's condenser , D 2 = 01807 microfarad , produces a rapid succession of 6-inch sparks when worked with 6 cells in series of a zinc-carbon battery , charged with a solution of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid , the plates being 12 inches by 5 inches , and each zinc between two carbon plates ; the make-and-break being effected automatically by the usual hammer-and-anvil arrangement .
This battery evolved 152 cub. centims. of mixed gases per minute , when the current passed through a voltameter having a resistance of 17 ohms , and containing a mixture of 1 part sulphuric acid and 10 of water .
The chloride of silver battery evolved only 0'5 cub. centim. of mixed gases under the same circumstances , consequently only sfeth part ; nevertheless , as great or even greater effects were obtained with it than those with the zinc-carbon battery .
With 1080 cells and the Lad condenser D 2 , 0*4518 microfarad , connected permanently with the battery , a dense spark , 3*5 inches long , was obtained on making contact with the key , so as to send the accumulated charge through the primary of the coil , but only a feeble spark on breaking contact .
With 2280 cells and condenser D 2 , under the same circumstances , a full 6-inch spark was obtained , and a rapid succession of such sparks when the break-wheel made 44 contacts in a second .
With 3480 cells , on making contact , the same effects , and a rapid succession of such sparks when the break-wTheel made 62 makes-and-breaks in a second .
It seemed probable that the battery could charge up larger condensers with sufficient rapidity , and this was shown to be the case by the following experiments :\#151 ; With 3480 cells and condensers D 2 and D 3 , 0*9222 microfarad , dense sparks not only passed between the terminals of the secondary coil , but other sparks , longer than 6 inches , jumped from every part of the coil when the break-wheel made 212 contacts in a second , With the same number of cells and condensers D 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 *4887 microfarads and 352 breaks in a second , the sparks were as long , but denser , than in the last-named case .
It appears from the foregoing experiments that a high potential is very favourable to the production of induction effects when used in connexion with accumulators of suitable capacity .
The accumulated high-tension charge passes at each make contact , and produces effects partly dependent on the potential and partly on the quantity of current , which must be , however , considerably less in a given time than that when a battery of large plates is employed ( 6 zinc-carbon cells , 12 X 5 inches ) .
Although it was not anticipated that the production of these exalted effects in comparison with the current was due to any effect with regard to the induced magnetism 108 MESSRS .
W. DE LA RUE AND H. W. MULLER ON THE in the iron core , nevertheless some direct experiments were made to test this point .
A horse-shoe electro-magnet , weighing 1854 grains ( 0*265 lb. ) , surrounded with 1102 yards of insulated copper wire of 0*014 inch diameter , in 4352 turns and 34 layers , and presenting a total resistance of 200 ohms , consequently very small in comparison with the internal resistance of the batteries , was employed in making the experiments .
The armature was suspended on a delicately-poised steel-yard , accurately divided , and provided with a suspender for the weight , mounted on rollers to permit of its being moved smoothly along the long arm of the lever , so as not to give any shock which might disturb the armature .
Observations were made of the weight supported by the magnet when 1200 , 2400 , and 3600 cells were used , the current passing in each case being at the same time measured by a galvanometer , the value of whose deflections had been determined in absolute units of current .
The following results show that the weight supported by an electro-magnet was not merely proportional to the current , but increased with the number of cells :\#151 ; Col. 3 .

electric discharge with the chloride of silver battery .
109 ' Description of the Battery and its Working .
We now proceed to give some account of the battery , of the working of which we have had nearly three years ' continuous experience . .
As originally constructed , the chloride of silver battery had open cells , and the zinc element was amalgamated ; * since then we have constructed batteries in which the cells ( tubes ) were closed with vulcanised rubber stoppers , perforated to admit of the insertion of the zinc rod , the silver wire connected with the chloride of silver was inserted between the stopper and the side of the tube , it being previously covered with several folds of thin sheet gutta-percha to protect it from the action of sulphur in the vulcanised stopper .
The amalgamation of the zinc has the advantage of preventing , to a great extent , the strong adherence of the oxychloride of zinc to which we have referred in an early part of the paper , but presents the great disadvantage of amalgamating and ultimately rotting the thin flattened silver wire ; t so that having to choose between two evils , we have preferred not to amalgamate the zinc when it is intended to keep the batteries one or more years in action .
Fig. 30 shows a nest of 20 rod cells of the most recent construction already described , ^ but of which we have not before given any drawing .
The several components of the battery are shown at the base of the stand : Z , the zinc rod with the plugp , inserted in a hole at the right-hand end ; AgCl , the chloride of silver rod , cast on the flattened silver wire SW ; Up , a vegetable parchment cylinder , open at both ends and perforated towards the top with two holes to admit of the silver wire SW being interlaced through them , as shown in the figure immediately above it , * Journal of the Chem. Soc. , new series , vol. vi .

f Platinum , which would not amalgamate , might be substituted , but it would cost \#163 ; 55 extra per 1000 cells .

the vegetable parchment is made to adhere so as to form a cylinder by means of shell-lac varnish on the edge of the last layer , of which there are three of one continuous piece ; as the shell-lac varnish does not effectually secure the adherence of the vegetable parchment ( for nothing does it effectually ) a few stitches of thread are made at the lower end , the interlacing wire preventing the vegetable parchment from unfurling at the upper part .
The use of the vegetable parchment cylinder is to prevent contact between the zinc rod and the chloride of silver ; C is the paraffin stopper perforated with two holes , one for the zinc rod to pass through , the other for filling in the liquid , the second hole is ultimately stopped by a paraffin plug jpp.* The stand S S ' , 16\#163 ; X 3^ inches and 4^ inches high , is made of Honduras mahogany and holds 20 cells ; it is supported on four ebonite feet ff\ inch high ; on the top ?
rail at the right or left corner , for the alternate shelves of the cabinet , is fixed a screw-clamp sc supported on a cylinder of ebonite fitted in the stand , the silver wire SW of the last cell is inserted between the screw-clamp and this ebonite support , and held fast by screwing the clamp tightly into its support .
The zinc of the terminal cell has also a screw-clamp screwed on it .
The zinc terminal clamp of one tray of 20 cells is connected by a gutta-percha covered wire N , one end being inserted and screwed fast into it , and the other end into the clamp sc connected with the silver wire of the terminal cell of the adjoining tray .
The cells are glass tubes with flat bottoms , 5^ inches high and 1-g- inch in diameter ; they pass through holes in the top rail and into recesses iii the bottom of the stand .
When the trays are put together a hot iron , like a soldering-bit , is run round the edge of the tube and round the zinc rod , this melts a little of the paraffin , making the joint tight and securing the zinc in its place .
The flattened silver , on which the chloride of silver is cast , of one cell is connected with the zinc of the adjoining cell by passing it through the hole in the top of the rod , and securing it by pressing in the taper plug with a pair of pliers ; these wires are 8 inches ( 20*32 centims. ) long , 0*05 inch ( 0*127 centim. ) wide , and 0*009 inch ( 0*0229 centim. ) thick , and weigh each 13*53 grains ( 0*88 grm. ) .
The holes in the stopper for charging the tubes are lightly closed by the insertion of the small paraffin plug pp , when the liquid has been ipserted .
The chloride of silver rodst are 2*125 inches ( 5*4 centims. ) long , and 0*3 inch ( 0*762 centim. ) diameter , and weigh 200*12 grains ( 12*97 grms. ) ; the vegetable parchment cylinders are 3*8 inches ( 9*65 centims. ) long , and 0*44 inch ( 1*12 centims. ) diameter .

Ill 6 inches ( 15*24 centims. ) long , and 0*22 inch ( 0*56 centim. ) diameter , and perforated at the top with a hole 0*1 inch ( 0*25 centim. ) in diameter , to admit the silver wire of the adjoining cell .
The fluid used for charging the batteries is chloride of ammonium , 23 grms. to 1 litre of distilled water ; by making use of a glass siphon with a long arm of india-rubber tubing , provided with a pinch cock , and terminating in a glass tube drawn down to enter freely into the hole in the paraffin stopper , it was found that 2400 cells could be charged by one person in ten hours .
Generally an enormous breakage of tubes takes place , the smaller number while inserting the stopper , but far the greater number without any apparent cause , in many cases after filling in the fluid , but chiefly before the battery has been charged .
This is a serious trouble , for as much as 33 per cent , of breakage occurs , and arises mainly from the tubes not having been properly annealed .
The battery behaves , on the whole , extremely well , and all the better the more frequently it is used , for idleness is its bane , as it permits of the slow formation and close adhesion of a skin of oxychloride of zinc , which interposes an enormous resistance in each cell , and reduces the current sensibly when the battery is worked in circuits of small resistance ; but for experiments with vacuum tubes , the current is amply sufficient , and has , in most cases , to be reduced by external resistance in order to protect the terminals of the tubes from fusing .
It is remarkably constant , and if coupled up through a resistance with a galvanometer in circuit , the deflection of the needle has been found to remain constant for several hours ; this we have had frequent occasion to do when determining the value of the deflections of our galvanometers in absolute units by electrolysis .
For example , a battery of 10 elements in series was connected through two galvanometers to a decomposition cell containing a solution of 1 part crystals of silver nitrate and 5 parts of water ; both electrodes were of silver , and were weighed before the commencement and at the end of the experiment .
The current was continued for exactly 1 hour , during which time one galvanometer showed a constant deflection of 77''75 , the other with fewer coils 60'*75 , when it was found that\#151 ; The positive electrode had lost 0*617 grm , , and The negative electrode had gained 0*616 " Mean 0*6165 " =0*0001713 grm. per second .
The resistance of the battery was 55 ohms , that of the decomposition cell was 3 ohms , and that of two galvanometers together was 5*24 ohms , making a total resistance of 63*24 .

A similar experiment with acidulated water in a voltameter having a resistance of 20 ohms gave in 6 minutes 7*2133 cub. centime , of mixed gases at 0 ' Cent , and 760 millims ; this corresponds to 0*001035 grm. of silver reduced per second by 1 cell through a resistance of 1 ohm , showing , on the supposition that the resistance had been accurately ascertained , that in the latter case about 5 per cent , of the current passed without an equivalent evolution of the mixed gases .
In order to eliminate small errors in the determination of the internal resistance of the battery , a single cell was built up of 10 rod cells so as to form one element of small resistance , namely , 0*297 ohm ; it was coupled up to the nitrate of silver decomposition cell through various resistances , making from 1*672 to 106*175 ohms total resistance in the circuit , the deflection of the galvanometers remained constant for 30 hours .
The mean of four experiments gave 0*0010945 grm. of silver deposited per second by 1 AgCl cell through 1 ohm .
This amounted to 94 per cent , of Kohlrauscr 's number multiplied by 1*03 volt , the electro-motive force of the chloride of silver cell\#151 ; 0*011363*Xl,03 __ 0-00H704 , Kohlrausch 's number being for the C. G. S. electro-magnetic unit , of which the .
Weber is one-tenth .
# When the deposit of oxychloride has caused a greater reduction of current than is convenient , the battery may be restored to its original condition by scraping the zinc rods , which is easy of accomplishment ; thus , 2400 rod cells charged up December 15th , 1875 , after being short-circuited for about half-an-hour to start the battery , evolved in a voltameter 2 cub. centims. of mixed gases in a minute ; on April 9th , 1877 , the battery only evolved 0'45 cub. centims. per minute .
Twenty cells were taken to pieces , and the zinc rods scraped to remove the crust which had formed on .
them , this battery of 20 then evolved 2'85 cub. centims. per minute .
The whole of the batteries were subsequently taken to pieces , and the zinc rods scraped , it required , on the average , six days to take to pieces and re-make up each 1200 cells of the rod battery.f From each of the batteries , 6 and 7 , each containing 1200 cells , there was * Everett 's C G S. Units , p. 77 .
t This operation was conscientiously performed by a pupil and workman of Messrs. Tisley and Spiiaeb , Mr. Henry Hawkins , who has put together most of our batteries , and of whose zeal and intelligence we are able to speak in high terms . . .
Since this communication was sent in , it has been found that a more expeditious mode of restoring the battery to its original current force is to withdraw the small paraffin ping used to close e hole in the stopper through which the cells are charged , and to introduce into each cell , containing 50 cub. centim. , 1 cub. centim. of pure hydrochloric acid , sp. gr. 1*16 , containing 318 per cent.

We found the vulcanised stoppers to be a source of great trouble ; in the first place , their elasticity frequently causes the tube to split , not at first possibly , but after the lapse sometimes of many months .
Moreover , after a year or so , many of them become in some measure conducting , and slowly run down the cell , and we have had many cases where a current of high potential has run along the top , and set fire to the stopper .
We have , therefore , entirely discarded vulcanised stoppers , substituting paraffin in our recent batteries and replacing broken down cells with vulcanised stoppers by others with paraffin .
The paraffin stoppers may be cast solid , as they are easily bored in a lathe with the American drill ; generally about five sizes are requisite to suit the various dimensions of the tubes used for cells , for it is quite impossible to obtain them of uniform diameter .
After having been in almost daily use during ten months , it was found that , in batteries 6 and 7 , 3'57 grms. of the chloride of silver rod , weighing originally 13 grms. , had been reduced , and 4*57 in batteries 4 and 5 , which had been in use sixteen months ; so that , when once set up , the life of the battery is sufficiently long , say three years , to admit of a great variety of experiments being made with it before it becomes necessary to renew it .
The loss of silver is not great , and on this point we are able , in consequence of an accidental circumstance , to give precise information ; 600 powder cells which had been charged up each with 14*5 grms. chloride of silver , ran down in consequence of portions of the zinc rod falling down on to the chloride equivalent to 0'3689 grin .
acid .
It is better to dilate the acid with , an equal volume of distilled water before introducing it into the cells , which is conveniently done by means of a graduated pipette furnished with a stop cock .
An effervescence takes place , and it is therefore necessary to allow tho tubes to remain twenty-four hours without the small paraffin plug being replaced , in order to permit the hydrogen , which is generated , to escape ; the acid dissolves 0'3295 grm. of zinc , or its equivalent of oxide .
It required two days for each battery , 1200 cells , to perform this operation.\#151 ; Nov. 29 , 1877 .
( this is now obviated by placing six discs of vegetable parchment on the chloride ) , the total weight of silver contained in the charge was\#151 ; 600 X 14-5 X 15*4325X3 f ---------\#151 ; \#151 ; \#151 ; ;----------=209 78 troy ounces ol silver .
480X4 J The quantity recovered was 206*92 Loss 2*86 or 1*38 per cent. Working in a large way this percentage , though small , would be still diminished , so that the chloride of silver battery is not costly in its working ; and we venture to believe that it is destined yet to find a place in telegraphy , for which its great constancy , and the very little attention it requires , particularly suit it .
It is without question a valuable implement for scientific research , and a source of great comfort to the operator , who finds it always ready at hand whenever he enters the laboratory .
Both the iodide and bromide batteries appear to form a much larger quantity of an oxyhaloid compound than the chloride ; the iodide solution especially seems to act on the zinc rods , causing filaments of metal to form , and bridge across towards the iodide of silver element .
They may be useful in making up in combination with chloride cells a battery of an exact number of volts , thus-\#151 ; volts .

Only a few experiments have as yet been made by us on the length of spark at different pressures below that of the atmosphere , but we intend to pursue this investigation with a micrometer discharger of longer range than that shown in fig. 1 , page 58 .

The comparison between the striking distances with spherical surfaces , and with the point and disc , points to the probability of the distances coinciding at a certain degree of rarefaction , Note A. \#171 ; I should attribute the difference of adhesion of the paper to the plate according as the point was positive ( P ) or negative ( N ) to the different facility with which electricity passes by discontinuous , and not too rapidly succeeding , discharges from points P and 1ST ; the facility being much greater from the former .
The points I have in view are not the metallic point alone , but also those ends of the fibres of which the paper consists which happen to be at the surfaces .
The dried paper is a very bad conductor .
Its upper surface is electrified by the electrified air whether the metallic point is P or N , and the electricity passes down through the bad conductor so slowly that the supply of electricity from the electrified air suffices to keep up a goc\gt ; d charge on it .
When the metallic point and consequently the paper is P , the ends of the fibres and other little roughnesses on the under face of the paper , by the property of P points , part with their electricity readily to the plate , so that the under portion of the stratum of paper is pretty well free from charge .
When it is N , the negative electricity of the paper has much greater difficulty in passing into the plate , and therefore there is more charge in the paper , and that too is situated ( in the mean ) further down , so that the paper and plate are equivalent to a condenser thinner than the paper itself , and therefore capable of receiving a greater charge than a metallic plate whose lower surface is at the height of the upper surface of the paper , and which is opposed to the actual plate , the paper being supposed removed .
" When the paper is damp , it conducts so much better that the electrification by the electrified air cannot keep pace with the loss by transfer to the plate , and there is small charge , and therefore small attraction .
When the upper electrode is greatly curved there is little electrification of the air , and therefore the charge of the paper resting on the lower electrode could not be kept up .
" Supplement .
February 11 , 1878 .
On January 1st , 1878 , we charged up with liquid the 2960 cells we had been preparing during the four previous months 1500 of these were rod cells , and 1460* powder cells .
Before combining them with the 8040 cells already in use we had the latter thoroughly examined and defective elements renewed .
Advantage was taken of the preparation of the new cells in order to ascertain whether the old ones had retained their initial electro-motive force ; this was done by means of the quadrant electrometer referred to in the footnote to page 104 , one pole of each battery being connected to earth , the other to the induction plate of the electrometer , and the following numbers were obtained :\#151 ; Battery .

It was found by direct experiment with several of the trays of 20 cells that the formation of ZnCl3 lessened the potential of the battery , and that it could be restored by removing the old liquid and charging the cells with a fresh solution of chloride of ammonium in the ratio of 23 grms. to 1 litre of distilled water .
In giving the following particulars of the measurements of the striking distances , it is necessary to state that as No. 8 battery contains 1500 cells and No. 9 battery 1460 cells , by adding No. 8 and 8 and 9 to the old series of 8040 , we obtain 9540 and 11,000 cells respectively .
It was not thought necessary to commence all the measurements afresh , as this would have occupied much time and uselessly wasted the life of the battery , so that we have contented ourselves with merely taking the striking distance of the 8040 cells , each time for the several forms of terminals , and then the additional striking distance for 9540 and 11,000 cells respectively .
These additional lengths of spark we have added on to the several means obtained for 8040 cells , as * The powder cells will be used to renew any of those in batteries 1 , 2 , 3 which may become exhausted , and will be replaced by rod cells .

It will be seen that the curve for two points runs on pretty smoothly with that obtained up to 8040 cells , whilst that for a point and disc bends inwards and no longer conforms to a curve , laid down on the hypothesis of the length of spark being in the ratio of the square of the number of elements .
We must state that our insulation is put to a severe test when 11,000 cells are connected in series , and that there is an evident leakage when one pole is connected to earth .
This may have some but not a great effect on the length of spark .
The 11,000 elements made manifest an interesting phenomenon in the streamer-discharge , which precedes the jump of the spark and formation of the arc , confirming what we have previously stated at pages 88-100 , namely , that the discharge is more continuous at the negative pole than at the positive .
It was seen that when two points were used as terminals in the discharger ( fig. 1 , page 58 ) with this number of elements there was a continuous brush-discharge at the negative , while from the positive an intermittent streamer-discharge took place , and that the streamers emanating from it enveloped the negative brush-discharge without m the least disturbing its form .
This phenomenon is well represented on a scale of 4 to 1 in fig. 32 .
