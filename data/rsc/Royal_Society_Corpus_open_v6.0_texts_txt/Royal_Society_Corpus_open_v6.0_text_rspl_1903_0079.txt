" Preliminary Note on the Resistance to Heat of B. By A. Mallock , F.R.S. , and Lieut.-Col. A. M. Davies , E.A.M.C. , Received November 30 , \#151 ; Read December 10 , 1903 .
Very discrepant statements have been made by various authorities as to the degree of temperature and duration of heating requisite to destroy the spores of various species of bacteria .
The great importance of the subject , especially as regards the rapid and effective* sterilisation of water for troops in the field , made us think it worth while to undertake the experiments here recorded .
Our object was to determine a curve whose ordinates should represent the time necessary for sterilisation in terms of the temperature to which the infected water was heated .
Since many of the authorities give very long times as necessary ( ranging from 10 minutes to some hours ) even at temperatures considerably above 100 ' C. , we expected to find that the slope of the curve would be a comparatively gentle one , and would meet the temperature axis at a finite but acute angle .
This expectation , however , was not fulfilled , and we rarely found any survival of living matter in fluid which had been raised to a temperature of 100 ' C. even for as short a time as 20\#151 ; 30 seconds .
In our earlier experiments ( Nos. 1\#151 ; 85 ) we used B.m. ruber , Staph , p. aureus , Staph , p. citreusand but subsequently we confined our attention to anthrax , and the results here recorded refer only to this latter , which may be considered as a typically resistant germ .
The experiments consisted in exposing infected water in sealed glass tubes to heat in steam , at various temperatures , and for various times , the contents of the tubes being afterwards incubated in broth .
The method and procedure employed is described in some detail , so that there may be no doubt about the conditions under which the results were obtained .
The heat was applied in a small closed chamber ( A ) ( fig. 1 ) , which by means of a two-way cock ( B ) could be placed in communication either with a steam boiler , or with the outer air .
The chamber had an easily removable steam-tight cover , to which was attached a light brass holder ( C ) fitted to receive six of the culture tubes .
Through the centre of the cover a thermometer was introduced into the chamber , its stem passing through a steam-tight packing , and its bulb dipping into water contained in the glass tube ( D ) , of the same size as the culture tubes .
The stem of the thermometer outside the chamber could be viewed through a lens attached to a movable pointer ( E ) .
This pointer was carried on the vertical rod ( F ) , which could be moved up and down by the milled head ( G ) , and a pen ( K ) , connected VOL. LXXII .

[ Nov. 30 , by levers with the rod at ( H ) , marking on uniformly moving paper , indicated the position of the pointer at each instant .
Time was also recorded on the paper by means of another pen ( L ) worked from an electric clock beating seconds .
During an experiment the pointer was kept carefully on the end of the mercury column in the thermometer , so that the diagram on the paper gave the temperature of the tubes in terms of time .

Thus the temperature to which the cultures were exposed must have been a little less than that recorded , but only when the times of heating were very short would the difference be appreciable .

The actual procedure in all the experiments was as follows Sterilised glass tubes 3 inches long and \ inch diameter were about half filled with infected water , and the tubes were then sealed with the blow-pipe This was effected without warming the contents by placing the tubes upright in a holder revolved by clockwork at about thirty revolutions per minute ; the top of the tube was then heated by an upward pointing flame until its diameter contracted to about l inch , and drawn to a point by means of a previously heated glass tube held in the hand .
_ - , The tubes were next placed in the holder attached to the cover o the chamber , the water in the tube surrounding the thermometer was brought to the same temperature as the sealed tubes and the cover placed on the heating chamber .
Before admitting steam , however , the paper record was started and the pointer ( E ) brought successively to 90 ' 100 ' , 110 ' , 120 ' , 130 ' , 140 ' , 150 ' , on the thermometer scale , so that each record might have on it a thermometer scale for reference .
Steam was then admitted and the requisite temperature maintained for the time determined on .
With a little practice in manipulating the two-way cock it was found easy to keep the temperature constant within a quarter of a degree Centigrade .
Of course the temperature which it was wished to maintain was settled beforehand , but m the results the temperatures are taken from the records .
The method of inoculating the tubes was as follows:\#151 ; The tubes , having been plugged and sterilised by dry heat , were half filled with distilled water , re-plugged , and then sterilised in the steamer for half an hour on three successive occasions .
On the morning of the day of experiment the tubes were inoculated with the respective organisms , either from an agar or broth culture , as stated in each instance , and again plugged .
Within two or three hours the inoculated tubes were sealed up and submitted to the different degrees and durations of heat , as detailed in the table .
This having been done the tops of the tubes were filed off , and the contents sown into broth with the least possible delay , generally within two hours .
Microscopic examination of the culture inoculated was made in each case immediately before sowing into the tubes j and afterwards , as soon as growth ( it any ) made its appearance in the inoculated broth , in order to ven y e purity of the cultures .
, .
Care was taken in all cases to be sure that spores were present m the infected water .
, The original growth of Bacillus anthracis was obtained from a pure culture on agar , supplied by the kindness of Dr. J- W. .
ire \gt ; Bacteriologist to Guy 's Hospital ; this was derived from t e \#166 ; 0 \#174 ; a fatal case of anthrax in the wards of the Hospital in Marc \#187 ; .
Sub-cultures were made from this strain , and inoculated into e u es of water , as detailed in the tables .

Out of the 95 , 14 eases occurred in which some growth took place after incubation .
In 12 cases out of the 14 the growth was contaminated .
Out of the 18 experiments below 100 ' C. , growth occurred in 5 cases , in only 1 of which ( viz. , in Experiment 109 ) was a pure Anthrax developed .
Whether Anthrax was really present in any of the contaminated growths is somewhat doubtful .
All that can be said is that in 3 cases the usual Subtilis contamination was accompanied by a non-motile spore-bearing bacillus growing in threads , which , as far as appearance goes , might be Anthrax .
Looking at the experiments as a whole , and considering that ten 190 .

different sub-cultures were experimented with at many different ages , and that in only two cases ( viz. , Experiments 8 and 97 ) was a pure Anthrax growth obtained when the infected water had been raised to 100 ' C. , we conclude that any heating of Anthrax spores in water to this or any higher temperature , even for the shortest practicable time , is almost certain to insure their destruction .
What is the lower limit of destructive temperature , when the heating is prolonged , we have not attempted to determine , but we hope to make some observations on this point both with regard to Anthrax and some other spore-bearing bacilli , and to give the results in a further communication .
On the .Resemblances Exhibited between the Cells of Malignant Growths in Man and those of Normal Reproductive Tissues."* By J. Bretland Farmer , F.R.S. , J. E. S. Moore , F.L.S. , and 0 .

Received December 8 , \#151 ; Read December 10 , 1903 .
The object of this communication is to draw attention to certain important cytological transformations exhibited during the development of malignant growths in man .
We believe that the changes we are about to describe are diagnostic of malignant as opposed to those of a benign character .
Furthermore , if our conclusions are well founded , they may at the same time serve to throw light upon the nature of the processes involved in the formation of these growths , and we hope that they may also serve as a point of departure for further investigations on the more remote setiology of the disease itself .
We wish , however , at the outset , to disclaim all intention of formulating at the present time any theory as to the nature of these various remote causes , although , as will be seen in the sequel , our observations indicate certain directions along which such causes may perhaps be profitably sought .
We may at once state as the results of our investigations on a large number of malignant growths , including numerous examples of Carcinomata and Sarcomata , that we have been able to trace in detail a number of definite and serial changes in the cells of the invading and proliferating malignant tissue , which are remarkably similar to those obtaining during the maturation of the elements contained within the sexual reproductive glands , and it would seem that such a resemblance , * We desire to state that whilst working together at this subjeet we have each approached the problems from an independent standpoint .
The paper is in every sense a joint one .
