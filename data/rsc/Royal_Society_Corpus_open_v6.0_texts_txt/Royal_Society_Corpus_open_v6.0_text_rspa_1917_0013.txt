188 Spontaneous Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel .
* By Charles F. Brush and Sir Bobert A. Hadfield , F.R.S. ( Received January 17 , 1917 .
) The object of this paper is to show that various kinds of steel , including carbon tool steel , " high speed " tungsten-chromium steel , and other similar iron alloys , after being quenched at a high temperature and hardened , spontaneously generate heat for at least several weeks in appreciable and measurable quantity , the rate of generation of course steadily diminishing .
The paper is divided into two sections .
First the research work relating to this discovery which originated with one of us ( Brush ) and which in the second part has been further experimented upon and verified by one of us ( Hadfield ) .
As the paper contains important new facts of much interest , it seems desirable that the results should be brought before the Royal Society .
Fig. 1 is a diagram of the apparatus employed .
A and B represent two large silvered Dewar vacuum jars selected to have very nearly equal thermal insulating efficiency .
They are supported in a wooden rack inside a thick copper cylinder C , packed in granulated cork in a wooden box E. D is a paper extension of C,.packed with layers of felt , by removal of which and the loose copper cover of C , easy access is had to the Dewar jars .
The copper cylinder weighs 52 lb. and its functions are , by reason of its large thermal capacity and high conductivity , to protect the Dewar jars from any rapid change of temperature , and from temperature stratification .
The box E is surrounded by a much larger wooden box F , lagged with felt .
By means of a long resistance wire and thermostat , not shown , the air space between the boxes may be maintained at constant temperature .
A ' is an air-tight cylinder of thin copper , 6 inches high and inches in diameter , provided with an open half-inch axial tube , also of copper .
A small round opening at the top of A ' permits the introduction of a weighed quantity of water , after which the opening is tightly corked to prevent any change of temperature by evaporation of the water .
B ' is another copper cylinder just like A ' , except that it has a removable top to permit the introduction of the substance whose thermal behaviour is to be investigated .
The high thermal conductivity of these copper cylinders prevents temperature stratification within them .
The Dewar jars are filled above the copper cylinders with layers of felt and granulated cork , and covered with waxed * Brush , in April , 1915 , presented a paper to the American Philosophical Society with regard to this subject .

Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened .
189 cardboard carefully sealed on to prevent temperature-difference inside the jars which would follow unequal loss or gain of moisture by the felt and granulated cork .
A small thin glass tube , flanged at top and closed at bottom , is located in the axis of each Dewar jar and extends from the waxed cover nearly to the bottom of the enclosed copper cylinder .
The glass tubes contain the ends of thermo-electric couples of fine constantan , copper and iron wires , one iron-constantan and one copper-constantan junction at the T a .

Careful calibration has shown that 55 scale divisions of the galvanometer indicate 1 ' C. temperature-difference between A and B ' , and that temperature-difference and galvanometer deflection are very closely proportional throughout the range used .

Spontaneous In the following experiment A ' and B ' were removed from the Dewar jars and allowed to attain equal room temperature .
Twelve half-inch round bars of tool steel , 5 inches long and with machined surfaces , were hardened by-heating to high " cherry-red " in a reducing atmosphere of a gas furnace and quenching in cold water .
The bars then had a thin and strongly adhering coating of black oxide .
They were next stirred in a large quantity of water at room temperature , to acquire that temperature , wiped dry , and oiled with heavy , neutral mineral oil to prevent generation of heat by further surface oxidation , wiped free of excess of oil and placed in the copper cylinder B ' .
A weighed quantity of water , also at room temperature , just sufficient to equal the steel bars in thermal capacity had already been placed in A ' .
The whole apparatus was then assembled as quickly as possible , and galvanometer readings commenced .
The upper curve in fig. 2 shows the progress of heat generation in the carbon tool steel bars during the first 150 hours after hardening .

The " normal cooling " curve was obtained five or six weeks after the other , , and when the generation of heat had very nearly ceased .
For this purpose the steel bars were removed , warmed a few degrees , and replaced ; then galvanometer readings were made from time to time as before .
This curve is plotted in a location convenient for visual comparison with the heating curve , but otherwise might just as well be plotted farther to the right .
For studying the generation of heat at any point in the upper curve , the curve of normal cooling may be plotted where it will intersect the upper curve at the desired point .
Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel .
The tungsten-chromium steel , consisting of the same number of bars of the same dimensions as in the first experiment , was treated in the same manner .
Fig. 3 shows the curve of heat generation in the tungsten-chromium steel , and the curve of normal cooling located with respect thereto , as in fig. 2 .

Further experiments show that carbon steel , when hardened , remains very considerably expanded , and that it shrinks progressively when " tempered " to various stages , and finally annealed .
A long thin bar of high carbon steel was found to shrink spontaneously after hardening , to such an extent that its progress was easily measured and followed for many days .
The spontaneous shrinkage of this steel is plotted in fig. 4 .

It was further shown that while spontaneous generation of heat was probably accompanied oy spontaneous shrinking in the specimen of steel 192 Mr. C. F. Brush and Sir R. A. Hadfield .
Spontaneous examined , yet the shrinking could not possibly be the prime cause-of the heat , because the work represented by the heat generated was hundreds of times more than sufficient to effect the reduction in volume that probably occurred .
This conclusion , that shrinking was not the cause of the generation of heat , has been questioned ; but the more recent experiments , some of which show no shrinking during the generation of heat , confirm it .
One of us ( Hadfield ) prepared two sets of specimens of nickel-chromium steel , of which the analyses are given in the accompanying figures , which were tested for spontaneous generation of heat after hardening .
Each set of specimens consisted of twelve half-inch round bars , five inches long , with machined surfaces , so that results obtained would be quantitatively comparable with those of the other kinds of steel formerly examined .
Specimen A was gradually heated in a gas furnace , with reducing atmosphere , whilst its magnetic susceptibility was observed from time to time by means of a simple induction apparatus devised for the purpose .
Susceptibility remained substantially constant until cherry-red heat was reached , then soon rose 10 per cent , or more , and again remained constant , at the higher value , for several minutes , then fell off rapidly to nothing .
This was taken to indicate complete decalescence , and the proper temperature for hardening .
The furnace was immediately opened , and the twelve bars quenched separately in water and crushed ice , then stirred in much water at room temperature , wiped dry , oiled , and placed in the calorimeter ( fig. 1 ) , all as in the earlier experiments first described .
Fig. 5 shows the progress of heat generation following this first hardening of specimen A of the Hadfield nickel-chromium steel .
Kapid generation of heat is indicated in the early stages , especially during the first hour , and maximum temperature , the point at which gain of heat was balanced by normal cooling , was reached in about 3| hours .
Obviously the rate of generation had diminished very much by that time , and was falling fast , though it still retained considerable value at the end of 150 hours .
In general , the curve of " first hardening " clearly indicates that the rate of heat generation diminished steadily from the moment of quenching the hot steel .
After a week of cooling , the same bars were again placed in the furnace and heated to a temperature considerably higher than before , by continuing the heating 15 minutes after complete loss of magnetic susceptibility .
They were then quenched and treated as formerly .
The other curve of fig. 5 shows the effect of the higher quenching temperature .
Generation of heat was at first much slower than before , the far lower maximum temperature requiring 8 hours to reach ; but the generation was Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel . .
193 much better sustained , as indicated also by the crossing of the curves after 35 hours .
The total amount of heat generated was not greatly different in the two cases .

Spontaneous second hardening .
The total amount of heat generated was much greater after the second hardening than after the first ; B differed greatly from A in this respect .
Probably this was due to the different carbon , chromium , and nickel content , as shown in the analyses of the two specimens .
The effect on specimen B of a moderate increase in quenching temperature was so great that it was thought worth while to quench it a third time , at a temperature somewhat lower than in " first hardening , " and the temperature of complete recalescence was chosen ; so that while the quenching temperature of first hardening was just above the critical temperature of decalescence , that of the third hardening would lie just below the critical temperature of recalescence .
In this way light may be thrown on the cause of the spontaneous generation of heat .
With regard to the third quenching of specimen B , alluded to as the " third hardening , " this having been quenched below the critical temperature is , of course , not hardened in the true sense , but would be slightly stiffer than material in the annealed condition .
In pursuance of this idea , specimen B was again slowly heated in the gas furnace until complete loss of magnetic susceptibility was reached .
This was the quenching temperature of first hardening .
Then the supply of gas and air was so far reduced that the furnace very gradually cooled .
In about 20 minutes the steel commenced to regain its magnetic susceptibility , and a few minutes later had completely regained it .
The bars were immediately quenched , and treated as formerly .
It was expected that the spontaneous generation of heat would be greatly modified , or possibly eliminated , by thus quenching the steel below the critical temperature , because true hardening could not have taken place .
But it was not so .
On the contrary , fully three-fourths as much heat was generated as followed the first hardening , and its curve ( not plotted ) was parallel throughout with that of " first hardening .
" It may , therefore , safely be concluded that the spontaneous generation of heat , at least in the case of specimen B , was not associated with the phenomenon of recalescence.* ' * With reference to the foregoing statement , one of us ( Hadfield ) has since carried out tests on specimens quenched from just below the critical point .
The results are shown in the diagram ( fig. 14 ) and Table VII .
It will be seen that in this case there is no measurable evolution of heat .
Quenched from above the critical point as shown on diagram ( fig. 9 ) , the Brinell ball hardness number was 740 , and a rise of temperature of T35 ' was measured .
In the specimen now referred to there is a slight stiffening , that is , the ball hardness number of the steel has increased from 200 in its ordinary softer condition up to 300 after treatment in the above-mentioned experiment .
It will be seen that no measurable evolution of heat occurs .
In other words , the slight increase of hardness from 200 to 300 is due rather to the mechanical or slightly strained condition of the metal , but there is no real hardening .
Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel .
195 It has been suggested that some , at least , of the spontaneously generated heat found in all these experiments may have been due to chemical action of residual moisture or oil , or both , on the metal or its coating of oxide .
To meet this criticism , specimen B was again slowly heated until it began to lose its magnetic susceptibility .
This was above the temperature of the previous quenching , and presumably obliterated its effects ; it also destroyed the oil and oily compounds , if any , of the previous operation .
Then the furnace was closed and , with its contents , allowed to cool 4 hours .
The steel bars were then removed from the furnace , still too hot to handle , allowed to air-cool half-an-hour longer , stirred in much water at room temperature , wiped dry , oiled and placed in the calorimeter just as formerly .
The slow leakage of air into the hot furnace after closing bad provided the steel bars with a thin coating of black oxide having the same appearance as that which followed the previous quenchings .
The aim of all this procedure was to reproduce as faithfully as possible all the conditions which obtained in previous experiments , except hardening .
In all former experiments the temperature of the steel had risen considerably during the assembling of the apparatus immediately following the oiling of the bars , as shown by the curve.sheets .
But in this case the first galvanometer readings were slightly minus , showing that the steel was about one-fiftieth of a degree colder than the balancing water in the other Dewar jar ; and several days passed before approximate equality of temperature was reached .
Hence we may safely say that not the slightest trace of heat was generated in the steel , and that the heat generation observed in former experiments was surely due to hardening .
Before commencing the experiments with specimens A and B above detailed , a test bar of each lot was prepared by machining its ends slightly convex and polishing , so as to permit of accurate length measurements by means of a micrometer calliper easily manipulated to constant end-pressure , and easily read to one twenty-thousandth of an inch .
The test bars were mechanically held always in the same position between the calliper jaws .
Measurements of the test bars were made after various treatments , and the results are shown in Tables I and II .
The error of measurement does not exceed one unit in the last decimal .
It will be observed that in neither case was there any spontaneous shrinking after the first hardening , thus demonstrating that the heat generation which then occurred was not due to shrinking .
In both specimens total shrinkage was about twice as great after second hardening as after first hardening , but was divided between the several treatments quite differently .
Thus , comparing second hardening shrinkages 196 Mr. C. F. Brush and Sir R. A. Hadfield .

In connection with the first tempering , to light straw colour , in both cases of second hardening , an interesting phenomenon was observed , as follows :\#151 ; In all cases of tempering to colour , the bar was sandpapered bright , very slowly and uniformly heated , until the desired colour appeared , and then quenched in water at room temperature to arrest progress of tempering .
But after this secondary quenching the bars continued to shrink measurably for several hours .
The final , stable measurements are given in the Tables .
Why no further shrinking occurred when the bars were tempered to light blue is not entirely clear ; seemingly , the large shrinkage which followed first tempering , to light straw colour , brought about a condition sufficiently stable to withstand further change by the moderately higher temperature required for tempering to light blue .
With the object of adding to the research and also to demonstrate practically the phenomena in question , one of the authors of this paper ( Hadfield ) , with the full concurrence and desire of the other ( Brush ) , continued the research and carried out the following experiments at the Hadfield Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel .

The following description shows the methods employed and the results obtained .
These experiments further prove the accuracy of the work described above .
The more definite particulars regarding quenching temperatures and the correlation of hardness determinations will be of interest .
These results are also presented in a somewhat different manner and form , attempts being made to obtain the actual evolution of heat by making suitable allowance for imperfections of the heat insulation .

2-51 2-81 These two specimens represent what is termed the nickel-chromium type of steel , which is sensitive to hardening .
Such material when quenched is intensely hard .
Type B differs in containing higher percentages of nickel and chromium .
The main constituents are carbon , nickel , and chromium .
Silicon , sulphur , phosphorus , and manganese are low and have little or no influence .
The chromium intensifies the hardening action of the carbon , as shown by one of the authors ( Hadfield ) in his paper to the Iron and Steel Institute in 1892 on " Alloys of Iron and Chromium .
" The nickel present toughens the material .
The importance of this subject to those engaged in what are termed hardening operations will probably be considerable .
Neither of the authors pretends to claim that the curious facts now noticed are concerned with or relate to every fracture brought about by hardening .
On ' the other hand , undoubtedly the phenomenon noticed is well worthy of study .
.Nevertheless the phenomenon of hardening is most complex and even now a little understood one .
Intense molecular stresses brought about by the hardening phenomenon introduce a very complex set of problems still to be solved ; when it is considered that there are millions of small articles weighing from a few ounces to a few pounds each , which are now-a-days satisfactorily hardened , nevertheless there still remain mysterious phases .
Besides , the hardening phenomenon becomes still more difficult to handle when reaching large masses , for example , objects such as those of 20 inches 198 Mr. C. F. Brush and Sir R. A. Hadfield .
Spontaneous T .%\#163 ; 1*4 diameter or even more .
In such cases it is necessary to suddenly convert thousands of cubic inches from a soft plastic mass into one of intense hardness .
Naturally phenomena are met with which are difficult of explanation , but this paper probably throws some light upon the dark corners which still remain .
Preparation of Specimens .
Cylinders of the form shown in fig. 7 were machined from bars carefully annealed at 770 ' C. , and cooled slowly .
Description of Apparatus .
After a few preliminary trial experiments , the following arrangement was made ( fig. 8 ) :\#151 ; Two vacuum flasks were placed side by side in a wooden box , and packed round with magnesia , the whole enclosed in a tin receptacle with more magnesia in between , and loaded with lead .
The tin , with its contents , was placed in a bath of running cold water to maintain a more steady surrounding temperature .
The flasks were partly filled to a certain depth\#151 ; equal in the two cases\#151 ; with powdered fireclay .

199 in the outer vessel was coiled round the corks of the two flasks , so as to cool the air in the neighbourhood to approximately the same temperature as the water .
Method of Working .
A pair of specimens of the same steel were taken .
One of these was cooled in running water and transferred to one of the flasks , a mercurial thermometer was placed in the piece and the flask filled up with magnesia , the water circulating round the apparatus .
The second piece was heated to the desired quenching temperature and dropped into the quenching medium .
After exactly 2 minutes it was taken out and placed as quickly as possible in the same running water as the previous specimen , its temperature being observed by a thermometer .
When it had reached the same temperature as the other piece it was transferred immediately to the second flask , a similar thermometer being placed in the piece , the flask filled up and corked in a similar manner , with a layer of magnesia spread over the top of the flasks .
The height of the fireclay in the flasks was so arranged that the pieces were practically in the middle of the flasks .
In these experiments , the pieces were in position in the flasks and ready for observation at from 15 to 20 minutes after quenching .
The temperature readings were taken at definite intervals , for several hours following , of the unhardened and hardened pieces , and also the surrounding air .
Results .
The observations obtained are shown in Tables III , IV , V and VI , and plotted on the top of figs. 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 .
The difference of temperature between the two pieces was next plotted , and the rate of increase or decrease in temperature of both pieces at any instant deduced by calculation .
From these rate observations it was possible to deduce the rate of evolution of heat in the quenched specimen , allowing for the radiation and conduction losses .
This curve of evolution is shown by the broken line for each specimen at the bottom of the diagrams .
They are compared with each other in fig. 13 .
It will be observed that the method presented by one of the authors ( Iladfield ) , as shown in fig. 9 , is more clear , because , by dealing with rates of evolution of heat , corrections can be made for natural loss of heat due to imperfections in the heat insulation .

mercurial thermometers used ( graduated to one-tenth degree ) are sufficient to demonstrate , and measure with an approximate degree of accuracy , the rate of evolution of heat .
The apparatus could , no doubt , be still further 206 Mr. C. F. Brush and Sir R. A. Hadfield .
Spontaneous improved , with more perfect heat insulation , but an actual rise of temperature of 1-1 ' has been met with , and clearly noticed , in these experiments .

This is obviously a question of degree of perfection of the apparatus .
From the general trend of the curve it is apparent that the bulk of the heat was evolved almost immediately after quenching .
The observations did not commence in any case less than 15 minutes after quenching , and by making arrangements to take records sooner , no doubt still better and more interesting results would be obtained .

phenomena are not necessarily the same , even under similar conditions of quenching .
The water-quenched specimen ( No. 3 ) shows a larger evolution of heat , as might be expected , than the specimen ( No. 2 ) quenched in oil from the same temperature .
The hardening in such cases is more rapid and more intense .

) 210 Mr. C. F. Brush and Sir R. A. Hadfield .
Spontaneous demonstrate the very unstable state in which steel recently hardened really is , one practical indication of this being occasional spontaneous fracture .
The explanation of this interesting phenomenon is not very apparent .
In searching for such an explanation it is important to distinguish between cause and effect .
The most obvious explanation would be that the specimens in quenching necessarily do not cool at an equal rate all through their mass , since while losing heat the interior must always be higher in temperature than the exterior .
It may be that the interior portion by cooling somewhat slower does not acquire quite the same degree of hardness , nor , therefore , expand to the same amount as the exterior .
Some adjustment must , therefore , go on in the material , so that the comparatively softer and more ductile interior can accommodate itself by flow to the greater dimensions of the harder exterior portions .
In stating this , it must not be considered that the difference in the interior hardness is great ; under suitable conditions an interior hardness of equal intensity can be obtained .
While the accommodation referred to takes place\#151 ; it is supposed continuously for some time after quenching\#151 ; internal work is being developed which would naturally be manifested as heat , and , under conditions of heat insulation as in these experiments , as a rise in temperature .
Inability to adjust itself in this way owing to lack of ductility , would seem to explain the spontaneous fractures met with .
This theory is , however , somewhat discounted by the American results quoted , in which a distinct evolution of heat was measured in the absence of any change in dimensions .
Any chemical change inside the steel , that is to account for the evolution of heat noticed , would be expected to be probably accompanied by a change of hardness , which , however , does not appear to occur .
Certainly there is no very vital change ; it must be remembered , however , that present methods of measuring hardness do not enable us to precisely determine this point .
It is for this reason that one of the authors ( Hadfield ) in his work on the Hardness Committee of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers , and also in his contribution to the discussion on that Eeport , called attention to the great desirability of improved methods being brought about of accurately determining the hardness of materials possessing hardness of from about 580 to 750 as now indicated approximately by theBrinell method .
Excellent as is this method , it is not sufficiently accurate to give more than an approximate idea of such hardness .
It may be here added that , at about 600 Brinell ball number , what is usually termed glass-scratching hardness commences .
As regards the practical bearing of this matter , as applied to industrial Generation of Heat in Recently Hardened Steel .
211 practice , it is important to bear in mind that the rise of temperature found does not actually exist under practical conditions , even to the extent of 1 ' , a , s shown by one of our ( Hadfield 's ) experiments ; that is to say , under such conditions the heat evolved has every facility for getting away , and cannot take effect by raising the temperature of the steel .
Certainly , as a line point , there may be a very slight rise of temperature , say , in the centre of a large mass of steel , 15 or 20 inches in diameter , after hardening , because the heat has a long way to go to get from the centre to the outside , but on the quantities of heat demonstrated by these delicate experiments , this rise of temperature is negligible , and cannot , per se , do any harm .
The special feature of these experiments is that they demonstrate the evolution of heat by allowing it to raise the temperature of the steel , which then becomes the outward and visible sign .
In other words , it is necessary to distinguish between cause and effect .
The heat evolution itself must be only an effect .
What the cause is , one of us ( Brush ) suggests in the remarks put forward earlier in this paper .
No doubt breakages in large masses of steel are due partly to the expansion on hardening .
Such large masses often do not harden in the centre of the mass , and , therefore , do not expand equally throughout the section .
Unless such comparatively softer material can accommodate itself by stretching to the greater dimensions of the harder portions , there is great liability for fracture to occur .
In conclusion , the authors of this paper are led to regard the fact that hardened steel is in a condition of very great molecular strain , somewhat unstable , especially at first , after being quenched .
Spontaneous relief of a small portion of the strain causes generation of heat until stability at room temperature is reached .
Any considerable rise in temperature , as in tempering , permits further spontaneous relief of strain or molecular rearrangement , doubtless accompanied by more generation of heat , and so on until annealing is reached .
