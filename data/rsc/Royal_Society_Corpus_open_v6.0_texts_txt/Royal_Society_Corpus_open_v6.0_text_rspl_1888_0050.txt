3G7 a ring of ice formed at the surface , which gradually extended down the sides and towards the centre , till we had a long tube of ice thinning out towards the lower end joined on to a case of ice , lining the inside of the cone .
The tube grew thicker and thicker , till it became a solid bar .
When a piece of sheet india-rubber was laid on the surface ( to prevent air entering ) , it was frozen firmly to the sides of the mould , while the centre was pushed upwards into the shape of a beehive , till at last it burst .
It was curious to find the india-rubber with the middle part drawn out into a long tube with torn edges , firmly imbedded in the ice at some little distance from the end .
In conclusion , we wish to express our thanks to Dr. Main for the use of his special stretching machine , and of the various thermometers , callipers , and much other apparatus , which he has generously placed at our service .
In case any reader of this paper should be kind enough to offer us any useful suggestions , or on the other hand should desire further information on any point , we give here the permanent address of one of the authors , James C. McConnel , Brooklands , Prestwich , Manchester , England .
We may add that copies of papers bearing on the subject would be particularly acceptable .

( Abstract .
) The author describes and figures a series of specimens which throw new light upon Corda 's two genera Zygopteris and Anachoropteris , as they aie adopted by M. Renault , but which specimens show that both these genera can no longer be retained , even by those who appiove of such multiplications of ill-defined genera .
He proposes , therefore , the abandonment of Anachoropteris and the retention of Zygopteris , so that u Zygopteroid " may be employed as a descriptive adjective in connexion with some specially remarkable forms of petiolai vascular bundles .
Under the name of Rachiopteris hirsuta , a new group of freely branching stems or rhizomes are figmred and described , , characterised by having the exterior of their bark abundantly clothed , especially in what appear to be the younger shoots , with remarkably large curved multicellular hairs , closely resembling those similarly located in the young shoots of the Marsileae ; numeious cylindrical roots radiate from these axial organs .
Under the provisional name of Rachiopteris verticillata attention is also 368 Mr. G. Gore .
Effects of different Positive Metals [ June 21 , ' called to some curious roots , the secondary branches of which are given off in regular verticils ; besides these plants two other distinct kinds of roots are described , in each of which the cortical parenchyma is characterised by containing numerous lacuna ?
of the type so common amongst aquatic and semi-aquatic forms of vegetation__________e.g .
, Nymphma .
All the above objects are from the Lower Carboniferous beds at Halifax .

" Effects of Different Positive Metals , \amp ; c. , upon the Changes of Potential of Voltaic Couples .
" By G. Gore , F.R.S. Received June 13 , 1888 .
The following effects upon the minimum change of potential of a voltaic couple in water ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' May 26 , 1888 ) , and upon the change of potential attending variation of strength of its exciting liquid ( ibid. , May 31 , 1888 ) , were obtained by varying the kind of positive ( and of negative ) metal of the couple , and by employing different galvanometers .
The measurements were made by the method of balance , with the aid of a thermo-electric pile* ( ' Birmingham , Phil. Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 4 , p. 130 ) , and the numbers have been corrected for errors caused by absorption of hydrogen by the platinum .
The water employed was ordinary distilled water , redistilled after addition of a minute amount of sulphuric acid , and was quite free from ammonia .
