314 PROF .
DARWIN ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF A ROTATING MASS OF LIQUID .
( s pi a , p. 67 ) , we can hardly fail to be reminded of some such phenomenon as the protrusion of a filament of protoplasm from a mass of living matter .
Notwithstanding the caveat which M. Poincare enters as to the dangers of applying these results to heterogeneous masses and to cosmogony , I cannot restrain myself from joining him in seeing in this almost life-like process a counterpart to at least one form of the birth of double stars , planets , and satellites .
Note.\#151 ; Erratum in " Ellipsoidal Harmonic Analysis , " ' Phil. Trans. , ' A , vol. 197 , p. 512 , line 4 from foot .
