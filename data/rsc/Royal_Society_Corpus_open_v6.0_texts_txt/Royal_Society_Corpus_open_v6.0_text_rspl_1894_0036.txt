Its hinder molar teeth have undivided roots , and low crowns , which are subquadrate or transversely ovate , surrounded by a diadem of low cusps , which are chiefly developed on the external and internal borders , with crenulations or minute cusps on the anterior and posterior margins of these teeth .
There is a low central cusp in the middle of the crown from which slight ridges extend , chiefly in the transverse direction ; but in the type species these ridges take the form of a cross .
The species are distinguished by the form of the crown and the details of the cusps .
The upper and lower teeth are opposed so as to be evenly worn , but the mandibular teeth are narrower .
These teeth are highly specialised , but distinct in plan from Tritylodon , and from all known Reptiles .
They closely approximate to some of the higher Mammalia .
The author refers Diademodon to a division of the Theriodontia in which the teeth become worn with use , which is named Gomphodontia .

" On the Effect of Magnetisation upon the Dimensions of Wires and Rings of Annealed Iron .
" By Shelford Bidwell , M.A. , LL. B. , F.R.S. Received February 14 , 1894 .
In the year 1885 I submitted to the Royal Society the first of a series of papers* upon the changes produced by magnetisation in the dimensions of rods , \amp ; c. , of iron and other magnetic metals .
The chief , and perhaps the most interesting , subject of the paper was the observation that if the magnetising force were sufficiently increased , the extension which a magnetised iron rod at first underwent ( as originally noticed by Joulef ) was followed by contraction , the rod ultimately becoming shorter than when it was unmagnetised .
The elongation was generally found to attain a maximum with a magnetising force of from 80 to 120 C.G.S. units , and to vanish with a force of 300 to 400 , retraction occurring when still higher forces were applied .
From that date until quite recently no accounts of similar experiments by other workers have , so far as I know , been published .
About the beginning of last year , however , it was stated in the scientific journals that M. Alphonse Berget had investigated the magnetic dilatation of iron in strong fields , and had found that the length of his bar was still increasing when the magnetic field had * ' Roy .

229 reached as high , a value as 540 units , beyond which point the experiment was not carried .
On reference to the original paper in the ' Comptes Rendus , '* it appeared that the experiment was made with a cylindrical bar , measuring 5*2 cm .
by 1*95 cm .
, its length being less than three times its diameter .
The actual magnetising force must therefore have been enormously less than that due to the coil itself , and it is very improbable that it ever reached the value at which the iron ( or the greater portion of it , for the magnetisation must have been far from uniform ) would attain its maximum extension .
The * Phil. Mag.* of December , 1893 , contains an account of some experiments by Mr. Sidney Lochner , made , as he states , with the express object of determining whether M. Berget 's results or my own were correct .
Using a thin iron rod , he obtained a curve very closely resembling those published by myself ; but , as might have been expected , he found that a short thick rod , like that of M. Berget , gave no decided indication of having passed a maximum extension within the limits of the magnetising force that he employed .
A paper of great interest , on " Hysteresis attending the Change of Length by Magnetisation in Nickel and Iron , " by Mr. H. Nagaoka , published in the ' Phil. Mag.* for last January , also incidentally confirms my observations .
In subsequent papers I have shown how the elongations and retractions were modified by tension , and by the passage of electric currents through the specimens under examination ; and in the present communication I propose to deal with the somewhat unexpected effects which were produced by carefully annealing the iron before using it .
Upon this point , Joule 's observations are as follows:\#151 ; " On inspecting the tables , it will be remarked that the elongation is , for the same magnetic intensity , greater in proportion to the softness of the metal .
It is greatest of all in the well annealed iron bars , and least in the hardened .
" f The current belief , in which till quite recently I myself shared , is in accord with this statement .
It appears , however , as will be shown , that it represents the reverse of the truth .
Joule 's conclusion with regard to iron seems to have been based entirely upon the results of a single experiment with an unannealed bar , and he may possibly have been mistaken in supposing that it consisted of the same quality of iron as the annealed bars which he had used before .
My own experiments , the results of which are given in Table I and fig. 1 , were made with a piece of iron wire , 10'6 cm .
in effective length and 0*265 cm .
in diameter .
The curve marked ( 1 ) shows the behaviour of the iron in the condition in which it was bought .

Effect of Magnetisation upon the [ Mar. length increased rapidly with the magnetising force , the maximum increment which was obtained in a field ( due to the coil ) of about 140 units being as much as 45 ten-millionths of the length of the wire .
The same wire was then carefully annealed , and the experiment repeated , with the results indicated in curve ( 2 ) .
It will be seen that the maximum increment had fallen from 45 to about 8 ten-millionths\#151 ; less than one-fifth of its former value\#151 ; and was reached with a force of about 60 units .
Finally , the wire was raised to a bright red heat in a blowpipe flame , and dropped into cold water , its subsequent performance being as indicated in curve ( 3 ) .
This last operation was found to have raised the maximum elongation from 8 to 25 ten-millionths , while the corresponding magnetising force had increased from 60 to about 110 units .

231 Other experiments gave results of a similar character , and many attempts were made to obtain an annealed wire which would not be lengthened at all by magnetisation , but begin to contract from the first , like nickel and cobalt .
But I never succeeded in bringing a wire into such a condition that its maximum elongation was less than 7 or 8 ten-millionths .
Though I failed with straight wires , however , I was perfectly successful with an iron ring .
I have in a former paper given an account of some experiments made with rings.* The changes in the diameter of a ring were found to be of just the same character as those observed in straight rods .
With a continuously increasing magnetising force the diameter first increased in length , and , after passing a maximum , ultimately became shorter than at starting .
In those experiments three different rings were employed , not one of which had been annealed before being used ; I therefore had a new ring made of good soft iron , and very thoroughly annealed .
It was afterwards fitted with a boxwood jacket , around which 515 turns of insulated wire were wound in the usual way .
With this ring it was found that the smallest currents which caused any effect at all produced contraction ; there was no indication of the smallest preliminary extension . .
The results of an experiment with the ring ( which I shall call Ring I ) are given in Table II and in the lower curve of fig. 2 .
The latter bears a close resemblance to the earlier portion of the curve given by a rod of cobalt .
The greatest retraction reached was nearly 75 ten-millionths ( exceeding any that has been ever before obtained with iron ) , and from the appearance of the curve there is reason to believe that this was still far from its limiting value , but the heating effect of the magnetising current made it impossible to carry the experiment further .
t , ' Phil. Trans. , ' 179 , A , p. 205 .
A ring is prepared for the experiment in the following manner:\#151 ; Short brass rods are attached to it at opposite ends of a diameter , forming prolongations , which serve to transmit the effect of changes in the length of the diameter to the measuring instrument .
The ring is then covered with a loosely fitting boxwood jacket , also ring-shaped , and through holes in this the two brass rods protrude .
The magnetising coil is wound directly upon the wooden ring , the object of the latter being to protect the iron from the heat Senerated when a current is passing th rough the coil .

233 run the risk of spoiling so remarkable a specimen which it might turn out to be difficult or impossible to replace .
I therefore had another ring made of iron from the same parcel , and believed to have been cut from the same bar as the first .
As , however , there was some doubt about this latter point , I thought it better in the first instance to anneal the new ring , and test it with a few turns of wire wound upon it .
Its behaviour was found not to differ materially from that of Ring I. A very small elongation\#151 ; too small to be measurable\#151 ; was , however , observed with a magnetising force of only 3 C.G.S. units , contraction beginning when the force was increased beyond this value .
The ring was then made red hot , and plunged into cold water , with the object of hardening it , after which operation it was replaced in its boxwood jacket and wound with 473 convolutions of wire .
This ring , called Ring II , was now found to give the same results as the old unannealed rings and straight wires .
As appears in Table II and fig. 2 , it attained its maximum elongation of about 33 ten-millionths in a field of 80 , its original length was recovered in a field of about 440 , and a retraction of 11 ten-millionths occurred in a field of 560 .
It appears , therefore , that as regards magnetic changes of dimensions , an iron rod or ring is affected by annealing in very nearly the same manner as by tensile stress , * a result which would hardly have been anticipated . !
Notes regarding Details .
The apparatus and methods of experiment were the same as those fully described in 'Phil .
Trans. ' , ' vol. 179 , A , pp. 218\#151 ; 224 , the instrument being arranged so as to have a magnifying power of 43,745 .
The height of each little square in fig. 2 corresponds to a length of about one-millionth of an inch ( 0'00000088 in .
for Ring I and 0-00000103 in .
for Ring II ) .
The wires and rings were demagnetised by reversals before every single observation .

t The less so since the length of an iron rod seems to be diminished by annealing .
A piece of iron wire 100 mm. long , cut from the same hank as that used in the experiments , was heated in a Bunsen flame , and slowly cooled .
It was found to have contracted 0'07 mm. , i.e. , 0 07 per cent. It was then heated in the blowpipe flame , and dropped into cold water .
This produced an elongation of about 0'G2 mm. , leaving the wire 005 mm. shorter than it was originally .
These-measurements were made with a rough apparatus extemporised for the purpose , and I do not attach much importance to the quantitative results , though there can he little doubt that they are qualitatively correct .

" On Correlation of certain External Parts of Palomon serratus."By H. Thompson .
Communicated by Professor Weldon , F.R.S. Received January 25 , 1894 .
In 1890 Professor Weldon published ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 47 , p. 445 ) the results of measurements of certain organs of the common shrimp , with a view to establish by accurate data the degree of variation existing in those organs .
In a later paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 51 , p. 2 ) he determined , by Mr. Galton 's method there described , the degree of correlation existing between four organs of the same animal , and in a recent paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proe .
, ' vol. 54 , p. 318 ) similar determinations have been worked out by him for certain organs of Carcinus moenas .
Some time ago it was suggested to me by Professor Weldon that I should determine the values of correlated variations in a number of parts of the hard exoskeleton of the common prawn ( serratus ) .
Accordingly , 1000 adult female prawns , chosen at random , were procured from Plymouth and measured .
Twenty-two measurements were made of each prawn , except in the case of two or three measurements which were made on part only of the sample .
The parts measured were the following :\#151 ;
