" On the Decomposition and Analysis of the Compounds of Ammonia and Cyanogen .
" By Robert Smith , Esq. , Ph. D. Communicated by Captain William Henry Smyth , R.N. , F.R.S. This paper is divided into four parts ; the first relates to the decomposition of ammonia and its compounds by the compounds of chlorine , and the collection and measurement of the nitrogen gas which is disengaged , the amount of which the author considers as furnishing a ready and accurate mode of estimating the quantity of ammonia in the solution subjected to analysis .
The chloride of lime was the salt usually employed for this purpose : this method is regarded by the author as being peculiarly applicable to the analysis of organic substances .
The second part treats of the decomposition and estimation of hydrocyanic acid and its compounds by means of chloride of lime , yielding nitrogen gas and carbonate of lime ; a process which occupies but a few seconds .
In some cases , the employment of chloride of soda is preferable to that of chloride of lime , on account of the solubility of all the compounds that are formed .
The author found the same method applicable also to the analysis of the salts of cyanogen ; for the cyanides of the alkalies are decomposed by it as rapidly as the pure acid itself .
The ferro-cyanides are also very readily decomposed .
The author , in the third part of his paper , relates the results of his trials of the hypochlorites as agents for the decomposition of uric acid , which proved so satisfactory as to induce him to belie'-e that these salts might be advantageously used as solvents of uric calculi in the living bladder .
He also proposes the employment of chloride of lime as a ready and accurate niode of estimating the quantity of nitrogen contained in urine , from the amount of gas disengaged by its action on the nitrogenous compounds .
In the last part , the apparatus used in the experiments is described .
