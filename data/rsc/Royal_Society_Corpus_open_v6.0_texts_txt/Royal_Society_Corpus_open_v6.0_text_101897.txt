An Account of some Saxon Coins found in Suffolk ; Communicated by Sir P. S. R. S. Soc. IN May 1687 , at Honedon nigh Clare in Suffolk , the Sexton , as he was digging a Grave in the Church-yard , met with a Skull ; and near it his Spade broke a Yellow Earthen Pot , wherein were many Silver pieces of Saxon Money , some of which I have seen , and endeavoured to read the Inscriptions , which are so various , that there are scarce two alike , tho ' they are generally of the same bigness , viz. of a Groat , and about the same weight .
I guess this variety of Inscriptions arises from the many Masters of the Mint who were appointed to coin Money in several Places , and who might each of them have a different Stamp : and I find this Conjecture of mine countenanced by a Passage in K. AEthelstan 's Laws , Printed by Lambard .
Some say there was no Pot .

The King 's Council might assign Money to be Coined in as many Places as they will .
( a ) But now in France , tho ' there be Mints in several Cities , yet there is no difference in the Inscriptions , only a Letter of the Alphabet , to signify where the Money is stamped ; as A for Paris , &amp;c. These Saxon Monies were Denarii , or Pennies ; for Greaves , of the Denarius , p. 117 .
says , In Ethelred 's time it was the 20th part of the silver Ounce Troy , and bigger than three of our present Pennies ; and our Goldsmiths weigh by this Penny weight or 24 Grains .
Five of the Saxon Pennies made a Shilling , and ( as Lambard 's Glossary says ) therefore 48 of those Shillings made a Pound , and 240 Pennies made a Pound , which is the present Proportion of our Penny and Pound , tho ' the intrinsic value be about three to one different .
I cannot yet meet with any satisfactory Reason , why this Money should be thus buried ; tho ' very probably it was upon a superstitious Account : I shall only offer a bare Conjecture of mine ; There were , they say , between 200 and 300 pieces found in the Grave ; and if 240 , i.e. 1 l. then the Deceased might order so many to be buried with him , as a kind of Expiation for having privately killed a Dane of servile Condition ; for in Ethelred 's Law there is this Penalty , Servilis conditionis Dacum si Anglus morte affecerit , integram solvito Libram .
If more or less was found , it might answer another Mulct enjoined by the Saxon Laws for killing or maiming some Person of another Quality .
Or the aestimatio capitis might be laid in the Grave with the Person that was killed .
Those who believe they were Peter-Pence , Rome-Scot , Rome Feoh , or Hearth-Penny , I think are under a Mistake ; for that Money was collected every Year , and carried out of the Nation .
Nor it cannot be the Soul Scot mentioned in Canute 's Laws , ( but first required by the Council or Parliament at Eanham in Ethelred 's time ) to be paid at the opening of the Grave , ( whence Sir Henry Spelman , De Sepultura , thinks the Fee demanded for the Office of Burial is derived ) for it is not likely that Fee or Soul-Scot paid to the Priest did amount to the Sum found in this Grave ; and it is more unlikely that the Priest should so easily part with his Money , by burying it .
I shall , as well as I can , give you the Inscriptions on those I On some of these Monies there are very odd Saxon Characters , which are not drawn here very exactly .

( l ) But I find Gronovius may be corrected in what he writes in the Addenda to the same Treatise by this Reverse ; Dubium non est ( says he ) si Saxonibus Anglis deberetur ea Vox , Sterling , in monumentis illorum repertam iri .
~ constat inter omnes ante Normannorum ingressum in Angliam , non reperiri mentionem hujus Vocabuli ; cum ipso Gulielmo primum legi , Sterlingos , &amp;c. appellatos , ergo his debetur ea Vox in Anglia .
Yet I believe what he writes just before , Denariis autem nomen etiam Sterlinges fuisse , in Continent qud Normanni imperabant , ostendunt duo rescripta Pontificum Romanorum in Decreto Gregorii ; and he might well have added , That the Normans borrowed of the Franks that Word Sterling , as well as descriptionem Librae per solidos denariosque .
But it may be , when Gronovius writ , no Coin or Monument of Antiquity was then discovered in England that mentioned Sterling before William I. whose Name brings to my mind , that on his Coin P is put for W. ( n ) Sir Henry Spelman , in his Glossary , speaks of Sterling and Denarius to be the same ; and he directs to the Statute made An. 1302 , 31 Edw. I. wherein the Penny is called Sterling , and the weight of the Sterling is 32 Grains of dried Wheat ; ( and I have weighed 32 Grains of Wheat , and they are equal to 24 Grains Troy-weight , which is our Saxon Penny .
) And Ann. 1496 , 12 Hen .

Cap. 5 , there is another Statute wherein the Sterling is of the same weight .
I am credibly informed , some of Egbert 's and Ethelbert 's Coin were found amongst them : Those I saw , were AEthelstan 's , who began his Reign about the Year 925 .
Edmund Etheling 's his Brother , ( for I take the Edmunds to be his ) who began his Reign 940 ; Edred , another Brother , who began his Reign 946 .
I hope others more skilful in Antiquities , and that have better advantage by our Records and ancient Histories , will give a clearer Interpretation of the Words , Characters , and other Circumstances relating to these and other Saxon Monies .
In the Church-yard at Foultsham in Norfolk , there is a Tomb-stone with this Inscription , which some of the Learned in these Curiosities may perhaps explain .

The want of knowing this Custom , has caused some Learned Men to mistake some Coins of Edward IV .
with Civitas Norwic .
on the Reverse , for Medals stamped in memory of Kett 's Insurrection , by Edward VI .
Golden Medals , in memory of great Actions , are of ancient use amongst us ; witness that golden Coin of Edward III .
where a Shield , with the Arms of England and France over a Ship , is stamped , to show his Title to the Kingdom of France , which he then claimed ; yet this can hardly be shown in silver Coins which then passed for current Money : that seems to have been peculiar to the Greeks and Romans , except some Instances in these two last Ages .
The single Exception of Edward III .
who quartered England and France in his Money , doth not weaken my Assertion , since it was extraordinary , as a more public Proclamation of the Justice of that Title , which he set on foot against Philip de ~ .
( b ) This Reverse is to be read PENE FEHO ; i. e. Penny money , a Duplication usual amongst the Saxons ; so afterwards Sterling-mony .
Feho , or Feoh , is a common Word for Money .

( c ) LAND~EH O ; This was coined in Memory of a Land Tax , raised by AEthelstan , to support his Wars against the Danes and Scots ; against whom , especially the Scots , he was always victorious .
Our Writers ( Ingulph .
Hist. Croyland .
p. 29 .
) say that he killed Constantine King of the Scots , with five more Kings at the same time ; but the Chronicle of Mailrose , written by the Abbot of Dundrainand , a Scottish-man , says only , Regem Scottorum Constantinum praelio vicit , &amp; fugavit ; ( ad An. 926 .
p. 147 .
) And this is the only AEthelstan who was ever King of England : There was another AEthelstan King of Kent only , Son to Egbert , who beat the Danes at Sandwich in Ann. 852 .
The variety of Letters in these Reverses is remarkable : The last Word in these two Reverses is manifestly to be read alike , yet the form of the Letters is vastly different .
This variety arose from the multitude of Mints , which did not all tie themselves up to one Stamp , nor to the same Letters .
AREM ( d ) This I should read REgia Moneta , to di+ ++ stinguish it from the Bishops or Abbots , for it was GNE A. probably coined at Canter bury ; A , I take to be a Mint-masters Mark .
( e ) Tho ' these Coins , as far as I can judge , are as good Silver as any current with us , if not better ; yet since what Alloy is in them is of Brass , I am apt to think , that the acid Steams in a long series of Ages arising from the Humane Bodies , might corrode so far into the Metal , as to raise some little Verdigrease upon the Surface of the Coins ; to which that Greenness is to be imputed .
( f ) Probably this Albericus was a Nobleman , and they might have had the Jus monetae as well as Bishops and Abbots ; but I must confess I cannot make that our clearly .
H before G is an usual Transposition ; so HClotharius , H Ludowicus .
( g ) This I read IVEMONET A , or Iv Money , that is , Money coined at St. Ives in Huntingdonshire .
The H , as also II , both used for M , are remarkable .
Bouteroue , in his Disquisitions on the old French Monies , gives us some Gallic Epitaphs from which he draws an Alphabet of the old Gauls : in that , H and ~ are used for M ; so that possibly the Britains might likewise use them : it is manifest they are not Saxon Letters ; and I see no Absurdity to allow the Saxons to have borrowed them from the Britains , and to have used them amongst their own Capitals .
There is a Coin in Tab. 3 .
Coin 14 .
of the Collection prefixed before AElfred 's Life , which has two other of those Gallic Letters of which Bouteroue has given us an Alphabet .
The Coin is , ~ ~~ BERII ~~ LF RE D+++ Fi RD ~~LED M~ The ~ and ~ are S and F in his Alphabet ; and I am apt to think , that that Inversion of Letters in these Saxon Monies , as ~ for M , ~ for M , ~ for F , took its rise from them ; for in this Alphabet we have ~ and ~ for D ; ~ , ~ , Z , for S : however , this will evince , in some measure , the Practice of such Inversions , which made some Learned Men take them for Runic , Gothic , or indeed for any Characters with which they were little acquainted .
( h ) This and the Reverse of the I I , are to be read alike , tho ' they were coined at different Places , as appears from the variety of the Letters .
( i ) II which is used here for M , is frequently used in that Collection of Saxon Coins prefixed to AElfred 's Life .
( k ) This Gotae mone , or Gods Money , was the Peter-Pence which was collected yearly , and sent to Rome .
Ina , one of the Kings of the Mercians , first gave it : thence it was constantly paid afterwards , tho ' now and then intermitted in the heat of the Danish Wars , I suppose this Coin came out of an Ecclesiastical Mint .
( l ) The true Original of Sterling is Starry .
The Common People observing the Crosses upon the Coins , which looked like so many Stars , called them Sterlings , Starry pieces .
Ling is an adjective Termination in the Saxon Language ; so in time , the Word became Substantive , and was used promiscuoufly for Penny .
( m ) The 19 and 21 Reverses are to be read alike , tho ' possibly they might be made from different Stamps .
The Letters in both ( for neither are very clear ) will mutually explain each other .
I read it M~HE~~~HON E , or Malmesbury Money : The ~ , which is an entire Letter , seems to have been taken from the square B , or ~ .
( n ) This P was the old Saxon ~ or W ; so it was Willem , not Pillem .
The Saxon Character , which was full and plain , gave rise to that small beautiful Character which we usually call the Roman Letter .
The ancient Romans , for ought as yet appears to the contrary , wrote all with one uniform Character , sometimes greater and sometimes less , of the same Figure with the great Letters in our Alphabet .
This they took from the Greeks ; and it is usual in all the Alphabets of the Oriental Nations .
The three Inscriptions in Gruter , ( page .

) only prove that they had our small t , p , b , h , for we have no Hints in our MSS .
of any others .
After them succeeded the Francick or Merovingian Character , entirely left off in transcribing Books after Charlemagne .
The Notaries kept it longer ; only by making it longer , they brought it to something like the Italica , to which it possibly gave rise .
The Specimens in Mabillon 's fourth Book de re Diplomatica , will put this past doubt .
All this while the Saxon Character was used in England , whose Alphabet is evidently the same with the small Roman , except some Letters which expressed Sounds proper to their Language , as ~ , ~ , ~ : wherefore when ~ ( Scholar to Egbert Arch-blishop of York ) went over into France to Charles the Great , and afterwards sent for Books out of Egbert 's Library , as may be gathered from William of Malmesbury , he introduced that fine way of Writing , which immediately took place with all but the Public Notaries .
Mabillon owns the thing in effect , tho ' he dissembles the Original : Prima stirpe extincta , Carolus M. Literas expolire caepit , aut certe jam tantisper expolitum Scripturaegenus a Merovinginco in elegantiorem formam commutavit , quae in eandem formam evasit , quae hactenus minuti Romani Characteris nomen retinet .
( Lib. 1 .
Cap. 11 .
num .
10 .
) And if this Change was not wrought in a moment , because the Transcribers used to the old Merovingian hand conformed it to the new , as much as they could , yet that wore off by degrees : so Mabillon , quae [ Carolina Scriptura ] principio nonnihil Merovingici Characteris habebat intermistum ; at subinde politior effecta , in eandem formam , &amp;c. Mabillon acknowledges , that Alcuin introduced the modern Punctuation into the French MSS .
and Records , which he learned from the Saxons , particularly [ ~ ] for a full Period , as is manifest to all that shall look into the Saxon MSS .
or printed Books in imitation of them .
Besides , all our Latin MSS .
in England , 'till some time after the Conquest , were writ in the Saxon Character .
So Archbishop Parker published Asserius Menevensis : and there are several Latin MSS .
in the University-Library of Cambridge , written in the Saxon Character .
And it is no wonder that those Letters which expressed Sounds not used in the Roman Tongue , should be left out by the French Transcribers , who at the same time might use Saxon Copies : so that it is not strange Vossius should be mistaken , when he thought ~ and D were from the Greek ~ and ~ , who did not consider them to be both Runic Letters , which were introduced upon a particular occasion , by Chilperic , who took them from the Visigoths in Spain , as Wormius ( de Literatura Runica ) has probably proved from Gregorius Turonensis and a Constitution of the same Chilperic printed in Goldastus : yet I will not deny but Theodore , or some other of those Greeks , who in that Age had so great Intercourse with England , might introduce some Greek Letters to express those Sounds which they had not in their own Language ; from hence they were carried into France , with the rest of the Saxon Alphabet , and so into Italy ; which Mabillon also in effect acknowledges when he says , Hanc tamen Scripturae formam non Franci a Romanis , qui Langobardicis passim Elementis tunc utebantur , sed a Francis Romani accepisse videntur .
But it would take up too much time here to discourse of the Original of the Saxon Character , and whence those Agreements between it and the pure Merovingian and Lombard Characters might at first arise ; and perhaps the thing it self does not deserve any farther enquiry .
