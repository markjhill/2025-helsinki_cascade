[ Plate 3.J Through the kindness of Professor MTntosh , to whom my very best thanks are due , I spent some time last summer at the Marine Laboratory at Saint Andrews .
The results given below arose from what were intended to be control experiments in some observations which aimed at determining , if possible , what organ or system of organs is definitely excretory in function in the Echinoderms .
The common starfish ( Asterias r ) was the form used , being convenient both from its size and from its abundance .
Indian ink or a precipitated aniline blue was injected into the ccelomic cavity by means of a fine pipette or a hypodermic syringe .
It was found best to insert the instrument into an arm close to the disk , for then the arm is far more rarely thrown off than if the puncture is made near its distal end .
The specimen was next held in different positions so as to distribute the injected fluid .
The grannies that are introduced are ingested by the amoeboid corpuscles which float in the coelomic fluid , as can readily be demonstrated by microscopic examination of that fluid .
The granule-laden phagocytes can be seen very plainly , owing to the particles they have ingested , in the dermal branchiae of a living specimen .
The cilia of the coelomic epithelium cause them to dance up and down in the branchia , and to be thrown against its wall .
Every now and again a corpuscle will adhere , and by repetition of this process a small clump may be formed ; this occurs at or near the apex of the branchia .
Mr. H. E. Durham .
Emigration of [ Jan. 26 , The corpuscles after their adhesion to the wall of the branchia creep by their amoeboid movement through the coelomic epithelium , the connective tissue layer , and the epidermis to the exterior ( fig. 1 ) .
Thus a clump may be formed on the outer side of the branchia , and the animal is freed from some of the irritating particles .
In these clumps the corpuscles retain their individuality ( fig. 2 ) , they do not fuse to form plasmodia such as Geddes* describes in the so-called clotting of the perivisceral fluid of urchins ; indeed if such a coalescence did take place the facility for their migration through tissues would be considerably diminished .
In cases where the emigration is proceeding exceedingly actively , besides the isolated phagocytes that are seen at different depths in the branchial wall on their outward journey , the apices of some of the branchiae appear to be perforated by an aperture , which is entirely filled up by a plug of phagocytes ( fig. 3 , It is clear that such a result might be due either to a stretching of the wall by a simultaneous entrance of several phagocytes at a certain point and subsequent intrusions of others between them , or to an actual rupture or carrying away of part of the wall by the energy and magnitude of the emigration round one patch .
So far as can be made out from serial sections the former of these alternatives holds good ; there seems , however , to be no reason why the latter might not also take place .
Since in preparing Echinoderms for sections it is usual to distend them with the fixing fluid , I should mention that here such treatment has been avoided .
The specimens were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate , and the gills could then be removed in a distended state , while moreover they remained distended after removal .
To return to the subject : after their arrival at the exterior the corpuscles retain their irregular amoeboid shape for a time .
They then become spherical and swell up and later they disintegrate , the granules they contained being scattered free .
It was found that besides the corpuscles containing Indian ink particles in the extruded material , there occurred amoeboid cells loaded with refringent granules ( fig. 2 , \amp ; ) ; moreover it is not only in the injected specimens that such corpuscles emigrate ; for if a starfish is kept in a vessel ( into which fresh sea-water is constantly dripping ) it throws off from its surface a certain amount of a dirty brownish slime .
This slime contains large corpuscles with refringent granules ( fig. 4 ) which are apparently identical with those mentioned above , and with those peculiar cells which occur here and there in different parts of the animal , especially perhaps in the so-called " heart ; " they are called " Plasma-Wanderzellen " by the Germans : I propose to refer to them as " sphaeruliferous " corpuscles .

] Amoeboid Corpuscles the 329 In the slime these sphaeruliferous corpuscles are seen in various stages of disintegration , held together by a material of slimy consistency which is , at any rate in part , derived from the swollen-up stromata of the corpuscles , some doubtless having origin in the scattered mucous gland cells " of the epidermis .
Besides these elements a holotrichous infusorian occurred , frequently in considerable numbers , swimming about and feeding on the freely scattered granules .
In connexion with this I might also note that on a large percentage of the specimens of Asterias rubens observed at Saint Andrews there crawled a species of .
These Caprellae feed on the above-mentioned slime ; and those which lived on specimens treated with aniline blue presented particularly gay alimentary canals .
As regards the emigration of these sphaeruliferous cells , it is interesting to find that Hamann* has recently described and figured the presence of such corpuscles in the wall of the ambulacral gills of JKchinids ; these are doubtless on their outward journey .
I might also note here that when the dermal branchiae of Asterina gibbosa are slightly , not rigidly , distended , they move round and round , more or less circularly , so that their apices rub against the neighbouring ossicles .
This movement might be interpreted as the expression of attempts to remove emigrated corpuscles from their surface ; the branchiae when removed showed sphaeruliferous cells in their wall .
I hope to make further observations to help to elucidate the meaning of this out-wandering of sphaeruliferous cells , about which at present it is impossible to draw up any definite conclusions .
I desire now merely to note its occurrence .
It seems evident , however , that the starfish has the power of removing minute foreign particles introduced into its system ; and it is conceivable that in nature such particles might gain admittance to the ccelomic cavity when an arm is thrown off .
It does not seem clear what becomes of insoluble foreign granules when they are introduced into other animals , except in the case of mammals ; at any rate I have been unable to find any account of an actual transportation to the exterior such as has been described above .
Over and above any respiratory function that the dermal branchiae may have , they form from their structure convenient places for the out-passage of scavenging amoeboid cells .
Hamannf notes that their nerve supply is very scanty ; the well-being of a fine nerve plexus would obviously not be added to by amoeboid cells traversing it .
To summarise in a few words\#151 ; minute foreign bodies introduced into the body-cavity of the starfish are removed to the exterior by * ' Jenaische Zeitschrift , ' vol. 21 , p. 159 , and Taf .

on the [ Jan. 26 , phagocytes which pass out through the dermal branchiae .
In conclusion , I should state that clumps of corpuscles occur , here and there , in the pore canals of the rnadreporite both of Asterias and Crihrellaocellata as seen in sections .
The madreporites and neighbouring structures were removed from full-grown specimens and then placed in hardening fluids : this being so , I think it not improbable that these corpuscles came from the cut end of the " heart , " and arrived at their position by the outward ciliary current , recently described by Dr. Hartog.* It is difficult to conceive that such an outflow of corpuscles should take place normally ; for then there must be a continual loss of ordinary as well as of corpuscles .

I have a series of vertical longitudinal ( radial ) sections carried through the madreporite , \amp ; c. , of a full-grown specimen of Cribrella ocellata : in this series the madreporic canals have a peculiar relation to the stone canal or water-tube .
Most of the pore canals pass into collecting canals which open into the stone canal directly : some few , however , lead into the space below the madreporite , which is the upper extremity of the " schlauchformiger Kauai .
" The stone canal dilates laterally on each side into an " ampulla , " and one of these lateral lobes of the ampulla has an aperture into the " schlauchfbrmiger Kanal .
" Now the " schlauchfbrmiger Kanal " is derived from the enteroccele ( Hamann ) , f so that in the specimen described there is a permanent connexion between the hydrocoele cavity and the enteroccele cavity .
