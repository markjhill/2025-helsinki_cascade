A paper was read , entitled , " An Account of a Second Series of Experiments on the Resistance of Fluids to Bodies passing through them.* ' By James Walker , Esq. , F.R.S. , Civil Engineer .
The author , in a paper read to the Society in the year 1827 , and printed in the Philosophical Transactions , gave an account of some experiments showing that the resistance of fluids increases in a ratio considerably higher than the square of the velocity , and that the ab ?
solute resistance is smaller than had been deduced from the experiments of the French Academy .
In the present communication he states the results of his further inquiries on this subject .
His experiments were made at the East India Docks , on a boat twenty-three feet long and six wide , with the stem and stem nearly vertical ; one end being terminated by an angle of 42 ?
, and the other of 72 ?
; and the resistance to the boat 's motion being measured by a dynamometer .
The results are given in tables : and it appears from them , that in light vessels sharpness is more important in the bow than in the stem ; but that the reverse is the case in vessels carrying heavy cargoes .
From another series of experiments the author infers that the resistance to a flat surface does not exceed 1251b .
for each square foot , at a speed of one mile per hour ; increasing , for greater velo ?
cities , in a ratio considerably higher than the square of the velocity .
The author concludes with some observations on the results lately obtained in Scotland , where great velocities were given to boats moving on canals , without a proportional increase of resistance .
The reading of a paper , entitled , " Researches on the Arseniates , Phosphates , and Modifications of Phosphoric Acid , " by Thomas Graham , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S.E. , Lectureron Chemistry in the Andersonian Institution of Glasgow ; communicated by Edward Turner , M.D. , F.R.S. ?
was commenced .
