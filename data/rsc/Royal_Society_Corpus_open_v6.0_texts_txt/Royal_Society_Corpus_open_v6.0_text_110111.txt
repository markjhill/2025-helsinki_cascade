] This communication is intended merely as a supplement to a former paper on the same subject , printed in the Transactions of this Society , in which a deviation of the transit instrument from the plane of the meridian , arising from a difference of expansion in its braces , was pointed out .
As no instance was there given of the magnitude of this deviation , one is here adduced in which the inferior passage of the pole star was found to have been retarded twenty-five seconds in consequence of the sun having been allowed to shine on the upper western brace , the object-glass of the transit being towards the zenith .
The author adds , that in consequence of the detection of this source of inequality , he now views with great suspicion all his previous observations of solar transits .
