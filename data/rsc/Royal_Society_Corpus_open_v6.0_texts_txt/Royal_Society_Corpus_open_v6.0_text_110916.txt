" On Spontaneous Nitrification .
" By C. F. Schcenbein , Professor of Chemistry in the University of Bale .
Communicated by Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. From various facts adduced by the author , he is led to the conclusion , that during the slow combustion of phosphorus in moist atmospheric air , while ozone is produced , there is also formed a quantity of nitric acid ; and that in all cases where both these compound bodies are simultaneously generated , however different may be the concomitant circumstances of the experiment , there is strong reason to suspect that the formation of the one is in some way connected with that of the other .
