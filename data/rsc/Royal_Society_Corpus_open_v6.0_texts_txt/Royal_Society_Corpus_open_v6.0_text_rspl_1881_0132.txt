" Description of the Fossil Tusk of an extinct Proboscidian Mammal ( Notelephas australis , Ow .
) , from Queensland , Australia .
" By Professor Owen , C.B. , F.R.S. , \amp ; c. Received March 21 , 1882 .
( Abstract .
) The author , after referring to the notice of the finding of a molar tooth of a mastodon , in Australia , by Count Strzelecki , in his " Physical Description of New South Wales , " p. 312 , proceeds to the details of the first evidence of a proboscidian mammal which has reached him from that continent since the date ( 1845 ) of the Count 's work .
This evidence consists of portions of a tusk indicative of an elephantine animal , somewhat less than the existing ones of Asia and Africa .
The evidences of the ivory nature of the tusk are given ' in detail , including the minute characters of that variety of dentine .
Figures of the fossil and of the microscopical sections accompany the paper .
The specimen was discovered by Mr. Fred .
N. Isaac , in a " drift-deposit of a ravine in a district of Darling Downs , sixty miles to the eastward of Moreton Bay , Queensland , Australia .

" Action of Ethylene Chlorhydrin upon the Bases of the Pyridine Series and on Quinoline .
" By Professor Adolph Wuetz , For .
Mem. R.S. Received March 17 , 1882 .
According to the constitution which is generally attributed to the bases of the pyridine series , they must be considered as tertiary bases , their nitrogen being united to the carbon by three atomicities .
The action which alcoholic iodides exert upon these bases , as shown by Hofmann , confirms this idea , which is equally applicable to quinoline .
I thought that the reaction of glycol chlorhydrin and similar compounds upon the pyridine bases and upon quinoline should produce oxygenated quaternary bases .
It is known , in fact , that such a base , neurine , results from the action of ethylene chlorhydrin upon trimethylamine .
The beautiful results which Ladenburg obtained recently by the reaction of chlorhydrin upon secondary bases are well known .
He is still continuing these researches to the great profit of science .
I myself , entering again on a line of researches which I had formally traced , will , describe the results obtained by investigations undertaken in the direction indicated , with the pyridine bases and quinoline .
I had two specimens .

The experiments have proved that these two collidines are isomeric .
Action of Ethylene Chlorhydrin upon Aldehydine .
A mixture of these two compounds , in proportion of their molecular weights , to which a quantity of water weighing as much as the aldehydine employed was added , was heated during several days m closed tubes to 100 ' C. The oily layer which floated on the mixture at e n a______ornl firmllxr rnsnrmfmrrea end of the operation , continually decreased and finally disappeared after cooling .
The aqueous liquid , which was slightly brown was extracted with ether , and finally evaporated m the vacuum .
The ether had dissolved a small quantity of unattacked aldehydine and chlorhydrin .

The Specimen III , after having been heated to 100 ' during some time , contains 28'2 per cent , of platinum .
This alteration , which is more marked in the case of the chloroplatinate of oxethyl-collidine , will be examined later on , The results of these analyses lead to the formula ( C10H16NOCl)2PtCl4 , which is that of a chloroplatinate of oxethyl-aldehydme [ c8HuN\lt ; g , C\#187 ; H ' ] PtCl , .

[ Mar. 30 , This chloroplatinate forms magnificent orange-red crystals of clinorhombic aspect .
It is quite soluble in hot water , and the concentrated boiling solution , when it cools , becomes cloudy , by depositing oily drops which finally transform themselves into crystals .
Decomposed in aqueous solutions by sulphuretted hydrogen , it furnishes a chloride whose solution is colourless , and does not crystallise after being evaporated during several days in the vacuum .
Decomposed by oxide of silver and water it furnishes a caustic soluble base , which attracts the carbonic acid of the air .
These reactions permit no doubt as the character of the new base , which is a sort of aldehydine neurine .
Action of the Ethylene Ghlorhydrin upon , In order to obtain the a-collidine quaternary base corresponding to neurine the method just indicated was employed .
The reaction is , however , more rapid than in the previous case ; and after heating for a few hours the oily layer disappears , excepting a few black drops which still float on the liquid .
The liquid on being extracted with ether , evaporated in the vacuum , and finally treated by platinum chloride , furnishes a crystalline orange-yellow precipitate less soluble in water , and much less stable than the preceding one .

The mixture was cooled and extracted with ether , and the aqueous solution , slightly coloured brown , was concentrated .
After a few days , the solution contained a great amount of brown crystals , which were strongly pressed between layers of paper , and finally dissolved in absolute alcohol .
The solution was treated with animal charcoal , filtered boiling , and , after cooling , anhydrous ether was added , so as to float on the alcoholic layer .
The next day the alcoholic solution was filled with magnificent colourless prisms , some of which traversed the entire vessel .

Its aqueous solution is not precipitated by ammonia , and gives with potassa a thick , coloured precipitate .
Boiled for several seconds with oxide of silver , the solution forms chloride of silver and reduced silver , and the filtered liquid possesses a very strong alkaline reaction , and rapidly assumes a crimson tint .
The hydrate of plumbic oxide decomposes this chloride in a similar manner .
Corrosive sublimate forms with it a compound which crystallises easily .
Chloride of gold produces , in the solution of this chloride , a yellow precipitate , soluble in boiling water , from which it crystallises on cooling in small crystals , which appear under the microscope as pointed lozenges .

The others had been dissolved in boiling water , and were thereby slightly altered , as the excess of platinum proves .
When quinoline is heated with an equivalent quantity of ethylene chlorhydrine without adding water , a dark purple-reddish mass is obtained .
Extracted with ether , dried and treated with absolute alcohol , this mass gives a dark violet solution , which , if ether is poured on it , deposits an almost black mass , which finally crystallises .
The crystals , pressed between sheets of paper , are sensibly less coloured than the mother-liquor , which imparts to the paper a dark violet colour .
I have not yet concluded the analysis of this product , and I propose to continue these researches in various directions .

" On the Movement of Gas in ' Vacuum Discharges .
' " By William Spottiswoode , P.R.S. , and J. Fletcher Moulton , F.R.S. Received March 25 , 1882 .
In the preparation of tubes for our experiments it was often noticed that , after the exhaustion had been carried to a certain degree , the passage of a strong current had the effect of increasing the pressuie .
This appeared to be due to an expulsion of gas from the terminals themselves by the passage of the discharge .
And accordingly the use of such currents from time to time during the process of exhaustion was adopted for making the vacuum more perfect and more permanent than otherwise would have been the case .
On the other hand , it was also noticed , that after the tube had been taken off the pump and sealed in the usual way , the passage of a strong current had in some instances the effect of decreasing the pressure .
We thus met with two effects , apparently due to the same cause , but diametrically opposite in character .
The fact of the tube being on the pump or off it did not appear to be at all material to the question , because the first effect could be obtained when the tube was temporarily shut off by a stopcock .
Nor indeed did either the first or the second effect depend upon the aosolute
