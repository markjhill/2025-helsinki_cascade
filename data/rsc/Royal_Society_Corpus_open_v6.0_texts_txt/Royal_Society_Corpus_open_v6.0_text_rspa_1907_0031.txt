For such glasses , then , the dispersion of doublerefraction appears roughly proportional to the stress-optical coefficient .

The experiments have also revealed that in one glass , for which the relation of stress to molar strain departed sensibly from linearity , the optical effect was proportional to the stress\#151 ; that is to the molecular strain\#151 ; and not to the molar strain ; a result in accordance with what one might expect from the phenomena of double-refraction in viscous fluids in motion .

) ( Abstract .
) The present work forms a continuation of an enquiry begun by Mr. C. Cuthbertson* on the refractive indices of the vapours of elements not gaseous at ordinary temperatures .
The refractometer of Jamin was again employed , but tubes of fused silica were now used and other improvements introduced .
The following table exhibits the results obtained :\#151 ; Element .

203 Dispersion .
Except in the case of potassium , the dispersion is probably normal in direction in every case , and the apparent exceptions shown in the table are to be ascribed to errors of observation .
Refraction and Refraction Equivalents .
The gaseous refractivities of zinc , cadmium , and tellurium are higher than the highest ( viz. , that of iodine ) of which we had previous knowledge .
The gaseous refractivities are compared with the refraction equivalents of Gladstone and others in the following table :\#151 ; Refraction equivalents .

The results are very curious .
Gladstone 's refraction equivalent for arsenic is about 12 times that for hydrogen , while the gaseous refractivity is 11 times that of hydrogen .
But the values of Gladstone for zinc and cadmium are just half those now obtained .
Haagen , however , has a value for zinc which corresponds fairly well with the refractivity .
Finally , Gladstone 's value of selenium is about double that shown by the refractivity .
Relative Refractivities of the Elements .
The values now obtained confirm previous observations of the periodicity of this function and its connection with the atomic weight .
They also strengthen the belief in an intimate connection with the valency .
