VIII .
An Account of an extraordinary Effect of Lightning in communicating Magnetism .
Communicated by Pierce Dod , M. D. F. R. S. from Dr. Cookson of Wakefield in Yorkshire .
A Tradesman in this Place having put up a great Number of Knives and Forks in a large Box , some in Cases or Sheaths , and others not , of different Sizes , and of different Persons making , in order to be sent beyond Sea ; and having placed the Box in the Corner of a large Room , there happened a sudden Storm of Thunder , Lightning , &amp;c. by which the Corner of the Room was damaged , the Box split , and a good many Knives and Forks melted , the Sheaths being untouched .
The Owner emptying the Box upon a Counter where some Nails lay , the Persons who took up the Knives , that lay upon the Nails , observed that the Knives took up the Nails , Upon this the whole Numbers was tried , and sound to do the same , nay , to such a degree as to take up large Nails , Packing-Needles , and other Iron Things of considerable Weight .
Needles or other Things placed upon a Pewter-Dish , would follow the Knife or Fork , though held under the Dish , and would move along as the Knife or Fork was moved ; with several other odd Appearances , which I wo n't now trouble you with , only this , that though you heat the Knives red-hot , yet their Power is still the same when cold .
2 You may be assured of the Truth of this , having myself made a good many Trials of the Knives and the Forks : How they came by this magnetic Power , or how Lightning should be capable of communicating such a Power , is the Quaere .
