A paper was read , entitled " Researches in Physical Astronomy.* ' By J. W .
Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society .
The author extends , in the present paper , the equations he has already given for determining the planetary inequalities , as far as the terms depending on the squares and products of the eccentricities , to the terms depending on the cubes of the eccentricities and quantities of that order , which he does by means of a table , similar to the one given in his lunar theory\ and applies them particularly to the determination of the great inequality of Jupiter , or at least such partof it as depends on the first power of the disturbing force .
That part which depends on the square of the disturbing force may , he thinks , be most easily calculated by the methods given in his lunar theory .
He recommends it as particularly convenient to designate the arguments of the planetary disturbances by indices .
The bulk of the paper is oc ?
cupied by the tables , and by examples demonstrating their use .
