The arrangement can be used for quite a number of purposes , and it is proposed to publish later the results of experiments in the reproduction of photographs , etc. For the present , in this preliminary paper , it is merely desired to point out that a new means is now available , by which , within a small compass , an almost unlimited number of separately controllable luminous areas can be obtained ; that such areas , or points , can have their luminosity graded , by means of the applied voltage ; that such luminosity can be established , or extinguished , at least some hundreds of times per second ; and that , since all the luminous points are automatically in parallel , being all connected to the negative pole ( the electrolyte ) , only one contact is needed for each alloy unit .
The Axial Chromatic Aberration of the Human Eye .

( Communicated by Sir J. Larmor , F.R.S. Received May 16 , \#151 ; Read May 28 , 1914 .
) A bright object viewed directly by a normal human eye shows no* perceptible coloured fringes .
From this it has been assumed by some that the eye is fairly well corrected chromatically , at least for the most luminous constituents of white light .
On the other hand , if the same object be viewed through a filter transmitting only the extreme red and blue , it will appear with either a red or blue fringe , showing that for these extreme rays the eye is not corrected .
Helmholtz* passed monochromatic light through a small hole and found that when red light was used , the hole appeared in best focus when viewed from a distance of about 8 feet .
With blue illumination it appeared brightest at about 1| feet , and with extreme violet but a few inches ( nur einige Zolle ) .
With these rough determinations of Helmholtz the question appears to have rested .
With the aid of very simple apparatus it was found possible to obtain rather precise determinations of axial focal length .
The test object used was the * ' Physiolog .

At a fixed distance ( about 20 cm .

Three eyes were tested at accommodations of 25 cm .

The object serving to fix the accommodation was so chosen that the slit image appeared against a dark background such as a distant tree trunk or a black printed letter , so that a barely perceptible amount of white light was mixed with that of the coloured slit image .
In making determinations at wave- ^=f=^ ^ lengths 406 and 436 a mercury arc was used as source , at other wave-lengths a Nernst lamp .
A shift of the lens 1 cm .
corresponded to 0*01 mm. shift in focal point at the retina , the relation between the two being roughly linear .
The uncertainty on a group of five settings was not over 2 mm. ; results could be reproduced at different times to about 5 mm. on the scale .

are given as relative focal differences , \amp ; v/ v. From these , approximate distances in millimetres of focal points from the retina may be obtained by multiplying by 15 . .
All the eyes tested show more or less correction .
For comparison , the axial error of an eye of pure water is given at the top of the figure .
In the most luminous part of the spectrum , from 520 to 660 , all eyes show less variation in focal length than an equivalent eye of pure water would have .
In some eyes the correction in the central region would compare favourably with that of a good photographic or telescopic objective .
On Anomalous Trichromatic Colour Vision .
443 Several types of correction are shown that are new to lens optics .
The high order central corrections of L. A. J. and P. G. N. are accompanied by decreased violet but normal red correction .
L. E. J. shows no correction except in the extreme red and violet , where the correction is normal .
M. B. H. is slightly corrected except in the extreme regions .
C. H. B. is fairly well corrected over a wide region from 480 to 780 .
Tests were made for residual chromatic spherical aberration ( departure from Gauss condition ) by placing half of a half-tone screen over the test slit .
The writer could detect no residual in his own eye in the region from 500 to 650 .
Beyond 700 in the red and beyond 480 in the blue it is noticeable , while at 406 in the violet it amounted to fully 20 times the normal diffusion .
L. A. J. agreed with the writer but L. E. J. could detect little loss of definition at 406 .
I wish to record my indebtedness to Mr. Eastman and Dr. Mees for apparatus and to those of my assistants who served as subjects .
On Anomalous Trichromatic Colour Vision .
By W. Watson , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. ( Received May 16 , \#151 ; Read May 28 , 1914 .
) Having occasion to examine a large number of persons who have abnormal colour vision , the author has found that the so-called anomalous trichromates are clearly divisible into two groups , which groups can be sharply differentiated by quite simple experimental means .
By anomalous trichromate is meant a person who , while not a dichromate , i.e. , a person who can match all colours of the spectrum by a mixture of two suitably chosen monochromatic lights , has not got normal colour vision .
Such cases were first investigated by Lord Rayleigh , and have since been investigated by many observers .
It has already been noticed by several investigators that there are two classes of anomalous trichromates .
These are distinguished by the fact that when a monochromatic orange ( D-light ) is matched by a mixture of green and red light one class , the protanopes , take more red in the mixture than the normal , while the other class , the deuteranopes , take more green than the normal .
The following paper is intended to prove that both of these classes require to be subdivided , or rather that anomalous trichromates ought preferably to be divided into two other classes , and then each of these classes subdivided into protanopes and deuteranopes .
