" On the Estimation of Ammonia in Atmospheric Air .
" By HORACE T. BROWN , Esq. Communicated by Dr. FRANKLAND .
Received February 19 , 1870 .
In the attempts that have been hitherto made to estimate the ammonia present in atmospheric air , the results arrived at by the various experimenters have differed so widely that it is still a matter of uncertainty what the quantity really is .
That it is a very small amount all agree , but the extreme results on record vary as much as from 13'5 to '01 part of carbonate of ammonium per 100,000 of air .
It may therefore not be without interest to give an account of a simple method affording very concordant and , I believe , accurate results , at the same time being easy of performance and requiring but little time for an experiment .
The apparatus used consists of two glass tubes , each of about 1 metre [ Mar. 17 , 286 in length and 12 millims. bore .
These are connected air-tight by means of a smaller glass tube , and inclined at an angle of 5 ?
or 6 ?
with the horizon .
Into each of the larger tubes are introduced 100 cub. centims. of a mixture of perfectly pure water and two drops of dilute sulphuric acid ( sp. gr. 1 18 ) .
Through this acidulated water a measured quantity of the air under examination is slowly drawn , in small bubbles , by means of an aspirator .
No porous substance must be used to filter the air , for reasons to be stated hereafter .
The air is conducted into the absorption liquid through a small piece of quill tubing drawn out to a small aperture at the end immersed .
This tube must be kept quite dry throughout the experiment .
Great care must be taken to cleanse perfectly every part of the apparatus with water free from ammonia , and the caoutchouc plugs , or corks , used must be boiled for a short time in a dilute solution of caustic soda .
The stream of air is so regulated as to allow about 1 litre to pass through the apparatus in an hour .
By directing the point of the delivery-tube laterally , each bubble has imparted to it on rising an oscillatory movement which facilitates complete absorption of the ammonia .
When from 10 to 20 litres of air have passed , the liquid is emptied from the tubes into upright glass cylinders , an excess of a perfectly pure solution of potash added , and then 3 cub. centims. of a Nessler solution .
The standard of comparison is made in the ordinary way , only using acidulated in place of pure water , and neutralizing with potash after adding the standard solution of ammonium salt .
-Beyond somewhat retarding the point of maximum coloration , a little potassium sulphate does not interfere with the delicacy of Nessler 's reaction .
If the experiment has been conducted with proper care , at least 4 of the total ammonia ought to be found in the first tube .
Four or five litres of air are generally quite sufficient to give a decided reaction , but it is better to use not less than 10 litres , as before mentioned* .
Very many experiments have been made by this method , both on air from the town of Burton-on-Trent , and that of the adjoining country .
The air from the town , as might be expected , varies somewhat in composition ; much more so than that taken from the open country , as may be seen from the following Tables , in which are given some of the numerous results obtained .
The ammonia is calculated in every case as carbonate ( ( NH4)2 C03 ) for although nitric acid is sometimes found in air , yet its presence must be looked upon as accidental .
'X When the air to be examined is highly charged with ammonia , as that from stables &amp;c. , a perfectly dry bottle of 3 or 4 litres capacity should be carefully filled with a pair of bellows , 100 cub. centims. of acidulated water introduced , and , after closing securely , the whole well agitated at intervals for three or four hours .
The liquid is then poured out , and the NIT3 estimated by the Nessler solution as usual .

5904 The direction of the wind does not seem to have any influence on the ammonia found ; immediately after heavy rain , however , the quantity falls somewhat below the average , but the air is again restored to its normal condition after a lapse of two or three hours .
Attempts were made to make the method more delicate still by absorbing the ammonia in pure water and then distilling , but the nitrogenous organic matter suspended in the air was found to interfere with the results .
When the air is passed through cotton-wool before entering the absorption-tubes , it is found to be entirely deprived of its ammonia by the filter .
This is also the case with air artificially charged with ammonia to a large extent .
This absorption is not due to the presence of hygroscopic moisture , since cotton-wool , when absolutely dry , is capable of taking up 115 times its own bulk of dry ammonia ( confined over mercury ) at 10 ?

, the gas being again slowly evolved when the wool is left in contact with the air at 100 ?
C. All other porous substances that were tried for filtering agents were found to possess this property more or less ; even freshly ignited pumicestone is not entirely without absorptive effect upon the gas .
