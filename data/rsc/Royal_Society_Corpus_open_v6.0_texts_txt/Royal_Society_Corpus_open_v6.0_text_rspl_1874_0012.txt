108 Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the [ Dec. 10 , I have endeavoured to prove in the foregoing pages the following main facts :\#151 ; 1 .
That the iodide of silver exists in three allotropic forms , viz. ( a ) , at temperatures between 116 ' C. and its fusing-point , as a plastic , tenacious , amorphous substance possessing a reddish colour and transparent to light ; ( / 3 ) , at temperatures below 116 ' C. , as a brittle , opaque , greenish-grey , crystalline mass ; and ( y ) , if fused and poured into cold water , as an amorphous , very brittle , yellow , opaque substance .
2 .
That the iodide possesses a point of maximum density at or about 116 ' C. at the moment before passing from the amorphous into the crystalline condition .
3 .
That if we allow a mass of molten iodide to cool , the following effects may be observed:\#151 ; ( a ) at the moment of solidification a very considerable contraction takes place ; the solid , on further cooling , undergoes slight and regular contraction after the manner of solid bodies in general , until ( y ) at or about 116 ' C. it undergoes sudden and violent expansion , passing from the amorphous into the crystalline condition ; ( B ) after undergoing this expansion the mass on further cooling undergoes slight expansion , and ( e ) the coefficient of contraction diminishes as the temperature decreases ( or otherwise expressed , the coefficient of contraction augments with the temperature ) .
I must , in conclusion , express my great indebtedness to Dr. Guthrie for allowing me to carry out many of the foregoing experiments in the Physical Laboratory at South Kensington .

" On the Coefficient of Expansion of a Paraffine of high boiling-point/ ' By G. F. Rodwell , F.R.A.S. , F.C.S. , Science Master in Marlborough College .
Communicated by Prof. Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received November 17 , 1874 .
In the search for a liquid of high boiling-point which could be used for the exact determination of the coefficient of expansion of iodide of silver , and which at the same time should be free from certain objections which apply to the employment of mercury for this purpose , a paraffine of high boiling-point naturally suggested itself .
Mr. " W. H. Hatcher , to whom X express my acknowledgments , procured for me a specimen of paraffine which was taken from one of the stills at Messrs. Price 's works at a high temperature .
" With it the following experiments were made .
The paraffine in question is perfectly white and pearly , and in thin layers translucent j it fuses to a colourless ^liquid , which slightly darkens when heated for some time to a temperature exceeding 600 ' F. ( 315'*55 C. ) .
Its specific gravity at 32 ' F. ( 0 ' O. ) is '921 .
It is hard and somewhat granular when broken , and at a low temperature may be crudely pulverized by a blow .
At temperatures exceeding 100 ' F. 874 .

17''75 C. ) it begins to soften slightly , and gradually becomes softer as ie temperature rises , until just before reaching the fusing-point , 142 ' F. 81'* 11 C. ) , it is quite plastic , and may be moulded by pressure , or spread ut into thin coherent sheets .
It thus resembles some metals which are rittle at the ordinary temperature , but become more and more malleable s the temperature rises .
As the temperature rises , the paraffine becomes aore and more translucent ; and , like sealing-wax and some other bodies , j becomes what we may call either semifluid or semisolid before it nally fuses to a colourless perfectly transparent fluid .
As the tempera-are approaches 400 ' F. ( 205'*5 C. ) , the liquid begins to give off fumes ; it flashes " ( that is to say , the vapour ignites on the application of flame , ut does not continue to burn ) at 458 ' F. ( 236'*65 G. ) ; and the vapour unites spontaneously without the presence of flame and continues to burn 4 576 ' F. ( 302''75 C. ) .
Finally the boiling-point is above the melting-)oint of lead and the boiling-point of mercury , but below the melting-joint of zinc ( apparently not much below it ) , presumably about 750 ' F. 398'*8 C. ) .
Air-thermometer determinations of the boiling-point were lot satisfactory .
As the liquid cools from the boiling-point the contrac-ion is seen to be enormous .
The comparatively small quantity of liquid jaraffine ( about 15 grammes ) capable of being contained in a tube 15 jentimetres ( nearly 6 inches ) long by 15 millimetres ( nearly S inch ) liameter can be seen to sink two or three centimetres in less than 10 minutes .
The subsidence continues until the point of solidification is ittained , when the mass commences to solidify at the bottom , and proceeds gradually up the sides of the tube , leaving a central core of perfectly luid matter which does not solidify for some length of time .
The mass parts with its heat very slowly .
When perfectly and uniformly cooled down to the ordinary temperature , a hollow central core is found in the mass of paraffine , extending nearly to the bottom , and gradually narrowing as it descends .
The contraction which takes place in passing from fche liquid to the solid condition is very considerable .
The expansion which paraffine undergoes when heated appeared to be so unusnally great , that the following experiments were made in order to determine its amount .
They may be divided into three parts , viz. experiments to determine:\#151 ; ( a ) the coefficient of expansion of the solid for temperatures between 32 ' F. ( 0 ' C. ) and the point of fusion , 142 ' F. ( 61' 'll C. ) ; ( ( 3)the precise change of volume which ensues when the solid at 142 ' F. passes into the liquid at 142 ' F. ; and ( y ) the coefficient of expansion of the liquid between its point of maximum density ( 142 ' F. ) and its boiling-point ( presumably about 750 ' F. , 398'-8 C. ) .
In these determinations the greatest obstacle to be contended against was the slight conductivity of the paraffine , which made it very difficult to evenly heat either a solid or liquid mass .
The only way of doing this was to keep the mass for a length of time at the precise temperature required ; and this it is almost impossible to do when the temperature of von .

K 110 Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the [ Dec. lb , the liquid mass is above the point at which the vapour ignites spontaneously .
It is also difficult to manipulate with a liquid which is above the boiling-point of mercury , and is at the same time giving off clouds of spontaneously inflammable vapour .
The slight conductivity of the solid is shown by the following results .
The bulb of a thermometer was imbedded in a mass of paraffine in such a manner that the distance between the outer surface of the paraffine and the surface of the bulb was 8 millims. ( about inch ) .
It was immersed in water , and kept in a fixed position about 3 centimetres above the bottom of the beaker , and on a level with a thermometer-bulb in direct contact with the water .
The beaker was gently heated on a sand-bath , and the thermometers were observed for nearly an hour at intervals of two minutes .
At starting , 11.20 a.m. , the temperature of the water was 52 ' F. ( 11'*11 C. ) .

] Coefficient of Expansion of a Paraffine .
Ill 3ut when the thermometer immersed in the water read 141 ' F. , but it rose to 148 ' F. ( six degrees above the point of fusion of the paraffine ) , and a very small amount of paraffine at the surface melted ; hence , with the exterior surface actually fusing at 148 ' F. , it will be seen that the imbedded thermometer , separated from the fused surface by only 8 millims. of paraffine , read 48 ' F. lower .
Further , it will be noticed that the temperature of the water rose steadily to 148 ' F. and then sank at the rate of about one degree in a minute , while the paraffine acquired heat increasingly till the water ceased to be heated , then less quickly , until when the paraffine had acquired a temperature of 130 ' F. the temperatures coincide , half an hour after the commencement of heating .
Then the temperature of the paraffine begins to fall gradually , and less quickly than that of the water , until at 90'*5 F. there is once again coincidence , one hour and twenty-seven minutes , from the commencement of heating .
After this the temperatures read alike , and the thermometers continue to fall pari passu .
In the column of differences , minus differences signify that the temperatures of the paraffine-thermometer were below those of the water-thermometer , plus differences that the former were above those of the latter . .
It will be noticed that the two-minute observations cease at 12.10 p.m. , and that the last four are made at intervals of 12 , 25 , 19 , and 68 minutes .
In regard to the fluid paraffine , a mass of from 20 to 30 grammes takes two or three hours to cool down from just below its fusing-point to the temperature of the air\#151 ; that is , to cool through about 80 ' F. The bulb of a thermometer was surrounded by 8 millimetres of liquid paraffine at 150 ' F. , and was plunged in a bath kept at 245 ' F. ; at the end of half an hour the mass of about 30 grammes had barely acquired the temperature of the bath .
In heating a vessel of paraffine there is always a marked difference between the temperatures of the upper and lower levels .
The convection-currents part with their heat so slowly that a uniform temperature throughout the mass seems to be altogether unattainable without constant and complete agitation .
During the heating of about half a litre of the liquid paraffine in a cylindrical copper vessel 75 millimetres ( about 3 inches ) diameter by 150 millimetres high , the following results were obtainedThe upper thermometer was placed with its bulb a centimetre from the surface , the lower thermometer with its bulb a centimetre from the bottom .
The fluid mass was directly heated by a Bunsen burner from below .
In the column of differences , minus differences signify that the temperature of the lower thermometer is below that of the upper thermometer , and plus differences that t e temperatures of the former are above those of the latter .
The gas was turned out at 6 p.m. , the highest temperature being attained by the ower thermometer ( 361 ' F. ) at 6.1 p.m. , while the highest temperature attained by the upper thermometer was 354 ' F. at the same time .

Determination of the coefficient of expansion of solid paraffine between 32 ' F. ( 0 ' C. ) and the fusing-point , 142 ' F. ( 61T1 C. ) .
The above examples show us the extreme difficulty of obtaining uniformity of temperature in either a solid or liquid mass of paraffine , an\#174 ; help to explain various incongruities which presented themselves in the course of the following determinations .
The coefficient of expansion of the solid was determined by weighing a piece of compact paraffine in water at different temperatures , the expansion of water ( as determined by M. Despretz to seven places of decimals ) being of course well known .

] Coefficient of Expansion of a Paraffine .
Ivving to the great contraction which takes place when a mass of liquid \gt ; araffine solidifies , it was found to be somewhat difficult to obtain a solid uass free from minute cavities and of uniform texture .
The plan iventually adopted was to take a long column of melted paraffine and to sool the lower extremity of it .
The supernatant fluid forced its way into ; he central cavity produced by the contraction of the solidifying mass , and she result was a mass of paraffine apparently quite compact and free from cavities .
It was suspended from the balance by horsehair , and weighted by a piece of brass , the weight of which in air and water at Afferent temperatures was known ; and the whole was finally weighed in listilled water which had been well boiled and cooled in a good vacuum .
Alter the immersion of the paraffine the whole was again placed in a good vacuum .
The mass was heated and weighed in water at various temperatures , between 32 ' F. ( 0 ' C. ) and 142 ' F. ( 61'*11 C. ) ; the melting-point and the cubical expansion was found to be as follows , for one degree Fahrenheit:\#151 ; Between 32 ' F. and 60 ' F. ( 15'*55 C. ) ... .

Determination of the amount of expansion which paraffine undergoes when it passes from the solid condition at 142 ' F. to the liquid condition at the same temperature .
Tubes of known weight and capacity were exactly filled with melted paraffine at 142 ' .
They were then allowed to cool ; the cavity produced by contraction was accurately filled with mercury , which was weighed and the capacity of the cavity deduced therefrom .
The results were concordant and satisfactory .
Thus it was found that volume=100 at 60 ' F. becomes , in the fluid condition , at 142 ' F.:\#151 ; Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the [ Dec. 10 , I. U. Ill IY .

Determination of the coefficient of expansion of liquid paraffine between 142 ' F. and its boiling-point { presumably about 750 ' F. ) .
The paraffine was heated in tubes of known weight and capacity in a bath of paraffine , and the weight of paraffine which exuded between any observed range of temperature was determined .
Specific-gravity flasks with capillary stoppers were found to be unsuitable for the determinations , on account of the difficulty of uniformly heating the mass of liquid within them .
Many attempts were made to determine the increase of the coefficient with the temperature , but the results were not satisfactory ; hence I can only give the mean coefficient of expansion between the melting-point and the boiling-point .
The result of many experiments gave as the mean coefficient of expansion of the liquid .

" By Richard C. Shet^le , M.D. Communicated by Dr. Lockhart Clarke , F.R.S. Received October 20,1874 .
The magnetic condition of all matter has been well ascertained , and the fact that the same matter may exhibit different magnetic phenomena according to the medium in which it is placed is a point of considerable importance when testing for such results .
It is therefore absolutely essential that any experiments which have for their object the demonstration of paramagnetic force of low power should be tested in media of known strength* In the experiments I have now the honour of laying before the Royal Society , the relative condition which bodies bear to each other as regards their magnetic properties has been strictly observed .
The experiments consist in suspending between the poles of a powerful electromagnet arterial blood hermetically sealed in a glass tube in a medium of venous blood , and venous blood in the same tube , previously well emptied of its contents , in a medium of arterial blood , care being taken to avoid as far as possible any exposure of the blood to the atmosphere , thus preventing any alteration in its physical characteristics as regards the gases which it contains .
The necessary apparatus consists of some G-erman glass tubes in which the fluid to be tested is hermetically sealed , a thin glass vessel for holding the medium in which the testing-tube is suspended , two glass bottles for defibrinating the blood , two store glass bottles for receiving the blood after it has been defibrinated , oxygen gas , carbonic acid gas , very thin india rubber , and an electromagnet and battery of 15 Grove 's cells ; The testing-tube ( fig. 1 ) was made of very thin German glass , and the one used for these experiments was of the size and shape shown ; It was filled by means of the two short tubes on the upper surface , and when filled was carefully tied over with very thin india rubber ; it was suspended by silk in the ordinary way .
