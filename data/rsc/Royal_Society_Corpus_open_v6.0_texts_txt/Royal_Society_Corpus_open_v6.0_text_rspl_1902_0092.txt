At high frequency , obtained by resonance , Thwing gives 56'2 for the specific inductive capacity of glycerine at 15 ' C.* The specific inductive capacity of pure liquid glycerine at 8 ' C. was found to be about 60 , whether the frequency of experiment was of the order 2 million or lOO.f At a frequency of 120 the specific capacity of glycerine varies from about 60 to 4-6 , as the temperature is varied from - 50 ' to - 100 ' in platinum degrees.^ The present paper deals with the specific capacity of glycerine at temperatures varying from about + 10 ' to - 80 ' C. The methods of experiment and the apparatus are those described in connection with the earlier experiments . !
The platinum plates forming the electrodes of a condenser were placed in pure glycerine , supplied by Messrs. Hopkins and Williams , and after a preliminary experiment , made to find its conductivity ( see table ) , the glycerine was frozen by aid of carbonic acid snow .
The temperature of the glycerine was observed by aid of a platinum thermometer .
At - 48 ' C. the specific capacity at about 2 million periods per second is 3*97 .
At - 44 ' C , the specific capacity at about 100 periods per second is 54 , which is of the same order of magnitude as that given by Fleming and Dewar .
The conductivity of this condenser at - 59 ' C. , and with times of contact varying from 0*00002 to 0*009 second , was found and is shown by the curve No. 1 in the accompanying figure .
If K be the instantaneous capacity and C the electric resistance , then the total capacity of the condenser at time t is Now the capacity of this condenser at - 48 ' C. at about 2 million periods per second is 0'00032 micro-farad , and the value of ; *0-009 1 l I \#151 ; ^ f , as given by the curve , will only account for -J 0*00002 ^ ^oo 0*00018 micro farad .
Assuming that it will be the residual charge which comes out in one-sixth of the period which produces the effect on the capacity , a large proportion of the residual charge comes out between the times TV x 10_tJ and 20 x 10~ ' second .
If the refractive index of the glycerine when frozen is taken to be 1*47 for short times , then Maxwell 's law would indicate a specific capacity of 2*17 ; and * ' Zeitschrift fur Pliysikalische Chemie , ' vol. 14 , p. 293 .

[ Jan. 7 , 3*97 was observed at 2 million periods per second .
It is possible , therefore , that some residual charge has already come out at 2 million periods per second .
When the glycerine was warmed up to atmospheric temperature 10 ' C , , it still remained solid , and its dielectric properties were examined at this temperature .
The resistance of the condenser was 216000 ohms , whether the time of contact was 0'00002 or 0*011 second , and this is about times the resistance at 10 ' C. when the glycerine was in the liquid state .
No residual charge comes out between the above times .
At 2 million periods per second the specific capacity of this solid glycerine at 10 ' C. is 6*67 .
By the method described previously* the specific capacity is 16 at 50 periods per second .
The specific capacity in the liquid and solid states at 10 ' O. varies approximately as the conductivity for long times .
The residual charge comes out at times less than 0*00002 second , whether the glycerine be liquid or solid at 10 ' C. Finally , the eondenser was frozen in carbonic acid snow in ether , and the conductivity at - 81 ' C. is shown by the curve No. 2 in the figure .
The final conductivity is less , and the area is less than given by the curve No. 1 .
This difference is due to the lower temperature for curve No. 2 .
Fleming and Dewar have shown that the specific capacity of glycerine for long times changes very rapidly with its temperature between \#151 ; 50 ' and \#151 ; 100 ' Pt " , The specific capacity at \#151 ; 81 ' C. was found to be 3*8 at 2 million periods per second .
During the freezing processes above referred to the conductivity of the glycerine was observed at different temperatures .
The results are given in the accompanying table .
It is noteworthy that for time 0*00002 second * Hopkinson and Wilson , 'Phil .

243 the conductivity falls and then rises , as the temperature is varied from +13 ' to - 59 ' C. when freezing from the liquid to the solid state .
An analogous effect has been observed in soda-lime glass.* When the time of contact is 0*006 second , all the points in the table lie well on the same curve between \#151 ; 26 and \#151 ; ,81 .
