A Letterfrom LewisWeston Dillwyn , Esq. , addressed to Sir Humphry Davy , Bart. P.R.S. Read March 25,1824 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1824 , p. 413 .
] This letter is supplementary to the former one , and contains further observations on the relative periods at which the different families of testaceous animals appear to have been created , and on the gradual approximation , which may be observed in British strata , from the fossil remains of the oldest formations to the living inhabitants of our present land and waters .
The author observes , that the dimyairia of the strata between the transition lime and lias have the ligament external , and that internal ligaments were therefore confined to the monomyairia till after the deposition of the lias .
In the beds above the lias all the shells are referrible to existing orders of animals , and it is only in the tertiary beds that any of the cirrhipeda or families of naked mollusca have been found .
What is generally considered as the beak of a sepia , Mr. Dillwyn refers to the cephalopode animal of an ammonite .
Every shell of the tertiary strata , the author observes , may be referred to some existing genus ; but though this approximation has thus far proceeded in the London clay , yet its numerous species are now extinct , and it is only in the upper beds of crag that any fossil can be completely identified with a living species .
