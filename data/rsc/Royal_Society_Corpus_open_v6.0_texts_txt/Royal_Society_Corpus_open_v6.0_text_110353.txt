A paper was then read , entitled , " Notice of the Remains of the recent Volcano in the Mediterranean .
" By John Davy , M.D. F.R.S. Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals .
The author communicates an account given by Captain Swinburne , dated the 24th of August , of a dangerous shoal , in latitude 37ยง 9 ' N. and longitude 12ยง 43 ' E , consisting principally of black sand and stones , with a circular patch of rock , which has been left by the vol ?
cano that lately appeared in the Mediterranean .
Captain Swinburne furnished the author with two specimens of the air which was seen rising from the site of the volcano , in small silver threads of bubbles .
These were found , upon examination by chemical tests , to consist of between 9 and 10 parts of oxygenous to 79 or 80 of azotic gases .
The author adduces arguments in favour of the supposition that this air is disengaged from sea water at the bottom in contact with the loose and probably hot ashes and cinders composing the shoal , rather than that it arises from the extinct volcano .
He is also disposed to extend this theory to the explanation of the gases disengaged from hot springs , which are generally found to consist of a mixture of oxy ?
genous and azotic gases , the former being in less proportion than in atmospheric air , in consequence of its abstraction by oxidating processes from the air originally contained in these waters .
