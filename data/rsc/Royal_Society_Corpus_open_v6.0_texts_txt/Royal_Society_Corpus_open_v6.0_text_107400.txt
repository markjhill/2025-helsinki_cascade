On the Tusks of the Narwhale .
By Sir Everard Honme Bart. F. R. S. Read February 18 , 1813 ... E structure of many animals that inhabit the great Northern Ocean , is , even at this day , imperfectly known ; this arises from those who have the best opportunities of making such enquiries not being fitted for them , or being too much engaged in pursuits of a different nature .
Under such circumstances too much praise cannot be bestowed on the few individuals , whose zeal for science induces them to exert themselves in improving this branch of knowledge ; to one of these , Mr. ScoREsBY , jun .
I am indebted for the ieans of making the following brservations on the tusks of the nariwhale .
Mr.'SCOsESBY told me , a year ago , that the female narwhale had no tusks , which astonished me ; and the only reply I could make to such an assertion , was to beg that he would procure me a skull , that I might be satisfied of the fact .
This he promised to do , and last summer sent me the skull of a female , in which there was no appearance whatever of tusks ; and as the sutures were all united , there was every reason to believe the time of having teeth had elapsed , particularly as a male skull of the same size , and in which the sutures were not equally well united , had a tusk four feet long .
With such evidence before me , I was naturally led to adopt the generally received opinion of the captains in the Greenland fishery , that the males had one tusk , and the females none ; and as I imagined that I had cleared up a part of the natural history of this species of whale , which had hitherto been involved in obscurity , I proceeded to lay these observations before the Society .
After I had done so , I found so many contradictory accounts among my friends , that I became staggered what to believe : some had seen two tusks of different lengths in the same skull , others believed they had seen two of the same length .
To set the question at rest , my friend Mr. BROWN , Librarian to Sir JOSEPH BANKS , took the trouble of collecting all the books in Sir JosEPH 's library , in which the subject is mentioned .
In ANDERSON'S Description of Iceland , Greenland , and Davis 's Straits , it is mentioned that , in 1684 , DICK PETERSON brought to Hamburghl the skull of a female narwhale with two tusks , the left seven feet five inches , the right seven feet long , and that this skull had ever since been preserved there , and shown to the curious , This account is copied by several later authors .
I found also , in TYcHO L. TYCHIoNIUs , an account , published in 1706 , of a narwhale 's skull with the left tusk seven feet long , and the rigiht imbedded and completely concealed in the substance of the skull , nine Danish inches in length .
The author takes some merit , and in my opinion deservedly , for having discovered it .
A drawing of it in situ is annexed .
This information set me to work in sawing the skulls in the HUNTERIAN collection , to ascertain whether they contained rudiments of tusks not yet protruded from the substance of the bone , and the result of this investigation explains , n the most satisfactory manner , every thing that I have seen 127 written , or heard asserted upon this subject , and clears up any apparent difference between them .
In one male skull , in which the sutures were tolerably firmly united , the tusk in the left side is seven feet nine inches long ; a small tusk , nine inches long , is imbedded in the bone on the right side , with a bulb or swelling at its root , and the point six inches from the front of the skull , which is quite solid , and has no external orifice .
In another male skull , which must have belonged to a younger animal , since the sutures are not completely united , the left tusk is four feet long , and the right one , concealed within the skull , is nine inches and three quarters long , and its point seven and a quarter distant from the front of the skull .
In this specimen there is an external orifice leading down to the point of the youngr tusk , so that in this respect the small tusk is more advanced than in the older one , showing that there is a great variety in the time of the second tusk coming forward .
The young tusks have not the spiral turns upon them , but are ribbed on the surface , and the ridges have a tendency to the left side .
These are milk tusks , since they have come to their full growth , and are quite solid throughout their whole length , similar to the milk tusk of the elephant , which is however only two inches long before it is shed .
Upon sawing a full grown tusk in a longitudinal direction , I found that , contrary to what happens in the tusks of other animals , there is a hollow tube in the middle through the greater part of its length , the point , and the portion at the root , only being solid .
From these two specimens , there can be no doubt that the left tusk appears commonly long before the right one , which corresponds with the accounts given by the captains employed in the Greenland fishery .
One of these captains , who has been thirty-five voyages , informed me that he never saw a male narwhale with two tusks , except once from the mast head ; the animal was rising out of the water , the left tusk was about six feet above the surface , and the point of the right tusk just out of the water , so that it appeared to him one-third the length of the left .
In the skull of the female sent me by Mr. SCORESBY , the sutures are more united than in the smallest of the males which I have described ; there is no appearance wltat::ve ; r of tusks externally , but both on the right and left side there is an orifice in the bone , and when the skull was cut into , two small milk tusks were discovered of the same size and appearance , and exactly resembling those described in the male ; they were eight inches long , and the points were only two inches and a quarter from the front of the skull , lying in a canal , of which the external opening was the orifice , so that they were nearer getting into the gum than those of either of the males ; and there can be no doubt that the permanent tusks , which were to follow them , would be of equal lengths , or nearly so throughout their growth , as they were found to be in the skull at Hamburgh .
We learn also , from this specimen , that the tusks in the female come much later than in the male , which explains the error the captains of the Greenland ships have been led into , of the females having no tusks .
Female skulls , with full grown tusks , must be rarely met with , since the only well authenticated account upon record a of a skull with two tusks of equal lengthls , is that given by DICK PETERSON , These facts make it necessary to take from this species of whale the name given to it by LINN^US , of Monodon Monoceros , since they prove that it is a very improper one .
The greatest length which has been given to the left tusk , before the right has cut the gum , is fifteen feet : this account is mentioned by EGEDE in his Natural History of Greenland , 1741 The lower jaw , both in the male and female , has a rounded edge , in which there is no part from which teeth can grow .
