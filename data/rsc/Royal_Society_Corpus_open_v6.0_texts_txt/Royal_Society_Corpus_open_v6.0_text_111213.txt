" By Captain Henry Mangles Denham , R.N. , F.R.S. Communicated by RtearAdmiral Sir Francis Beaufort , K.C.B. , F.R.S. , Hydrographer .
Received January 20 , 1853 .
This sounding was obtained on a calm day , October 30 , 1852 , in the course of the passage of H.M. ship Herald , from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope .
The sounding-line was ^--th of an inch in diameter , laid inrto one length , and weighing , when dry , llb .
for every hundred fathoms .
Captain Denham received from Commodore 5IcKeever of the United States Navy , commanding the Congress Frigate , a present of 15,000 fathoms of this line , 10,000 fathoms on one reel , and 5000 on another ; and considers it to have been admirably adapted for the purpose for which it was made and to which it was applied .
The plumimet weighed 91bs .
, and was 11*5 inches in length , and 1-7 inch in diameter .
When 7706 fathoms had run off the reel the sea-bottom was reached .
Captain Denham states that Lieut. Hutcheson and himself , in separate boats , with their own hands , drew the plummet up 50 fathoms several times , and after it lad renewed its descent , it stopped , on each occasion , abruptly at the original mark to a fathom , and would not take another turn off the reel .
The velocity with which the line run out was as follows : hms The first 1000 fathoms in ... .
0 27 15 1000 to 2000 fathoms in. .
0 39 40 2000 to 3000 fathoms in ... .
0 48 10 3000 to 4000 fathoms in ... .
1 13 39 4000 to 5000 fathoms in ... .
1 27 06 5000 to 6000 fathoms in ... .
1 45 25 6000 to 7000 fathoms in. .
1 49 15 7000 to 7706 fathoms in ... .
1 14 15 9 24 45 The whole time therefore taken by the plummet in descending through 7706 fathoms , or nearly 7'7 geographical miles of 60 to the degree , was 911 24m 458 .
The highest summits of the Himalaya , Dhawalagiri and Kinchinginga , are little more than 28,000 feet , or 4-7 geographical miles above the sea .
T'he sea-bottom has therefore depths greatly exceeding the elevation of the highest pinnacle above its surface .
''he strength of the line tried before the sounding was found to be equal to bear 721bs .
in air .
The 7706 fathoms which ran out weighed , when dry , 771bs .
, exclusive of the plummet , 91bs .
Great care was taken in the endeavour to bring the plummet again to the surface to show the nature of the bottom , but , whilst carefully reeling in , the line broke at 140 fathoms below the water-line , carrying away a Six 's thermometer which had been bent on at 3000 fathoms .
A paper was also in part read , entitled " On the Eclipses of Agathocles , Thales and Xerxes .
