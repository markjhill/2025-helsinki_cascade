373 Factors in the Interpretation of the Inhibitive and Fixation Serum Reactions in Pulmonary Tuberculosis .
By Alfred H. Caulfeild , M.B. ( Communicated by Prof. T. G. Brodie , F.R.S. Received August 24 , \#151 ; Read November 2 , 1911 .
) ( From the Pathological Department of the National Sanatorium Association , Gravenhurst , Canada .
) Calmette and Massoll* have reported that immunisation of a calf with " bacillen-emulsion " has produced , not complement-fixation bodies , but an inhibitive effect which they designate as an " inhibiteur .
" Previous to this theyf had reported upon a serum , obtained by intravenous inoculation , which had an extremely active agglutinating property , and under certain conditions was capable of precipitating various solutions of tuberculin .
The reaction of fixation was not , however , obtained with either the serum or the serum precipitate .
Independently I had observed a somewhat analogous serum reaction ( inhibitive reaction ) in certain cases of pulmonary tuberculosis , and I first reported this at the meeting of the Canadian Medical Association , Toronto , June , 1910 , subsequently publishing more extended investigations !
along these lines .
These reactions have become an additional aid in the clinical estimation^ of the type of case .
Emeryll records an observation which he regards as similar in character to that of Calmette and Massol .
The variations in technique at present , however , prevent one from drawing any very close comparisons .
The complement negation phenomenon ( inhibitive reaction ) becomes more easily demonstrated if one employs a series of antigen dilutions which range , with salineH replacing the serum unit , from one producing a full * Calmette et Massol , " Sir un Nouvelle Reaction Masquant dans les S6rums la Presence d'Anticorps Tuberculeux , " 'Bull , de la Soc. de Biol. , ' 5 fev .

IT When the word saline is used , physiological saline solution is meant ( 0*85 NaCl in distilled water ) .
374 Mr. A. H. Caulfeild .
Inhibitive Fixation [ Aug. 24 , anti-complementary result to one which may be termed antigenic with the original restrictions of that term .
Since my earlier observations on the inhibitive reaction and the reaction of fixation , a number of factors have appeared that have necessitated changes in the technique , in order to obtain more correct interpretations of the end results .
While these factors have been mentioned to some extent in the literature upon complement-fixation tests , the importance of their influence has not been brought out .
The technique of the inhibitive reaction has been developed with an alcohol-ether extract of the tubercle bacillus , finally prepared as a 2-per-cent ; stock solution .
Four dilutions of this stock solution are used , the first of which is fully anti-complementary with saline , a 1/ 10 to 1/ 20 further dilution gives the antigenic strength , while the intermediate dilutions of 1/ 2 and 1/ 4 dilutions represent more or less anti-complementary strengths .
With these four dilutions , three main types of end results with pathologic 43era become evident .
1 .
Inhibitive Reaction.\#151 ; With these sera , according to their activity , partial to complete haemolysis results with the full anti-complementary strength of antigen .
Because of certain observations which will be presented I prefer to term this phenomenon the inhibitive reaction , and to assume , for facility of expression alone , that it is evidence of what may be called inhibitin .
In contrast to the conception that sensitisers* ( amboceptors ) show , in the presence of their specific antigens , complement attraction , inhibitin may be said to exert a complement negation effect .
2 .
Fixation Reaction.\#151 ; Sera with these effects ( sensitisers , amboceptors ) must cause deflection of complement with the antigenic as well as with all other dilutions .
3 .
Indifferent Reaction.\#151 ; The essential features here are complete haemolysis with the antigenic , and no haemolysis with the full anti-complementary dilution .
The varying results which were obtained with the intermediate dilutions and these sera first demonstrated the importance of two factors ( serum suspension and natural sheep-corpuscle amboceptor ) which should always be controlled .
When these are offset , many irregularities , especially noticeable with varying amounts of serum in the inhibitive reaction and the reaction of fixation , are explicable , while " doubtful reactions " also can to a great extent be eliminated .
From the prevalence of tuberculosis in adults , I have been forced to show the specificity of the inhibitive or fixation reactions by the use of other * The terms " amboceptor " and " sensitiser " have been used with the same meaning .
In referring to tuberculous fixation bodies , it has been convenient to use the word \#166 ; " sensitiser , " reserving the term " amboceptor " for other than tuberculous fixation bodies .
1911 .

375- antigens .
With antigens such as alcoholic extracts of normal and pathologic organs , specificity has been maintained .
Extracts of other micro-organisms have not as yet been tried .
From the relative specificity of a serum , obtained after tubercle immunisation , to different acid-fast cultures ( as shown by Gengou , Calmette , and others by different serological reactions ) , it is likely that comparative results would be obtained with the inhibitive and fixation tests between the serum of the tuberculous and other acid-fast bacteria .
The routine* for some time , as far as this part of the serological work is concerned , has been to determine the reactions of the serum in two strengths ( 03 c.c. and OT c.c. ) to the four dilutions of antigen , and subsequently to attempt to show the cause of the various irregularities which may have appeared .
For these purposes it is essential that the same samples of sera be used , and that the succeeding reactions be performed immediately , as marked variations have been shown sometimes to take place rapidly in stored sera .
To meet these requirements blood is usually drawn from 10 to 20 patients .
As a great number of patients have been followed for a considerable period , it is frequently possible to include a number of similarly reacting sera .
From these it is often possible to determine conditions connected with the irregularities .
The results of these observations and inferences drawn from them can be considered most conveniently under their various headings , ( 1 ) General Preparation.\#151 ; Despite the utmost care and similarity of procedure , I have found that every now and then any single tube may vary remarkably , even to 100 per cent , error , as can readily be proved by a repetition of the test .
Further , the results of an entire series have been thought doubtful because of the unsatisfactory condition of some of the controls which , with the usual technique , are not generally made .
Because of these inherent characteristics of the test it seems advisable to outline the general technique which has been adopted .
Glassicare.\#151 ; These articles are finally cleaned in saline solution , then rinsed in distilled water and allowed to drain and dry .
Test tubes , as similar in size as obtainable , are not dried on racks , but packed in wire baskets and inverted on clean filter paper .
All articles are sterilised for use .
( 2 ) System.\#151 ; Guinea-pig complement and anti-sheep-corpuscle rabbit hsemolysin have been used .
It has been the custom to re-standardise * For economy of materials , 0'5 c.c. units have been employed .
With this unit it has been convenient to designate in Arabic numerals the number of 0'05 c.c. quantities employed , which are in each instance completed to 0'5 c.c. with physiological saline solution .
By this means the insertion of a decimal point converts the protocol into comparison with 1 c.c. units .
This is the method that has been adopted in this report , so that actually but one-half the quantities reported have been used .
376 Mr. A. H. Caulfeild .
Inhibitive Fixation [ Aug. 24 , periodically the hsemolysin to pooled complement of two or more guinea-pigs .
Then twice the strength ( half the dilution ) producing complete hemolysis in this standardisation is used in the tests .
With this amount of hsernolysin , which it is convenient to designate as two units , complement is titrated before each protocol .
From these results twice the strength ( half the dilution ) of complement is used .
The sheep-corpuscle suspension of 1/ 20 is finally prepared by washing three times in 80 c.c. centrifuge tubes .
This amount of washing has seemed sufficient to prevent any interference by remaining traces of sheep serum .
( 3 ) Antigen.\#151 ; The inhibitive reaction has , so far , been tried only with an alcohol-ether extract of tubercle bacillus freshly cullured on glycerine broth .
It has been prepared as follows:\#151 ; After the tubercle mass obtained by filtering the glycerine broth cultures is thoroughly washed with saline solution and allowed to dry at room temperature , it is transferred to widemouthed 2-litre bottles .
The tubercle mass is then covered with a mixture of absolute alcohol ( Kahlbaum 's ) and ether sulph .
C.F. ( Kahlbaum 's ) in equal parts , the amount of solvent being 10 to 20 times the weight of tubercle mass .
The bottles are shaken frequently during the 5 to 10 days allowed for extraction .
Loss of the acid-fast character has in some of the preparations been complete , in others this has been but slight .
This has seemed to depend chiefly upon the age of the strain and the capacity for rapid growth .
The solution thus obtained has been evaporated at varying rates in vacuo over sulphuric acid , and also under a stream of C02 .
The yields of 100 c.c. , no matter how prepared , have been very close , being in the neighbourhood of 0-2 grm. The solid substance thus obtained is re-dissolved in the same solvent as a 2-per-cent , solution .
Both the original and stock solution are passed through double layers of hardened filter paper .
Very considerable differences have been found between the different antigens .
Those which have in general given the best results have been obtained from long cultured and rapidly growing strains .
It has seemed that an antigen , which in its antigenic dilution gives with suitable sera the most satisfactory complement fixation , is also the most suitable for the demonstration of the inhibitive reaction .
Differences in the various preparations have been shown to exist between the range of dilutions that are necessary , on the one hand to produce the full anti-complementary effect with saline , and on the other to act efficiently in antigenic dilutions with sera containing sensitisers ( amboceptors ) .
Work in sufficient detail has not been done to correlate completely these end results to the variations in preparation or use of the antigen .
Other things being equal , the more non1911 .

specific adsorption of complement by the antigen dilution , the more marked will be the amount of apparent complement fixation by suitable sera .
For the demonstration of both the inhibitive and fixation reactions considerably more than one unit of available complement should be present to show the specific action of the serum .
For use the stock solution is freshly diluted with saline .
This gives a cloudy emulsion .
The opacity of the different preparations has not always borne a proportionate relation to the anticomplementary effects .
Employing as already mentioned two units of both complement and hamrolysin the full anti-complementary effect with saline takes place in the neighbourhood of a 1/ 10 to 1/ 20 dilution .
With the determination of this point four dilutions* have been used in the following proportions , namely , 1 c.c. , 0-5 c.c. , 0*25 c.c. , and 0T\#151 ; 0'05 c.c. With these strengths , which I will call for convenience respectively the first , second , third , and fourth dilutions , the antigen and complement controls to any protocol should result about as follows :\#151 ; Table I.

Complement is standardised before each protocol , and an amount already defined as a two-unit strength employed .
The three controls ( Table I ) for this are added to each protocol to show the amount of fixative available at the time and under the conditions of the protocol .
Considerable variation may take place in a short space of time , so that this has been found advantageous for a satisfactory comparison of different protocols .
As each addition is brought to a full unit in all protocols , the effects of the saline dilution are closely related .
With alteration of the fixative strength of * Sachs and Rondoni-Florenz ( 'Zeits .

132 ) call attention to the fact that fractional dilution " often results in a very increased intensity of the reaction .
" This has in my hands produced marked changes in the antigen controls , and consequently , one may assume , may play a considerable rdle in the antigen serum tubes .
Particularly with the stronger dilutions fractionally made , one can observe that the upper part carries the greater part of the antigen .
378 Mr. A. H. Caulfeild .
Inhibitive Fixation [ Aug. 24 complement , a corresponding variation will occur in the end results of antigen saline controls .
Thus with increase more or less htetnolysis appears in the first tube ; with decrease lessened haemolysis in the second and possibly the third tube .
The fifth tube shows as accurately as possible the amount of complement non-specifically affected by the antigenic dilution .
Qualitatively the most efficient extract in the antigenic titre is the one which causes the greatest amount of fixation with sera containing sensitisers and , at the same time allows the greatest amount of haemolysis in the fifth tube ( Table I ) .
With the end results of Table I , more than one and less than two units of complement are available for the specific action of inhibitive and fixative sera with antigen .
( 4 ) Nomenclature Adopted in Beading the End \#151 ; The need of a comparatively accurate method of recording the end results has been felt by all who have worked with fixation tests , and consequently a number of methods have been devised by Madsen , Epstein , and others .
Cloewes photographs the end results ; this seems to be the most accurate , although the most time-consuming method .
The range of antigen and complement control as outlined in Table I gives one a standard for each protocol , which has seemed to aid in the use of the five expressions in terms of haemolysis:\#151 ; 1 .
None ( absolutely no haemolysis ) .
2 .
Almost none .
3 .
Some .
4 .
Almost complete .
5 .
Complete ( absolutely complete ) .
A further grading is allowed by the use o the signs + and \#151 ; , which , however , are probably of value only for the immediate comparison of a set of tubes in the same protocol .
( 5 ) Effect of Age upon Antigen.\#151 ; By thus controlling the antigen for each protocol it has become evident that with time the anti-complementary power increases in an irregular fashion .
Thus Extract IV , prepared for use on November 1 , began to show towards the end of December tendencies towards incomplete haemolysis in the third tube ( 0-25 c.c. ) .
By the end of January this alteration had progressed so far that with two units of complement no-haemolysis resulted in the first three tubes of antigen control .
This change has occurred with most preparations , so that the full efficiency of an antigen lasts in the neighbourhood of two months .
With this irregular onset of increased anti-complementary properties there is decreased efficiency for the exhibition of the inhibitive reaction .
This change applies in a comparable fashion as regards true fixation , if the amount of non-specific fixation by antigen is taken iiito account .
In other words , complete specific fixation with two units of complement may not be produced with suitable sera , if the antigenic dilution be increased and brought to compare with the amount of non-specific fixation produced by the original antigenic dilution .
It would 1911 .

seem that some qualitative change , displaying itself by increased anti-complementary effect , took place , which is not associated with those quantities in antigen which are concerned with specific antigen-serum attraction or negation . . .
The following protocols ( Table II ) seem to support this conception , although they are not conclusive .
Indeed , it is difficult to realise all the conditions necessary to prove this , nor is it perhaps essential .

two hours after the addition of corpuscles* and hsemolysin .
With this technique I frequently noticed various rates of haemolysis taking place .
The protocol of November 27 , 1910 , with inhibitive serum 2225 ( Table III ) shows the results that were obtained in this regard .
However , this has not proved a practical method of observing the comparative activity of inhibitive sera , partially because of the importance of the amount of complement available in regard to time effects , and the great difficulty of maintaining in complement a constant two-unit strength .
In Table III are also given the results obtained by leaving antigen-inhibitive serum mixtures in room temperature and in the cold .
With these tubes the addition of complement to the mixtures before or at the time of the use of the indicators apparently makes no practical difference .
These results lead to an attempt to dry rapidly antigen-inhibitive serum mixtures , and then determine their effect upon complement as seen in Table IV .

Inhand Fixation [ Aug. 24 , inhibitive reaction ; Serum 30 , from a dog injected with Vaughn 's non-toxic tuberculin , gave complement fixation .
Both sera were treated as follows : On November 29 , 1910 , 1*5 c.c. serum was added to 5 c.c. of a 1/ 10 solution of stock antigen extract , and the mixture brought to 10 c.c. with saline and incubated for one hour at 37*5 ' C. A control of antigen diluted with saline was treated in the same fashion .
After incubation the mixtures were poured on hardened filter paper , and rapidly dried in vacuo .
Previous to use the paper was ruled by a platinum point into centimetre squares .
The results were not expected , and there further seemed to be a shade of htemolysis hanging about certain squares that were not completely macerated .
The repetition with Serum 324 ( Table V ) was made in identical fashion , except that the paper was thoroughly macerated before incubation .
The 10 c.c. mixture , containing 1*5 c.c. serum , was spread over 40 squares ( as in the preceding ) as evenly as possible .
Squares for the test were taken at random .
It would seem that the negative attraction of antigen-inhibitive serum mixtures is destroyed by rapidly drying .

of storage .
Loss of fixation strength in sera containing sensitiser has been observed to take place within a few clays , while storage of inhibitive sera usually causes a less rapid loss of activity .
Four inhibitive sera , sealed and frozen in pairs on November 16 , 1910 , and November 26 , 1910 , were tested on December 12 , 1910 .
One serum of each date showed full activity , the other two but slight loss .
( 7 ) Serum Suspension.\#151 ; Bordet and Gay have shown that the inhibiting effect of normal rabbit serum in specific haemolysis " is not due to any effect upon the sensitisation of corpuscles nor to any neutralising action upon complement , but that the addition does oppose the fixation of complement by the sensitised cells .
" Further , as has been shown , this retarding or hindrance of the specific reaction is offset by increasing the avidity of the antigen-amboceptor for complement , or by dilution with salt .
Tins effect of inert serum in contrast to salt solution as a medium can appropriately be described as serum suspension , and it seems logical to conclude that serum provides unfavourable physical conditions in contrast to salt solution as a suspending medium .
Accepting this explanation of the suspension effect of serum , one may suppose that the presence of any serum may tend under favourable circumstances to the end-result of lessened haemolysis .
Certain results strongly support this conception .
With some inhibitive sera irregularities in the end result with increasing amounts of serum seem explicable on this ground .
Thus when 0T c.c. serum gives as complete an inhibitive reaction as 03 c.c. serum , the end result of the latter can sometimes be increased by further saline dilution .
The technique can easily be modified by using more closely related amounts of anti-complementary strengths so that the degree of the inhibitive reaction can be more closely read .
In other words , saline dilution encourages specific reaction by off-setting the suspending effect of larger amounts of serum .
The anti-complementary effect of antigen can be lessened by saline dilution as well as by increase of the avidity of corpuscles-haemolysin , so that to some extent the absence of haemolysis under this condition seems to be due to a suspending effect of antigen upon complement .
These effects are partially shown in Table VI , by Serum 1354 , which had previously given the same result with 02 c.c. as with 0'3 c.c. quantities .
Serum suspension may thus under favourable conditions tend to simulate specific fixation .
This makes it essential for one to know in each protocol as accurately as possible how much prevention of haemolysis serum itself may cause , and , as has been pointed out in the remarks under antigen saline control , how much prevention of haemolysis by the fourth dilution of antigen before one can feel certain to what extent the combined antigen-serum tube Mr. A.

represents specific fixation .
From many observations made with sera from man and animals with saline and one unit of complement , it is evident that every variation from complete to no haemolysis may result .
If one takes into consideration the amount of prevention induced by serum and that by antigen a very considerable check is afforded for otherwise " doubtful fixation reactions .
" This explanation with certain sera ( S. 860 , Table VI ) , however , is not sufficient to explain the end results as shown in the first and second dilutions .
For here , were the end reactions not specific , the addition of saline would modify them .
This serum has on several occasions given no haemolysis with the first three antigen dilutions .
The third and fourth dilutions could not be made in Table VI because of lack of serum .
The increased anticomplementary conditions as shown in the third dilution ( usually 1/ 40 or 1911 .

1 / 60 ) might easily be realised in antigen in a short space of time which , under many methods of control for fixation purposes alone , would escape detection ; indeed Serum 860 was in the very earliest part of the work recorded as a positive example of fixation .
Since then , because of the repeatedly similar results , and in the light of these conceptions and the clinical correlation , the value of this is felt to be doubtful .
( 8 ) Natural Sheep Corpuscle Amboceptor.\#151 ; This hsemolysin is frequently found in the serum of man and animals , and may interfere with a correct interpretation of the end results .
It can be avoided by first treating the serum with corpuscle solution , which , however/ means an increase of technique that is particularly objectionable with patients ' serum for purposes of clinical correlation .
As a routine I have instead used two controls , so that the extent of the influence of this amboceptor under the circumstances of the test may be fairly accurately gauged .
These are serum with in one tube the maximum strength of antigen , and in the other saline ; saline solution being used to replace the immune hsemolysin with the second incubation .
Thus the control with saline gives an end result indicative of the activity of the natural haemolysin under slightly more favourable conditions than exist in the protocol proper , i.e. greater saline dilution .
With no haemolysis in this latter tube it has been shown that slight sensitisation of corpuscles can be produced by adsorption experiments .
In only a few instances has the control with antigen shown any haemolysis .
However , no haemolysis in the antigen control tube for natural amboceptor is not as satisfactory a control as might at first appear , because of the underlying principles , which can be shown by the apparent degree of the inhibitive reaction before , and the real reaction after , adsorption of the amboceptor .
This is chiefly due to the fact that the curve of the end results with regard to time and degree is not in direct proportion to increase of the different biological constituents of the test .
In this regard , the use made of the term one and two units is inaccurate ; such nomenclature is , however , convenient , and is in this way qualified .
In earlier parts of the work a negative result in the antigen control tube was relied upon too extensively , and certain of the interpretations made were probably not correct .
With any more than " some " haemolysis in the saline tube , adsorption of the natural amboceptor should be performed for an accurate estimation of the amount of inhibitin .
The presence of natural amboceptor seems to explain certain irregularities of the inhibitive reaction obtained with varying amounts of serum and anticomplementary antigen .
Thus a serum may show no evidence of inhibitin with 0T c.c. and a full reaction with 03 c.c. , while the controls show the presence of the natural haemolysin .
After adsorption , the serum would show 386 Mr. A. H. Caulfeild .
Inhibitive and Fixation [ Aug. 24 , lessened or no evidence of inhibitin with 0'3 c.c. Besides this apparent increase , a serum without inhibitin may erroneously be credited with that reaction , as the haemolysis can be shown to be due to the natural amboceptor , although the control tube with antigen showed no haemolysis .
This agrees with what was earlier stated , namely , that anti-complementary strengths of antigen act partially by suspending complement , and can be offset by increasing the avidity of the corpuscle-amboceptor complex .
Apart from the inhibitive reaction , this factor may hinder true fixation results .
This is best illustrated when OT c.c. serum shows no haemolysis , while 0-3 c.c. gives a trace .
Thus in a serum with strong natural amboceptor effects , specific fixation may be partially masked and the results imperfectly interpreted .
Again , in Sera that have been classed as indifferent , all degrees of haemolysis with the second and third dilutions of antigen have been observed .
After adsorption , the serum in nearly all instances shows no haemolysis with the first three dilutions , the explanation being already given as serum suspension in addition to antigen adsorption .
In fact , in interpreting the results obtained with sera untreated ( beyond inactivation ) , regard must be paid to the controls for both serum suspension and the natural amboceptor for corpuscles .
From fnany observations upon the presence and variation of natural amboceptor in the serum of patients in all stages of nutrition , the results have suggested that a study of these bodies* might prove of value in digestion and assimilation experiments .
The technique that has been adopted for adsorption experiments with small amounts of serum has been as follows :\#151 ; Corpuscle solution ( 1/ 20 ) 5'0 c.c. + serum 2 0 c.c. are incubated for hours , centrifuged , and the supernatant fluid removed by a pipette .
Proportionately smaller amounts can be used where the amount of serum is less .
This serum-saline mixture contains nearly 0'15 c.c. serum in 0'5 c.c. , which corresponds to the unit and actual amount used .
The serum treated corpuscles are brought to twice the original amount of solution ( i.e. , 10 c.c. ) and activated by 10 units of complement .
Table VII illustrates the variation that may obtain with both a partially inhibitive and a fixation positive serum .
Table VIII shows the effect of the natural hsemolysin with indifferently reacting sera , and several sera with varying amounts of inhibitin .

( 9 ) Variation in the Fixative Tower of Fresh Guinea-pig Serum.\#151 ; Unfortunately , it has not always been recorded in standardising complement whether this was from one or more animals .
Lately , however , some endeavour has been made to note this , and , in 24 instances , when the complement was from only one animal , the following standardisations were made:\#151 ; 1 unit strength in a 1/ 15 dilution or less in 4 guinea-pigs .

24 " This method of estimating the fixative power of complement is not satisfactory , for in the few examples of sera which , in dilutions of 1/ 20 , that did not completely hsemolyse the corpuscles , the 1/ 10 dilution had a very rapid effect ; and in this latter dilution seemed efficient in the succeeding protocol , although , according to the method of standardisation , did not contain two units .
1911 .
] Serum Reactions in Pulmonary .389 ' Apparently , reproduction of the fixative strength of serum may take-place by the addition of fresh serum .
The following results in this connection have been obtained:\#151 ; February 16 , 1911.\#151 ; Fresh serum from two guinea-pigs killed on February 15 , 1911 , standardised 1/ 20 dilution to 1 unit ; used satisfactorily in a 1/ 10 dilution in the succeeding protocol .
February 18 , 1911.\#151 ; About 12 c.c. of fresh guinea-pig serum ( drawn February 17 , 1911 ) added to between 3 and 4 c.c. of serum remaining from the preceding lot .
Immediately after adding the fresh to the older serum the mixture standardised at barely 1/ 20 .
Within 3 hours this was used in a 1/ 10 dilution .
The protocol of 18 sera contained well-marked examples of fixative positive sera , and yet nothing less than partial haemolysis resulted , in a few instances , with the higher strengths of antigen and serum .
The following morning there remained sufficient of the mixture of guinea-pig sera to show that the fixative strength was over 1/ 50 .
The chief points that have been dealt with may be brought together as-follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The technique is concerned with specific biological factors , but is hampered also by other specific and non-specific conditions .
For a correct estimation of the specific effect of the antigen-serum complex upon complement these must be adequately controlled .
( 2 ) These factors may be regarded in the light of their tendency to induce or hinder haemolysis .

( b ) Non-specific effect of antigen upon complement .
