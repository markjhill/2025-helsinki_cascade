Communicated by S. H. Christie , Esq. , M.A. , Sec. R.S. The author states that the Regar of India is found , by chemical analysis , to consist of silica , in a minute state of division , together with lime , alumina , oxide of iron , and minute portions of vegetable and animal debris .
Hence it is usually considered as having been formed by the disintegration of trap rocks : the author , however , after examining its numerous trap dykes traversing the formation of the ceded districts , which he found invariably to decompose into a ferruginous red soil , perfectly distinct from the stratum of black r ?
gar through which the trap protrudes , was led to regard this opi ?
nion of its origin as erroneous : and from the circumstance of its forming an extensive stratum of soil covering a large portion of the peninsula of India , he believes it to be a sedimentary deposit from waters in a state of repose .
Specimens of basaltic trap and of the Regar soil were transmitted to the Society by the author , for the purpose of analysis .
