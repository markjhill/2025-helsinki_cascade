Trypanosome Hazmatopota , or other biting flies may act as mechanical carriers .
The evidence that Stomoxys plays a similar role is unsatisfactory .
Conclusions .
1 .
The Mvera Cattle strain , the Wild-game strain and the Wild G. morsitans strain belong to the same species of trypanosome , T. 2 .
T. pecorum , Nyasaland , is identical with the species found and described in Uganda .
3 .
It is an important disease of domestic animals in Nyasaland , being destructive to donkeys , oxen , goats , pigs , and dogs .
4 .
Its carrier in this district is G. morsitans , about 2 per cent , probably of the local wild flies being naturally infected with T. pecorum .
5 .
Its reservoir is the wild game inhabiting " fly-country , " 14'4 per cent , of which were found to be infected with this trypanosome .
It is hardly to be doubted that 100 per cent , are , or have been , infected .
6 .
It is recommended that if infected animals are found in a herd they should be destroyed or segregated , as there is a danger of biting flies other than the tsetse spreading the disease in the herd by mechanical transmission .
Morphology of Various Strains of the Trypanosome causing Disease in Man inNyasaland.\#151 ; The Mzimba Strain .

] Introduction .
Up to the present time it has usually been considered that almost all the cases of Human trypanosome disease in man in Nyasaland have been confined to a small area .
This , the so-called Sleeping-Sickness District , has been described in a former paper , * but it may be repeated here that it is the part of the " fly-country " lying along the western shore of Lake Nyasa , * ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' B , vol. 86 , p. 274 .
causing Disease in Man in between S. lat. 13 ' 20 ' and 13 ' 50 ' , and extending some twenty miles inland .
Through the centre of this area a road runs from Domira Bay on the Lake into North-East Rhodesia .
This road , until lately , was a principal highway between the coast and Central Africa .
Dr. Aylmer May , the Principal Medical Officer of North-East Rhodesia , who lately visited Kasu , informed the Commission that it was along this trade-route that all the North-East Rhodesian cases of Human trypanosome disease have occurred .
It is said that some 25,000 native porters passed along this road every year , and as they entered a Glossina palpalisarea at the Congo end of their journey , it seemed at first natural to suspect that the disease was true Sleeping Sickness , and had spread from west to east along this trade-route .
This suspicion was shown to be groundless by the discovery that the parasite causing the disease in North-East Rhodesia and Nyasaland is not Trypanosoma gambiense , but a distinct and separate species giving rise to a totally different disease .
The question then arose as to whether this was an imported or indigenous disease .
It has , therefore , been one of the objects of this Commission to determine whether the trypanosome causing Human trypanosome disease in Nyasaland is restricted to the game and " fly " of the Proclaimed Area , or if it extends to the north and south along the " fly-belt .
" If it is found to extend over all the " fly-area " in Nyasaland , then the disease is probably native to the soil and not an importation from Tanganyika or the Congo .
But it will be well at this point to lay down definitely the various opinions or theories at issue .
These are three in number .
First , that the Human trypanosome disease of North-East Rhodesia and Nyasaland is caused by a specific trypanosome , T. that the wild game and " fly " are heavily infected with it , and that T. brucei , or Nagana , is absent altogether .
This is the theory held by one school .
Second , that the wild game and " fly " are heavily infected throughout these " fly-areas " by T. brucei , but that at certain places or foci another trypanosome , T. rhodesiense , occurs , which is pathogenic to man as well as the other animals .
That these two species of trypanosomes are indistinguishable morphologically or by their action on animals , except that one is capable of infecting man and the other not .
That the only way to separate them is by inoculating man : if the man reacts it is T. rhodesiense , if not , T. brucei .
Third , that T. brucei\#151 ; a common trypanosome of wild game , whose distribution extends from Zululand to the Sudan\#151 ; and T. rhodesiense are one and the same species of trypanosome , and that wherever wild game and G. morsitans are found there also will be found cases of trypanosome 28 Sir D. Bruce and others .
Trypanosome disease in man .
That the cause of the sparsity of cases in man in these areas is due to the fact that man is more or less refractory to the trypanosome , and that it is only rarely that the " fly " meets with a susceptible subject .
That this is the reason why the cases of Human trypanosome disease in the Luangwa valley and in Nyasaland do not tend to increase in numbers .
The disease remains stationary , as it probably has done during the last thousand years .
This is the working hypothesis held at present by this Commission .
These , then , are the points at issue , and it would appear at present that the only way of solving the problem will be by searching and finding out whether cases of T. bruceidisease , or Nagana , in man occur wherever G. morsitans and this parasite are found together .
Already cases have been found on the Rovuma river on the borders of German and Portuguese East Africa , and in the Hartley District south of the Zambesi , in Europeans and natives , who certainly could only have contracted the disease in these widely separated districts .
Thanks to Mr. Garden , the Government Veterinary Officer , the Commission have had the opportunity of studying a trypanosome of the Nagana type found in the blood of a donkey at Mzimba ( lat. 11 ' 55 'S .
, long .
33 ' 35 ' E. ) , about 100 miles north of the northern border of the Proclaimed Area .
It is proposed , then , in this paper to describe this trypanosome , in pursuance of the policy of describing in detail as many strains as possible of this type of trypanosome , if peradventure some method of separating T. brucei from T. rhodesiensemay be discovered , or of proving them to be one and the same species .

The movements of this trypanosome in the living condition are similar to T. brucei and T. gambiense in being non-translatory .

The similarity in the curve of the Mzimba strain and the curve of the Wild-game strain* is remarkable , and there can be little doubt that the same trypanosome is being dealt with .
This is what might be expected , seeing there is probably only one animal between the wild G. morsitans and the experimental animal in both cases .

Table IV agrees very closely with the same table given in the paper on the " Morphology of the Trypanosome causing Disease in Man in Nyasaland."* It is doubtful if this detailed method of measurement assists in putting trypanosomes in their proper places , but it may be that when more work has been done , something may emerge .
There can be little doubt that morphology , in future , will play an important part\#151 ; perhaps the most important part\#151 ; in the classification of trypanosomes .
Breadth.\#151 ; The average breadth is 3*45 microns ( maximum 5*75 , minimum 1-5 ) .
The short and stumpy average 37 ( maximum 575 , minimum 2 ) , the intermediate 3*16 ( maximum 5 , minimum 1*5 ) , and the long and slender 2'84 ( maximum 4'25 , minimum 175 ) .

Conclusions .
1 .
The trypanosome of the Mzimba strain is the same species as that occurring in the wild game inhabiting the Proclaimed Area , Nyasaland .
2 .
It has already been concluded that this species is T. brucei vel rhodesiense .
3 .
Hence it would appear that wild occurring in a district 100 miles north of the Proclaimed Area are infected with the trypanosome which causes the Human trypanosome disease of Nyasaland .

The Trypanosome causing Disease in Man in Nyasaland.\#151 ; Susceptibility of Animals to the Human Strain .
By Surgeon-General Sir David Bruce , C.B. , F.R.S. , A.M.S. ; Majors David Harvey and A. E. Hamerton , D.S.O. , B.A.M.C. ; and Lady Bruce , R.R.C. ( Scientific Commission of the Royal Society , Nyasaland , 1913 .
) ( Received May 26 , \#151 ; Read June 12 , 1913 .
) Introduction .
In previous papers the morphology of various strains of this trypanosome \#151 ; from man , wild game and wild Glossina morsitans\#151 ; was described , and the different strains compared .
This paper describes the action on animals of the five strains derived from cases of trypanosome disease in man in Nyasaland , and compares their virulence .
In a future paper it is proposed to describe in the same way the action on animals of the Wild-game and Wild G. morsitans strains , but up to the present this has been impossible on account of the scarcity of experimental animals .
