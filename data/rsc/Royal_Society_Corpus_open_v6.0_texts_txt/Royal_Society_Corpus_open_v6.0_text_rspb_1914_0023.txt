Part II.\#151 ; The Formation of a Gel from Cholate Solutions having Many Properties analogous to those of Cell .
By S. B. SCHRYVEK .
( Communicated by Prof. V. H. Blackman , F.R.S. Received January 22 , \#151 ; Read February 19 , 1914 .
) In the first communication under the above title , * attention was called to the fact that solutions of sodium cholate , on warming in the presence of calcium salts , set to a gel , which is not reversible on cooling .
It has since been found that calcium salts can be replaced by other salts , such as sodium chloride , magnesium chloride , ammonium sulphate and potassium fluoride , and the clot formation is not therefore due to double decomposition between calcium salts and sodium cholate .
The concentrations of sodium , potassium , and magnesium salts necessary to produce the " clot " are , however , much higher than that of calcium chloride , which even in the concentration of N/ 40 can cause 1-per-cent , sodium cholate to set to a solid gel in about a qiiarter of an hour at 50 .
Sodium and magnesium chlorides produce clot formation at 50c , when their * ' Roy .

367 concentration is of about the order of half saturation .
It is proposed to investigate the relative clotting power of salt in greater detail later ; the present communication deals mainly with the question of the influence of one particular factor on gel formation , viz. , on the surface tension of the solution.* A preliminary account of the clot production by various calcium salts has been given in the first paper { loc. cit. ) .
It was then shown that in the case of calcium salts which increase the surface tension of water , increase in the concentration of the salt caused a diminution of the clotting time .
In the case of the calcium salts which lowered the surface tension , however , the accelerating effect of the increase in the concentration of the salt was counterbalanced by the diminished surface tension of the solution .
In two cases ( those of calcium dichloracetate and of the sulphocyanide ) an optimal point was found .
Increase in the concentration of the calcium salt above and below this point caused a lengthening of the time required for gel formation .
In the case of calcium trichloracetate , the length of clotting time progressively increased with increasing concentration within the limits investigated . !
Method of Experiment.\#151 ; The following was the method of experiment adopted:\#151 ; 1 c.c. of a 4-per-cent , sodium cholate solution and 3 c.c. of the salt solution in the required concentration were heated in separate quartz tubes of 10 c.c. capacity in a thermostat at 50 ' .
As soon as the liquids had attained the temperature of the thermostat , they were rapidly mixed ; the salt solution was poured into the cholate solution , and the mixture was then poured back into the tube originally containing the salt alone .
This was then clamped in the ( transparent ) thermostat and watched .
The formation of oily globules was the first sign of clot formation .
These at first moved rapidly in the liquid , but as they increased in size , motion became less rapid , until , finally , movement was hardly visible .
At this point , at short intervals , steel balls of 3/ 32 inch diameter , such as are used for ball-bearings , were dropped into the tube at short intervals .
The time of complete gel formation was taken as that at which a ball stopped dead before it had fallen half-way through the tube .
The time was taken by a stop-watch , which was started at the moment of mixing the solutions .
Even when the clotting time was 5 minutes , control determinations seldom differed by more than 10 seconds\#151 ; they usually agreed with one another within 5 seconds .
In the first series of experiments on calcium salts , the cholate solution was made by saturating N/ 100 sodium hydroxide with cholalic acid* * Throughout this communication by " surface tension " is meant surface tension measured against air .
t The surface tension of the salt solutions is affected mainly by the anions .
The series of anions employed was that used in the investigations on aggregation ( * Roy .

Investigations dealing with the until a solution neutral to neutral red was obtained .
An approximately 4-per-cent , solution was obtained .
It was found , however , that eholalic acid is soluble in sodium cholate solution , the amount dissolving varying with the temperature .
As this free acid inhibits the clotting , it was found that the clotting time of a solution varied from day to day .
For all subsequent experiments , sodium eholate was prepared and a 4-per-cent , solution was made directly from this .
The cholate was made by dissolving cholalie acid in 20 times its weight of alcohol , neutralising this solution with sodium ethoxide , heating for a short time on a water-bath and filtering off the first separation of solid , and then evaporating the filtrate .
Sodium cholate rapidly separated after a short time , and was filtered off , washed with acetone , and then dried , first on a water-bath , and then over sulphuric acid in a desiccator .
It gave a solution in water , acid to phenolphthalein , but slightly alkaline to neutral red .

Many attempts have been made within recent years to correlate physical properties of organic substances with their different biological actions , such as the production of exosmosis , haemolysis , narcosis , etc. ; more especially , their effect on the surface tension of water has been stated to be intimately associated with the production of changes in the cell .
Czapek* ( in his monograph , January , 1911 ) claims to have determined the surface tension of the membrane of certain plant cells by showing that exosmosis of tannin takes place , whenever they are immersed in solutions the surface tension of which falls below 0*681 ( water = 1 ) .
The smaller the amount of a given substance necessary to reduce the surface tension to this figure , the lower is * See also the numerous papers by Traube .
Phenomena of " Clot " Formations , the concentration of that substance which will produce exosmosis .
The conceptions of Czapek have been subjected to severe criticism , principally by Yernon , who has shown that there are many exceptions to Czapek 's rule .
Several substances , especially the narcotics and acetonitrile , produce exosmosis in solutions , the surface tensions of which are appreciably greater than Czapek 's critical point .
Czapek accounts for the exceptions to his rule by ascribing to them some specific toxic property .
Yernon hhs shown that a marked parallelism exists between haemolytic and narcotic actions and the inhibitory action on indophenol oxydases of animal tissues .
Batelli and Mile .
Stern support Yernon 's views in their investigations on the so-called oxydones and correlate the various toxic properties with the property of precipitating nucleoproteins.* In view of the above-mentioned facts and .
the preliminary experience obtained from the study of the calcium salts as to the action of surface tensions , it was a matter of considerable interest to study the inhibitory action of various organic substances on the formation of the cholate gel , which is derived from chemically pure crystalline products , and which , in thin films , might be regarded as a structure analogous to the cell membranes .
As a result it was found that whilst generally those substances which have the greatest power in lowering the surface tension of water have a greater inhibitory action on the gel formation , this rule is by no means absolute , and the chief exceptions are the narcotics and acetonitrile , i.e. the very substances which deviate from Czapek 's generalisation .
There is , moreover , a very close parallelism between the inhibitory action on gel formation and narcotic and other biological reactions .
In the following experiments 0*5 c.c. of calcium chloride was diluted to 3 c.c. with water containing a given amount of the substance under investigation , and this was then mixed with 1 c.c. of 4-per-cent , sodium cholate , and the clotting time was determined by the method given above .
The concentration of cholate in the mixture was , therefore , 1 per cent. , and of the calcium chloride , N/ 8 .
By determining the weights as well as the volumes of the organic substances , and also the specific gravity of the solutions , the concentrations in gramme molecules per litre could be calculated .

A solution of water saturated with chloroform at 17 ' contains 0*710 per .cent .
When 2*5 c.c. of this solution was mixed with 0*5 c.c. N. calcium chloride and 1 c.c. 4-per-cent , cholate solution , the clotting time was not appreciably longer than when no chloroform was present .
By diminishing the concentration of the calcium salt to one half , the clotting time was 230 seconds in the presence of saturated chloroform water ( 2*75 c.c. in 4 = 0*041 grm. mol .

per litre amyl alcohol , and the same amount of calcium salt , was 155 seconds , and of 0*038 grm. mol .
per litre chloral hydrate 194 seconds .
The inhibitory action of chloroform is therefore greater than that of amyl alcohol .
Nitromethane .
The action of nitromethane is anomalous .
In the presence of 3*75 per cent , the clotting time is 23 seconds , in the presence of 5 per cent , it is 57 seconds , and of 6*25 per cent , it is 42 seconds .
It appears to behave more or less like an acid , for in the presence of hydrochloric acid in N/ 800 concentration , the clotting time of cholate solutions is 41 seconds , in 17/ 400 it is 104 seconds , 317/ 800 it is 185 seconds , and in 17/ 200 it is 74 seconds .
At the highest of these concentrations the acid is sufficient to cause precipitation of free cholalic acid ; on keeping at 50 ' the precipitate disappears and a gel then forms .
The lower concentrations produce no separation of free organic acid in form visible to the naked eye .
The nitromethane possibly forms the / O salt CH3N\#151 ; 017a by double decomposition .

Whilst it cannot be denied that those substances which lower most markedly the surface tension of water have , as a rule , the greatest tendency to exert an inhibitory effect on the formation of the cholate gel , the law is not by any means an absolute one .
The exceptions are precisely the ones which deviate from Czapek 's generalisation .
Acetonitrile , which lowers the surface tension of water but little , has a greater inhibitory power than ethyl alcohol , which lowers it much more .
The deviation from the rule is shown in a very marked manner also by the typical narcotics , chloral , chloroform , and ( in the experiment on gel formation ) by urethane .
There is , in fact , a striking parallelism between inhibition of gel formation , narcotic and haemolytic actions and production of tannin exosmosis , which is well exhibited in the following table .

in the order in which they inhibit the gel formation , the more active substances being placed first in the list .
The numbers given are the strengths in which they produce narcosis of tadpoles according to Overton .
The concordance between the gel inhibitory action and the narcotic action is striking .
Methyl propyl ketone is an apparent exception , but gel-inhibiting action of this substance cannot be accurately determined , as in relatively small concentrations it causes the formation of crystals .
The same is true for ethyl alcohol in higher concentrations .
Normal propyl alcohol should follow instead of preceding urethane .
The substances showing a marked deviation from the surface tension generalisation are indicated in large type* General Summary and Conclusions .
The inhibition of gel formation may be assumed to be due to adsorption of various substances from solution , which prevent the formation of larger aggregates , which constitute the gel.f The adsorbability of those substances cannot be determined by their effect alone in lowering the surface tension of water .
Czapek has assumed that certain plant cells have a lipoid membrane , with a surface tension of about 0*681 ( water = 1 ) , and that , when they are immersed in an aqueous solution , the surface tension of which has been reduced to below this figure , exosmosis of complex molecules takes place , owing to the changes in the lipoid membrane .
Czapek found , however , .
that certain substances deviated from his rule .
To these he ascribed a specific toxic action on the cell .
In view of the fact that these same substances show a deviation also from a surface tension rule in their inhibitory action on the formation of the cholate gel , a phenomenon from which specific biological action is excluded , the purely mechanical conception of cytolysis , as propounded by Czapek , is clearly no longer tenable .
Nor do the results in the above paper support the Overton-Meyer lipoid hypothesis .
Although the lipoid soluble substances have , as a rule , the greatest inhibitory action on gel formation , the gel itself cannot , by any extension of the meaning of the term , be described as a lipoid .
It is formed from the salt of an acid , which is generally insoluble in organic solvents , in which even the free acid itself is only slightly soluble .
The results suggest that the semipermeability of the cell may owe its properties to the presence of some gel-forming substance * Several estimations of the surface tensions of solutions have been made by different observers .
Czapek 's own numbers have been adopted .
In arranging the above table the approximate dilutions which delay gel formation 15 minutes have been ascertained .
The surface tensions of these dilutions in water lies normally between 0'5 and 0*67 ( water = 1 ) .
The substances indicated in capitals deviated markedly from these numbers .

which has not yet been isolated , and which need be neither lipoid nor protein .
Such a gel need not , furthermore , be continuous , but may simply form a matrix , holding together proteins and lipoids and other cell constituents .
The protoplasm itself may exert its normal functions only when its constituents are held in such a matrix .
The amount of substance to which the gel formation may be due need be present only in very small quantities .
A solid gel has been obtained with S-per-cent .
solutions of sodium cholate , but the author , in conjunction with Dr. E. Graf von Schonborn ( in a preliminary communication to the Biochemical Society last May ) , has shown that solid gels are formed from sodium deoxycholeate ( another bile acid ) , when the concentration does not exceed 1 in 1000 .
Various other problems arise from the study of these gels .
Attention has been called to the fact that relatively large quantities of sodium and magnesium salts are necessary to produce gel formation as compared with those of calcium salts .
These facts offer a suggestion as to the antagonism of calcium salts to the toxic action of sodium and magnesium salts , as has been observed by Loeb , in the case of fundulus eggs , and of which many other biological examples exist .
The replacement of a calcium salt by sodium or magnesium salts may render a gel unstable .
It is proposed to investigate phenomena of this description .
In all the above experiments a large excess of calcium salts has been employed in gel formation , in order to accelerate this phenomenon .
To obtain results more analogous to the various biological phenomena , it will be necessary to study the action of various reagents on the gel when in thin membranes , and under conditions under which excess of calcium salts can be readily removed.* Preliminary experiments indicate that under such conditions the gel may be reversed .
Work is proceeding in this direction , and it is also proposed to employ the gels for the study of various phenomena of permeability .
* Tn the above-described experiments the inhibitory action of various substances on a membrane ( or gel ) formation has been studied .
It has been assumed in these arguments that the more powerful this particular action of a given substance is , the greater will be its disaggregating action on an already formed membrane ( or gel ) .
