" Remarks towards establishing a Theory of the Dispersion of Light .
" Bythe Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
In an abstract of M. Cauehy 's Theory of Undulations , published in the London and Edinburgh Journal of Science , the author of the present paper deduced a formula expressing precisely the relation between the length of a wave and the velocity of its propagation ; and showed that this last quantity is , in fact , the same as the reciprocal of the refractive index .
The author here examines , by means of this formula , the relation between the index of refraction and the length of the period , or wave , for each definite ray , throughout the whole series of numerical results which we at present possess ; and the conclusion to which he arrives from this comparison , for*all the substances examined by Frauenhofer , viz. for four kinds of flint glass , three of crown glass , water , solution of potash , and oil of turpentine , is that the refractive indices observed for each of the seven definite rays are related to the length of waves of the same rays , as nearly as possible according to the formula above deduced from Cauchy 's theory .
For all the media as yet accurately examined , therefore , the theory of undulations , as modiried by that distinguished analyst , supplies at once both the law and the explanation of the phenomena of the di ?
spersion of light .
