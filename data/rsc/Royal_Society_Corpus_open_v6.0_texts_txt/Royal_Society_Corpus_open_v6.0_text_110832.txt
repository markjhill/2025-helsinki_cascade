" An Account of a remarkably large and luminous Spot in the Sea .
" By Captain F. Eardley Wilmot , F.R.S. With remarks on the water taken thence : in a letter to S. H. Christie , Sec. R.S. , from Lieut. Manley Dixon , R.A. The letter is as follows : DEAR SIR , Woolwich , October 6th , 1843 .
Captain F. Eardley Wilmot , on his voyage home from the Cape of Good Hope in the spring of this year , observed one night a remarkable , though not very uncommon appearance of the sea .
This was a large and very luminous spot , which was clearly defined by a sharp edge .
He thus describes the appearance , and also the steps which he took to obtain some of the water for the purpose of bringing it home to England and submitting it to a chemical test .
" The sea was covered with so brilliant a surface of silver light that we could see to read , and the shadows of ropes , &amp;c. were strongly marked .
We sailed through it for about four hours .
In one place it had an edge ; and we sailed out of it for nearly half an hour , when we again entered it as abruptly , and finally left it , when the edge of the illuminated part was strongly defined .
The water was taken up in a clean bucket and put into a carefully cleaned bottle ; about 10 ?
north latitude .
" As Captain Wilmrot 's time in England was limited , he left the bottle of sea water with me , and I took the first opportunity of showing it to Dr. Faraday , who took it to London with him , and wrote me a note , of which the following is a copy .
" Royal Institution , September 25th , 1843 .
" DEAR SIR , -I have examined the water , and it is peculiar in some points .
It contained much sulphuretted hydrogen , and also a portion of solid deposit , which was about one half sulphur and the other half organic matter .
There has no doubt been considerable change in the contents of the water , and I cannot now recognise organic forms ; but the presence of the animal matter , the sulphur , and the sulphuretted hydrogen , all agree with the idea that the water , when taken up , was rich in animals or animalculme .
