" Researches towards establishing a theory of the Dispersion of Light , No. II .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
The author , in a preceding paper , published in the last part of the Philosophical Transactions , commenced a comparison between the results of M. Cauchy 's system of undulations , expressing the theoretical refractive index for each of the standard rays of the spectrum , and the corresponding index found from observation in different media .
Since that paper was communicated , he has received the account of a new series of results obtained by M. Rudberg , and comprising the indices for the standard rays in a prism of calcareous spar , and in a prism of quartz , both for the ordinary and the extraordinary rays 5 and also the ratios of the velocities in the direction of the three axes of elasticity , respectively , in Aragonite and Topaz .
The author was accordingly ledto examine this valu ?
able series of data , and the comparison of them with the theory forms the subject of the present paper .
He finds the coincidences of theory and observation to be at least as close as those already obtained from Frauenhofer 's results , and to afford a satisfactory extension of the theory to ten new cases , in addition to those already discussed j and a further confirmation of the law assigned by the hypothesis of un ?
dulations .
A paper was in part read , entitled , " On the action of Light upon Plants , and of Plants upon the Atmosphere .
