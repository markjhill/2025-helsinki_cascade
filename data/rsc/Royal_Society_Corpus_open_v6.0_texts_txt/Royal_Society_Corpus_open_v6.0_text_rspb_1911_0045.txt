49 Immunisation by Means By R. Tanner Hewlett , M.D. ( Communicated by Prof. W. D. Halliburton , F.R.S. Received March 28 , \#151 ; Read May 4 , 1911 .
) In a former paper* it was shown that the intra-eellular constituents of bacterial cells , bacterial endotoxins , possess a considerable capacity for increasing the opsonising action of the serum of healthy rabbits .
In the present paper , the action of bacterial endotoxins in immunising against-injections of the corresponding living organisms has been investigated .
Smallman , in an investigation upon the active immunisation of experimental animals with typhoid cell juices , f found that the fresh fluid cell juice and also the dried juice immunised guinea-pigs against injections of living typhoid culture .
The endotoxins were prepared in the manner described in the previous paper .
Guinea-pigs were the experimental animals employed throughout .
The results obtained are summarised in the following sections:\#151 ; Immunisation against the Bacillus Typhosus .
SeriesI.\#151 ; Fifteen guinea-pigs were inoculated on May 14 , 1909 , each with 1 mgrm .
of typhoid endotoxin prepared on May 12 , 1909 .
Series II.\#151 ; Fifteen guinea-pigs were inoculated on the same date ( May 14 ) each with 0T mgrm .
of typhoid endotoxin ( same preparation ) .
Series III.\#151 ; Fifteen guinea-pigs were inoculated on May 26 , 1909 , each with 001 mgrm .
of typhoid endotoxin ( same preparation ) .
Series IV.\#151 ; Sixteen guinea-pigs were inoculated on May 21,1909 , each with 1 c.c. of Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome 's anti-typhoid vaccine ( equivalent to 1,000,000,000 bacilli ) .
All the guinea-pigs , at the time of inoculation , weighed 250 to 300 grm. Of Series I , one died on May 21 , two on May 22 , and one on May 28 , leaving 11 animals for experiment .
Of Series II , one died on May 22 , and another on June 1 , leaving 13 animals for experiment .
Of Series III , one died on June 2 , leaving 14 animals for experiment .

Summary of Results obtained with Typhoid Endotoxin.\#151 ; The experiments detailed in Tables I , II , and III indicate that injections of 1 , 0*1 , and 0'01 mgrm .
of typhoid endotoxin confer considerable protection against subsequent injections of living typhoid bacilli .
With amounts of 1 and 0*1 mgrm .
of endotoxin the protective power was maintained for a period of nearly 11 weeks .
With 0-01 mgrm .
of endotoxin the protective power appeared to be maintained for six weeks , but did not seem to be manifest after eight and nine weeks ; but it is to be noted that in the two last instances the test dose of typhoid bacilli was larger than that employed previously .
As regards the typhoid vaccine the results obtained with it correspond with those obtained with the lowest dose of endotoxin , viz. , 0-01 mgrm .
Immunisation against the Bacillus diphtheria .
The diphtheria endotoxin was prepared by growing a virulent diphtheria bacillus on the surface of blood-agar for 48 hours , collecting the growth , well washing twice with physiological salt solution by centrifuging in order to remove adherent toxin , and grinding , etc. , in the usual way .
The endotoxin solution was prepared on June 17 , 1909 .

each , and three 0'5 mgrm .
each of the endotoxin .
One of the guinea-pigs which received 1 mgrm .
died on July 12 .
The five survivors , together with two controls , were each inoculated subcutaneously with 1/ 10 of a loop of a 24-hour blood-agar culture of virulent diphtheria .
The virulence of this strain of diphtheria bacillus had been previously tested on June 25 with the following results ( Table Y):\#151 ; Table V.\#151 ; Virulence of Diphtheria Culture .

[ Mar. 28 , Immunisation against the Vibrio cholera .
The endotoxin solution was prepared on June 29 , 1909 .
On August 11 , 1909 , six guinea-pigs ( 300 to 400 grm. weight ) were each inoculated subcutaneously with 0-25 mgrm .
On September , 15 , 1909 , these guinea-pigs were each inoculated intra-peritoneally with one loop of cholera culture , equivalent to about two minimum lethal doses .
Three control animals were inoculated at the same time with the culture , two receiving one loop each , the third 0*5 loop .
All the six vaccinated animals survived , but of the controls the two receiving 1 loop of culture were dead on September 16 , and the one receiving 0'5 loop was very ill but recovered .
The cholera endotoxin , therefore , protected the animals against living cholera culture . .
Immunisation against the Bacillus pestis .
\gt ; The plague endotoxin was prepared in the usual manner , and was used fresh ( 24 hours old ) .
Subsequently the animals were inoculated with virulent plague culture .
The results are shown in the following tables ( Tables VII and VIII ) Series I.\#151 ; The guinea-pigs were injected subcutaneously with 1 mgrm .
of plague endotoxin on August 11 , 1909 , and , together with controls , were inoculated intra-peritoneally with plague culture on September 15 .

Simultaneous Inoculation with Two and Three Different Endotoxins .
A few inoculations were simultaneously done with two and three different endotoxins .
The endotoxins were injected subcutaneously on August 11 , and the cultures were inoculated intra-peritoneally on September 15 , five weeks later .
The typhoid endotoxin was prepared on June 29 , the cholera endotoxin on June 29 , and the diphtheria endotoxin on June 17 .

The controls for the typhoid and the cholera were the same as in Series I , Table IX .
Controls for the diphtheria were as follows : G and H , OT loop diphtheria , were dead on September 17 ; K , 0'05 loop diphtheria , was dead on September 19 .
The results of these few experiments suggest that the simultaneous injection of two different endotoxins does not interfere with the protection conferred by either .
Trypanosoma brucei .
A few experiments were performed in order to ascertain whether the method employed in the foregoing work is applicable to immunisation against the Trypanosoma brucei .
Eats were inoculated , and , when the trypanosome was abundant in the blood , they were killed and the blood was collected .
The blood , together with the spleen in some instances , was ground in the usual way , and the fluid obtained was injected into healthy rats , which subsequently were inoculated with living Trypanosoma brucei .
One , or in some cases two and three , injections of the ground material were given , but in no case was any protection obtained .
Other experiments were also performed , using the blood and triturated spleen , which had been subjected to the action of a freezing mixture of ether and solid carbonic acid , without grinding .
It was found that this freezing ruptures , and destroys the vitality of , the trypanosomes .
Negative results as regards protection were also obtained by this method .
General Summary .
The results obtained in this investigation indicate that typhoid , cholera , diphtheria , and plague endotoxins confer considerable protection against Method of Disintegrating Bacterial Cells .
57 subsequent inoculation with the corresponding living organisms , a protection* which , with appropriate doses of the endotoxin , is exerted for at least 11 weeks after the injection of the endotoxin .
This result suggests that endotoxins may be of considerable value as protective or prophylactive vaccines .
The endotoxin solutions maintain their activity for at least six weeks .
A few inoculations of typhoid and diphtheria endotoxins have been performed in the human subject .
The inoculations cause some local reaction at the site of inoculation , consisting of redness , soreness and stiffness of the part , but little general reaction is induced , nor are any ill effects apparent .
I am indebted to Mr. Henry Welcome for the facilities he has kindly afforded me for carrying out this work at the Welcome Physiological Laboratories , and my best thanks are due to Mr. E. Thompson for his invaluable assistance in the preparation of the endotoxins .
On a Method of Disintegrating Bacterial and other Organic Cells .

( Communicated by Prof. W. D. Halliburton , F.R.S. Received March 28 , \#151 ; Read May 4 , 1911 .
) [ Plate 1 .
] The methods hitherto available for accomplishing the disintegration of bacteria may be summarised briefly as follows :\#151 ; The earliest experiment is that of Buchner* for obtaining the intracellular juices of yeast .
This method was adopted by Macfadyen , Harris-Morris , and Rowland in their investigations on " Expressed Yeast Cell Plasma , " communicated to the Royal Society , June 19 , 1900 , but they subsequently introduced some modifications and improvements in the method .
Their improved process was to place the yeast cells in mass in a mechanical contrivance , together with a proportion of added silver sand , and to violently agitate the containing vessel .
