A paper was then read , entitled , ' ' On the Tides.'* By John William Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society .
Various tables relating to the tides are communicated in this paper , calculated , according to the instructions of the author , by Mr. Dessiou .
In the tables given by the author in former papers , already published in the Philosophical Transactions , and having reference to the corrections due to the influence of the parallax and declination of the moon , Mr. Dessiou employed only observations of the tides made between con ?
junction and opposition ; but in those now given , similar corrections have been obtained from observations made between opposition and conjunction .
The author enters into an inquiry into the correction due to the calendar month , which is mixed up with that due to the moon 's declination , and shows that the correction for the moon 's parallax , as well as declination , deduced from the theory ofBernoulii , are quite discordant with the results of Mr. Dessiou 's calculations , founded on actual observation .
The author agrees with Mr. Whewell in the remark , that the theory of the tides is now in the same state as that which the theory of the motions of the moon and planets presented about a century ago 5 and unless considerable exertions be made , it may so continue for many years to come .
The tables of the planets have acquired their present accuracy only through the liberal encouragement of learned bodies , and of some of the governments of Europe ; nor can tables of the tides , adapted to the present state of science , be now constructed , unless very considerable expense be incurred , and immense labour bestowed .
The results of numerous observations on the influence of the wind on the tides in the River Thames , are stated ; and the author observes , that this is a subject of considerable importance as regards the accu ?
racy of which tide predictions are susceptible .
