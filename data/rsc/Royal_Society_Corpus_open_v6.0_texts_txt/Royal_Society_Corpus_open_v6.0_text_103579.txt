A Letter from Mr. Atkinson , Surgeon in White-Chappel : Concerning an Imposthumation in the Stomach .
To the same .
SIR , THE Case you desire a particular account of , was as follows .
I had a Patient about seven Years ago , which had a large Tumour on the upper part of her Belly , it was hard and painful , but did not alter the natural colour of the Skin , and had been three Months in coming .
I applied a warm Gum Plaister to it , which in about a Fortnights time brought it to a Suppuration .
I then applied a Caustic about the bigness of a Shilling ; when the Eschar fell off , I saw a solid kind of Substance appear in the Orifice , I laid hold of it with my Forceps , and pulled it gently towards me~ upon which there thrust forcibly out a quantity of it , that near filled my Hand , so I dressed it .
Next dressing , the same Substance appeared again , which on her straining , forced out near twice as much as before .
I was at a great loss to determine what this stuff was , but at last concluded it was the Omentum it self , in which Opinion I was confirmed by some other Surgeons I showed it to .
I was still in doubt , whether the Stomach was concerned in this Case or not , till the next Removal of the Dressings , at which there spurted out above half a Pint of Ale in a full Stream , which was part of a Pint she had drunk a little while before .
I now concluded the Case mortal , however , I ordered her to keep her Bed , to lie constantly upon her Back , and feed on things of easy Digestion .
The greatest part of what she eat or drank , came through the Ulcer for eight or ten Days , so that I had no hopes of ever curing it , yet contrary to my Expectation in about six Weeks she was perfectly cured , and is now living and in good Health .
