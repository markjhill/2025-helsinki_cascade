] To ascertain whether the fungi mentioned in the title of this paper vegetate in the snow , Mr. Bauer put a small portion of them into a phial filled with compressed snow , and placed in the open air in a N.W. aspect .
In fifty-two hours they had formed a red sediment ; and the snow being thawed the water was poured off , and a fresh portion added as before .
In two days the mass of fungi was raised.in little pyramids , which gradually increased in height , so as nearly to fill the phial , and occupied the cells of the mass of ice .
A thaw now continued for some time , and the fungi fell to the bottom of the water in the phial , where they occupied about double their original bulk , having sustained an increase to that amount during their vegetation in the ice and snow .
In water these fungi appear also perceptible of vegetation , but they produce new fungi of a green instead of a red colour .
By exposure to excessive cold the primitive fungi are killed , but their seed still retains vitality , and if immersed in snow regenerates new fungi , generally of a red colour .
The author thinks that snow is undoubtedly the native soil of these fungi .
This paper is illustrated by a drawing , showing the original appearance of the fungi in the snow water from Baffin 's Bay , and their gradual increase in the phials , as described in this abstract .
