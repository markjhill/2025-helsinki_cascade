" On the Formation and some of the Properties of Cymidine , the Organic Base of the Cymol Series .
" By the Rev. JOHN BARLOW , F.R.S. , Sec. R. Inst. Received June 14 , 1855 .
The object of this memoir is to detail the process by which an organic base , provisionally named Cymidine , was obtained from the hydrocarbon , cymol , and to describe some of its properties , and certain phenomena attending its production .
The substitution-product , nitrocymol , was procured by acting on cymol by strong nitric acid , both liquids being kept at the temperature 17 ?
Cent. ( 0 ?
Fahr. ) .
From nitrocymol , cymidine was obtained by Bechamp 's modification of Zinin 's process , and results of analyses , made by combustion of the platinum salt , and likewise by a silver determination of the hydrochlorate , were found to coincide with the formula C20 H15 N. In the formation of cymidine a neutral oil occurred , having the same boiling-point with cymol .
From this hydrocarbon a substitution compound was derived , apparently isomeric with , but possessing a less specific gravity than nitrocymol .
This nitro-compound was also subjected to the process of reduction already described , and a basic substance was formed from it , which was identified by a platinum determination with cymidine .
Some qualitative experiments , made with cymidine , were also described , and the memoir concluded with the following synoptical table of the homologues of the benzol series .
