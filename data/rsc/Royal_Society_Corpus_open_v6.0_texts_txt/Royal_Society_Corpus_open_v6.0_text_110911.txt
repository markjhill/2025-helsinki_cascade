" On a point connected with the dispute about the invention of Fluxions .
" By Augustus De Morgan , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.A.S. , &amp; c , Communicated by Samuel Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. An assertion made by Sir Isaac Newton in a letter to Conti , published in Raphson 's History of Fluxions , that the materials of the Commercium Epistolicum were " collected and published by a numerous Committee of gentlemen of different nations , appointed by the Royal Society for that purpose , " appeared to be at variance with the list of the Committee as it was appointed on the 6th of March , 1711-12 , and which only contains the names of Arbuthnot , Hill , Halley , Jones , Machine and Burnet , who were all English .
But on flirther search of the records of the Society with the aid of Mr. Weld , the Assistant Secretary , the author ascertained that other members were subsequently added to the Committee , among whom were Bonet , the Prussian minister , and De Moivre , both of whom were foreigners ; thus showing that the imputations which might have been cast on Newton 's veracity are groundless .
