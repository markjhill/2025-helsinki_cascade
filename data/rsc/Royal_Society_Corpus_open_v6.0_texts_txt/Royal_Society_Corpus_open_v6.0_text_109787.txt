] In a paper communicated to the Royal Irish Academy by Dr. Mooney , the method of exterminating any number of quadratic surds is pointed out by successively squaring them when brought alone to one side of the equation ; and the present is an extension of the same method : first , to all surds whose indices are any integral power of 2 , as the fourth , eighth , sixteenth , thirty-second power , &amp;c. ; and next to cubic surds , and to any number of surds whose common indices are in any manner compounded of the factors 2 and 3 ; next to any combinations of surds whose indices do not exceed the number 6 , and to as many as three surds , neither of whose indices exceed 12 , as well as to various others which cannot be concisely specified .
