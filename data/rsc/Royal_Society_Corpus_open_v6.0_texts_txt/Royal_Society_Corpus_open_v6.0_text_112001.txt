I. " Extract of a letter to General Sabine from Dr. OTTO ToRELL , dated from Copenhagein , Dec. 12 , 1863 .
" Received Decenmber 18 , 1863 .
The Swedish Diet has given the necessary money to complete the survey for the measurement of an Arc of the Meridian at Spitzbergen .
When the proposal was submitted to the Diet by our Government , at the instance of the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm , it was passed without opposition in the three first houses of the Diet ( viz. the Nobles , the Clergy , and the Burghers ) .
In the fourth house ( the Peasants ) , only one Member opposed the proposal , on the ground of the high amounit of the BuLdget .
He was replied to by seven or eight other Members , advising that the house should not oppose a grant which had for its object to advance science .
in consequence the money was also voted by the House of Peasants .
There is every reason to expect that the question of the practicability of the undertaking will be settled in the next summer , and I hope that the result may be satisfactory .
The Diet has with the same liberality given the necessary money for the Swedish share in the proposed large Middle-European Triangulation from Palermo to Trondjem , and has also made a grant of the money which will be required to erect a new Astronomical Observatory at the University of Lund .
I expect therefore that the excellent astronomer at the University , Mr. Moller , will read with intense interest the correspondence regarding the Melbourne Telescope , which even to me has been of great interest .
