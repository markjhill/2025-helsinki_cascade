[ The investigation of these intramolecular changes is being continued .
It has been found that a similar interchange of halogen for hydroxyl takes places very readily in solutions of chloro- and bromo-naphthalene-diazonium salts , even in the presence of excess of acid .
The author is of opinion that the observation of Gaess and Ammelburg , * that an aqueous solution of l-nitro-2-naphthalenediazonium sulphate yields the 1 : 2-naphthalenediazo-oxide , is an example of the type of transformation here considered .

] In a former communication to the Society !
the curve of the initial freezing points of the alloys of gold and copper and some micrographic evidence as to their structure were given , and it was shown that according to the theory of solutions the alloys rich in gold should not be homogeneous after they have solidified .
The fact that they are not uniform was confirmed by analysis .
The subject has , however , more than theoretical interest , and the inference was drawn that standard gold , which consists of eleven parts by weight of gold to one of copper , is unsuitable as a material for the preparation of the trial plates by which the standard of the coinage is tested .
These trial plates according to law must contain 916'6 parts of gold and 83*3 of " alloy , " that is of some other metal , and it remained to be determined what the other metal should be .
It will be at once apparent that the alloy or mixture of the two metals must , if the cold mass is to be uniform , solidify as a whole , that is to say , that the crystals first formed should be of the same composition as the mother liquor , and this condition Can be fulfilled by isomorphous mixtures only .
It has long been recognised that the gold-silver alloys are cases of isomorphism , and Gautier , in 1896 , stated !
that the freezing-point curve of the series followed a straight line if the percentages by weight of the constituents were taken as abscissae .
This curve was re-determined by experiment , a number of alloys being made up and autographic records taken of their cooling curves by the Roberts-Austen recording pyrometer .

With further additions of silver there is a steady acceleration in t e rate of lowering of the point of solidification , so that the freezing-point curve of the series has no double flexure , unless one is indicated near the silver end of the curve by Heycock and Neville 's results .

] Properties of the Alloys of the Gold-Silver Series .
There is , of course , no eutectic alloy observable in any member of the series .
The alloys all consist of large grains , but these are built up of smaller grains , so that the ultimate structure is exceedingly minute .
When magnified 1500 diameters the grains appear as small irregular crystals of the cubic system ( see fig. 2 , PI .
3 ) .
In order to develop any segregation that might take place , an ingot of the standard alloy containing 91*66 per cent , of gold by weight was heated for 2 months in one of the annealing furnaces at the Royal Mint , the temperature of which was kept at about 700 ' by day , but fell to about 100 ' at night .
The maximum temperature attained was over 300 ' below the fusing point of the alloy , and the sharpness of the angles of the specimen had suffered no change .
After this treatment it was found that the grains had increased in size , and the crystals forming them had become well developed , as shown in fig. 3 ( PI .
3 ) , in which the structure is magnified 1500 diameters .
No true segregation , however , could be detected even in this ingot , either by analysis or by the microscope , and plates prepared by rolling out ingots containing 916*6 parts by weight of gold , and 83*3 parts of silver , were found on analysis to be uniform in composition .
The ancient trial plates , according , to the analysis made by one of us , * consist of a triple alloy of gold , silver , and copper .
The earliest one in existence was made in 1527 , the year following the first introduction of the standard 916*6 .
This plate contained only 0*62 per cent , of copper , and was probably intended to consist of gold and silver only .
All subsequent plates , however , down to that made in 1829 , contained much larger amounts of copper .
In 1873 it was determined to omit the silver and to use only copper as the alloying metal , and thus to preserve identity of composition between the trial plate made in that year and the coinage .
In view , however , of the importance of obtaining homogeneous trial plates and of the ease with which the exact quantity of copper required to make the assay pieces identical in composition can be added to the pieces of the trial plate .during the course of the assays , it is preferable to use only silver as the alloying metal in the manufacture of the trial plates .
Such an alloy has accordingly been used at the Royal Mint since the beginning of the present year instead of fine gold for checks in the assay of standard bars and coins .
In view of the minute accuracy with which the operations of coinage have to be conducted , this is a matter of much importance .
By this method any errors are avoided which might be caused by accidental variations in weights occurring after the trial plates have been made .
