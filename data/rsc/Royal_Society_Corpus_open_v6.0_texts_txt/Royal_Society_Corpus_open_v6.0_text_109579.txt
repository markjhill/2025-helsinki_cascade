Analysis of a triple Sulphuret , of Lead , Antimony , and Copper , from Cornwall .
By Charles Hatchett , Esq. F.R.S. Read January 26 , 1804 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1804 , p. 63 .
] This is the analysis to which the Count de Bournon more than once refers in his elaborate account of the same mineral , lately read to the Society .
We find here , in addition to the information contained in that paper , that one of the reasons why this very scarce ore has been hitherto so little attended to , is probably its great resemblance to an ore of antimony ; that by all the chemical tests by which it has been tried , its constituent parts are manifestly lead , antimony , copper , and a small proportion of iron , the whole combined with sulphliur ; and that when the specific gravity , the external and internal colour , the fracture , the grain , and other characters here described are considered , there can be no doubt that the three first metals exist in the ore in , or nearly in , the metallic state , combined with sulphur , so as to form a triple sulphuret .
The proportion of the ingredients are as given by Count de Bournon , who , in fact , took them from this paper .
