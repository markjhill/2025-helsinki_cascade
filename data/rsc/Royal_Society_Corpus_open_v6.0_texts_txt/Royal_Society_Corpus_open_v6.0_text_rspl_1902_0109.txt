" The Statolith-theory of Geotropism .
" By Francis Darwin M.A. , M.B. , F.R.S. Received March 6 , \#151 ; Read March 1903 .
To make clear the point of view from which the experiments here-recorded were undertaken , a few words on the modern theory of gravitational sensitiveness are necessary .
For fuller details the reader is referred to the papers of Noll , Nemec and Haberlandt* to* whom the theory in question is due .
When a geotropic organ suffers a change of position it responds by an appropriate curvature , and ultimately reassumes verticality .
With the mechanism of curvature I am not concerned , the problem to be solved is the source of the stimulus to which the curvature is a response .
In other words : when a plant , which normally grows vertically upwards , is laid horizontally , it obviously perceives the change p by what mechanism is the perception rendered possible 1 The view of Nemec and Haberlandt is that the stimulus is due to the presence of bodies of greater specific gravity than the cell sap , which in consequence of their weight always fall to the physically lower regions of the cells .
These bodies are usually movable starch grains , and may conveniently be termed statoliths .
As long as an organ is vertical , i.e. , in its normal position , the statoliths , in consequence of their weight , collect in a heap or layer on the basal walls of the cells .
When the organ is placed horizontally the heap of statoliths topples over and gradually spreads out in a layer on the lateral walls , which are now horizontal .
It is clear that in this circumstance is to be found the possibility of an appropriate stimulus .
We can conceive that the pressure of the statoliths on the protoplasm of the lateral instead of the basal walls , might become associated with certain definite curvatures .
Thus in a typical stem-structure the reflex action correlated with pressure on the lateral cell walls would be an upward curve , in a typical root the same stimulus would result in a downward curve .
The starch grains or other heavy bodies have been named statoliths in harmony with the nomenclature of the zoologists , who have given the name to the heavy particles which supply certain animals ( e.g. , the Crustacea ) with the means of orienting themselves , spatially .
The beautiful experiment of Kreidlf has definitely proved * Noll , i Heterogene Induction , ' Leipzig , 1892 .

] The Statolith-theory of Geo363 that the Crustacean Palcemonis guided in keeping its dorso-ventral plane vertical , and dorsal surface upwards , by the stimulus of the statoliths resting on the internal surface of its otocysts .
In favour of their theory , Nemec and Haberlandt have stated fully and well the general argument based on the distribution of statoliths .
Thus , broadly speaking , statoliths are found to occur ( in Phanerogams at least ) in organs and parts of organs capable of gravitational stimulation .
On the other hand , speaking generally , statoliths are absent where there is no power of curving geotropically .
Thus in the older parts of stems , which have lost the power of curvature , the statoliths disappear from the endodermis.* The presence of statoliths in the tip , and only in the tip of the root , is a striking fact , and one that is in general accordance with the theory set forth in the Power of Movement Plants , and confirmed since the appearance of that work by more than one observer . !
The same thing is true of the cotyledon of Setaria and Sorghum , the statoliths are practically confined to this part of the seedling in which the gravitational sensitiveness has been shown to reside .
] ; For further details of the general argument from distribution we must refer to the writings of Nemec and Haberlandt .
Personally , I consider the general argument to be highly convincing , but this opinion seems not to be shared by others , and in any case it does not permit us to neglect experimental tests .
Experimental Evidence .
Nemec lays some stress on the loss of geotropism following the destruction of the statoliths .
He employs Pfeifer 's method of embedding a seedling bean or pea in liquid plaster of Paris .
In this way , when the gypsum sets , the seedling is prevented from growing , and for some unknown reason the treatment leads to the disappearance of the starch from the group of specialised cells at the tip of the root .
According to Nemec seedlings so treated fail to respond to gravitational stimulus .
But the argument is not complete , it should be shown that the starchless roots are not also inhibited in their reaction to other stimuli .
For instance , supposing the experiment was performed on seedlings of it should be ascertained whether the starchless radicles would or would not curve apohelio-tropically , while remaining incapable of geotropic curvature .
I have tried a similar experiment on Setaria and Sorghum .
It was discovered accidentally that the cotyledons lose a great part of their # Haberlandt , ' Pringsheim 's Jahrbiiclier , ' vol. 38 ( 1903 ) , p. 451 ; and ' Ber .

other similar experiments showed us that we had no right to conclude that the loss of geotropic capacity depended on the absence of the special mechanism ( statoliths ) , but rather that the loss of the starch may perhaps be no more than a symptom of exhaustion which shows itself both geo- and heliotropically .
Nemec has shown that in decapitated roots , i.e. , roots from which 1903 .
] The Statolith-theory the tip containing the statocytes have been removed , the capacity for geotropism returns with the regeneration of the statoliths .
Even here\#151 ; though the fact is a striking one\#151 ; the argument seems to require the heliotropic test .
For obviously the regeneration of the tip may mark the recovery of a generalised sensibility , and not merely the rehabilitation of the special gravitational mechanism .
The same objection holds to some extent with regard to Haberlandt's* experiments on plants found to be starchless in winter .
It should have been more definitely shown that they are heliotropically active though incapable of gravitational reaction .
The Tuning-fork Method .
In the autumn of 1901 , I began a series of experiments by a method which was at the time a new one , but has been in the meanwhile published by Haberlandt.j It seems to me that Haberlandt 's argument is open to the objection above set forth , and as it is an objection I have tried to meet , my results seem to be worth giving .
My point of view was that if gravitational sensitiveness is a form of contact-irritability ( which must be the case if the pressure of the statoliths on the plasmic membrane is the critical event ) , then it might be possible to intensify the stimulus by vibration .
I hoped , by applying vibration in a vertical plane to a horizontal seedling , to make the starch grains dance on the lateral walls , and by such repeated blows on the protoplasm to produce more active geotropic response .
The experiments were made with seedlings of , and Panicum .
In the earlier trials entire seedlings were used , but they were found difficult to fix horizontally with sufficient accuracy , and I consequently employed cut hypocotyls cemented by means of melted cocoa-fat on cork supports , and kept damp in small metal boxes , each containing a strip of wet filter-paper .
The vibration was supplied by means of a tuning fork driven by an electric escapement .
The fork was fixed in a horizontal plane so that the vibration was vertical .
The amplitude of the vibration varied in different parts of the fork from 4 mm. to less than a millimetre .
The rate was about 47 vibrations per second .
The general plan of the experiments was to attach a pair of metal boxes , one to each limb of the fork , each box containing four to six seedlings fixed approximately horizontal .
Control boxes were placed on a support a few centimetres from the fork .
It was found essential to insure an identical temperature for the experimental and control plants .
The fork is set in motion and the experimental plants sub# Haberlandt , 4 PriDgslieim 's Jahrbucher/ 1903 , p. 472 .

[ Mar. 6 , jected to vibration for about 8\#151 ; 20 minutes .
The control and experimental boxes are then placed on a klinostat to avoid further gravitational stimulus , and the angular curvature estimated after a few hours .
The general result is clear , viz. , that the plants subjected to vibration are more strongly curved .
In other words , that vibration increases the gravitational stimulus .
Precautions and Sources of Error .
In performing the experiment it is necessary to take scrupulous care that the control and experimental plants receive similar treatment .
In the case of both it is necessary to cement the plants into their boxes without allowing any possibility of geotropism being induced before the boxes are fixed to the tuning fork .
In all the later experiments the plants were cemented into their places vertically and received no gravitational stimulus until horizontal on the fork , or on the place prepared for the control plants , as the case might be .
Any error arising for the want of this precaution in the -earlier experiments was equally divided between the experimental and control plants .
The most serious source of doubt and error is the tendency in the grass seedlings to nutate in various directions ; all that can be said is that the error in question is equally applicable to the experimental and control plants .
Sorghum saccharatum is especially liable to nutation , and had to be discarded as material .
A theoretical source of error arises from the fact that the movement of a vibrating rod being part of a curve there must be a generation of centrifugal force parallel to the rod and towards its free end .
If the force were sufficient it would cause a displacement of the starch in the cotyledons of the grass seedlings , and this would affect those seedlings whose apices were directed towards the free end of the vibrating rod , precisely as if they were in an oblique position , the apices being downward .
Now this position is known* to be more favourable to geotropism than horizontality , therefore the plants on the vibrating rod could not be fairly compared with the motionless specimens .
But we were unable to see any displacement of starch in seedlings exposed for short periods to the vibration of the tuning fork .
By a rough method I estimated the centrifugal force in my experiments as about 02 g. This is a force quite sufficient to affect the starch grains , if enough time is allowed ; but it is hard to believe that for periods of 8\#151 ; 20 minutes it could have any serious effect .
However this may be , I avoided , in the later experiments , all possible favouring of the experimental plants , by placing them with their apices towards the base of * Czapek , 1 Pringsheim 's Jahrbudier , * yol .

In this case any acceleration in the line of the fork would be in favour of the " still " specimens .
Table I requires a few words of explanation .
The third column gives the number of the experiment and simply refers to the original notes .
The next column gives the time in minutes during which the plants were left horizontal .
Then follow the temperature and the length of time during which the plants were left on the klinostat .
When two readings occur under this column it means , of course , that the curvature was measured more than once : thus in experiment 74 the curvature was read after 4 hours ' rotation , and again after 6h .
33m .
from the time at which the plants were originally placed on the klinostat .
The column " Shaken " gives the angular deviation from the horizontal of the plants which had been on the fork ; their average curvature follows in a separate column .
The last two columns give in the same way the actual observations and the average for the control plants .
For the sake of brevity we use the terms " Shaken " and " Still " for the experimental and control plants .
In columns " Shaken and " Still " the letter x occurs occasionally in brackets , thus ( ) : this means that nutation downwai'ds or sideways had occurred .
In the same way ( 5 ) indicates a downward or lateral nutation of 5 ' .
In striking averages , I have counted the nutating specimens and also those which showed no geotropism , i.e. , remained horizontal .
Thus , if the readings were 13 , 15 ( ) 17 , the average would 11-3 : or if it had been 13 , 15 , 0 , 17 , the average would have been the same-When the cases of nutation were very frequent , or where the curvature occurred very slowly , as in experiments 131 , 140 , I have omitted the average curvature from consideration , although I have allowed the readings to remain in the table .
The first thing that strikes one is that the shaken specimens show a greater curvature than the still ones in a large majority of cases .
Thus , taking the whole of the thirty cases in which the average curvatures are calculated , we have :\#151 ; Shaken , curvature greater in ... ... ... . .
25 cases .

] TheStatolitli-theory In three of the experiments ( 102 , 109 , 111 ) readings were taken before the plants were placed on the klinostat , and these readings are omitted in summing up the results :\#151 ; Curvature of shaken plants greater ... 7 cases , , still , , , , ... 4 Shaken , equal still ... ... ... ... . .
1 Thus there is a majority of wins in favour of the shaken plants , though it is not nearly so striking as in the geotropic experiments .
When the amount of curvature is taken into consideration , the result is decisive :\#151 ; Still .
Shaken .
Sum of averages 259*9 273*9 or as 100 105*4 The conclusion at which I arrive is that vibration does not materially increase heliotropic curvature , whereas it does increase geotropism .
The following figures show in round numbers the difference between the geotropic and heliotropic experiments :\#151 ; Geotropic Curvature .

100 105 The inference I draw from this result is the same as that of Haberlandt , viz. , that the increased geotropism of the shaken specimens is due to the increased stimulus produced by the vibration of the starch grains on the protoplasm of the lateral walls of the cells .
I desire to express my thanks to Miss Pertz , and to my assistant Mr. Elborn , for much valuable help .
