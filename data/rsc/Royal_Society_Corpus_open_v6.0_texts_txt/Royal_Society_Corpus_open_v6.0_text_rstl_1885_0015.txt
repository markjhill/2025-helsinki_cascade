herefore ( S6 ) This gives V , the velocity of translation .
The first equation is or Another equation between is found from the fact that the volume of the core is constant , i. e. , ( 7 ) volume say therefore Write Then ( 37 ) To find , we must take account of one order higher and the terms in .
This gives another equation , which , with the previous ones , will be sufficient to determine them .
As we do not require them for our present purposes we shall postpone their consideration to another occasion .
It remains to discuss the results already obtained , , the three expressions , which give , and the relation between and the 's .
The formulae are , writing for CCLXXXV .
