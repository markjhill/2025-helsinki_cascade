A paper was read , entitled , " An Account of the Construction and Verification of the Imperial Standard Yard for the Royal Society .
" By Captain Henry Kater , F.R.S. The scale of the standard , of which an account is given in this paper , is constructed in a manner described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1830 .
The support is of brass 40 inches long , 17.5 inches wide , and 0.6 of an inch in thickness .
A brass plate seven-hundredths of an inch thick was made toslide freely upon the support in a dove-tail groove formed by two side plates , and was then fixed to the support by a screw passing through its middle .
This plate carries the divisions , which are fine dots upon gold discs let into the brass ; the scale is divided into inches , and there is one inch to the left of zero , which is subdivided into tenths .
The scale is the work of Mr. Dollond .
The paper is concluded by an account of the precautions which were taken to ensure the accuracy of the plane surface on which the bar rested , while the comparisons were made with the microscopic apparatus described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1821 .
The results are given in a table .
