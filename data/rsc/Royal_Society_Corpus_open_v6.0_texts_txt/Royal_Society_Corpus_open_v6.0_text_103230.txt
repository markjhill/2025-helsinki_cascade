An Account of an Experiment touching the different Densities of the Air , from the greatest Natural Heat , to the greatest Natural Cold in this Climate .
By Mr. Fr. Hauksbee , F. R. S. I Took a Glass Tube about 2 Feet in length , and near two tenths Diameter ; which at about 6 Inches from one end , I bent in form of a Syphon , as represented by the Figure : at whose end , which was farthest distant A A from the Angle , I cemented on a Brass Screw with a small Perforation in it ; by which means , when I put a little Quicksilver into the shorter Leg , I could by declining the Tube , or longest Leg , bring it to rest any where ; as suppose at A A. the superfluous Air within passing the premention 'd Perforation .
Then screwing a Cap on it , the Mercury was detained in the same Place , and possessed in length about half an Inch .
In this manner it was conveyed into a Wooden Trough , with a Thermometer : Then putting in as much warm Water as would cover its Ball , the Syphon lying at Bottom in an Horizontal Position , its shorter Leg appearing above the Water , ( which was purposely so contrived to prevent any Inconvenience that might arise by the Waters getting into it , and to give a free liberty for the pressure of the outward Air to exercise its full power .
) When the Spirit of Wine had ascended by the heat of the Water into its small Ball on top , which I thought was necessary , that I might make my Observations with the more exactness upon its Descent ; supposing by that time it should fall to the Degree designed to begin at , that the Spirit in the Ball , would have received an equal Degree of heat in all its Parts .
Accordingly I began my Observations , when it had descended to 130 Degrees above the Freezing Point ; at which time , I found the length of the Column of Air , from the closed end of the Syphon , to the nearest Surface of the Quicksilver , to be just 144 tenths of of Inches .
After the Spirit had descended 10 Degrees lower , the Air , which before possessed 144 Parts , lacked one of them now ; and so on successively at every 10 Degrees descent of the Spirit , the Column of the contained Air was lessened in its length one exact tenth .
When it had descended to 30 Degrees above the Freezing Point , the Air was found to possess but 134 of the prementioned Parts : So that from hence it will be easy to conclude , that at the Freezing Point , the Air in the Syphon would be reduced to 3 tenths less than the last Observation .
And consequently at 50 Degrees below the Freezing Point , ( which I am informed is the greatest degree of Cold that has happened in our Climate .
) it would be reduced to 126 Parts of the whole , and in that state would be one eighth more dense than when at the greatest Degree of our Natural Heat : and the Reason why I could not prove this latter part by Experiment was , that when I came to expose the Thermometer and Syphon in the open Air , or Freezing Mixture , the Syphon would instantly stantly receive the Impression of the Cold , and the Air contained in it be considerably contracted , before the Thermometer gave any sign of such Alteration .
But seeing the former part of the Experiment succeeded so exactly regular , I think there can be no doubt of the truth of the whole Calculation , which yet I do not see how better to be performed .
I shall add a Table of the different Degrees of the Airs density at every 10 Degrees , from 130 above the Freezing Point , to 50 Degrees below it .
This Experiment was made February the 11th , 1708 ; the Mercury in the Barometer at the same time standing at 30 Inches Degrees .

This Table shows the Difference of the Airs Density at every 10 Degrees , from 130 above the Freezing Point , to 50 below it .
As supposing the Spirit in the Thermometer should stand at 40 Degrees above the Freezing Point ; I find right against it in the third Column ~ : Its State being then so much more dense than when the Spirit is elevated to 130 Degrees .
And so of all the rest .
The 2d Column shows the extent of the Air at the several Stations , from the Greatest Heat , to the Greatest Cold .
