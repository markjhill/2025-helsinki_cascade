] The author , in this paper , first recapitulates the results obtained by him in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1822 ; by which it appears that the secreted fluids of animals are so deranged , by dividing the nerves of the secreting organs , as to be incapable of performing their functions ; but that they may be restored to their former powers by transmitting voltaic electricity through the secreting organs by the portion of the divided nerves attached to them .
In this paper , the functions of the stomach were chiefly considered ; in the present , he proposes to consider those of the lungs .
When the nerves of the 8th pair , supplying the lungs , are divided , the animal breathes with difficulty , and speedily dies of suffocation .
If the lungs be examined after death , their cells are found so completely filled with a viscid fluid , as to obliterate them entirely , as well as the air tubes .
They sink in water ; and from a description by Mr. Cutler , which is stated by Dr. Philip at length , it appears that they are rendered impermeable to injections .
The author then states , on his own testimony and that of various other gentlemen who have witnessed the fact , that if the due degree of voltaic electricity be transmitted through the lungs by those portions of the nerves which remain attached to them , no affection of the breathing supervenes , and the lungs after death are found quite healthy , unless the electricity has been applied of such power , or for so long a time , as to cause inflammation ; in which case , the appearances on dissection are those of inflammation , and not those produced by mere division of the nerves .
