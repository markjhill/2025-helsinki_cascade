Of late years many careful determinations have been made of the dielectric constants of water and ice by different observers .
These evaluations may be divided into two classes .
Firstly , those which are , strictly speaking , determinations of the specific inductive capacity of the material , and have been made by measuring the change in the capacity of a condenser when water or ice is substituted for air as the dielectric .
Secondly , those which are really measurements of the electrical refractive index of water or ice for electric waves of various lengths , and which have been generally made by obtaining the reduction in wave-length experienced by an electric wave on passing from air into water or ice .
The square of this refractive index or the ratio of wave-length reduction is then taken as the dielectric constant .
In order that results thus recently obtained may be compared , we have collected into two tables ( I and II ) some of the values for the specific inductive capacity , and the electric refractive index of water for waves of various lengths .
The determinations of the specific inductive capacity quoted all appear to have been made by methods which , whilst excluding , or believed to exclude , error arising from the conductivity of the water , may yet be regarded as giving the value corresponding to comparatively slow reversals of electromotive force or to waves of infinite wave-length .
The electric refractive index observations have been made by using electric waves of lengths in air varying from 8 mm. to 600 cm .
Two very careful determinations of the specific inductive capacity of water seem to be those of W. Nernst ( 80'0 at 17 ' C. ) and F. Heerwagen ( = 80'88 at 17 ' C. ) , and that of J. F. Small is in close agreement with that of Nernst .
As regards the electrical refractive index , it will be seen that the determinations of P. Drude for waves of 70 cm .
, which give / a = 8'95 , and hence / \gt ; ?
\#151 ; 80'2 at 17 ' C. , and those of Cohn and Zee-man , which give j.i = 8-91 and \#151 ; 79'39 , as a mean value for waves from 155 to 560 cm .
in length , are in fairly close agreement with one another , and with the best determinations of specific inductive capacity .

The general results show that the square root of the specific inductive capacity of water as determined by relatively slow-speed electrostatic methods is expressed by a number which is not very different from that which denotes the refractive index of water for electrical waves varying in length from 8 mm. to 600 cm .
Maxwell 's law is , therefore , fulfilled in the case of water under these conditions .
The general evidence at disposal does not indicate any very marked dispersive power on the part of water for electric waves varying in length between the above-named limits ; though the careful results of P. Drude in 1896 , for waves from 40 to 200 cm .
in length , taken by themselves , indicate a slight normal dispersion , the refractive index increasing with decreasing wave-length .
Change of temperature has a marked effect upon the electrical refractive index , and conclusions cannot be drawn , therefore , from the comparison of observations not made at the same temperature .
There is , however , no such good agreement between the results of these two classes of physical measurement in the case of ice .

Constant of Ice and A lcohol at very Low Temperatures .
5 M. E. Bouty ( ' Journal de Physique , ' 3 S. , vol. 1 , 1892 , p. 454 ) found by a slow-speed method a value of 78'8 for the specific inductive capacity of ice at \#151 ; 23 ' C. and upwards , whilst R. Blondlot ( ' Count .
Bend .
, vol. 119 , 1894 , pp. 595\#151 ; 597 ) , using electric waves and measuring the wave-lengths in air and in ice , found 1*41 for the electric refractive index of ice , and hence the number 2'0 as the value of the dielectric constant of ice at a temperature not stated , but presumably not far below 0 ' C. Also A. Perrott ( ' Count .

C. B. Thwing , working with electric resonance , and therefore very rapid reversals , gives ( ' Zeits .
Phys. Chem. , ' vol. 14,1894 , pp. 286\#151 ; 300 ) 3-36 at \#151 ; 2 ' and 2'85 at \#151 ; 5 ' C. as values for the dielectric constant of ice .
It seemed desirable to endeavour to throw light on the reasons for these differences by an examination of the dielectric constant of ice at very low temperatures.* We have accordingly applied the method and apparatus used by us in the latest determinations of the dielectric constant of liquid oxygenf for the purpose of making an examination of the dielectric constant of ice and frozen ethyl alcohol .
A condenser was constructed consisting of three very thin concentric brass tubes about 20 cm .
in length .
The extreme outer and inner tubes , having diameters of 3*74 and 3 cm .
' respectively , were connected together metallically at the bottom , and formed one plate of the condenser .
An intermediate brass cylinder 337 cm .
in diameter was suspended between the inner and outer tubes , thus forming the other plate of the condenser .
This last plate was insulated and suspended from the others by providing it with small wire attachments , which were passed through the holes in six glass beads wedged in between the inner and outer connected cylinders at the top and bottom as shown in fig. 1 .
This condenser was contained in another brass cylinder closed at the bottom , and then had its dielectric formed of ice by filling the annular space between the cylinders with distilled water and freezing it .
The terminal wires from this condenser were connected to a rapid contact maker driven by an * 2sote added February 15 , 1897 .
Since this Paper was presented a communication lias been made to the Royal Society by Dr. J. Hopkinson and Mr. E. Wilson , in which they describe experiments on the dielectric constant of ice .
These authors find that the specific inductive capacity of ice , when measured with electromotive force reversals having a period of from 1/ 100 to 1/ 10 of a second , is a number of the order of 80 , but if measured with periods such as 1/ 10\#174 ; of a second it is a number less than 3 .
The difference they ascribe to residual charge .
Hence it is clear that these observations are in accord with those of Bouty and Blondlot .

electrically controlled tuning fork .
The tuning fork used made 124 complete vibrations a second , and was made , by means of a mercury cap and steel stylus dipping into it , to close an electrical circuit 124 times every second , and thus drive synchronously an electro-magnetic contact maker , which placed one terminal of the condenser alternately in connection with a battery of fifty lithanode secondary cells , and with a sensitive galvanometer .
The other terminals of the battery , galvanometer and condenser , were connected together .
In this way the galvanometer was traversed by a rapid series of electric charges , which have all the effect of a continuous current .
The galvanometer deflection remains perfectly steady as long as the battery voltage is unaltered .
Other things remaining the same , the galvanometer deflection measures the capacity of the condenser .
In employing this method , the galvanometer may be arranged so as to be affected by the series of discharges of the condenser , or it may be placed so as to be traversed by the series of charges of the condenser .
If the condenser has any sensible leakage or dielectric conductivity Constant of Ice and Alcohol at very Low Temperatures .
7 this will show itself by making the galvanometer readings in the two cases unequal .
Mr. Petavel , who assisted us in these observations , and to whom our thanks are due , arranged a convenient switching device which enabled the galvanometer to have its position in the circuits instantly changed to take either the charge currents or the discharge currents of the condenser , and the equality of these readings is taken as an indication that no sensible leakage takes place across the dielectric during the passage of the contact maker from one stop to the other .
This method of exchanging the position of the galvanometer also eliminates errors due to the setting of the scale , as the deflections are on opposite sides of the zero .
The above-described arrangements having been made , the ice condenser was cooled down to the temperature of liquid air by immersing it in the liquefied gas contained in a large vacuum vessel .
In order to take the temperature of the condenser a platinum wire resistance thermometer was placed in the inside of the inner cylinder and in close contact with it .
The ice having been reduced in temperature to \#151 ; 185 ' C. , or \#151 ; 198 ' platinum temperature , the capacity of the condenser was measured .
The condenser was then raised out of the liquid air and allowed to warm up very slowly , and its capacity taken at lauous stages as the temperature rose .
Before and after the experiment with the ice the capacity of the condenser was taken when the metal cylinders were at the temperature of \#151 ; 185 ' , but the dielectric was gaseous air at that temperature instead of ice , and the results so obtained enabled the dielectric constant of the ice to be calculated .
Ihese experiments being to a considerable extent preliminary experiments , and intended merely to explore the ground , we do not make any particular claim for the accuracy of the numbers as determinations of a physical constant .
We are arranging improved methods for repeating the whole of these measurements .
All we desired in the first instance to do was to examine the mode in which the dielectric constant varied with temperature and its approximate magnitude at each temperature .
The following Table III shows the observed value of the dielectric constant of ice between \#151 ; 185 ' C. ( 198 pk ) and about 120 ' ( \#151 ; 130 ' pt .
) .
The voltage used on the condenser was 24-1 volts , and kept perfectly constant during the whole time .
In order to ascertain if the galvanometer deflection was really due to the sequence of capacity charges or discharges only , and not to any measurable admixture of conduction current through the ice , a resistance of 1,000 to 90,000 ohms was occasionally insei ted in the galvanometer circuit , and the absence of any observed change m the galvanometer deflection was taken as a proof that sensible conduction did not interfere with the true capacity effect .
The galvanometer used had a resistance of 500 ohms .

The above numerical results are plotted out in a curve in fig. 2 .
They show clearly that the dielectric constant of the ice increases progressively from a value of about 2"8 to 11'6 between the limits of __198 ' and ___131 ' pt .
Moreover , the trend of the curve shows that at the absolute zero the dielectric constant of the ice would probably not be far from 2*0 .
With the above arrangements we were not able , partly for want of time and partly because of the very moderate frequency of the tuning-fork , to take the dielectric constant at higher temperature , but this we hope to do before long , and also to examine the effect of varying the frequency of the contact maker .

12 _ Variation , of the JPieUclric Conslanf of f c e with TrmJ^praf Temperature in Platinum degrees .
The broacl general result which emerges from these experiments is that at a temperature of \#151 ; 185 ' C. we find a value for the dielectric constant for ice , when using relatively very slow reversals of electromotive force , which is not very different from that found by observers using reversals of many millions per second by the use of electiical oscillations or waves , when working at temperatures of 0 ' C. or a little below .
C. B. Thwing ( 'Zeits .
Phys. Chem. , ' vol. 14 , 1894 ) , using an electrical resonance method , has examined the variation of the dielectric constant of water with temperatures from 0 ' C. to 88 ' C. , and found a maximum value of 85'2 at or near the temperature of maximum density of water .
It seems therefore to be a matter of some importance to measure the dielectric constant of ice at all temperatures from the lowest which can be reached up to 0 ' C. , using various frequencies of alternating electromotive force , and to explore the mode of variation of the dielectric constant with temperature and with frequency throughout this range .
The point which especially needs to be cleared up is whether the dielectric constant of ice is , or is not , more changed by 10 Profs .
J. Dewar and J. A. Fleming .
On the Dielectric change of frequency of the electromotive force than is the case with water .
It appears certain that as far as water at 0 C. is concerned , the dielectric constant and the square of the electric refractive index is a number not far from 80 , for waves having wave-lengths between 8 mm. and infinity , or for electromotive force reversals having frequencies varying from 37'5 X 109 to zero .
On the other hand , the values found for ice at or a little below 0 ' C. seem to indicate a dielectric constant of 78 , when using very slow oscillations ; and a value of about 2-0 when using oscillations having a frequency of some millions per second .
It is clear that in this matter there is still room for further investigation .
It is evident , since the optical refractive index of water is a nnmber lying'between 1*3 and 1*4 for waves having a wave-length of 000005 cm .
or reversals having a frequency of \#151 ; 400 X1012 to 700 X1012 , that water may be regarded as presenting the phenomenon of anomalous dispersion beyond the range of the visible spectrum , because the refractive index for waves of ' a length of 0 8 cm .
and upwards is a number not far removed from 8'9 , and this number is very much greater than that for wave-lengths of the order of visible light .
Within the octave of wave-lengths comprising visible light the refractive index of water lies between 1*3 and 1 4 .
We know very little about the refractive index of water for the fourteen octaves of radiation lying beyond the extreme red end of the spectrum , but we know that water has very considerable absorptive power for a large range of this radiation .
The next ten octaves beyond the last , include the range of the Hertz radiation or of wave-lengths from \#163 ; to 500 cm .
in length , and for all this the refractive index of water is approximately 8'9 .
It remains to be seen how the high value is connected with the low one , and whether this variation may be properly regarded as a case of anomalous dispersion analogous to that found in the case of an alcoholic solution of fuchsine within the range of the visible spectrum .
It is evident that since the dielectric constant of any one substance , such as ice-water , is a function both of temperature and time , it can best be represented geometrically by a surface , which may be called the dielectric surface , and which is defined by the co-ordinates representing dielectric constant , temperature , and frequency of electromotive force reversals .
The details of two determinations of the dielectric constant of ice at \#151 ; 185 ' 0 .
are given in Table IV .
The same readings were obtained both with 90,000 ohms and 1,000 ohms in the galvanometer circuit .
The above figures of observation require two corrections to be applied .
In the first place , the pins which support the inner con-denser plate , and which pass through glass beads , have a total area Constant of Icc and Alcohol at vcvy Low Lcmpcvatuves .

In order to determine this last capacity the brass condenser had its capacity taken at 20 ' C. , air being the dielectric , and then it was cooled in liquid air and then lifted out into the cold gaseous air at a temperature of -185 ' 0 .
, lying above the liquid air , and in this condition the same readings taken .

On Dielectric The difference between the mean galvanometer readings , viz. , 8 31 and 8'39 , in the two last cases , is due to the fact that the condenser-capacity is changed by the cooling , owing to the fact that the plates contract .
The actual difference due to the temperature of the air changing from 20 ' C. to -185 ' C. is very much smaller , and does not sensibly0 affect the capacity as far as the accuracy of the present : correction which needs to be applied , the leads and of the contact maker .
Experiment showed that this was equivalent to 4'15 mm. deflection of the galvanometer , and hence the amount has to be deducted from all mean galvanometer readings .
The final result then is as follows-:\#151 ; The specific inductive capacity , K , of the ice at 185 C. is very nearly equal to the ratio of ( 22-917\#151 ; 0'07\#151 ; 0'415 ) to ( 8-39\#151 ; 0-07\#151 ; 0415 ) , or K = 2"83 .
The correction 007 is the correction for the capacity of the glass separators , which is equal to 5x017 = 0-85 per cent , of the total capacity , and hence the remanent capacity of the condenser is 8'39\#151 ; 8-39 x 0-0085 = 8-39\#151 ; 0-07 .
The correction 0-415 is the correction for the capacity of the contact maker and leads .
A second determination was made at a lower voltage , the details of which are as follows in Table VII .

Mean voltage = 50'5 .
Galvanometer deflection corrected for capacity of glass separators and also of contact breaker , and reduced to correspond to a voltage of lOl'l = 24665 .
Since the corrected capacity of the condenser when at \#151 ; 185 ' C. and filled with gaseous air at \#151 ; 185 ' C. is represented by the number 7-905 = 8 39\#151 ; 0-07 \#151 ; 0-415 , we have for the dielectric constant of solid alcohol at \#151 ; 185 ' C. the value 24-665/ 7-905 = 3-12 .
In addition to measuring the dielectric constants , the same experimental arrangements enabled us to measure approximately the dielectric resistance of the ice and frozen alcohol at and from the temperature of -185 ' C. , and the following tables give the approximate total resistance of the condenser when the dielectric consisted of these substances and was slowly allowed to heat up from lable IX.\#151 ; Variation in the Resistance of an Ice Condenser heated up from \#151 ; 185 ' C. = \#151 ; 200 ' pt .

-200-0 ' -190-0 -186-5 -168-0 The above numbers cannot be considered as more than moderate approximations , but they are sufficient to show the mode of variation of resistance in the two cases .
, The values for the resistance of the ice and alcohol have been set out in the two curves in figs. 3 and 4 .
These figures show that in the case of the alcohol , as soon as a temperature of \#151 ; 190 ' pt .
is reached the resistance begins to fall with great rapidity or the conductivity to go up . .
In the case of the ice the same rapid increase m conductivity begins to take place at about \#151 ; 90 ' .
We have designed a form of condenser which will enable us to repeat these measurements and free them from some sources of error due to the difference between the contraction of the metal plates ot the condenser and that of the dielectric ; but pending such more accurate measurements the above figures may be taken as showing approximately the course of events when the ice and frozen alcoho are heated up from the temperature of boiling liquid air .
We add two tables , XI and XII , giving some recent determinations of the dielectric constant of the ethyl alcohol the results m Table XII showing that evidence apparently exists of abnormal disConstant of Icc and Alcohol at very Low Tempenatuves .
