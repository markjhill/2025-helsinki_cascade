But since the calorimeter lad slightly risen in temperature , the ice must have been above 80 ' C. From the nature of the experiment , as carried out on the present \#166 ; cale , the weight of the ice which can be dropped into the calorimeter^ jg 0I1ly small , and therefore the rise in temperature is but slight .
But iince a fall in temperature of a much larger amount ought to have been obtained had the ice been at 0 ' , it is considered that the above experiments are conclusive .
Great care was taken , in order to obtain correct temperatures in the calorimeter .
The latter was enclosed in several casings , and the water was allowed to stand in it for several hours before the experiment , so that it might first attain the temperature of the room , whilst the time which elapsed between the readings of the thermometer before and after the ice was dropped in would not be more than from 10 to 15 seconds .
In the course of the next few weeks I intend to make one or two more determinations , and , if possible , on a larger scale .

The Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
Since I had the honour of submitting to the Society papers on the above subjects , " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 279\#151 ; 803 , accurate determinations , by a new method , of the melting points of the substances with which the experiments were made have been described by Mr. Carnelley .
He finds that the melting point of iodide of silver , hitherto generally described as " a low red heat , " is 527 ' C. ; of the bromide of silver 427 ' C. ; and of the chloride 451 ' C. These numbers are in all cases higher than those which I adopted , and I have , consequently , recalculated those portions of the results which are affected by the new determinations , and they are given in the following table .
The volume of the chloride and bromide at \#151 ; 60 ' C. has been taken as unity for better comparison with the iodide , which , according to Fizeau , possesses its maximum volume at that temperature .
It will be remembered that the iodide of silver in cooling from its melting point contracts like ordinary solids until it reaches a temperature of 142 ' C. , at which point it possesses its maximum density , it then suddenly expands to a volume greater than that which it possesses at the fusing point , and continues to expand as the temperature diminishes .

The Chloro-brom-iodides of Silver .
Hr .
Carnelley has been so good as to determine for me , by his new method , the melting points of the five chloro-brom-iodides of silver [ escribed in my former paper ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 292 ) , knd the resnlts have been recalculated in accordance therewith .
By eference to the accompanying table , it will be seen that the fusing boint of No. 1 is 44 ' C. lower than that of its most easily fusible constituent , and 144 ' 0 .
lower than that of the least easily fusible constituent .
The lowering is most conspicuous in No. 3 , the fusing point being 101 ' C. lower than that of bromide of silver , which constitutes nearly one-quarter of its weight , and 201 ' 0 .
lower than that bf iodide of silver , which constitutes more than half its weight .
lAgain , in No. 4 it will be seen that the melting point is 147 ' 0 .
lower than of iodide of silver , which constitutes nearly three-fourths of its weight .
[ We may notice , moreover , the following points :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) No. 1 , containing the smallest quantity of iodide of silver , is almost unaffected by it .
It closely resembles bromide of silver , save that a very slight contraction takes place between 125'5 C. and 1310,5 C. ; and the orange-coloured powder furnished by pulverisation turns green on exposure to light .
In No. 3 , which contains a little more than half its weight of iodide of silver , we find the lowest melting point ; the highest specific gravity ; the greatest divergence in every respect from the properties of its constituents , although the Influence of the iodide is very marked , both in the plasticity of the substance above 250 ' C. , and in the considerable contraction which takes place between 124 ' C. and 133 ' C. In No. 5 the influence of the iodide is most marked , and in some respects the substance resembles its principal constituent .
( 2 .
) Let ns note , moreover , that the fusing points diminish from 1 to 3 , and increase from 3 to 5 ; while the specific gravities diminish on both sides of No. 3 .
( 3 .
) In No. 1 , in spite of the presence of the iodide , the coefficients of expansion above 131*5 and below 125*5 are higher than those of any of its constituents .
Again , in spite of the presence of such expansible bodies as the chloride and bromide of silver , the amount of contraction undergone by some of the chloro-brom-iodides , on heating between 124 ' C. and 133 ' C. , exceeds that of the iodide itself .
The case becomes one of great complexity .
Take the most distinctive of the chloro-brom-iodides , No. 3 .
Between 0 ' 0 .
and 124 ' C. , any mass of a hundred molecules consists of 58 which are undergoing slight contraction , and 42 which are undergoing rapid expansion .
Rapid contraction takes place with the iodide alone at 142 ' C. ; here ifc commences 18 ' C. lower , and while it takes place in the case of 58 Composition in 100 parts :\#151 ; Iodide of silver ... ... ... ... .

( Abstract .
) In this communication is described an investigation of various of the conditions of the above phenomena .
The phenomena have been found to be purely physical except in those cases where the electricity was of too high tension and produced electrolysis , and in those in which the solution acted chemically upon the mercury .
The influence of the kind and strength of numerous solutions was examined , including those of various salts of neutral , alkaline , and sacid reaction , and of various acids , and the results are described .
Of the salts , some gave anomalous results ; alkaline cyanides , for instance , reversed the direction of the movements of the mercury .
Inferior conducting liquids , such as aqueous ammonia , gave feeble movements .
Good conducting solutions , such as neutral salts of the alkalies , potassic cyanide , and dilute sulphuric and phosphoric acids , yielded strong movements .
Both the kind and the degree of dilution of the various substances had great influence upon the results .
By examining the question of the influence of the relative dimensions of the mercurial surfaces it was found that no such influence existed , simply because one surface of liquid metal with a suitable solution was alone sufficient .
Attempts were made , but without success , to obtain the same movements of two aqueous solutions instead of mercury and a watery liquid .
Other effects , of apparent movement , \amp ; c. ( described in a separate communication , see " Influence of Voltaic Currents on the Diffusion of Liquids , " ( ante , p. 250 ) , were obtained .
; The question as to whether the movements were wholly due to alteration of volume of the mercury was also investigated , and the conclusion arrived at was , that while a very minute alteration of volume did occur , nearly the whole of the movement was due to other causes .
The influence of adhesion was freely examined , and the hypothesis proposed that the motion is primarily due to a direct mechanical action at the immediate surfaces of contact of the mercury and solution , VOL. xxxi .
