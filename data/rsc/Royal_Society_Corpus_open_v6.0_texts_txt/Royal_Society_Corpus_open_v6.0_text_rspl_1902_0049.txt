Pressure Coefficients of Hydrogen and Helium .
The pressure coefficients have been determined by measuring the pressures which the gases exert when the bulb of the thermometer is in melting ice , or in steam at the boiling point .
Full details of the method employed are given in the paper of which this is an abstract .
The principal new features of the method are as follows The gases were introduced into a glass bulb sealed to a capillary glass stem , which was in turn sealed at the other end to the tube which formed the " dead space " ; thus eliminating any chance of leakage of the gas , which must necessarily occur when steel tubes , connected to the glass by cementj are employed .
The mercury in the dead space was brought close to , but not into contact with , a point in the dead space , and the pressure on the gas in the thermometer was directly observed by measuring the height of the mercury in an exhausted manometer tube above the mercury in the dead space ; the apparatus was so arranged that the two mercury menisci lay on the same vertical axis .
The mercury column and the dead space were enclosed between two parallel glass plates in a water-jacket , the temperature of which could be maintained constant , by means of a rapid current of water , to within 0-02 ' C. Inequalities in the temperature of the mercury column and dead space , to which the largest errors in such measurements are due , were thus eliminated .
The scale which formed the first surface of the water-jacket was certainly correct to 0'01 mm. The distances between the surfaces of the mercury menisci and the nearest division of the scale were measured by means of a telescope with an ocular micrometer placed at a 1902 .

485 distance of one metre from the apparatus .
By this means it was possible to obtain readings concordant to O'Ol mm. In calculating the pressure , corrections were made for capillarity , taking into consideration the height of each meniscus , which was measured at each observation , and for the temperature of the column .
The volume of the dead space , which varied with the distance of ' the mercury in it from the point , and with the height of the meniscus , and the expansion of the bulb with the change of temperature and pressure between 0 ' and 100 ' C. , were taken into consideration in making the final calculations .
In determining the value of the coefficients , the pressures P0 and P100 , which the gas would exert , supposing the whole of it was at the temperature of melting ice or of saturated steam under normal pressure , were first calculated .
Each of the values of P0 or of Pi00 given in the following table , is the result of four consecutive measurements of the pressure , temperature , etc. Pressure Coefficient of Hydrogen .

[ June 19 , We have thus three determinations of the pressure coefficient of hydrogen at an initial pressure of 700 mm. , to the third of which , since it is the result of one measurement of P0 and one of P10o , and was only carried out to make certain that our instrument was in good working order before determining the pressure coefficient for helium , we attach less weight than to the remaining values .
The results of the two experiments with helium are of equal value , each being the result of two determinations of Po and three determinations of P100 .
The mean values of the pressure coefficient for both hydrogen and helium appear to approach 0'00366255 , a number which agrees very closely with the value obtained by Chappuis ( 000366254 ) , and is somewhat lower than that given by Onnes ( 00036627 ) as his final result , though differing little from one of his three actual measurements ( 0'0036625 ) .
The values of the coefficients at lower initial pressures , do not show the same concordance as those at higher pressure , but they tend to show that at very low pressures the pressure coefficient does not assume a lower limiting value , the reciprocal of which should be the melting point of ice on the absolute scale of temperature .
That helium and hydrogen have the same pressure coefficient , and that the coefficient is independent of the pressure , suggest that whatever correction may be necessary to reduce temperatures between 0 ' and 100 ' C. on the scale of the hydrogen or helium constant-volume thermometer to temperatures on the absolute scale , it must be very small .
Further study of the thermodynamic properties of these gases is necessary for the solution of this important problem .
Part II.\#151 ; By M. W. Travers , G. Senter , and A. Jaquerod .
Vapour Pressures of Liquid Oxygen .
As has been shown in Part I , the coefficients of increase of pressure at constant volume for hydrogen and helium , between 0 ' and 100 ' C. , have the same value , viz. , 0'00366255 or l/ 273-03 .
Numerous measurements of the boiling points and vapour pressures of liquid oxygen on the constant volume hydrogen scale have been made by previous investigators .
The values obtained differ by two or three degrees , and even the fnost reliable measurements vary between - 182'-4 and - 182'*7 C. In very few cases are any experimental details given in the original papers ; in most cases it is even impossible to ascertain what value was taken for the coefficient of expansion of hydrogen .
In every case , however , it appears that the measurements were made by immersing the thermometer in a mass of liquid oxygen , and measuring the pressure under which the liquid was evaporating .
As is shown in our paper , it is extremely difficult to maintain liquid oxygen in a steady state of ebullition , and unless a rapid current 1902.1 On the Measurement of Temperature .
487 of air or oxygen is passed into the liquid it ceases to boil , and may become superheated to the extent of more than one degree .
Further , it is very difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity of pure oxygen for such a measurement .
In our experiments a bulb in which a small quantity of pure oxygen could be liquefied was immersed together with the thermometer bulb in a vacuum-vessel containing liquid air or oxygen , through which a fairly rapid current of air was passed , The bulb containing the pure oxygen communicated with the lower chamber of a barometer , so that the measurements of the vapour pressure were quite independent of the atmospheric pressure , with a mercury pump , and with an apparatus for generating pure oxygen from potassium permanganate .
Simultaneous readings of this barometer and of the thermometer , which contained hydrogen or helium , gave the vapour pressures of pure oxygen at temperatures which could be varied between 80 ' and 90 ' Abs .
, according as the vacuum vessel surrounding the thermometer bulb , \amp ; c. , contained freshly made liquid air or nearly pure oxygen .
Four thermometers were employed in these measurements , the capacities of the bulbs being approximately 90 c.c. , 12 c.c. , 26 c.c. , and 27 c.c. Only one single set of measurements on the hydrogen scale were made with the large thermometer , which was the same instrument as was employed in the determination of the pressure coefficients of the gases , for though it was possible to observe a steady temperature by means of it with a degree of accuracy approaching 1 part in 20,000 , it was found impossible to maintain so large a thermometer bulb at a constant and uniforin temperature , without employing very large masses of liquid oxygen .
The results obtained by means of this thermometer differ only by 0*1 ' from the mean of those obtained by means of the three smaller thermometers .
The temperatures observed by means of the three smaller thermometers rarely differ by more than 0-03 ' from the temperature , corresponding to the same pressures , taken from the smoothed vapour pressure curve .
The form of the thermometers employed in this research , and in the measurements of the vapour pressures of liquid hydrogen , was practically the same as that described in the previous abstract ; full details are given in the paper .
The pressure on the gas in the thermometer was directly observed by means of a manometer attached to the apparatus , and was independent of the atmospheric pressure .
The temperature of the dead space and mercury column were determined by means of mercury thermometers , and the mean temperature of the vertical portion of the stem immediately above the bulb was measured by means of an auxiliary gas thermometer , with a cylindrical bulb of the same length as that portion of the stem of which the temperature is uncertain .

[ June 19 , bulbs were made was determined by measuring the contraction of the inner tube of a vacuum vessel , 1000 mm. long , when filled with liquid air .
The coefficient between 0 ' and 100 ' had been found to be 0-0000284 ; between 0 ' and - 190 ' it was 0-0000218 .
The pure hydrogen and helium employed in the thermometric measurements was prepared by methods which are described in the next paper , Part III , Appendices II and III .
The results of our measurements show that with constant volume thermometers , in which the pressure at the melting point of ice is about 1000 mm. , the temperatures between 80 ' and 90 ' Abs .
on the helium scale are 0'-l higher than on the hydrogen scale .
Olszewski obtained identical readings on the two thermometers .
This may be accounted for by the fact that he employed helium from cl^vite which had only been purified by sparking with oxygen , and which possibly contained a trace of argon or other impurity .
Our helium was probably quite pure , as it had been passed through a coil cooled to 15 ' Abs .
in liquid hydrogen , and was therefore a more perfect thermometric substance than that employed by Olszewski .
This result is further discussed in the full paper .

Vapour Pressures of Liquid Hydrogen .
The liquid hydrogen employed in these investigations was obtained by a method devised by one of us two years ago , and described in the 'Philosophical Magazine , ' 1901 , vol. 17 , p. 412 .
About 400 c.c. of liquid hydrogen was employed in each of the seven sets of experiments , of which the following are the results .
After filling the gasometer with hydrogen , and collecting the quantity of liquid air ( 8 litres ) necessary to cool the apparatus , this quantity of liquid hydrogen can be obtained in half an hour from the moment at which the operations are commenced .
Our experience has shown us that when liquid hydrogen is once obtained , it is much more convenient to 1902 .

489 manipulate than liquid air .
As its latent heat of vaporisation is very high , little loss is entailed through cooling apparatus , previously cooled in liquid air , to its boiling point .
Further , the liquid shows no tendency to become superheated , and boils steadily , even under reduced pressure .
Dewar* has obtained the following values for the boiling point of hydrogen on the constant-volume hydrogen scale : -253'*03 , -253'-37 , -252'-81 , -250'*35 ; the pressure on the gas at the ice-point being 287 mm. , 270 mm. , 739 mm. , and 127 mm. respectively .
On the scale of a thermometer filled with helium containing 7 per cent , of neon , at a pressure corresponding to 728 mm. of mercury at the ice-point , he found the temperature to be 252'*68 and 252'*84 C. In calculating the temperatures on both thermometers he employed Chappuis ' coefficient of expansion for hydrogen , 0*00366254 .
In our experiments we have employed the three small thermometers which we used to determine the boiling point and vapour pressures of liquid oxygen .
The thermometers were filled with pure hydrogen or helium , obtained by the methods described in Appendices II and III to this paper .
The small bulb communicating with a manometer , which had in the former experiments contained pure liquid oxygen for the measurement of the vapour pressure , contained , in these experiments , pure hydrogen from palladium .
This method of measuring thejvapour pressure was essential to the accuracy of the experiments , for it appeared that the vapour pressure of the pure hydrogen , and of the hydrogen in the vacuum vessel surrounding the thermometer , always differed slightly , probably owing to the presence of impurities dissolved in the latter .
The agreement between the results obtained with different thermometers containing different samples of gas is indicated in the following table :\#151 ; I. Hydrogen Scale .

[ June 19 , and on the helium scale between the boiling point and a pressure of 50 mm. , by a method which is described in detail in the full paper .
The temperatures on the helium and hydrogen scales were found to differ to a greater extent than at the temperature of liquid oxygen .
The difference , as the following table shows , is from 0'T9 to 0'-21 over the range of temperature investigated .
Considering that the critical point of hydrogen lies about 35 ' Abs .
, while that of helium is probably in the neighbourhood of 10 ' Abs .
, this difference is not surprising .

Pure helium is most readily obtained from clevite gas , which appears to contain only helium , argon , and a trace of krypton .
The gas used in our experiments was passed through a glass coil immersed in liquid hydrogen boiling under normal pressure in one case ( thermometer A ) , and under a pressure of 110 mm. of mercury in another ( thermometers B and C ) .
This helium was probably very pure .
