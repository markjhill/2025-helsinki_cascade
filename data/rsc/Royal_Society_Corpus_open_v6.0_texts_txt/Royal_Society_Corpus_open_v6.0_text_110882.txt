" On Benzoline , a new organic Salt-base obtained from Oil of Bitter Almonds .
" By George Fownes , Esq. , F.R.S. Pure oil of bitter almonds is converted , by the action of a strong solution of ammonia , into a solid white substance having a crystalline form , and which was termed by M. Laurent hydrobenzamide .
The author found that this substance , by the further action of alkalies , became harder and less fusible than before , and not differing in chemical composition from the original substance , but exhibiting the properties of an organic salt-base .
To this substance the author gives the name of benzoline .
He finds that the salts which it forms by combination with acids are , in general , remarkable for their sparing solubility ; and that many of them , as the hydrochlorate , the nitrate and the sulphate , are crystallizable .
Of the properties of these salts the author gives a detailed account .
