) There is very special interest in searching among the Archaean rocks for minerals showing a high ratio of helium to radioactive matter .
It is here that we might expect to find the strongest evidence that this method of enquiry can afford for the antiquity of the globe : nor is the expectation falsified by results .
Archaean rocks , from their crystalline nature , afford much more choice of minerals than do the fossiliferous formations .
A conspicuous example of large helium ratio is already known in thorianite .
Several other examples have , however , been brought to light by the present experiments , which show a higher ratio than this substance .
I select the most striking of these by way of illustration .
The minerals in question come from crystalline rocks in various parts of the world .
Only those from Norway and from North America are , as far as I know , proved by definite evidence to underlie the older fossiliferous formations .
In the other cases it is only on general grounds that the same order of antiquity can be presumed .
In striking contrast to the sphenes from Archaean rocks is a sample from the recent volcanic rocks of the Laacher See ( No. 1 on list ) .
These are the only sphenes I have examined .
The extreme antiquity indicated by the measurements is about 700 million years for Archaean rocks .
It must not be forgotten that this is a minimum .
There is one point which requires special discussion .
In a paper published in the ' Proceedings , ' !
I showed that the mineral beryl contained a quantity of helium out of all proportion to its radioactive content .
The alternative explanations are\#151 ; ( 1 ) Beryl might be supposed much older than any other mineral examined .
Although the rocks in which beryl occurs are not in general easily dated geologically , this supposition has little plausibility , the more so that many beryls from different localities have shown the same feature .
( 2 ) A much more plausible explanation , suggested to me by Dr. Boltwood , * For previous papers , see 'Roy .

f In former measurements on this mineral the radium was much over-estimated , presumably owing to accidental contamination .
Thus the remarkable character of the result was much understated , The Accumulation of Helium in Geological Time .

is as follows:\#151 ; Beryl is a substance of extremely peculiar composition .
Its crystallisation from the rock magma , which can only contain beryllia at a great dilution , is a process hard to understand , and one about which it would be rash to dogmatise .
It is , however , permissible to imagine that one of the longer , lived radioactive products , say radium , ionium , or radiothorium , which we know also to be present in the magma , might also be separated by this peculiar crystallisation , in a relatively concentrated form .
In a few thousand years such a constituent of the beryl would have lost its activity , and nothing but the helium to which it had given birth would remain recognisable .
If this view is accepted , the question will no doubt be asked , What \#166 ; evidence is there that a similar process has not gone on in the other cases , such as zircon , sphene , or thorianite , relied upon to give a minimum estimate of the age of the rocks in which they occur ?
It can only be replied\#151 ; ( 1 ) Such minerals show a close connection between the helium ratio and the geological age.* As regards sphene , the above table shows the results obtained from a sphene of late tertiary date , which shows a helium ratio quite insignificant compared with any of the numerous Archaean specimens examined .
( 2 ) The helium content in cases other than beryl is in close relation to the amount of radioactive matter now present , the ratio being , for instance , of the same order for thorianite as for Archaean sphene and .zircon ; while the former is a thousand times more active than the latter .
