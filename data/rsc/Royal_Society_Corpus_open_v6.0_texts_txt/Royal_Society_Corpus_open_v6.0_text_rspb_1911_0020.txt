) A characteristic feature of malignant growths is the occurrence of degeneration , usually in the more central portions of the growth .
It is therefore possible that antibodies might make their appearance in the blood plasma in respect of the dead material thus set free .
The presence of such antibodies could be sought for in several ways , , for example , by observing if any of the insoluble constituents of the tumour could be agglutinated or caused to dissolve , or any of the soluble constituents obtainable from the growth could be precipitated , by the blood serum of the host .
There is , however , another way of testing for .
the production of such antibodies , namely , by observing if .
the serum when mixed with the tumour , or with a watery or alcoholic extract of the tumour , can fix complement .
In this case the method followed , is an application of the observation of Bordet , * that an immune serum contains a thermostable substance ( amboceptor or immune body ) , which when mixed with the antigen which has been employed to determine its production is capable of absorbing complement .
So far as I can ascertain from a search of the literature of complement deviation , no investigation on these lines has , up to the present , been made in connection with malignant growths .
It was , therefore , decided to test for the presence of antibodies in respect of malignant growths , using in the first instance the method of complement fixation .
For the purpose of investigation carcinoma of the mouse appeared exceedingly suitable , since it affords a condition which is readily producible and represents a single pathological entity , the same strain of tumour being inoculable from animal to animal so long as may be desired .
Only under such circumstances is it possible to make a comparative series of observations under conditions of experiment which are throughout identical in respect of the tumour employed .
These experiments fall into two groups : those in which complement of the rabbit or of man was employed ; those in which the complement of the mouse was used .

[ Dec. 5 , Experiments in which the Complement Employed was that Present in the Serum of the Babbit or of Man .
Method.\#151 ; The haemolytic system selected consisted ( 1 ) of the red blood cells of the rabbit , employed in a 2J-per-cent .
suspension in 0-85-per-cent , sodium chloride solution ; ( 2 ) of immune body derived from the serum of the rat ; and ( 3 ) of complement contained in human blood serum or that of the rabbit .
The rat providing the immune serum had been previously inoculated intraperitoneally on three occasions at intervals of 10 to 14 days , receiving each time about 0'3 gramme of the red blood cells of the rabbit , previously washed in 0-85-per-cent , solution of sodium chloride .
Before being used the serum was inactivated by heating to 57 ' C. for one hour .
The haemolytic power of the serum of the rat varied with different animals ; that used in the experiments recorded in the tables was capable of completely haemolysing , in one and a-half hours , at a temperature of 37 ' C. , four to five times its volume of the red blood suspension employed .
In sensibilising the red blood cells of the rabbit one part of serum was added to one part of the red blood cell suspension , and the mixture allowed to stand at 37 ' C. with occasional shaking , for one hour and a-half .
A slight degree of agglutination of the red blood cells took place on the addition of the inactivated serum of the rat , but this did not give rise to any difficulty .
A further slight increase in the degree of agglutination occurred when human blood serum was subsequently added ; this did not occur , however , if the blood serum of the rabbit was employed as the source of complement , for which reason in most of the experiments the latter was used .
The amount of serum obtained from the rat varied from 0'5 c.c. to 2 c.c. ; on keeping this serum a precipitate of proteid sometimes slowly separated out .
The above haemolytic system was chosen chiefly because the animals employed in its preparation are readily obtainable and can be kept in a laboratory .
As antigen , an alcoholic extract of mouse tumour was prepared by addiug 90 c.c. of absolute alcohol to 19 grm. of tumour .
The procedure adopted was as follows:\#151 ; The tumour was placed in a mortar , together with the alcohol , and was then converted into as fine a pulp as possible .
After standing at room temperature for six days , with occasional shaking , the alcoholic liquid was poured off and filtered .
For use in the experiments recorded below , one part of the alcoholic extract was added to five parts of 0-85-per-cent , solution of sodium chloride .
The alcoholic extract was floated on to the top of the solution of sodium chloride , and , after standing for about five minutes , admixture was completed by shaking the tube , when a very turbid liquid , free from precipitate , resulted .

] Complement Deviation in Mouse Carcinoma .
Serum was obtained from mice affected with mouse tumour by killing these animals with ether , exposing the heart with antiseptic precautions , puncturing the right ventricle with a sterilised glass pipette provided with a capillary point which was pushed into the right auricle .
With the aid of a rubber teat blood was sucked into the pipette and transferred to a sterilised centrifugal tube , in which it was allowed to coagulate .
The latter was then centrifugalised , the supernatant serum pipetted off , and inactivated by heat as above described .
The amount of serum obtained from the mouse ranged from 0T c.c. to 03 c.c. For use in control experiments , serum was obtained by the same procedure from normal mice .
The sera were not employed for experiment until the lapse of 24 hours after inactivation .
Owing to the small amount of serum obtainable from the mouse , it was necessary to deal with very small quantities of the fluids used for experiment .
To this end capillary pipettes were prepared , which were graduated in hundredths of a c.c. , and were capable of delivering amounts as small as 0'003 c.c. to OOOl c.c. The graduation of the pipettes was effected by determining the diameter of the capillary portion with the aid of a microscope provided with an eyepiece micrometer .
From this the sectional area of the capillary tube was determined , and the length corresponding to any desired number of cubic millimetres calculated .
The tubes were so selected that the length corresponding to 0 01 c.c. was from 1 cm .
to 2 cm .
The mixtures of fluids employed in Tables I to IY were preserved in small tubes of about 5 mm. internal diameter .
The actual testing was carried out in the following way :\#151 ; In the first place a number of tubes were prepared containing sensibilised red cells .
To this end , into each tube 0-02 c.c. of the inactivated serum of a rat into which the red blood cells of the rabbit had been injected as above described was placed , and then 002 c.c. of the suspension of the red blood cells of the rabbit , the mixture being kept at 37 ' C. , with occasional shaking , for one hour and a-half .
At the end of this time the fluid part of the mixture was removed by means of a capillary pipette from the red cells which had been allowed to fall to the bottom of the tube .
The tubes containing sensibilised red cells were now arranged in four groups ( cf. Tables I to IY ) .
To the tubes in each group complement was added in amounts ranging from O'OOl c.c. to 0081 c.c. To each of the tubes of the first group 0*06 c.c. of a 0'85-per-cent .
sodium chloride solution was added , so as to make the volume of lluid in each tube equal to that in the corresponding tubes of the other groups .
In this group the haemolytic power of varying quantities of complement was exhibited .
To each of the tubes of the second group 003 c.c. of sodium chloride solution and 0*03 c.c. of tumour Dr. J. O. W. Barratt .
[ Dec. 5 , extract was added .
This group exhibited the effect of tumour extract in fixing a relatively small amount of complement .
Sodium chloride was replaced in the third group by inactivated normal serum of the mouse , and in the fourth group by inactivated serum obtained from a mouse with a tumour .
In both the latter groups a further and more considerable fixation of complement took place , and a comparison of the two enabled the effect of mouse carcinoma upon complement fixation to be determined .
Experimental Results.\#151 ; When a complement deviation test , as above described , is applied to the serum of a mouse inoculated with mouse tumour , a positive reaction is obtained in some cases , in others a negative reaction is observed .
The course of a positive reaction is exhibited in Tables I to IY , which will now be considered .
In Table I the action on sensibilised red blood cells of healthy human serum obtained a few hours before use is exhibited .
An exceedingly slight degree of laking was produced by OOOl c.c. of this serum , and it may be added that half this quantity produced no laking recognisable to the naked eye at the end of 90 minutes ; ( hOCKI c.c. and larger amounts of human serum produced complete haemolysis within this period of time .
When active normal rabbit 's serum was employed instead of human serum in the experiments given in this and the following tables , the degree of the resulting haemolysis was slightly lowered .

quantities dealt with , it is not possible to recognise a slight degree of laking , and , in particular , it is not possible to determine quantitatively the degree to which the red cells are laked , as is possible when large amounts of cells and fluid are available .
When tumour extract was added at 37 ' C. to human serum in the amounts given in Table II , and after the lapse of an hour and a-half the mixtures were transferred to tubes containing sensibilised red blood cells , laking took place slightly , but distinctly less readily , the first tube remaining free from laking , and the second tube presenting , instead of complete laking at the end of 90 minutes , only a slight degree of laking , which was slow in appearing .
In the remaining tubes rapid and complete laking occurred .
It follows , therefore , that the antigen is of itself capable of fixing a certain amount of the complement contained in the human serum employed .

] Complement Deviation in Mouse Carcinoma .
3-65 90 minutes in the third tube , while the rate and degree of haemolysis-occurring in the fourth tube were also reduced , and in the fifth tube haemolysis , though not prevented , was retarded .
It must also be observed that the actual increase of complement in passing from the third to the fourth tube is considerably greater than that between the second and third tubes , owing to the circumstance that the quantities employed have been selected so as to form a geometrical progression , the amount of complement contained in each tube being three times that contained in the preceding tube .
By adding equal increments of complement to the tubes , the difference between the last two series becomes more obvious , but as the number of tubes made up cannot be conveniently increased , it is necessary to reduce the range over which the investigation extends .
In this , as in the previous series , no considerable change occurred on keeping the tubes at room temperature ( 14 ' C. to 17 ' C. ) for a further period of 18 hours .
In making the last two series of experiments , recorded in Tables III and IV , serum was obtained on the preceding day from a normal mouse and from a mouse with a tumour ; both sera were sterilised at the same time , and were kept , as already mentioned , for 24 hours before use .
Haemolysis in these experiments proceeds slowly .
The quantities dealt with being very small , it is not possible to attempt to discover the formula representing the reaction velocity or to ascertain the end equilibrium .
It isr however , clear that it is not at present permissible to treat the reaction as a stoichiometric one , and to represent in terms of red blood cells the quantities of complement fixed .
This is well exhibited in Table IV , Experiment 5 , in which it is seen that the reaction rate is retarded , though if the reaction were simply stoichiometric this should not occur , owing to the much greater amount of complement in tube 5 as compared with tube 4 .
A better means of comparison would presumably be afforded by the determination of the reaction constants .
In the observations recorded above , it was found , on comparing the third and fourth series ( Tables III and IY ) , that the degree of haemolysis occurring when serum obtained from a mouse with a tumour was employed was less in degree , and proceeded more slowly , than when the serum of a healthy mouse-was used .
In other words , during the period of experiment , more complement was fixed with the former serum than with the latter .
This result was not , however , always observed .
Sometimes the rate and degree of haemolysis were not appreciably different in the two series ; the weight of the tumour of the mouse furnishing the former serum in these cases amounted to-from about one-sixth to one-quarter or more of the total body weight .
The mimber of experiments so far made does not furnish many data bearing upon Dr. J. O. W. Barratt .
[ Dec. 5 , the cause of this difference in respect of complement fixation .
It would be expected that the degree of fixation would be likely to be marked when the tumour was considerably degenerated .
In the earlier experiments the condition of the tumour in this respect was not noted .
In the last five experiments , however , attention was paid to the condition of the tumour , and deviation was found to be increased when marked degeneration was present ( two cases ) , but was unaltered when degeneration was slight in rapidly growing tumours ( three cases ) .
Experiments in which the Complement employed was that Present in the Serum of the Mouse .
Exception may be taken to the experiments already described on the ground that there is no direct proof that the complement employed fits the amboceptor of the autotoxin for which search has been made .
There is , however , indirect proof that this is so , since the complement employed is fixed by the amboceptor in the presence of antigen contained in the tumour extract .
As , however , the degree of complement fixation observed in the preceding experiments was slight , it was decided , in view of the importance of the issues involved , to repeat these experiments in a form in which this objection was avoided , namely , by employing as complement that present in the normal serum of the mouse .
Method.\#151 ; The lines along which this investigation proceeded are as follows : The first stage was to discover a suitable source of red blood cells , preferably one for which the serum of the mouse normally possessed a haemolysin .
The action of the normal serum of the mouse upon several easily obtainable varieties of red blood cells was tested , with the results given in Table Y. The red cells employed were those of the rabbit , guinea-pig , rat , man , and goat .
It will be seen that the degree of haemolysis obtainable with these red cells was much less than that ordinarily occurring when a haemolytic serum prepared by injecting red cells intraperitoneally is employed .
When the different varieties of red cells are compared it is seen that those of the rabbit were haemolysed far more readily than any of the other forms employed .
The red blood cells of the rabbit were therefore selected as the most convenient to employ for testing for deviation of the complement of the mouse .
The haemolysin in question in normal serum of the mouse is present in relatively small amount .
Subsequent observations showed that the amount normally present was occasionally considerably less than that indicated in Table V. Complement Deviation Mouse Carcinoma .

It was also necessary that the amount of serum obtained should be enough for an extended series of observations .
To this end 23 mice received intraperitoneally injections of the red blood cells of the rabbit in the following amounts:\#151 ; 0*005 c.c. of red cells on the 1st day .
0*01 " " 3rd " 0 02 " " 4th " Nineteen of these mice still surviving were killed with ether on the 18th day , and immediately after death blood removed with aseptic precautions from the right ventricle of each by means of a glass pipette .
The sera thus obtained were mixed together and the haemolytic power of the mixture upon the red blood cells of the rabbit determined .
The results obtained are given in Table YI .

In sensibilising the red blood cells of the rabbit with this serum , after inactivation , when testing for complement in the experiments described below , twice this minimum amount was employed , the time allowed for sensibilising at 37 ' C. being one hour .
The method pursued in the further course of these experiments was so similar to that followed in the preceding section that no additional description of technique employed is required .

0*054 The complement fixation power of the mouse tumour extract was tested with normal mouse serum as the source of complement .
At first a series of observations was made in which varying amounts of tumour extract were mixed with a definite amount of normal mouse serum , and after keeping for one hour at 37 ' C. added to sensibilised red blood cells of the rabbit ( the serum employed for sensibilising the red cells being pipetted off before adding the mixture of normal mouse serum and tumour extract ) .
This series is given in Table VII .
It will be seen that with normal mouse A 0009 c.c. of tumour extract fixed the greater part of the complement contained in O'Ol c.c. of the normal active serum of the mouse .
This was the usual result , but in the case of some mice , as B in the same table , the tumour extract fixed much less complement .
A second series of experiments , similar to the preceding but with the addition of varying amounts of inactivated normal mouse serum , was now made .
The results are given in Table VIII .
The amount of complement contained in O'Ol c.c. of active normal mouse serum was nearly completely fixed by OOl c.c. of mouse tumour extract in the presence of O'Ol c.c. of inactivated normal serum .
This , it will be observed , does not differ markedly from the action of mouse tumour extract acting alone , exhibited in Table VII .
If , however , the two series of experiments are carried out simultaneously , the same active mouse serum being employed in both , it is 1910 .

As in the experiments described in the preceding section , it is again not evident that a stoichiometric relationship exists between complement and amboceptor or between amboceptor and antigen .
In view of the above results it became evident that , in testing the relative amount of complement fixation effected by mouse tumour extract in the presence of inactivated mouse serum obtained respectively from normal mice and from mice with tumours , the most convenient amount of inactivated normal mouse serum ( having regard to the small scale on which these experiments must of necessity be made ) would be 0*005 c.c. to 0*01 c.c. and that 0*025 c.c. of tumour extract would contain much more antigen than would be required for the amboceptor ( corresponding to the antigen ) contained in this serum .

serum to be employed would of course be the same as that of the inactivated normal mouse serum .
The amount of active normal mouse serum employed as source of complement ranged from O02 c.c. to 0-06 c.c. Table IX.\#151 ; Complement Fixation by Amboceptor of inactivated Normal Mouse Serum in presence of an excess of Tumour Extract .

In Table X , a series of observations of this character is given .
It is seen that when a comparison is made between the tubes in which inactivated tumour mouse serum was employed ( 7 to 9 , 10 to 12 , 13 to 15 ) , and those in which inactivated normal mouse serum was used ( 4 to 6 ) , the amount of complement fixation was distinctly greater in the former than in the latter .
It is true that the difference in fixation is not profound , but it is nevertheless unmistakable .
It must also be remembered that the amboceptor corresponding to the antigen is partly contained in the active normal serum employed , and that , in consequence of this , the difference between the two inactivated sera in respect of amboceptor is rendered less evident .

Experiments of the kind recorded in Table X were repeated with the same and with other tumour mice sera .
Altogether , the sera obtained from six mice with well developed tumours were employed , and in each case two complement fixation tests were made .
With one exception , all the tests gave a similar positive result such as is shown in Table X. The exception occurred when the observation made with the serum of Tumour Mouse 1 was repeated ; in this case 1310 .
