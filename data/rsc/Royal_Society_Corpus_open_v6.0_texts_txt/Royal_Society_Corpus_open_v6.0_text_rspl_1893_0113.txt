[ Mar. 2 , found , as in the copper wire , that there was no permanent alteration unless there was permanent stretching .
Hitherto the results on specific resistance have been given by all investigators on this subject , except Lord Kelvin , in volume units , but , as the alteration in density is in every case very small , the results obtained in the present investigation are in very good agreement with those of former experimenters .
The conclusions arrived at are that for practical purposes any mechanical treatment , however severe , does not affect the electrical properties of the metals tested .
As contrasted with this , it is interesting to note that the smallest impurity in the metal produces a greater change than the most severe mechanical treatment .
For example , an impurity of -f per cent , lowers the electrical conductivity by 13*5 per cent , while an impurity of \#163 ; per cent , lowers it as much as 30 per cent. III .
