A paper was read , entitled , " On the construction and use of Single Achromatic Eye-Pieces , and their superiority to the double eye-piece of Huyghens .
" By the Rev. J. B. Read , M.A. , F.R.S. The author observes , that experience has shown it to be impracticable to make a telescope even approach to achromatism , by employ ?
ing the same object-glass with an astronomical , as with a terrestrial eye-piece : for if the focus of the blue rays from the object-glass be thrown forwards , as it must be in order to make it impingc upon the focus of the blue rays of the terrestrial eye-glass , then there will be produced a great over-correction for the astronomical eye-glass ; and vice versa .
Hence it appears that the application of Iluyghenian eye-pieces to refracting telescopes , is incompatible with the conditions of achromatism , throughout the entire range of magni ?
fying power ; and that in reflecting telescopes they unavoidably introduce dispersion , because they are not in themselves achromatic .
These defects the author proposes wholly to obviate , by substituting for the Huyghenian eye-pieces , single achromatic lenses of corresponding magnifying power ; consisting of the well-known combina ?
tion of the crown-lens , and its correcting flint-lens , having their ad~ jacent surfaces cemented together ; thus avoiding internal reflections , and enabling them to act as a single lens .
The achromatic eye-pieces which he uses were made by Messrs. Tulley and Ross , and are of the description usually termed single cemented triples .
