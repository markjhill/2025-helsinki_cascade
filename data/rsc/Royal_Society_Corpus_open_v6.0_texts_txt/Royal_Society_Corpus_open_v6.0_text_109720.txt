On the Rectification of the Hyperbola by Means of Two Ellipses ; proving that Method to be circuitous , and such as requires much more Calculation than is requisite by an appropriate Theorem : in which Process a new Theorem for the Rectification of that Curve is discovered .
To which are added some further Observations on the Rectification of the Hyperbola : among which the great Advantage of descending Series over ascending Series , in many cases , is clearly shown ; and several Methods are given for computing the constant Quantity by which those Series differ from each other .

] The present communication is designed by the author as an appendix to his former paper on the same subject , printed in our Transactions for 1802 .
Although he acknowledges the ingenuity of Mr. John Landen , who devised the rectification of the hyperbola by means of two ellipses , and adds his tribute of applause to that which has been bestowed upon it by the most eminent mathematicians of the Continent , as well as of our own country , Mr. Hellins is nevertheless of opinion , that it is more to be admired as curious than practically useful ; since it is circuitous , and requires much more calculation than will be found requisite by the theorem , which is the primary subject of this paper .
Mr. Hellins also adds some further observations on the rectification of the hyperbola , and shows the great advantage of descending series over ascending series , in many cases , and gives several methods of computing the constant quantity by which those series differ from each other .
