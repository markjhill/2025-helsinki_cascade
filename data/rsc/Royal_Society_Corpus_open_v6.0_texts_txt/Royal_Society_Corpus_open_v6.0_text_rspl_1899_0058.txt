spectrum and the solar spectrum taken at Kensington , the silieium line apparently agrees better in position with the less refrangible edge of the solar line than with the middle .
Before this point can be definitely settled , still larger dispersion will have to be employed .
In the paper mentioned , it was shown that silicium made its appearance first at the temperature represented by a TJrsse Minoris , and strengthened at the higher temperature of a Cygni and ( 3 Orionis , , afterwards weakening as we pass through the still higher temperatures-of \#163 ; Tauri and 7 Orionis , until at the \#163 ; Orionis stage it is bordering on extinction .
In the same paper the behaviour of a line at A 4089*2 was plotted , , and at the same time it was quoted as an " unknown " line .
It is interesting to note that this line is now traced to silicium , and is the strongest line in set B. It is apparently a short-lived line in stellar spectra , as it only occurs between the stages of temperature represented by 7 Orionis and \#163 ; Orionis , being one of the weakest lines in the spectrum of the former star , and one of the strongest in that of the latter .
Most of the photographs of the silicium spectrum under varying , conditions were taken by Mr. Butler .
The wave-lengths of the lines , have been reduced by Mr. Baxandall , and he is also responsible for establishing the identity of the terrestrial and the stellar lines .
My thanks are due to him also for help in the preparation of the present communication .

Introduction .
In the year 1881 I communicated a paper* to the Royal Society in which I described some experiments relating to the brightening of some lines in the spectrum of iron on passing from the arc to the spark .
It was found that in the case of iron , the two lines in the visible spectrum at A 4924*1 and A 5018*6 , on Rowland 's scale , were greatly enhanced in brightness , and were very important in solar phenomena .
The work was subsequently carried into the photographic region of the spectrum with very interesting results , since it was found that several other lines were enhanced at the highest temperature I could then obtain .
In a later paper f I described the results obtained in further photo* * Roy .

453 graphic investigations of metals at high temperatures , dealing specially with the spectra of iron , calcium , and magnesium , and more recently still , * I referred to the enhanced lines of other substances , but refrained from giving a list of the wave-lengths of the lines photographed , as the series of comparisons with the large Rowland grating was not then completed .
The important part which the enhanced lines of the elements play in the study of stellar spectra cannot be over-estimated , but a great advance can only be made in this direction by a systematic examination of the spectra of all the elements .
Such an undertaking as this involves considerable time and labour .
I have been fortunate enough to have the use of the large 42-inch Spottiswoode coil for a short space of time , and employed it in this work , for which it is specially adapted , as the brilliancy of its spark shortens the time of exposure .
Although I have previously stated my indebtedness to Mr. Hugh Spottiswoode and Mr. G. Matthey for their assistance , I wish again to express my best thanks to them , and I must now add Professor Moissan and Sir William Crookes , who have kindly supplied me with some specimens of metals .
The elements which have been dealt with in this investigation are the following :\#151 ; " Aluminium , bismuth , chromium , copper , iron , magnesium , manganese , titanium , and vanadium .
" For each of these elements the spark and arc spectra were photographed and compared , and the wave-lengths of the enhanced lines , that is , those lines which are intensified in passing from the temperature of the electric arc to that of the spark , were determined .
v.r Method of Reduction The method of reduction was as follows:\#151 ; The spark spectrum of the element was first compared directly with the spark spectrum of air between platinum poles , and the air lines were thus eliminated .
The spark and arc spectra of the element being taken on different plates , were then compared , and the lines present in the spark spectrum but absent from the arc , or lines relatively more intense in the spark than in the arc spectrum , were noted .
The wave-lengths of these lines were then determined by direct comparison with a solar spectrum taken under the same instrumental conditions , and reference to Rowland 's list of lines in the normal solar spectrum .
Instruments Employed .
The grating used is a 6-inch concave one , having a surface 2 inches by 5f inches , ruled with 14,438 lines to the inch , and a radius of curvature of 21 feet 8^ inches .
The instrument is mounted in the * ' Roy .

455 manner described by Rowland , the camera and grating being at opposite ends of an iron girder adjusted exactly to the radius of curvature of the grating .
It has been found that by carefully making the adjustment the scale can be maintained constant within a very small limit , and the conditions were such that it was possible to use plates 18 inches long without bending .
In some cases a Steinheil prism spectroscope was used .
The dispersion arrangement of this instrument consists of four dense flint prisms , three of 45 ' angle and one of 60 ' .
These are fed by a collimator of fi inches aperture and 18| inches focal length .
The camera objective is a single quartz lens of 2 inches aperture and about 54 inches focal length ( for A. 4340 ) , the non-achromatism of which necessitates a considerable inclination of the photographic plate to the axis of the lens .
The total deviation for the blue region of the spectrum is about 150 ' .
The scale of the spectrum is as follows D\#151 ; F - 2f inches .
P\#151 ; K \#151 ; 61 " The spark conditions were as follows:\#151 ; The Spottiswoode coil is capable of giving a spark 42 inches long in air .
For spectroscopic purposes , however , a condenser is inserted in parallel with the secondary circuit , the length of spark then obtainable depending on the capacity of the particular condenser used .
These have varied from a single gallon jar to a battery of twelve jars of about 15 gallons each , and finally a plate condenser has been used , at the suggestion of Professor Boys .
This consists of thirty sheets of plate glass , 30 inches by 25 inches , with tinfoil , 24 inches by 12 inches , between each pair .
The spark under these conditions varies from about 25 to 2 mm. in length , and this was again further controlled in intensity and duration by a secondary spark gap in series with the one containing the metallic poles .
The primary was fed from the street circuit at 100 volts , the usual current employed being about 25 amperes .
Interruption of the current in the primary was by means of a mercury break actuated by hand .
In the case of the arc , the exposures lasted generally for about fifteen minutes , while an hour and a quarter was the average time given for the spark .
My thanks ' are due to Mr. C. P. Butler , who was employed in taking the photographs , to Mr. F. E. Baxandall , who is responsible for their discussion , and to Dr. Lockyer for assistance in the preparation of this note .
