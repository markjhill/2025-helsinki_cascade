The Royal Society^ Committee of the Kew Observatory , since the issue of the last Report , have lost by the death of Mr. de la Rue a colleague who for nearly forty years had taken a prominent part in the management of the Observatory , and who had long presided over the Committee as their Chairman .
Mr. de la Rue was one of the movst munificent benefactors of the Observatory .
It was at his suggestion that the first photoheliograph was constructed and brought into use under his supervision at the Observatory .
His sound practical judgment and thorough familiarity with scientific operations of all kinds were of constant service to the Committee , and his loss will be greatly felt by them .
Report of the Kew Committee .
I. Magnetic Observations .
No change has been made in the magnetographs during the past year .
The curves representing Declination , Horizontal Force , and Vertical Force variations have been obtained uninterruptedly , and , as in former years , the scale values of all the instruments were determined in the month of January .
The ordinates of the various photographic curves were then ascertained to be as follows :\#151 ; Declination : 1 inch=0 ' 22',04 .
1 cm.=0 ' 8'*7 .
Bifilar , January 15,1889 , for 1 inch 3H = 0*0278 foot grain unit .
" 1 cm .
" = 0*00050 C.G.S. unit .
Balance , January 16,1889 " 1 inch = 0*0285 foot grain unit .
" 1 cm .
" = 0*00052 C.G.S. unit .
The principal magnetic disturbance of the year was recorded on the morning of July 16th ; on July 11th between 10 and 11 p.m. the curves registered the passage of tremors from an earthquake which was experienced in Central Asia .
Observations with the absolute instruments have been made monthly , and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix I of this Report .
The magnetic instruments have been studied , and a knowledge of their manipulation obtained , by Lieutenant W. J. Comb , R.N. , of H.M.S. " Penguin .
" With a view of ensuring accuracy in the tables employed in the reduction of magnetic observations , which have been frequently reprinted for use by observers , a careful examination has been made by Professor G. Carey Foster of all the formulae and blank forms employed in the Kew methods .
He has reported to the Committee that he did not detect any inaccuracy .
A careful examination of the observations of Absolute Declination made at Kew from 1858 to the present date has been made at the request of Professors Thorpe and Rucker , who have been investigating the secular changes of Declination during the interval .
The results have been forwarded to those gentlemen with the object of their embodiment in the paper on the Magnetic Survey of the British Islands now in progress submitted by them to the Royal Society .
In order to examine certain features of the working of the Kew pattern Vertical Force magnetograph instrument , Mr. Charles Chambers , F.R.S. , Director of the Colaba Observatory , Bombay , has been provided by the Indian Government with a new instrument of the same pattern , which has been tested at Kew , and forwarded by the maker , Adie , to Bombay .
Report of the KewCommittee .
Dr. van Rijckevorsel , of Rotterdam , visited the Observatory to redetermine the constants of his instruments , and make observations of the magnetic elements prior to the commencement of a new magnetic survey of Holland and Belgium , which he has undertaken under the auspices of the Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam , so as to connect M. Moureaux 's survey of France with Dr. Neumayer 's survey of Germany .
Dr. van Rijckevorsel selected Kew , Wilhelmshaven , and Paris as his base stations .
Mr. Kitto , Superintendent of the Falmouth Observatory , visited Kew in the spring of the year , to study the methods of constructing tabulating scales for the conversion of the indications of his magnetographs into numerical values , in accordance with the recommendations of the International Commission .
He also took advantage of the visit to become conversant with the use of the transit instrument , one of which has been recently acquired and set up at the observatory under his charge .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of Atmospheric Pressure , Temperature , and Humidity , Wind ( direction and velocity ) , Bright Sunshine , and Rain have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year .
The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records have been duly registered , together with the daily observations in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system .
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix II .
The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly made , and these , as well as copies of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine have been transmitted to th^ Meteorological Office .
The readings of the old 100-inch area square rain gauge have been discontinued since February , the new 8-inch circular gauge being now regularly employed , as a check upon the indications of the Beckley self-recording instrument .
The working standard barometer ( Newman , 34 ) of the Observatory , which has been in use continuously since the date of its erection in 1851 , having become somewhat worn in its mechanism , was dismounted , and the scale and fittings repaired by Negretti and Zambra , without interfering with the tube and cistern , which were retained at the Observatory .
On its return it was again put together and restored to its old place , and fresh comparisons made with the Welsh absolute standards .
These showed that a slight shift had taken place in the position of the zero of the scale , a new determination of the scale error was made and fresh corrections accorc -ingly adopted .
During the period it was under repair the Royal Report of the Kew Committee .
477 Society 's old standard barometer was used in the daily observations .
The barograph and thermograph formerly at work at the Armagh Observatory have been put in thorough repair , and set up in the Verification House awaiting the instructions of the Meteorological Council as to their transmission to the new Observatory now erected at Fort William , Inverness , at the base of Ben Nevis .
It .
is the intention of the Committee controlling the Observatory on the summit of that mountain , to maintain a second establishment near the sea-level for the purpose of working in conjunction with it .
A Beckley rain gauge has been also provided to complete the equipment .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by ' The Times ' and * The Torquay Directory .
' Data have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the editor of ' Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , ' Dr. Rowland , and others .
The cost of these abstracts is borne by the recipients .
Tables of the monthly values of the rainfall and temperature have been regularly sent to the Meteorological Sub-Committee of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club for publication in their Proceedings .
Detailed information of all thunderstorms observed in the neighbourhood during the year has been forwarded to the Royal Meteorological Society soon after their occurrence .
Rlectrograph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in constant action throughout the year , and comparisons with the portable ' electrometer ( White , 53 ) made in March , June , and September show the scale value to have remained unchanged .
III .
Solar Observations .
Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 173 days , and the groups numbered after Schwabe 's method , the results being given in Appendix II , Table IV .
Time Signals.\#151 ; At the suggestion of the Engineer at the Genei'al Post Office , a galvanometer has been fitted to the chronograph in order that the Greenwich time signal may be observed on those occasions when it fails to record itself on the chronogi'aph .
The 10 a.m. signal has only failed on 16 days throughout the year .
On 10 of these days , when it was not received at the usual hour , the later one , at 1 r.M. , was duly forwarded by the Post Office .
The errors of the Greenwich clock on certain selected dates , when some uncertainty existed as to the correctness of the signal received , have been courteously given after application to the Astronomer Royal .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; Solar and sidereal transits have been occasionally observed as a check on the signalled times .
Report of the K Committee .
Violle s Actinometer.\#151 ; The Committee have undertaken at the request of the Meteorological Council to make observations with a pair of Violle 's actinometers .
These consist of two delicate mercurial thermometers encased , the one in a well-blackened hollow metal sphere , the other in the centre of a similar sphere thickly gilded and having a highly polished surface .
They have been suitably mounted , and are taken out on sunny days , placed side by side in the open air , and then alternately exposed to the Solar rays , and shielded from its action , the behaviour of the thermometers being noted .
Up to the present date .
230 observations have been made with them on seven days .
Solar Physics.\#151 ; The Committee have handed over to the Solar Physics Committee , with the view of their utilisation , the collection of Solar Negatives from 1858 to 1872 taken at Cranford and at Kew , as well as a large number of undistributed copies of the papers on Solar Physics by Messrs , de la Rue , Stewart , and Loewy .
IV .
Experimental Work .
Photo-nephograph.\#151 ; As it was found that a much more suitable site was offered by the roof of the new building for the working of the cloud cameras , the pedestal was removed from the position it formerly occupied and set up on gratings placed on the new roof , the necessary alterations being effected in the electrical attachments .
Opportunity was taken at the same time of replacing , by new wire , about 30 yards of the cable which had become damaged during the building operations .
As , however , the question of the most convenient way of utilising the cloud pictures is still under consideration by the Meteorological Council , no photographs have been taken during the past year . .
Pendulum Observations.\#151 ; In November last , the series of pendulum observations at the Observatory , as arranged by General Walker , were successfully carried out , and the apparatus then dismounted and conveyed to the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , where it was set up in the Record Room .
Mr. Hollis was instructed by Mr. Constable , the Kew Observer , in the routine of observing in the manner employed at Kew , but the operations had to be postponed for several months owing to a pressure of other work at the Greenwich Observatory .
The pendulum swings were commenced in June and are now completed , and the results , at both Kew and Greenwich , are being prepared for publication .
Anemometer Constants.\#151 ; With a view of examining into the accuracy of the graduation of the small anemometers or air-meters that are very much employed in measuring draughts and air-currents in mine-shafts , galleries , and similar places , a whirling apparatus was roughly constructed with materials at hand and set up in the Optical Room .
Report of the Kew Committee .
By means of this a number of experiments were made , which afforded satisfactory results , with several Lowne 's air-meters kindly lent by Mr. Casella , the maker .
A more complete whirler has now been constructed , and it is intended to include the examination of these air-meters in the list of operations carried on by the Verification Department .
The electrical anemograph mentioned in the 1886 Report as having been sent to Valencia for erection on that island , was returned to Kew in a somewhat damaged condition after a lengthened trial in a very exposed situation .
Certain defects in its construction which became evident during its stay there have now been corrected , and , after undergoing thorough repair , the instrument has been erected on a suitable staging on the roof of the Observatory , with the intention of submitting it to a rigorous comparison with the Beckley anemograph working at the same level about 14 feet due south of it .
V. Verification of Instruments .
The following magnetic instruments have been purchased on commission and their constants determined:\#151 ; An inclinometer and unifilar magnetometer for U.S. Navy Department , Washington .
An inclinometer for the University of Modena , Italy .
Three magnets for Mauritius .
The total number of other instruments compared in the past year was as follows :\#151 ; Air-meters ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .

38 , , ordinary meteorological ... ... ... 16 Various ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
50 13 Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated , and 6 supplied to different individuals during the year .
There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , 10 Barometers , 850 Thermometers , 50 Hydrometers , and 8 Sextants .
The increase in the number of sextants verified during the past year has been considerable , 292 instruments of that kind having been tested , whereas the greatest number in any previous year has been 157 .
A much larger number of artificial horizons has also passed through the Department , being in nearly all cases flat glass plates set in levelling frames and supplied with spirit levels .
These have been all Hall-marked after examination as to trueness of the surface .
In accordance with the arrangement mentioned in last year 's Report , 440 Navy telescopes and binoculars have been examined and marked for the Admiralty .
Also 33 standard measures of length have been tested for the War Office .
The Committee , having considered the advisability of Hall-marking other instruments besides the thermometers submitted to them for verification , instructed Messrs. R. and J. Beck to construct for them an engraving pantagraph , which has been fitted on the Holtzapffel lathe belonging to the Observatory , By its aid the Navy telescopes , binoculars , and Standard Rules have been successfully engraved with mark and number .
Report of the Kew Committee .
VI .
Rating of Watches .
During the year 528 entries of watches for rating were made .
They were sent for testing in the following classes:\#151 ; For class A , 483 ; class B , 28 ; and class C , 17 .
Of these 119 failed to gain any award ; 15 passed with C , 28 with B , 366 with A certificates , and 21 of the latter obtained the highest , class A especially good .
In Appendix III will be found statements giving the results of trial of the 26 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks during the year , the highest position being attained for the third time by Mr. E. F. Ashley .
His watch was a keyless single roller fuzee , which obtained 89'1 marks out of a possible 100 .
He is very closely followed by Mr. A. E. Fridlander , of Coventry , whose keyless double roller fuzee stands only one-tenth of a mark lower on the list , having gained 89 0 marks .
It is satisfactory to note the general improvement in the performance of the watches sent to the Observatory , the proportion of failures of those submitted for trial being but 22 per cent , against 34 per cent , last year .
The effect is , moreover , seen in a diminution of the number of entries , for makers are more critical as to the performance of their watches during the timing and springing operations than they were before Kew trials were instituted .
No difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the three safes\#151 ; in which the watches are placed during rating\#151 ; at the three temperatures of 40 ' , 65 ' , and 90 ' Faht .
respectively , all the year round .
Special attention continues to be given , as before , to the examination of pocket chronographs , in accordance with the request of the Cyclists ' Union , and the extra tests alluded to in last Report have been regu-larly enforced .
Marine Chronometers.\#151 ; Certificates of mean daily rate and of variations of rate at three different temperatures have been awarded to 10 marine chronometers after undergoing the 35 days ' trial as specified in the regulations VII .
Miscellaneous .
Assistance to Observatories , 8/ c.\#151 ; There have been purchased on commission the following instruments :\#151 ; Sunshine recorders on Jordan 's pattern for the St. Petersburg and Coimbra Observatories ; a low range aneroid for Dr. Lowenherz , of Charlottenburg ; various pieces of apparatus for the Hong Kong and Mauritius Observatories ; and an Ammeter and Voltmeter for Dr. H. Wild , of St. Petersburg .
In accordance with a resolution of the International Meteorological Committee at their Zurich Meeting , a thermometer of very low 482 Report of the Kew Committee .
range lias been constructed to be used as a standard spirit thermometer for comparison with the hydrogen thermometer of the International Office of Weights and Measures at temperatures ranging from zero to about \#151 ; 70 ' C. Prepared photographic paper has been procured and supplied to the Observatories at Aberdeen , Batavia , Colaba , Falmouth , Lisbon , Mauritius , St. Petersburg , and Stonyhurst , as well as to the Meteorological Office .
Anemograph sheets have been sent to Mauritius , and blank forms for entry of observations , \amp ; c. , distributed to various applicants .
Old Mural Quadrant.\#151 ; The Department of Science and Art having accepted the old mural quadrant for exhibition in the science collection at South Kensington , application was made to the Governors of the Armagh Observatory for the telescope and object glass belonging to the instrument , which had been found by Dr. Dreyer in the Armagh collection of astronomical apparatus , forwarded to that Observatory at the time of the abolition of the King 's Observatory at Kew in 1840 .
The Committee 's request having been acceded to , the missing parts were duly received at Kew and forwarded to the Museum Galleriest at South Kensington .
Exhibition.\#151 ; The Committee contributed to the annual exhibition of the Royal Meteorological Society , held in March ( 19-22 ) , several actinometers , solar radiation thermometers , and photometers .
Library.\#151 ; During the year the library has received as presents the publications of\#151 ; 29 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ireland , and 81 Foreign and Colonial Scientific Establishments , as well as numerous private individuals ; The Librarian has been engaged for some time in the preparation of a card catalogue of the library , on the model of that of the Meteorological Office , and has now completed over 1,100 cards , which contain the titles , \amp ; c. , of all works received by the Committee during the past seven years , together with those of a like title which had been received previously .
The publications not yet catalogued formed part of Sir E. Sabine 's Magnetic Office collection , and are chiefly excerpts from foreign publications and reports .
They have generally but little interest , and are being examined with the view of binding such as the Observatory does not possess in other forms , and disposing of the duplicates .
Workshop.\#151 ; The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the Donation Fund have been duly kept in order .
Report of the Ke Committee .
House , tfc.\#151 ; The external walls of the Observatory , as well as the out-houses , have been thoroughly painted .
Book shelves and presses have been fitted to the new rooms , which have also been furnished .
Glazed sashes have been inserted in the West Wing Thermometer Room , in place of the panels which formerly filled the window frame , and new pipes have been fixed for the water supply of the House .

484 Report of the Kew Commit Report of the Kew Committee .
APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. Long. Oh lm 15s !
TV , for the year October 1888 to September 1889 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log jt2K employed in the reduction is 1-64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient fi is 0'000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0'0001194(\#163 ; o\#151 ; 35 ) -j-0*000,000,213(\#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)^ .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1'0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction ( l\#151 ; \#151 ; \ is -0-00205 .
X X ' V r0V In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , has been carefully determined .
The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker .
