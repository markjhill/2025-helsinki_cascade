In a previous communication we have drawn attention to the fact that the power of cell proliferation , which has been proved to occur in an epithelioma of the mouse ( Jensen ) , is a phenomenon unparalleled in the mammalia .
A mass of tumour , 16 lbs. in weight , has been produced by artificially transplanting portions of the original growth and its descendants .
In seeking to throw light on this fact , we have studied carefully the phenomena which follow the transplantations of portions of the tissue to new sites , and have found that the tumours which arise are the genealogical descendants of the cells introduced .
We have studied the growth of the tumours which arise at successive stages of 24 hours .
In a tumour removed on the eighth day , and less than half a split pea in size , conjugation of resting nuclei has been observed .
To take a specific case , the nuclei of two adjacent cells are continuous through the cell wall by a tube-like bridge , in the middle of which a strand of nucleolar substance with fusiform swellings in either cell is visible .
The cells of this particular case are adjacent to .
the stroma , and close to the outer surface of the young tumour .
