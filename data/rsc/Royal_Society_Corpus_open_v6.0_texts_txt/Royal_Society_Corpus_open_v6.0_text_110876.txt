SIR JOHN WILLIAM LUBBOCK , Bart. , V.P. and Treas .
in the Chair .
" An Account of Compact Aluminum .
" By Professor F. Wohler of G6ttingen , in a Letter to Thomas Graham , Esq. Communicated by Thomas Graham , Esq. , F.R.S. The author has lately found , contrary to the results of his former researches on aluminum made eighteen years ago , that this metal is readily fusible , and that in its reduction from the chloride of aluminum by means of potassium , it presents itself in the form of fused globules , generally so small that their shape is not distinguishable under the microscope , although occasionally they are met with having a sensible diameter .
He effects the reduction at once in a clay crucible , the bottom of which he covers with pellets of pure potassium , and places upon these the chloride of ammonium , covering the whole with chloride of potassium in powder .
The crucible being then closed up , and heated in a coal fire , the reduction is instantly effected .
Fused aluminum has the colour and lustre of polished tin ; it continues perfectly white in the air ; it is fully malleable , and the globules may be beaten out into the thinnest plates without cracking at the edges .
It is entirely unmagnetic .
In other respects the metal in this compact state has the properties which the author formerly ascribed to it .
