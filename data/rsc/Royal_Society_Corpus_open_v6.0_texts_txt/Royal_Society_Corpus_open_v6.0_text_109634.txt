] The observations here given were made at Westbury , in Somersetshire , in the years 1800 and 1801 , with a circular instrument of 2 ' feet in diameter , constructed by Mr. Troughton .
The stars selected by our author were , for a period of nearly two years , constantly observed on the meridian , when they passed at a convenient hour , generally reversing the instrument in azimuth at the end of every day 's observation , and never making use of those observations that were not made in pairs .
Mr. Pond has subjoined to his observations a comparison with some procured for him by Mr. Troughton , in which he has included the latest observations made at Greenwich .
The deduced polar distances are also annexed to each observation .
