Some Account of the fossil Remains of an Animal more nearly allied to Fishes than any of the other Classes of Animals .

] The bones here spoken of , are from the cliff between Lyme and Charmouth in Dorsetshire .
The cliff , says the author , is composed of limestone , upon which is a stratum of blue clay two or three feet thick , in which these bones were deposited .
A drawing has been made of these bones to accompany the paper , which supersedes the necessity of a very particular description .
Their magnitude is such , that the head alone measures four feet .
The upper and under jaw are very distinct , set with small conical teeth , as in the crocodile ; but the lower jaw is not articulated as in that animal , but connected by an intermediate flat bone , as in fishes .
The sclerotic coat of the eye is also , as in fish , bony , but is subdivided , as in the eyes of many birds , into a number of separate plates .
The intervertebral cavities of the spine likewise prove , that this skeleton is that of a swimming animal ; since the form of each cavity is that of an oblate oval , much wider in its transverse diameter than in the direction of the spine .
The mode of articulation of the lower jaw , which admits of its being opened to a great extent , seems to show the animal to have been voracious , as would appear also from the structure of the teeth ; but the points in which it differs from any one animal , and resembles others belonging to classes extremely remote , occasion the author to view it , with the singular productions of New South Wales , as one of the connecting links in the creation , formed for the purpose of preventing any void in the chain of imperceptible gradations , from one extreme of animated beings to the other .
