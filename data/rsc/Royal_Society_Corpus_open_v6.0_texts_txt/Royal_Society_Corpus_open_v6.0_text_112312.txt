( Abstract .
) If the sun were a magnet of sufficient power to exert a sensible attraction upon a small magnet at the distance of the earth , it would have a real influence on the earth by inducing magnetism in its soft iron , and an apparent one due to the direct action of the sun upon the magnets used for measuring the earth 's variations of force .
As the earth rotates upon its axis , producing a varying relation , as to position , of the place of observation with respect to the sun , a diurnal variation will thus be produced in the forces which act upon the magnetometers , which variation is shown to follow the simple law x= A sin ( h + a ) , x being the deviation of the magnet from its normal position , h the hour-angle of the sun ( and for a single day ) , Aa constant coefficient , and aa constant angle .
A comparison of this result with the laws of the observed diurnal variations shows that direct and inducing action of the sun is not the sole cause of the variations .
An endeavour is then made to prove that if any part of the observed diurnal variations is due to this cause , it is small in comparison with that produced by other forces in operation .
This is done by separating from the observed variations the part of them which obeys the law x'=B sin ( h+ / ) , and comparing the variations in the values of B and p from month to month with those of A and a , when it is seen that the former obey a law which has but little similarity to the law of variation of the latter .
