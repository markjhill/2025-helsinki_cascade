" On the Limit of Solar and Stellar Light in the Ultra-violet Part of the Spectrum .
" By William Huggins , D.C.L. , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received March 28 , \#151 ; Read April 4 , 1889 .
It has been long known that the solar spectrum stops abruptly , but not quite suddenly , at the ultra-violet end , and much sooner than the spectra of many terrestrial sources of light .
The observations of Cornu , of Hartley , and , quite recently , of Living and Dewar , appear to show that the definite absorption to which the very rapid extinction of the solar spectrum is due , has its seat in the earth 's atmosphere , and not in that of the sun ; and that , consequently , all ex-terrestrial light should be cut off at the same place in the spectrum .
During several years I have attempted to obtain the limit in the ultra-violet for stellar light here , but as it was necessary to make use of a bright star at a high altitude , and at a time when the atmosphere was very clear , it was not until September 20th , 1888 , that I was able to obtain a result which , seemed to me to be satisfactory .
On that night three successive photographs of Vega , with increasing exposures , were taken on the same plate .
The first spectrum was exposed for 10 minutes , the second for 20 minutes , and the third spectrum nearly four times as long , namely , for 70 minutes .
A comparison of the extent of the second spectrum due to an exposure of 20 minutes with that of the third spectrum , to which an exposure of 70 minutes was given , leaves no doubt that the latter spectrum has reached the limit imposed by atmospheric absorption , and has not stopped in consequence of an insufficient exposure of the plate .
134 Dr. W. Huggins .
On the Limit of Solar and Stellar The original plate has been enlarged about four times ; and a spectrum of magnesium and calcium , taken with the same apparatus , and enlarged simultaneously with the plate of stellar spectra , has been placed above to serve as a scale .
As the spectra are prismatic it is not possible to indicate the wavelengths in a scale of equal parts .
A short scale only is placed over the spectrum where the light of Vega ends .
The spectroscope with which the spectra were taken is furnished with a prism of Iceland spar and lenses of rock crystal , and a mirror of speculum metal was used to condense the light of Yega upon the slit .
It will be seen that at my observatory* the light of Yega at about V 3000 is abruptly weakened , and then continues as a very faint line to the point of apparent extinction at X 2970 .
Numerous solar spectra taken here during the last four years with the same spectroscope show an average abrupt weakening at about X 3000 , and an apparent total extinction at about X 2985 .
On two occasions only the very faint weakened spectrum could be traced as far as X 2970 .
The abrupt narrowing of the spectrum at the end towards the red is produced by the rapid falling off of sensitiveness of the silver bromide for light of increasing wave-length .
The increase of breadth of the spectra with increase of duration of exposure is due to the same causes , optical and photographic , which produce the increase of diameter of stellar disks on the photographic plate with longer exposures , when a reflector is used .
At h the breadths of the spectra , having 20 minutes and 70 minutes exposure respectively , are 0'06 inch and 0T05 inch.f In 1879 Cornu| made experiments on the limit of the solar spectrum with reference to the altitude of the place of observation .
On the Riffelberg , at an elevation of 8414 feet , the spectrum reached to \ 2932 , while at the lower elevation of Yiege , 2163 feet , the spectrum stopped at 2954 .
He concludes that the absorption is due to the gaseous constituents , and not to aqueous vapour in the atmosphere .
In 1881S Hartley stated that an amount of ozone proportional to * Elevation of the observatory 177 feet above mean sea level .
Barometer about 30'03 inches at the time of observation .
f The law of increase of size of image with exposure is not as yet accurately defined .
Bond found that the diameter of star-disks varied nearly as the square root of the time of exposure .
Pritchard , using a reflector , found a law near the fourth root ; and Mr. H. H. Turner has recently found a law very near the cube root for plates taken with a photoheliograph object-glass ( 'Astron .

Light in the Ultra-violet part of the Spectrum .
135 the average quantity in a vertical column of the atmosphere , caused an absorption similar to that observed in the solar spectrum , namely , terminating about X 2950 .
Quite receDtly Living and Dewar have made some important experiments on the absorption-spectrum of large masses of oxygen under pressure.* They state that with a tube 165 cm .
long and a pressure of 85 atmos .
, oxygen appeared to be quite transparent for violet and ultra-violet rays up to about X 2745 .
From that point the light gradually diminished , and beyond A. 2664 appeared to be wholly absorbed .
In some later experiments with a steel tube 18 metres long and a pressure of 90 atmos .
, oxygen produced complete absorption above P , i.e. , X 3359-2 .
M. Janssen , from his observations on the Alps , concludes that both the bands which follow the law of the square of the density , and the dark lines obeying a different law of formation , which are due to oxygen in the solar spectrum , are produced exclusively by the earth 's atmosphere\#151 ; u 1/ atmosphere solaire n'intervient pas dans le pheno-mene."t * ' Chemical News , ' vol. 58 , p. 163 , and ' Phil.
