Though the proof of that part of the " Report " j passed under my eyes , the error entirely escaped my attention .
With regard , however , to Professor Owen 's remark that throughout the " Report " the discovery of Lagomys in Brixham Cave is treated as I an original discovery , I have simply to observe that the Report consists of ] one hundred pages , in which about five lines , at most , relate to Lagomys \ spelceus , in two of which the reporter observes , with perfect truth , that " it j has been met with elsewhere in association with Pleistocene mammals .

The statement of this well-known fact is hardly , in the usual sense of words , a claim to " original discovery .

( Abstract .
) These tidal observations were made by Sir Edward Belcher , R.N. , i K.C.B. , on board of H.M.S. ' Assistance , ' in the summer of 1853 .
They are interesting , from the fact that they were made in the highest latitudes in which tidal observations have been ever recorded .
Prom a discussion of the heights and times of high and low water the following partial results have been obtained , which , it is hoped , will be further extended and corrected , by taking into account the height of the water at other phases of the tides .

" On Musical Duodenes , or the Theory of Constructing Instruments with Fixed Tones in Just or Practically Just Intonation .
" By Alexander J. Ellis , F.R.S. , F.S.A. , F.C.P.S. , F.C.P. Received October 28 , 1874 .
This paper is intended to complete and supplement three papers on Music which I have already read before the Royal Society ' .
It contains a more complete theory of temperament , embracing that indicated by Helmholtz2 , but not worked out by him , and its application to the theory of constructing musical instruments with an intonation practically just , without change of fingering , and , if there are three or four performers , without change of mechanism .
The name Duodene refers to that collection of twelve notes , suitable to the present manuals , which is made the unit of construction .
To obtain its precise form , and determine the number and value of all such duodenes as it is necessary to tune , I have been obliged to indicate a theory of harmonic scales and modulation , which I believe to be entirely new , and which has of course other uses .
The great extent of the subject obliges me to confine this part of my paper to a mere indication .
A. Notation of Pitch .
The letters C , D , E , F , G , A , B indicate both musical tones and the number of vibrations made by the prime or lowest partial tone of each in a second ; so that , C being known , D = |C , E=f C , F=|C , G=f C , A = fC , B = MC .
