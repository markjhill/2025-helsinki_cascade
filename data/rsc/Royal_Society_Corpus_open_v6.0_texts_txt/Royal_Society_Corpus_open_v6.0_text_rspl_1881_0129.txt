Scott , F.R.S. Received December 29 , 1881 .
In the concluding pages of No. Ill paper , now in the hands of the Royal Society , I described an apparatus the essential parts of which consist of a wooden gallery about 126 feet long by 2 feet square , and a sheet iron cylinder about 6 feet long by 2 feet in diameter ; and , at the same time , I gave a short general account of the experiments that had been made with it up to that date , intending to resume the subject on some future occasion .
It will be remembered that the experiment was made by mixing together and igniting a small quantity of fire-damp and air in the sheet iron cylinder called the-"explosion chamber " ; that the resulting explosion burst through a paper diaphragm which separated the explosion chamber from the wooden gallery and created an air-wave ; that the air-wave in passing through the gallery swept up coal-dust from the floor and from certain shelves placed at given points in it ; and , lastly , that the flame of the original fire-damp explosion traversed the cloud of coal-dust and air to a greater or less distance from the origin .
During the warm dry weather prevailing between the 14th and 21st of July last , I made sixty-three further experiments , which for convenience may be separated into the three following well-defined groups .
I. Fifteen to ascertain how far the flame of the mixture of firedamp and air contained in the explosion chamber would extend along the wooden gallery in the absence of every trace of coal-dust .
II .
Thirty-eight to ascertain how far the flame produced in the same manner and under the same conditions as in the preceding case would extend into a cloud of coal-dust and pure air , created by the action of the air-wave in its passage through the wooden gallery .
III .
Ten to ascertain the effects due to the explosion of small heaps of blasting powder placed at given points in the wooden gallery , all the other conditions being exactly the same as in the last case .
In each experiment the fire-damp was carefully and accurately measured by water displacement in a , special cylinder called the-measuring cylinder in the two preceding papers .
No fire-damp could enter any part of the apparatus without first passing through the-measuring cylinder , and being thence transferred into the explosion chamber .
As lias been previously stated , also the explosion chamber 438 Mr. W. Galloway .
[ Mar. 23 , was separated from the wooden gallery by certain sheets of paper interposed between them in the form of a diaphragm .
None but sheets without visible flaws were employed for this purpose , and they were inserted in the joint between the wooden gallery and the explosion chamber in such a way that their edges projected into the open air all round about .
Seven minutes or so elapsed from the time the fire-damp was begun to be transferred into the explosion chamber until its mixture with air was ignited .
The largest quantity of firedamp employed in any one of the sixty-three experiments was 1*876 , or say , 2 cubic feet , and if even one-half of this quantity had escaped* there could have been no explosion , as the mixture remaining in the explosion chamber would not have been inflammable .
Admitting , however , for the sake of argument , that , in every case , one cubic foot of fire-damp passed through each sheet of paper in the diaphragm in succession and found its way into the gallery , then its rate of escape would be , say , one-seventh of a cubic foot per minute .
But , during the whole time the first forty-two experiments were in progress , there was a current of fresh air amounting to upwards of 1,000 cubic feet per minute constantly passing into the gallery immediately behind the diaphragm and traversing it towards its open end .
Therefore , the greatest amount of fire-damp which the gallery could possibly have contained at any moment before one of these explosions was effected , even in the extreme case I have imagined , and with the further supposition that all the doors were shut , was about one-fourteenth part of a cubic foot , giving a mixture of one of gas to seven thousand of air , a proportion which is obviously far too small to be of the least practical account .
It appears necessary to give the foregoing explanation , inasmuch as , in a report on some experiments made with dust from Seaham colliery , * Professor Abel has made the following remarks regarding the experiments conducted with the smaller apparatus described to the Royal Society in 1879 , and whatever applies to those experiments in this respect , applies with equal force to the present ones , which are nothing more than their continuation on a larger scale .
At page 5 , Professor Abel says , \#151 ; " The apparatus devised by Mr. Galloway for the latter experiments was very ingenious , but it appears open to question whether small quantities of fire-damp did not find their way before the explosion from that part of the apparatus where the gas-mixture was prepared and fired into the channel where the coal-dust was raised , and into which the flame of the explosion was projected .
" The coal-dust employed in this series of experiments came from the # Report on the result of experiments made with the samples of dust collected at Seaham Colliery in compliance with the request of the Secretary of State for the Home Department , conveyed by a letter dated November 4 , 1880 .

It had been produced in the operation of grinding coal for coke-making purposes , and had floated in the air and been deposited in a still atmosphere within the building containing the machinery .
I could not obtain the results described in my previous papers , and in the present one , with dust taken from screens , or from the roadways of mines ; for , on the one hand , the dust from screens seems to have lost its finest particles before being deposited ; and , on the other hand , the feeble nature of my explosion prevented me from attempting to perform the winnowing operation to which I imagine the dust in mines is subjected before it is required to propagate the flame of an explosion .
It is an indispensable condition that the dust be dry , and I have found also that the best experimental results can only be obtained in fine dry weather .
For instance , on the 20th of July , when it was warm and dry , I succeeded in producing flames of coal-dust and pure air varying in length from 108 to 147 feet ; but on the 22nd , only two-days afterwards , when it rained occasionally , and the air contained very finely divided moisture in the form of a light and hardly perceptible mist , I could not produce a flame even 36 feet long .
In making the series of experiments corresponding to the ones we are now discussing , which were described in No. II paper , I found that when the gallery was air-tight , or nearly so , the flame could not be propagated further than 30 or 40 feet from the origin ; whereas , when the seams between the boards were open , the flame travelled 80 or 90 feet under the same conditions as before .
The dry weather which had prevailed before the 14th of July last had dried up the timber of which the gallery was formed to such an extent as to produce twelve open seams in it longitudinally , varying from to wide ; and it was recognised after the seventeenth experiment had been made , that this circumstance allowed the force of the fire-damp explosion to be dissipated , without forming an air-wave of sufficient energy to raise the coal-dust in the gallery .
Accordingly , strips of wood were nailed along the seams on the top , on the doors , and on the back , while some of the succeeding experiments were in progress ; strips of canvas were nailed along the seams on the floor ; the spaces between the ends of the sections were carefully closed , and canvas was nailed along the joints between the doors and the gallery , with the object of making it as air-tight as possible everywhere .
This operation was completed as far as the end of the sixth section , when the thirty-eighth experiment was made .
The experience in this case was that the more air-tight the gallery could be made the better were the results .
When the twenty-eighth experiment was made , it first became evident that the gas and air in the explosion chamber had not been sufficiently well mixed in the preceding experiments to produce the 440 Mr. W. Galloway .
[ Mar. 23 , best possible results by their explosion .
Accordingly , in all the succeeding experiments the driving wheel was turned rapidly 200 times instead of 100 times as before , the attendants relieving each other at the work , and , thereafter , the results were much more uniform , and , consequently , more satisfactory .
It will be recollected from the account given in Ho. Ill paper , that the gallery consists of seven sections , and that each section has a door 18 feet long by 2 feet 3 inches wide , which constitutes one of its sides when it is closed [ see sections a and \amp ; , fig. 3 ) .
'W'hen all the doors are open the gallery has only three sides\#151 ; namely , top , bottom , and back , and its interior is exposed to view from one end to the other .
The doors then stand out horizontally on a level with the top to which they are hinged , while their free edges are supported on suitable props .
The table given below shows how many doors were shut , and how many were open when each experiment was made , the shut ones being , of course , those nearest the explosion chamber .
In one or two experiments , however , there were three doors next the explosion chamber closed , the following three open , and the last one shut .
This was the case , for example , in the sixty-third experiment .
There is no provision in the table for showing this arrangement , and as the flame did not , on any of these occasions , extend to the last section , it was not considered worthy of a special column .
Each of the seven sections contained coal-dust in the cases referred to , and that is the reason why they are all represented in the table .
There were sets of three shelves , one above the other , placed transversely in the gallery at the following points , measured from the diaphragm towards the open end : 10 feet , 21 feet , 32 feet 6 inches , 42 feet , 56 feet , 65 feet , 76 feet 4 inches , 87 feet , 96 feet 8 inches , 107 feet , and 117 feet 6 inches .
The spaces between the shelves of each set , and between the highest and lowest shelf and the top and bottom of the gallery , were intended to have an approximately equal area .
The shelves were about 6 inches wide by f inch thick .
Those heaps of powder referred to in the table , whose distances from the diaphragm correspond to the position of certain of the sets of shelves , were in these instances placed on the top shelf , the others were laid on the floor .
After each experiment the coal-dust was entirely swept out and replaced by fresh dust , except in one or two cases which are specially mentioned in the table .
The diaphragm usually consisted of six single sheets of newspaper , but the exceptions are shown in the table .
Where a note of interrogation occurs the number of sheets may be taken as six , although the real number was omitted in taking notes at the time .
Fig. 1 shows the length of flame ( measured from the diaphragm ) obtained in the principal explosion of each group .

The average length of five flames of coal-dust and pure air , augmented by the explosion of small heaps of gunpowder ( 145 feet ) , is shown by the line EF .
All the experiments between the fifteenth and thirty-first are omitted , as they were made while the apparatus was in an imperfect condition .
In fig. 2 the apparatus is reproduced on a very small scale , so as to show its whole length , as well as the appearances presented by some of the more remarkable flames as they issued from its side , or end .
The part which represents the explosion chamber is on the left hand side of the zero line , and the seven sections of the wooden gallery are on its right hand side .
The form of the flames was sketched at the instant of their occurrence , with the exception of No. 59 , which is correct as to length , and approximately correct as to its other dimensions , but was not sketched until afterwards .
The average length of fire-damp flame obtained .

But as it was found that the fire-damp flame was , if anything , shorter than before , sometimes not exceeding eight or nine feet in length , I did not think it necessary to undertake a new series of experiments , and allowed the original one to remain intact .

As the coal-dust flames issued from the apparatus they assumed various forms according to the direction in which the wind happened to drift the cloud of coal-dust and air which preceded them .
Nos. 39 and 58 were bent backwards , as the wind was blowing against the open end of the gallery at the time ; Nos. 43 and 59 , on the contrary , were drawn out in the same line as the gallery , the wind favouring that development ; the others are more or less doubtful .

t This result was obtained without putting in any fresh dust after the previous experiment was made . .
_ S The gallery had not been swept out , and no fresh dust was added after the last experiment .
1 he soot was taken off the first and third heaps of powder , that had been left unburnt , and another heap was substituted for the one that had been burnt in the middle .
I ) In this case and the next the explosion of the powder seemed to arrest the progress of the flame , instead of accelerating it .
There was fresh dust in the two first sections only .
' ** This flame came out of the last two sections and swept the ground , coking the dust lying at the three points it touched over an area of four or five square feet at each .
It should again be mentioned that a thick cloud of coal-dust and air was always created by the air-wave which emanated from the firedamp explosion and swept through both the closed and open parts of the gallery , in advance of the flame .
When this cloud emerged into the open air , either by drifting sideways from the open sections , or by 1882 .
] On the Influence of Coal-dust Colliery Explosions .
445 being projected beyond the end of the gallery , it occasionally assumed large proportions , and the flame , which afterwards shot into it , also became enlarged until it appeared to have a diameter varying from 5 to 9 feet on different occasions .
It then emitted a loud roaring sound and exhibited all the phenomena of incipient explosive combustion .
Crusts of coked coal-dust were found adhering to the edges of the transverse shelves farthest from the explosion chamber , and their opposite edges were covered with a thin deposit of soot and dust , which had a velvety feeling when touched .
These circumstances seem entirely to corroborate the hypothesis first proposed in No. I paper , in connection with Llan Colliery explosion , and afterwards revived in No. Ill paper , in connexion with Penygraig Colliery explosion , to the effect that the crusts of coked coal-dust are , as a rule , deposited during the retrograde movement of the air , that is to say , 'while it is travelling backwards towards the origin of the explosion .
The results stated in the foregoing pages strengthen and confirm the opinions I have expressed in each of the three preceding papers on the same question , as to the manner in which the flame of an explosion is originated and propagated in a dry and dusty mine .
The experiments described in the first paper seemed to show that a mixture of air and coal-dust is not inflammable at ordinary pressure and temperature without the presence of a small proportion of firedamp ; but those described in this place show conclusively , I think , that fire-damp is altogether unnecessary , when the scale on which the experiments are made is large enough , and when the fineness and dryness of the dust are unquestionable .
It may be objected that , although the particular kind of dust I have generally employed may form an explosive mixture with pure air , it does not follow that other kinds of coal-dust will do the same , even under the very same conditions as to fineness and dryness .
I am inclined to think , however , that the objection has very little real importance as far as the general question of colliery explosions is concerned .
Possibly the dust produced in mines in which very dry or anthracitic qualities of coal are worked might not behave in the manner indicated .
But the number of mines of this class now being worked in this country is far too small , as compared with the whole , to be of any practical account .
I may add , in concluding , that the views advocated in these papers , or similar ones , have been held for many years by a few eminent Prench engineers , including MM .
Verpilleux , Vital , and others ; and they now appear to be making rapid progress amongst the practical mining men of our own country , who , judging by the reports that have reached me from many sides , are urgently desirous of obtaining as much information on the subject as they possibly can .
