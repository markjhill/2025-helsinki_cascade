It is well.known how much labour has been bestowed hby gome-ters on the aolution of Kepler 's Problem , and what . ?
ompic ; tted resuits have been obtained for the coefficents n the epressi1n fsor n the Equation of the Center , I ; have tely fouand a new solution iof this problem , which differs so strikingly from former solutions in ths respect , that it leads to.an unexpectedly simple law of coefficients .
It is as follows : Let g be the mean anomaly ; p : be the angle of excentricity ; i be any positive integer number .
Put 3= tan i , ^i cos2 Pi+=+P+ +*+2 Ql=l-2Q1 2.3..i+1 Q.=Q.2+:2 31 &amp;c. Then the Equation of the Center -=(1l )3 Q{p.4 3+Pi4+l .
