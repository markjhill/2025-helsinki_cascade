Part III.\#151 ; The Solvent Properties of Silver Nitrate Solutions .
By T. Martin Lowry , F.R.S. ( Received June 18 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) In an earlier paper by Mr. F. E. Smith* and a second paper by the author in conjunction with Mr. F. E. Smith it was shown that the weight of silver deposited by a given current was influenced in a very important degree by impurities in the silver nitrate solutions .
The most important impurities are those which are capable of exerting a reducing action upon the silver nitrate .
But there is also a group of substances to be considered which are soluble in silver nitrate solutions , though almost insoluble in water : these are precipitated when the silver nitrate solutions are impoverished at the cathode by the passage of the current and cause an appreciable increase in the weight of the deposit .
They may be removed by diluting the silver nitrate solutions , filtering off the precipitated impurities , evaporating the filtered solution and draining the crystals of silver nitrate which separate ; any impurities that may have escaped precipitation will be freely soluble in the concentrated mother-liquor from which the crystals have separated , and may be got rid of in the usual way by draining on the pump and rinsing cautiously with water .
In view of the importance of these impurities in the experimental determination of the electrochemical equivalent of .silver , and the interest of the * Part I , " A Comparison of Various Forms of Silver Voltameters , " by F. E. Smith , A.R.C.Sc .

problem from the standpoint of the theory of solutions , it appeared to be desirable to pursue the matter further and to make quantitative measurements of the solvent properties of silver nitrate solutions for some typical substances which are insoluble , or nearly so , in pure water .
The present paper includes measurements of the solubility of silver chloride , bromide , iodide , and sulphide .
The solubility of the iodide has already been investigated somewhat fully by Hellwig* but only a few incidental measurements have been made in the case of the other salts .
A. Silver Chloride .
( With F. Hawks , J. F. Potts , B.Sc. , and R. G. Parker , B.Sc. ) In determining the conditions that were most favourable for the precipitation of silver chloride and silver bromide , Stas foundf that the solubility of these compounds was diminished by the presence of an excess either of silver nitrate or of the soluble halogen salt .
This is in accordance with the law of mass-action , according to which the action AgN03 + KCl ^ AgCl + KNOs should be driven towards completion ( left to right ) by the presence of an excess of either of the substances shown on the left-hand side of the equation .
It has long been known , however , that the contrary effect takes place in more concentrated solutions .
Thus Berthollet , in 1799 , J discussing the problem of removing small quantities of hydrochloric from nitric acid , writes as follows :\#151 ; " Muriate of silver being much less soluble than muriate of lead , silver is therefore much better than lead for retaining the muriatic acid mixed with nitric acid ; yet Welter and Bonjour have observed that some muriatic acid always passes by distillation , if the precautions indicated by those learned chemists were not attended to .
To obtain nitric acid pure in a direct manner it is necessary that the acid to be distilled be diluted , so that it may not have strength sufficient to dissolve muriate of silver , and that the muriate of silver which is precipitated be separated before the liquid be submitted to the action of heat ; still better , the muriatic acid of nitrate of potash may be precipitated by a solution of silver ; and by decomposing afterwards the nitrate of potash , nitric acid will be obtained quite pure , and free from muriatic acid .
" Berthollet s observation is again in agreement with the law of mass-action .
But precisely similar effects are produced by concentrated solutions of * 4 Zeitschr .

hydrogen chloride or of common salt ( see , for instance , Barlow* ) , both of which might be expected , by a simple application of the law of mass-action , to produce a diminution of solubility .
The solvent properties of concentrated solutions of silver nitrate are less widely known , but the effects produced are quite as important as those which are observed in the case of hydrochloric acid and common salt .
It is not the purpose of the present paper to discuss fully the origin of these remarkable solvent influences ; but it may be suggested that ( in accordance with the general principle that " like dissolves like " ) fused silver nitrate is probably an excellent solvent for silver chloride and that the behaviour of its concentrated aqueous solutions may be interpreted in much the same way as that of other mixed solvents .
The case appears to resemble the use of a mixture of alcohol and water to dissolve an organic compound such as camphor , the solubility of which in dilute aqueous alcohol is very small , but increases rapidly as the concentration of the alcohol in the mixture is increased .
Solubility of Silver Chloride in Silver Nitrate ( Gravimetric Method ) .
The solubility of silver chloride in aqueous silver nitrate was measured by two methods\#151 ; ( ?
) By gravimetric analysis at 20 ' C. ( ?
) By volumetric analysis over a range of temperature , up to about 100 ' C. In the gravimetric analysis a considerable quantity of silver nitrate was dissolved in less than half its weight of water , and a precipitate was formed by adding a known quantity of a standard salt solution .
The mixture was stirred in a large test-tube , supported in a thermostat heated to 20 ' C. After a time , the precipitated silver chloride was allowed to settle , the bulk of the clear liquid was decanted and the precipitate was collected on a weighed Gooch crucible .
After draining away as much as possible of the concentrated silver nitrate solution the silver chloride was washed , dried , and weighed .
The weight of the precipitate obtained in this way was much less than when the salt was precipitated from a dilute solution by a small excess of silver nitrate .
A considerable proportion of silver chloride had therefore been retained by the silver nitrate , when present in great excess and in a concentrated solution .
The whole of the silver solutions , including the earlier washings from the Gooch crucible , were then collected , made up to a known weight with water , warmed to ensure complete saturation with silver chloride , and again stirred * 4 Arner .

in the thermostat at 20 ' C. A further quantity of silver chloride was thus thrown down , and this was collected and weighed as before .
This process was repeated until almost the whole of the silver chloride had been collected .
In a preliminary series of experiments 120 grm. of silver nitrate were mixed with 19-987 grm. of a decinormal solution of sodium chloride in presence of quantities of water amounting altogether to 60 grm. in the first and 240 grm. in the final measurement .
Out of a total weight of 0'2868 grm. AgCl , the quantities precipitated and retained were : AgN03 .

The second and final series of measurements was made with 220 grm. of silver nitrate and 30*0558 grm. of N/ 10 salt solution , which should have given 0*4314 grm. AgCl .
The silver chloride precipitated and retained was as follows :\#151 ; Table I.\#151 ; Solubility of Silver Chloride in Silver Nitrate at 20 ' C. AgN03 .

The quantities retained after dilution are too small in the preliminary series , because local precipitation had taken place on dilution , and the necessity of warming the solutions to*secure complete saturation had not been discovered .

The rapid diminution of solubility by dilution with water is shown in fig- ! .

Solubility of Silver Chloride in Silver Nitrate ( Volumetr ic Method ) .
The volumetric method of measurement has the advantage of providing data for a wide range of temperatures almost up to the boiling point of the solutions ; it can also be carried out with much smaller quantities ( 5 to 10 grm. ) of silver nitrate .
The silver nitrate was weighed into a test-tube provided with a thermometer and a small stirrer passing through a rubber stopper .
A known quantity of water , containing a suitable amount of salt in solution , was added under such conditions that a clear solution was obtained .
The test-tube containing the hot solution was then placed in a beaker of hot water and allowed to cool slowly , with constant stirring , until it became opalescent by the separation of silver chloride .
It was found that this effect could be detected far more readily when the test-tube was surrounded by clear water Mr. T. M. Lowry .
for comparison than when it was cooled in air , and that stirring was essential to prevent supersaturation .
The temperature of saturation could be fixed within about a degree .
By varying the proportions of water , silver nitrate , and salt , complete temperature-solubility curves could be plotted for any given ratio of silver nitrate to water .
The following data were obtained :\#151 ; - Table II.\#151 ; Solubility of Silver Chloride in Silver Nitrate at Different Temperatures .

The dots represent gravimetric experiments at 20 ' C. These observations are plotted out in fig. 2 .
It will be seen that the solvent power of the strongest solution ( AgNC\gt ; 3 : water = 2:1 ) increases as the temperature rises , until at 86 ' no permanent precipitate is produced byadding silver nitrate ( 10 grm. ) to decinormal salt solution ( 5 c.c. ) ; the liquid may indeed be regarded as a decinormal solution of silver chloride , so far as the chloride and water are concerned .
Silver nitrate is , therefore , a more effective solvent at high than ac low temperatures .
In the weakest of the three solutions ( AgN03 : water =1:2 ) , change of temperature produces a similar effect since the solubility increases with rising temperature , but it does so at an increasing rate .
It might be expected that , at some intermediate concentration , an inflected curve would be obtained which would be concave in one range of temperatures and convex in another .
This expectation is verified in the case of solutions in which the ratios are AgN03 : water = 1:1 .
The observations from 20 ' to 70 ' plot out to a straight line which no doubt includes the point of Mr. T. M. Lowry .
inflection ; above 70 ' the curve rises like that for the weaker solution , below 20 ' it would probably show the curvature which is characteristic of the stronger solutions .
_ , The volumetric readings are obtained with increasing difficulty as the temperature falls , but a comparison with the gravimetric readings , represented by black dots in fig. 2 , shows that even at 20 ' there is no large difference between the two series .
Solubility of Silver Chloride Common Salt .
The solubility of silver chloride in solutions of sodium chloride was determined gravimetrically at 15 ' C. , by adding to a series of salt solutions ( containing 28 , 20 , and 15 grm. Nad per 100 grm. of solution ) sufficient concentrated silver nitrate solution to produce rather more silver chloride than would remain dissolved .
After warming and shaking , the solutions were left to stand during 24 hours at 15 ' C. A known weight of the clear solution was then diluted with water to 20 times its volume ; the silver chloride which was precipitated was filtered off on a Gooch crucible , washed , dried , and weighed .
Volumetric determinations were also made of the solubility of silver chloride in 28 , 20 , and 15 per cent , salt solutions at temperatures up to the boiling points of the solutions .
Decinormal silver nitrate solution was added from a burette to 20 c.c. of the salt solution ; after every addition of silver nitrate the concentration of the salt was restored to its original 't-O 60 80 IIO'C Chloride in Hydrochloric Acid and in Solutions of \#166 ; Solubility of Salt .

The solution was then allowed to cool slowly , with vigorous stirring , until it became opalescent .
The results of the gravimetric and volumetric measurements are given in Table III. .
It will be seen that the concentration of the silver chloride may be as great as 2 grm. per 100 grm. of salt , and that , in spite of its smaller solubility , common salt is a better solvent for silver chloride than is silver nitrate .

are in satisfactory agreement .
Three points calculated from data given by Barlow , and represented by black dots in the figure , are seen to lie upon a curve of precisely similar form .
_ Solubility of Silver Chloride Hydrochloric Acid .
Hydrochloric acid of constant boiling point ( 2.0-24 per cent. HC1 ) was used , in order that loss by evaporation should not alter the strength of the acid .
To 20 grm. of this acid silver nitrate solution was added gradually .
For every cubic centimetre of solution added , T54 grm. ( or 1-315 c.c. ) of 33 per cent. HC1 was also added , and the volume was then brought back to its original value by evaporating .
The concentration of the acid was thus maintained at 20 per cent , by weight .

( With E. G. Parker , B.Sc. ) In the case of the bromide , iodide , and sulphide , the measurements of solubility are complicated by the formation of double salts .

So also by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on aqueous silver nitrate there may be produced ( I ) Silver sulphide , Ag2S .
( II ) The double salt , Ag2S , AglSr03 .
The existence of double salts of silver iodide and silver nitrate was referred to as long ago as 1839 by Preuss.* Schnaussf and KremerJ prepared and analysed the salt AgI , AgN03 .
Weltzieng and Eisse|| prepared and analysed the double salt AgI,2AgN03 .
Both salts were prepared and analysed a few years later by Sturenberg.1T Kremer** and Eisse ( loc.cit .
) also prepared and analysed a bromide-nitrate of the formula AgBr , AgNO ; s. Eisse attempted further to prepare a chloride-nitrate , but only succeeded in obtaining a product having the composition AgCl,18AgN03 , which he hesitated to regard as a definite compound .
ThS yellow sulphide-nitrate , Ag2S , AgN03 , which is formed when sulphuretted hydrogen is added to concentrated solutions of silver nitrate , was prepared and analysed by Poleck and Thiimmel.ff GutzeitJJ had put forward as a test for arsenic the formation of a yellow stain by the action of arseniuretted hydrogen on a filter-paper moistened with a concentrated solution of silver nitrate ; this yellow stain became black on the addition of water .
Poleck and Thummel showed that identical phenomena are observed with SH2 , PH3 , AsH3 , and SbH3 .
The compounds formed by the action of phosphoretted , arseniuretted , and antimoniuretted hydrogen have the formulae Ag3P,3AgN03 , Ag3As,3AgN03 , Ag3Sb,3AgN03 , and are rapidly decomposed by water according to equations such as Ag3 As,3 AgN 03 + 3H20 = H3As03 + 3HN03 + 6Ag .
SS The sulphide-nitrate , Ag2S , AgN03 , is much more stable , but decomposes directly into silver sulphide and silver nitrate when boiled with water .

Solubility of Silver Bromide in Silver Nitrate Solutions .
Volumetric measurements were made for a series of different concentrations , using the same method as in the case of silver chloride in .
aqueous salt solutions .
Possibly on account of complications due to the formation of a bromide-nitrate , the volumetric and gravimetric measurements agreed less closely than in the case of the chloride .
Only two of the six series of measurements are reproduced , therefore , in Table V and in fig. 4 .

Solubility of Silver Bromide in Silver Nitrate Solutions .
Gravimetric measurements were made of the solubility at 14*5 ' C. of silver bromide in silver nitrate solutions containing 44 , 52 , 60 , and 65 per cent. AgN03 .
In each case a clear solution , saturated with AgBr , was precipitated by dilution , and the silver bromide thrown down was collected and weighed .
In one case a duplicate measurement was made by adding a known volume of N/ 10 KBr solution to a known weight of silver nitrate and weighing the silvei bromide which remained undissolved .
The two measurements showed a satisfactory agreement .
Table V shows that the solubility of silver bromide in silver nitrate solutions is much greater than that of silver chloride\#151 ; on the average about thiee oi femr times as great .
This is contrary to two isolated observations The Silver Voltameter .

namely Agl , AgI , AgN03 , and AgI,2AgN03 , no attempt was made to determine systematically the point of saturation under different experimental conditions .
A complete series of solubility measurements has , however , been given by Hellwig* for a temperature of 25'2 .
By warming together at 60-70 ' C , 2 grm. silver nitrate , 2 c.c. water , and 4 c.c. N/ 10 KI solution , a clear solution can be obtained .
When heated to 100 ' it gave a yellow precipitate of pure silver iodide , which dissolved again when the liquid was allowed to cool slowly , with constant shaking , to 60-65 ' C. Evidently , therefore , the silver iodide , which separates from a 25-per-cent , solution of silver nitrate at temperatures near the boiling point , is less soluble at 100 ' than at 70 ' C. On allowing this solution to cool further it became cloudy at 50 ' C. , and at 35 ' deposited white needles of the iodide-nitrate , AgT , AgN03 .
These needles were at once converted into the yellow iodide by contact with water and were also decomposed by alcohol .
By draining and pressing on porous earthenware , a pure white powder was obtained , which lost only 01 per cent , when dried at 100 ' during 30 minutes , and therefore contained very little mother-liquor .
When boiled with water during several hours , 0'0847 grm. gave 0-0506 grm. Agl and 0-0340 grm. AgN03 , whence Agl : AgN03 = 1'07 : 1 , agreeing satisfactorily with the formula AgI , AgN03 .
When this material was allowed to stand in contact with the mother-liquor for 12 hours at atmospheric temperature , the white needles changed completely into compact crystals of the iodide-nitrate , Agl,2AgN03 .
These were dried between filter-papers and then in a steam oven .
After boiling with water during 5 hours , 01647 grm. gave 0-0679 grm. Agl and 0-0968 grm. AgN03 , whence Agl : AgN03 = 1 : T97 , agreeing closely with the formula AgI,2AgN03 .
The observations recorded above show that the solubility of silver iodide in 25-per-cent , aqueous silver nitrate reaches a maximum at about 60 ' , and that at the point of maximum solubility the quantity dissolved even in this weak solution amounts to about 5 grm. Agl per 100 grm. AgN03 .
The iodide is thus about 30 times more soluble than the bromide and about 100 times more soluble than the chloride .
Solubility of Silver Sulphide i Silver Nitrate Solutions .
The first effect of adding sidphuretted hydrogen ( or a soluble sulphide ) to an aqueous solution of silver nitrate is probably in every case to precipitate the black sulphide Ag2S .
But , if the silver nitrate solution is at all concentrated , this soon changes over into the yellow sulphide-nitrate of the formula * Loc , cit. , p. 173 .

1 10 \#187 ; \#187 ; These numbers , which are plotted out in fig. 5 , indicate that the black sulphide would probably be permanent in contact with solutions containing 10 per cent. AgN03 or less .
There is evidently a limiting concentration of silver nitrate above which the yellow sulphide-nitrate would be stable , whilst below it the black Fig. 5.\#151 ; Conversion of Black to Yellow Silver Sulphide .

sulphide would be stable .
In order to determine the limiting concentration more accurately , attempts were made to measure the velocity of the converse change from yellow to black at different concentrations : these were not successful , as the change is both slow and indefinite .
It was found , however , that in contact with 1-per-cent .
AgN03 the yellow double salt became black in the course of 12 hours .
_ The yellow salt was prepared by adding to 10 grm. of dry silver nitrate a solution of 1*5 grm. Na2S in 5 c.c. of water .
The yellow precipitate was drained on a small Buchner funnel and washed with alcohol until no silver could be detected in the washings .
It was then rinsed with ether and allowed to dry in the dark .
Qualitative analysis showed that the substance contained only silver , sulphide , and nitrate .
Gravimetric estimation of the silver gave Ag = 77*05 , 77*02 per cent. .Ag2S , AgN03 requires 77*49 per cent. When boiled with water 02054 grm. gave a residue of silver sulphide weighing 0*1215 grm. ( calc .
0T218 ) and containing 87*2 per cent. Ag ( calc .
87*15 per cent. ) ; the extract contained 0*0835 AgNQ3 ( calc .
0*0836 ) ; the ratio AgN03 : Ag2S = 1*002 : 1 agrees closely with the formula Ag2S , AgN03 .
As the sulphide-nitrate is the stable form at all concentrations above 10 per cent. , all the solubility measurements are for solutions saturated with this form of the sulphide , although the data are worked out for the simple sulphide Ag2S .
Some preliminary experiments were made with sulphuretted hydrogen , purified by dissolving in milk of magnesia and decomposing the resulting sulphide solution by boiling .
The purified gas was dissolved in boiled water and estimated ( 1 ) by precipitating as Ag2S and as CdS , and ( 2 ) by titration with iodine ; but it escaped so quickly from the solution that it could not be used conveniently for the solubility measurements .
Instead , Kahlbaum s purest crystalline sodium sulphide was used , in freshly prepared solutions which were standardised by titration with iodine Na2S +12 = 2NaI + S. Ihe solubility of silver sulphide in silver nitrate solutions was determined ( a ) Gravimetrically at 15 ' .
( b ) Volumetrically at 100 ' .
I he volumetric method could not be used in the same way as in the case of the chloride and bromide , because the solubility of the sulphide is almost independent of the temperature ; nor could the method used at 100 ' be used at atmosplieric temperature , since silver sulphide when once precipitated is The Silver Voltameter .
very difficult to dissolve again , especially at temperatures below the boiling-point .
The gravimetric measurements were made by adding 50 c.c. 0'948 x N/ 5 sodium sulphide to 100 grm. of silver nitrate ( AgN03 : water = 2:1 ) warming and stirring thoroughly , then leaving 24 hours to settle at the atmospheric temperature .
The undissolved silver sulphide was filtered off , drained , washed with alcohol and ether , and weighed as Ag2S , AgN03 .
This process was repeated after adding successive quantities of 50 c.c. of water to the solution until all the sulphide had been precipitated .
The solubilities are much less even than in the case of the chloride , and are therefore subject to larger percentage errors , A further source of error is introduced by the difficulty of weighing the double salt , which decomposes if washed with water ; thus the actual weight of the double salt collected was 2'040 grm. , the calculated quantity being T985 grm. The data are set out in Table VII .

Volumetric measurements were made at 100 ' C. by two methods .
In the first a solution of sodium sulphide was added to 10 grm. of silver nitrate , mixed with a variable quantity of water , with constant shaking in a closed test-tube , until a faint permanent precipitate was formed .
In the second method a definite quantity of sodium sulphide was added to a solution of silver nitrate under such conditions that a clear solution was produced ; water was then added gradually until a faint permanent precipitate was formed .
The second method gives better results than the first ; the results obtained by both methods are collected in Table VIII .
It will be seen at once that even at 100 ' C. the quantities of silver sulphide retained are very small ; at the high concentration AgN03 : water = 2:1 the quantity of silver sulphide is only about 0'1 per cent , of the weight of silver nitrate in the solution .
The order of magnitude is the same at 100 ' C. as The Silver Voltameter .

at 15 ' C. for similar concentrations , but by using concentrations up to AgN03 : water = 9 : 1 the solubility of the sulphide in the hot solutions was increased to T36 per cent , of the weight of silver nitrate .
These concentrated solutions are a clear yellow , resembling aqueous solutions of potassium chromate .
The data now given can only be regarded as approximate , but the general influence of the concentration of the silver nitrate on the solubility of silver sulphide is shown clearly in fig. 6 , in which all the data are set out together , and are seen to be very near to a smooth curve whether they refer to a temperature of 15 ' or 100 ' C. Fog Signals.\#151 ; Areas of Silence and Greatest Range of Sound .
By A. Mallock , F.R.S. ( Received June 19 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) The experience of Trinity House in regard to the audibility of sound signals has brought to notice the fact that on occasions the sound may be heard near the source and again at a considerable distance , while inaudible between these positions .
This was first observed , or at least prominently brought forward , by Prof. Tyndall .
The statement was regarded with some scepticism by scientific men at the time , but the explanation of the effect of wind on sound given by Prof. G. Stokes* will , with a little amplification , suffice also for the silent areas .
Stokes in this explanation ( which was repeated by Henryf and by Osborne Reynolds^ ) points out that the speed of the wind , in consequence of the surface friction of the ground , increases with the height , and that since the velocity of sound is constant not with reference to the ground , but to the air through which the sound travels , the front of a plane wave vertical at some given instant will subsequently lean backwards if travelling against the wind , and forwards if with the wind .
Or , in other words , the sound tends to leave the ground in the first case and to cling to it in the second .
If one may use such a word as a " ray " in connection with sound , the ray to windward is deflected upwards , and the ray to leeward , downwards .
