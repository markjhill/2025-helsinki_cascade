159 Some Enumerative Studies on Malarial Fever .
By Major Ronald Ross , F.R.S. , and David Thomson , M.B. , Ch. B. , D.P.H. ( Received October 12 , \#151 ; Read December 8 , 1910 .
) Prefatory Note by B. Boss.\#151 ; Towards the end of last year the Advisory Committee for the Tropical Diseases Research Fund ( Colonial Office ) allotted considerable funds to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine for researches to be carried out in Liverpool .
This enabled us to commence , under my direction , a number of minute co-ordinated studies on cases admitted into the Tropical Ward of the Royal Southern Hospital\#151 ; material which , though it offered peculiar facilities for research , had long remained neglected owing to want of funds .
The cases ( occurring in the clinics of Dr. Macalister , Dr. Lloyd Roberts , and myself ) were placed in charge of Dr. David Thomson ; the chemical studies in charge of Dr. G- .
C. E. Simpson ; the parasitological studies in charge of Dr. H. B. Fantham .
Parallel researches on animals were also assigned to Dr. John Thomson who is working under Sir Edward Durning-Lawrence 's fund for the investigation of the effect of temperature on disease ; Dr. Y. T. Korke ( Research Fellow ) has studied coagulation times and other details ; the literature was in charge of Mr. W. R. Drawz , the Malaria Bibliographer ( Advisory Committee 's Fund ) ; and much valuable help has been given by the staffs of the University , the School of Tropical Medicine , and the Royal Southern Hospital of Liverpool , and by Sister Linaker of the Tropical Ward .
The researches were commenced on January 1 , 1910 .
A paper by Dr. David Thomson and myself , describing a regular periodical increase of the trypanosomes in a case of Sleeping Sickness , was published ; * and we now present to the Society brief accounts of our results regarding malaria , blackwater fever , trypanosomiasis , and various therapeutical agencies , obtained ( mostly by new methods ) up to the end of July , 1910 .
Further details will be published , if necessary , in the ' Annals of Tropical Medicine , ' Liverpool .
1 .
Preliminary.\#151 ; For many years past little information which is both new and exact has been added to our knowledge o\#163 ; the pathology of malaria .
This has probably been due to the exhaustion of the older methods of research , which , being purely qualitative , have failed to indicate the precise correlations between the numbers of the parasites present in a patient and the various pathological and therapeutical reactions .
For example , out of * ' Roy .

[ Oct. 12 , 51 and 38 successful inoculations of men by means of infected blood and infected Anophelines respectively , in not a single one has any exact estimate been given of the numbers of parasites inoculated , or recovered after the lapse of the incubation period ; and , though many researches on quinine have been made , we know of none in which its direct effect upon the numbers of the parasites in the patient has been correctly measured .
Moreover , the older methods often failed to reveal the parasites at all , unless they were present in large numbers .
Hence our first care was to elaborate more exact methods both for detection and for enumeration .
This was done early in the year ( by R. R. and D. T.)\#151 ; though we have by no means reached finality yet .
The new methods were next employed for all the cases in the Tropical Ward , daily counts of the parasites and often of the leucocytes , together with other estimations , being made ( by D. T. ) .
At the same time parallel chemical studies were carried out ( by G. C. E. S. ) and therapeutical ones ( by D. T. ) ; and the measurements were carefully charted and compared .
Even at this preliminary stage the results ( which are given at the end of this paper ) include more accurate verifications of some old conjectures , and demonstrations of some new theorems .

The Detective Method Used.\#151 ; In the ordinary methods the blood is spread out in a thin film , liquid or dry\#151 ; 1 cu .
mm. covering , say , 4 sq .
cm .
of area .
If the field of the oil-immersion lens has a diameter of 0165 mm. , and can be thoroughly searched by the eye in three seconds , about 12 hours ' work would be required to examine the whole of 1 cu .
mm. of blood in this way ; and if the specimen contains only one parasite it may not , by bad luck , be found until nearly the whole of the area has been searched .
We have , therefore , employed the " thick film process " described by one of us ( R. R. ) in 1903 .
In this 1 cu .
mm. of blood is spread out over only about one quarter of a square centimetre or less , and dried ; the haemoglobin is then gently washed out with water ; and the residue , consisting of parasites , leucocytes , platelets , and the stromata of the red corpuscles , is carefully stained by any convenient method , with or without fixation .
By this simple means the whole of 1 cu .
mm. of blood can be searched in less than an hour ; but the identification of the Plasmodia requires considerable practice .
3 .
The EnumerativeMethod Used.\#151 ; The younger Plasmodia are too small to be counted by an ordinary htemocytometer ; hence their number has usually been estimated by comparison with the number of red or white cells , the latter figure being determined by the haemocytometer .
This gives a large compound error ; for if e is the percentage error made in counting the red or white cells in one specimen , and e ' is the percentage error made in .
1910 .
] Some EnumerativeStudies on Fever .
computing the proportion of parasites to each corpuscle in that specimen , then , by a simple calculation , the total percentage error will be / 100 .
( For example , if e = +5 per cent , and e !
+10 per cent. , the total percentage error will be + 15*5 per cent. ) Our method consists simply in making a measured quantity of blood into a thick film preparation and then counting all the parasites in it .
The blood is measured by determining the diameter of a fine capillary tube under the microscope and then calculating and marking off the length of the tube required to hold the given quantity ( as suggested by Dr. Wakelin Barratt ) .
Thus a uniform tube of 0180 mm. diameter and 4 cm .
length will contain 1-018 cu.mm.\#151 ; a convenient size .
The blood is sucked up into the tube and then quickly discharged upon the glass slide in one or several measured droplets , first samples being rejected .
The dehmmoglobinised thick film is fixed before staining , in order to avoid loss , and the whole area is scrupulously searched with the aid of a sliding stage .
Mr. M. Greenwood , Junior , informs us that if is the number of parasites counted in the unit ( say , 1 cu .
mm. ) of blood , and is the number of such units in the patient 's whole body , then the total number of parasites in him , assuming uniform distribution , will be -m ?
i-+ 0,67449mv/ w. Thus the probable percentage error is 67*449 / \/ n , the factor m cancelling out from the ratio .
This is important , because it shows that the error depends , not on the magnitude of the measured sample taken , but upon the number of parasites actually counted in it .
Hence , in order to obtain results within an assigned error , we take a large sample when the parasites are scarce and a small one when they are numerous ; the number of parasites which we must find and count being given by the formula n \#151 ; 4550/ e2 , where e is the permissible error .
The greatest error occurs when the parasites are so scarce that it is difficult to find enough of them to count up to the required standard ; or when they are so numerous that it is difficult to measure a volume of blood small enough to contain an easily countable number of them .
In these preliminary researches we have seldom examined at one sitting more than 1 cu .
mm. of blood , or less than \#163 ; cu .
mm. When the parasites were very numerous , we have sometimes fallen back on estimating their number by comparison with leucocytes , but are now elaborating improvements and special instruments for such , and other , details .
The method is also accurate and rapid for other blood parasites , and for leucocytes .
Other sources of error are ( 1 ) inaccurate measurements of the quantity of blood used , and ( 2 ) difficulty of seeing or distinguishing badly stained parasites .
Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
[ Oct. 12 , One kilogramme of blood of average density ( 1057'5 ) contains 945,626 cu .
mm. , and the blood in a man 's body is estimated to weigh about 4-9 per cent , of the total body weight\#151 ; from which data it is easy to compute the total number of parasites in a patient .
A man of 64-74 kilogrammes , or about 10 stone , will contain about 3,000,000 cu .
mm. of blood .
4 .
The Cases studied by us numbered 33 .
All had been infected in West Africa or America , so that none was of less than some weeks ' duration when admitted into hospital in Liverpool .
All were males of from 18 to 60 years of age .
They were mostly shipmen or traders , and two were negroes .
The parasites of all were counted almost every day and sometimes several times a day ; and the temperature was taken every four hours , or more often .
One case showed Plasmodium malaria % together with crescents ( sexual forms of P. falciparum ) .
Eight showed P. vivax only , and 24 P. falciparum only , two of the latter containing only sexual forms .
Quinine was often withheld for some days while other methods of treatment were used .
The cases were studied for over 600 days altogether .
There were no deaths .
All the cases will be recorded in the 'Annals of Tropical Medicine , ' vol. 4 , No. 3 , but charts of Cases 17 and 20 are given on pp. 164 and 165 .
At this preliminary stage of the enquiry we have undertaken to study only the gross daily correlations between the numbers of parasites and other phenomena\#151 ; leaving more minute hourly or four-hourly analysis to future work .
Hence , if a number of counts or other observations have been made on one day , we have recorded only the averages in the tables .
For temperatures , however , it has been thought best to record maxima instead of averages , and , as the tables should be as economical as possible , we have used the hcematothermicscale suggested by one of us ( R. R. ) , in which the 10 ' between 95 ' and 105 ' F. , or between 35 ' and 45 ' C. , are divided into 100 parts .
Except in Case 6 , specially studied by Dr. Fantham , we have not distinguished in the tables the various forms , sets , or stages of P. vivax\#151 ; this being reserved for future study .
Similarly , the treatment , leucocytes , haemoglobin , and urobilin are not differentiated too minutely .
Case 25 was counted by Dr. Korke .

The Correlation between the Parasites and the Fever.\#151 ; It is well known that fever is caused only by the asexual forms of the parasites , but though these are generally thought to be more abundant during pyrexial periods , no extensive numerical studies on the point appear to have been made , with the result that some sceptics still profess doubts on the subject .
Our cases , except four without fever ( Cases 1 , 15 , 16 , 27 ) , would seem to indicate a very strong ( almost convincing ) correlation .
Twenty-one of them suffered each from one pyrexial period , lasting from one to seven days , and preceded 1910 .
] Some EnumerativeStudies on Malarial Fever .
or followed by apyrexia , and in all , except Case 32 , the asexual parasites were very much more numerous during the pyrexial period .
Nine of the cases ( 7 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 32 ) suffered from one or two relapses each ( 13 relapses altogether ) , and every relapse , as well as every original attack , was associated with a comparatively large number of parasites ( 43 pyrexial periods altogether ) .
Similarly , there were 46 apyrexial periods ( including the four cases without fever ) , all associated with comparatively small numbers of asexual parasites , and conversely not a single marked rise in the number of asexual parasites took place without corresponding fever .
For further detail we compare the numbers of parasites per cubic millimetre counted on days of fever with those counted on days without fever .
A febrile day is taken as any one on which the patient 's temperature exceeds 980,6 F. ( = 36 ' hsematometric scale ) , or any one which comes between two tertian paroxysms ( Cases 9 , 14 , 24 ) .
The non-febrile days on which no asexual forms could be found in 1 cu .
mm. of blood are omitted .

, 19 83 38,277 461 If we had not omitted the non-febrile days on which no parasites were found , the non-febrile daily averages would have been much smaller than the figures given above , and the ratio of the febrile averages to them much larger , so that the febrile excess is very marked .
An examination of the details will further convince the reader of the great fall in temperature which accompanies the fall in the number of parasites .
We should note that the comparatively small numbers of found are due to the fact that the specimens generally contained a large proportion of mature parasites , not as yet disintegrated into spores , these of course being absent from peripheral blood containing P. falciparum , in which only spores or young forms generally occur .
There is no reason for considering quinine in this connection , because it probably affects the fever only through its action on the parasites .

The Degree of Fever Associated with Various Numbers of Parasites .
We know of no extensive and exact studies on this point , and ours are not yet complete .

In numbers of the specimens there were certainly two sets of parasites of different ages , which were often counted together , though only one set could have been concerned with the fever .
It is probable also , though by no means certain , that the resistance to the toxin of the Plasmodia varies , not only in different persons , but in the same person at different stages in the course of his infection and under different physiological conditions .
Our new methods will , we hope , enable us shortly to undertake very detailed studies on these points .
7 .
The Pyrogenic Limit.\#151 ; It is quite evident that if the parasites fall below a certain limit , they are no longer numerous enough to cause fever .
Thus with P. vivax , an average of 125 parasites of all ages and forms counted during 68 days in 8 cases , and with P. f an average of 460 asexual forms counted during 83 days in 19 cases , failed to produce fever .
The actual limit above which they become pyrogenic probably varies in different cases .
With P.vivax , as many as 1500 , 852 , and 540 were found in Cases 2 , 6 , and 7 1910 .
] Some Enumerative Studies on Malarial Fever .
without fever , and as few as 150 and 50 in Cases 5 and 9 with very slight fever ( 980,6 F. ) , so that about 200 to 500 may perhaps be taken as the usual limit .
With P. falciparum , as many as 1620 ( asexual ) were found as an average of four non-febrile days in Case 26 , and 1196 as an average of six non-febrile days in Case 25 ; while in Case 18 from 16 to 1860 were present for 22 days without causing any marked fever , so that 600 to 1500 may perhaps be adopted as the usual limit .
With P. malarice ( Case 1 ) , an average of 79 were present for 13 days without fever , but about 140 twice caused slight rigor .
8 .
The Asexual Forms betiveen the Relapses.\#151 ; It is generally thought and taught that these forms tend to " disappear " between the relapses\#151 ; though of course exceptions , especially in children , are noted\#151 ; and to reappear during them ; and several hypotheses , such as that of parthenogenesis ( F. Schaudinn ) , have been advanced to explain the supposed phenomenon , and have led to what appears to be much waste of work .
We find that the asexual forms do not necessarily disappear at all between the relapses , but are generally still to be found in small numbers per cubic millimetre on most of the days .
The apyretic periods preceding the 13 relapses in our cases ( 7 , 17,18 , 19 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 32 ) lasted 114 days altogether ( nearly nine days each on the average ) .
On 18 of these days no observations were made ; but on the remaining 96 days the parasites were found in small numbers on 59 , or 61 per cent. , and were not found only on 37 .
Moreover , the general trend of the curves suggests that they were not found on these days only because their numbers were a little too few for detection .
The parasite curve , at its height during a pyrexial period , generally falls very rapidly at first and more slowly later , and tends to reach its lowest about half-way between two apyrexial periods .
At this point it may or may not remain above the detectable limit ( by thick-film methods ) .
After this it was observed ( by D. T. ) , especially in Cases 7 , 17 , 23 , and 24 , to begin mounting slowly at first , until , when it reached the pyrogenic limit , another pyrexial period commenced .
All this is scarcely compatible with the speculation that the apyrexial periods are due to the abrupt death of most of the asexual Plasmodia , or to tlieir conversion into " resting stages , " etc. Nor do such speculations appear to be at all necessary .
It is easy to see that the survival of comparatively small numbers of the asexual forms will suffice to keep the infection alive , not only for the short periods observed by us , but for " relapses of long interval , " and for months or years .
Obviously , if only a few parasites per cubic millimetre are present , they may easily be overlooked in the small amount of blood ( say 01 cu .
mm. ) usually examined by thin film , and may then be reported as being absent : yet many millions may still exist Major B. Boss and Dr. D. Thomson .
[ Oct. 12 , in a patient who contains , say , 3,000,000 cu .
mm. of blood .
The speculation regarding parthenogenesis in malaria , and the case of Scliaudinn supposed to support it , have been criticised elsewhere by one of us ( R. R.).* In two of our relapsing cases ( 19 , 26 ) , no sexual forms at all were found during 35 different thick-film examinations .
Even if they were present in small numbers ( crescents do not collect in the spleen ) , yet the numbers of asexual parasites found in or just before the relapses%(24 and 400 per cu .
mm. ) cannot be explained by parthenogenesis unless we suppose that each sexual form produced by " gametoschizogony " 840 or 14,000 spores !
Until better evidence for such views is adduced , our results justify the doctrine that the malarial infection is kept continuously alive simply by the persistence of the asexual forms in varying numbers , and that fever occurs only when the forms are numerous enough to produce it .
9 .
The Effect of Quinine on the Asexual Forms.\#151 ; The destructive effect of the drug is , of course , everywhere recognised , though very little completely satisfactory statistical evidence can be cited in proof .
Many laborious researches have been made regarding the comparative utility of the various salts , but these have been confined almost entirely to estimating the rate and percentage of absorption , judged from urinary elimination .
The subject is of the greatest sanitary and medical importance ; but , so far as we can see , it can be usefully studied only by the more detailed enumerative analysis which we propose soon to undertake .
Our daily analysis gives a little more light ; but the following figures may be mentioned .
Cases 15 and 16 showed no asexual forms ; Cases 11 and 13 were so severe that quinine was given at once ; Cases 1 , 5 , 27 , 31 and 32 were so mild that quinine was withheld during the period of observation ; and in the remaining cases the drug was withheld only for some days ( except an occasional necessary dose ) , and was then given continuously while the parasites were still being counted .
We have therefore added together all the daily counts during the periods of no-quinine and quinine respectively .
With eight cases of P. vivax there were 45 no-quinine days , showing 104,032 total parasites , or an average of 2,312 a day ; and there were 74 quinine days , with 31,769 total parasites , or an average of only 429 a day ( one-fifth ) .
With P. falciparum ( 19 cases ) , 147 no-quinine days showed an average of 3,136 asexual forms , and 148 quinine days an average of 1,535 ( one-half ) .
We should have expected that the proportion of quiuine-day parasites would have been smaller ; but the no-quinine counts are diminished by the inclusion of the five mild cases and also by doses of 10 to 20 grains which were given on 10 isolated occasions .
On quinine days the doses were generally * ' Prevention of Malaria ' ( Murray , 1910 ) .
1910 .
] Sortie EnumerativeStudies on Malarial Fever .
20 to 30 grains a day , and Cases 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 and 16 , and parts of other cases are omitted because they were unsuitable .
Great falls in the number of parasites occurred , even without quinine , in Cases 5 , 17 and 26 ; while , on the other hand , small numbers of asexual forms remained in some cases for five or more days in spite of considerable daily dosage .
In Case 23 a severe relapse began six days after the stoppage of quinine tannate , which had been given for nine previous days in 10 to 30 grain doses daily .
No other relapses occurred after continuous quinine treatment ; but 12 occurred without it .
10 .
Observations on the Sexual Forms.\#151 ; It is , of course , generally held\#151 ; and probably quite rightly\#151 ; that these are developed ( by a cytological process not yet clearly seen ) from the asexual forms .
But , at the same time , no one has been able to note any correspondence between their numbers\#151 ; many of the former may be present when the latter are very scarce , and vice versa .
This rule , which is fully confirmed by our figures , has always been difficult to reconcile with the accepted theory of origin .
On comparing our curves , however , the remarkable fact was observed ( by I ) .
T. ) that there often seems to be indeed a correspondence , but that it is delayed for from 8 to 10 days\#151 ; that is , that the sexual curve tends to rise that number of days after a rise in the asexual curve .
Out of our 25 infections with P. falciparum 18 showed crescents , and of these Cases 14 , 22 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 and 30 suggest this phenomena , while in 17 and 20 , the rises are sufficiently isolated to show it most distinctly .
In Case 17 , asexual rises existed on the-1st to 3rd days , the 11th to 12th and the 21st to 22nd days , separated by apyrexial periods during which few asexual and no sexual forms were found ; but on the 30th day ( eight days after the last relapse ) crescents appeared for the first time .
In Case 20 , an asexual relapse commenced on the 17th day and reached its height on the 20th day .
A very few crescents had been found all the time ; but a marked rise in their numbers commenced on the 26th day and reached its height on the 28th day .
The most ready explanation is that the crescents require 8 to 10 days for development , during which they remain undetected , probably in the internal organs of the host .
This is confirmed by the fact that numerous small ones are seen at the commencement of a rise ; and also by the observation ( frequently made ) that in fresh infections the crescents seldom appear until a week or more after the first attack of fever .
Strong confirmation is also given by Case 6 , in which Dr. Fantham noted a sudden appearance of sexual forms ( P. on the lltli day , 7 to 10 days after the original asexual rise , and after the patient had been taking 30 grains of quinine daily for a week , suggesting that the same phenomenon holds for P. vivax also .
Major R Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
[ Oct. 12 , Other observations are as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) By no means every asexual rise is followed by a sexual one .
In seven cases ( 13 , 19 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 31 , 33 ) , no crescents at all were seen .
In Case 13 , a negro , 173,400 asexual forms per cubic millimetre failed to produce any ; and no crescents were observed in another negro ( Case 28 ) .
( 2 ) The number of crescents never exceeded 5 per cent , of asexual forms found in the generation which ( hypothetically ) produced them , and were generally in a much smaller proportion .
( 3 ) We could find no relation to youth , vigour , amount of haemoglobin , duration of infection ( from 3 to 30 weeks ) , or season of first infection .
( 4 ) The daily counts of crescents generally show marked daily variations , but we think that after considerable doses of quinine have been given for some days these daily variations tend to be smoothed out ( Cases 16 , 18 , 22 , 24 ) .
( 5 ) In Cases 15 , 14 and 16 particularly , a distinct tertian tendency was observed in the daily variations of crescents .
This appears not to have been previously noticed , but is just what would be expected in the case of a tertian parasite ; though , of course , the curve would be confused in a double tertian .
( 6 ) Sometimes the crescent curve suddenly rises with great rapidity , reaches its maximum , and then begins to fall on the next day with equal rapidity ; though , later , the fall often tends to be much more slow ( Cases 14 , 15 , 22 , 23 ) , especially when the numbers are very small .
Apparently , the greater the maximum the quicker the fall ( Cases 14 , 15 ) ; and the fall is sometimes jagged , with a tertian tendency ( ibid. ) .
( 7 ) Sometimes the maximum is irregularly maintained for a number of days ( Cases 16 , 18 , 24 ) , especially when quinine has not been previously given .
( 8 ) The crescents remained detectable for as many as 31 , 32 , 32 , 35 and 44 days in Cases 20 , 22 , 23 , 24 and 18 respectively ; and finally disappeared ( in 1 cu .
mm. of blood ) in Cases 1 , 11 , 12 , 16 , 21 and 23 .
From these data we think ( 1 ) that a varying percentage of asexual forms are constantly generating crescents , which , after about 8 to 10 days , appear in the peripheral blood .
Hence , when the asexual forms remain sufficiently numerous for a period , as when no quinine is given , the stock of crescents is being constantly replenished .
Thus the mortality among the older crescents is constantly being compensated for by new arrivals , and the total numbers appear to remain constant ; an appearance which has given rise to the generally accepted hypothesis ( perhaps erroneous ) that the crescents survive for weeks .
On the other hand , the sudden rise and fall of their numbers seen in Cases 14 , 15 , 22 and 23 suggest that they really survive only for a short time alter their appearance in the peripheral blood .
In Cases 16 and 24 , however , a few crescents were still found after quinine had been given continuously for 16 to 18 days , suggesting that some of them 1910 .

may be able to survive for longer periods .
In Cases 20 , 22 and 23 , they appeared in increasing numbers for 4 to 6 days after continuous 30-grain doses of quinine had been commenced , suggesting that the drug has no effect upon them when they have once been generated .
But quinine appears to affect the numbers of crescents indirectly by cutting off the source of supply .
Though many researches upon the effect of quinine on crescents ( a subject of the greatest sanitary importance ) have been attempted , so far as we know , the possibility of a constantly continued supply has not previously been taken into consideration .
We are continuing researches on the point .

The'Leucocytes were counted frequently , but not always daily ; at first by the hsemocytometer , but in the later 20 cases by the thick-film method .
The latter method has the advantages of putting the leucocytes closer together and of enabling us to estimate them at the same time with the parasites ; but , like the hsemocytometer , it is not very appropriate for differential counts , because of occasional uncertainty in distinguishing the various kinds .
Accordingly , these were made ( in six cases ) by thin film , 500 cells being examined on each occasion .
Our results are , as shown in all the cases , that during the pyrexial periods the total leucocytes are comparatively few , being frequently as low as 2000 to 3000 per cubic millimetre ( Cases 17,18 , 23,24 , etc. ) .
But as the asexual forms and the fever diminish , the total leucocyte curve rises , and about seven days later exceeds the normal , and may reach 20,000 and even , rarely , 30,000 per cubic millimetre ( Case 7)\#151 ; though this height is not maintained .
The very high counts seem to be associated with much quinine .
We observed generally that the so-called polymorphonuclear leucocytes , though rather few during the pyrexial periods , do not vary much from day to day , but about 7 days after the fever has abated their numbers are markedly increased and vary much .
The so-called mononuclear percentage was always in excess throughout the cases , even long after the disappearance of all forms of the parasites\#151 ; for six weeks afterwards in Case 1 , though quinine had been given daily during that period ( out of hospital ) .
We think , therefore , that a high mononuclear percentage is likely to be always of value in diagnosis in the absence of parasites .
The normal ratio of total mononuclears to polymorphonuclears is about 35 per cent. , but in our cases it was often 60 per cent , and in Case 30 reached 80 per cent. It tends to fall slightly with great improvement in health .
During the individual daily paroxysms , as shown by Stephens and Christophers , the total mononuclears are rather low during the height of the fever , but show a marked increase during the following remission .
This increase is chiefly due to the large mononuclears .
This process is repeated with each paroxysm , and if a paroxysm fails the 172 Major R. Ross and Dr. D. Thomson .
[ Oct. 12 , mononuclears remain ( Case 9 especially ) .
But we could not find these variations in the absence of fever and many parasites .
This mononuclear reaction , which we have also seen in our case of trypanosomiasis , appears to be exactly comparable to the polymorphonuclear reaction described by F. W. Andrewes* as generally occurring in bacterial diseases .

Various Therapeutic Agents.\#151 ; Methylene blue was tried in three cases in 12-grain daily doses ; the parasites diminished , but we cannot draw any conclusions from the figures .
In Case 24 , altogether 36 grains of soamine were injected intramuscularly in 5 to 10 grain doses on five occasions during 12 days , and yet a smart relapse occurred during and after the last dose .
In the same case , just before the same relapse , X-rays had been applied over the spleen and abdomen for 20 minutes .
The asexual parasite rise had commenced before the application .
In Case 24 , faradic and galvanic currents were applied over the spleen , each for 10 minutes , but crescent counts made immediately before and two hours after the application remained unaltered .

Hcemoglobin.\#151 ; This was estimated in most of the later cases .
The percentage always fell during fever , and began to rise rapidly shortly afterwards , proving the destructive effect of the parasites and the rapid recuperation of the patients .
The greatest fall was 25 per cent , after four days ' fever ( Case 20 ) ; hut more detailed work is required to trace correspondence with the number of parasites .
The lowest percentage found was 53 per cent. All the patients were anaemic at first , but the haemoglobin rose rapidly with improvement of health , and very rapidly in the more vigorous subjects .
We decided not to attempt counts of red corpuscles , as these have been made so frequently already .
The elimination of the haemoglobin ana the findings in a case of blackwater fever will be dealt with in the following paper by Dr. Simpson and in one by ourselves.*)* 14 .
Summary.\#151 ; ( 1 ) There is a very decided correlation between the number of asexual Plasmodia found in the peripheral blood and the fever .
( 2 ) As a rule , no fever exists unless the asexual forms exceed some hundreds per cubic millimetre .
( 3 ) The asexual forms do not always disappear between relapses ( as often thought ) but tend to persist in small numbers per cubic millimetre , and often increase again for some days before the actual febrile relapse occurs .
( 4 ) These observations give a coherent theory of the malarial invasion , according to which the infection is kept alive indefinitely by the ordinary sporulation of the asexual forms , and not by parthenogenesis or by resistant * ' Lancet , ' June , July , 1910 .

forms : and fever recurs only when the parasites are numerous enough to produce it .
( 5 ) We estimate from our cases that considerable continued doses of quinine reduced the asexual forms by 50 to 80 per cent. ( 6 ) There are strong reasons for supposing that the sexual forms require eight to ten days for development ; that the often noticed long persistence of crescents is not due to their long life ( as generally thought ) but to constant replenishment of the stock by fresh broods ; that they sometimes show a distinct tertian periodicity ; and that quinine does not affect them when once generated , but ultimately reduces their numbers by destroying the generating cells .
The sexual forms were never seen to produce fever .
( 7 ) The leucocytes are below normal during febrile periods and above normal afterwards .
The percentage of mononuclears rises greatly after paroxysms , and is always in excess of the normal .
( 8 ) Methylene blue , soamine , X-rays , and faradic and galvanic currents had no results in a few experiments .
( 9 ) The haemoglobin falls markedly with fever , but rises rapidly with convalescence .
( 10 ) The faecal urobilin shows marked correlation with the occurrence of fever , and is specially studied in the accompanying paper by Dr. G. C. E. Simpson.* Many other deductions may be based on our observations , but will be better considered after more detailed counts have been made .
