) The rate at which uric acid is turned out of the body is very different at different times of the day , even when the food contains no ready-made purine derivatives .
It is higher during the early hours of the day than at any time , and it is considerably lower at night .
The reason for this , as .
was pointed out by one of us , * is not likely to be that the excretory functions are depressed at night , since these functions , to judge from the total nitrogen of the urine , are more active during the first hours of sleep than at any time in the 24 hours .
And since , when the diet is confined to bread , butter , and milk , the uric acid must be derived from the body substance and not from the food , it seems probable that there is some function of the body which is in abeyance during sleep and is , to a considerable degree , responsible for the output of uric acid ; some function , that is to say , which is effected by chemical reactions involving the production of uric acid , and of nothing else that can be detected in the urine , unless it be phosphoric acid , and possibly in some measure creatinine .
If it is possible to identify this function , the activity of which can , on a suitable diet , be measured by the amount of uric acid excreted , it may be possible to give a clearer account of the processes by which , at the onset of fever , the temperature of the body can be sent up independently of any voluntary muscular activity ; for while the temperature is rising , the output of uric acid may be four times as great as it otherwise would be.f Similarly , in the study of other pathological conditions in which uric acid plays a part , it must be of importance to be able to point to the kind of activity which is accompanied by increased uric acid production .
The following series of observations , which we have worked out conjointly , was designed to show how the reaction of the body to loss of heat on the one hand , and the heat produced by ordinary muscular exertions on the other , might affect the amount of uric acid in the urine .
It was the outcome of several earlier , as yet unpublished , experiments , which * J. B. Leathes , 'Journal of Physiology , ' vol. 35 , p. 125 , 1906 .

[ June 22 , pointed , though less clearly , to the same conclusions as we think may be drawn from this one .
A diet was taken by the subject of the experiment ( E. P. C. ) which consisted of 2 quarts of milk ( 2*28 L. ) , 12 ozs .
of bread ( 360 grammes ) , 4 ozs .
of cheese ( 120 grammes ) , and 2 ozs .
of butter ( 60 grammes ) .
This was distributed equally over six identical meals taken every three hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The urine was collected immediately before each meal , and in each sample the total nitrogen ( Kjeldahl ) , the creatinine ( Folin ) , the uric acid ( Folin ) , and the phosphoric acid ( by titration with uranium acetate ) was estimated , and the hourly rate of output calculated for each period of the day .
The diet was taken from May 17 till June 4 .
On the first two days the urine was collected for 24 hours and mixed before analysis .
On the eighth day of the diet , May 24 , two and three-quarter hours were spent stripped at a swimming bath .
For the greater part of this time the subject of the experiment stood about , and entered the water only from time to time as the skin became dry , the object being to lose heat with as little compensatory production of heat by voluntary exertion of the muscles as possible .
The rectal temperature was reduced in this way from 100'*8 , at 2.50 p.m. immediately after undressing and after the 10 minutes ' walk to the bath , to 97''7 just before dressing again at 5.30 .
The reading at 4 p.m. was 98''8 , and at 5 p.m. 98 ' .
The temperature of the water was 71 ' , and that of the air 64 ' .
At fairly frequent intervals spasmodic attacks of shivering came on , but these were not so severe as in a " rigor .
" Although the body temperature fell 3 ' F. , the greater part of this fall would have occurred even with clothing , as the observations taken every three hours throughout the whole experiment showed that a rectal temperature of 98''8 , or even slightly less , was normal for this time of day on abstaining from muscular activity .
The body temperature , therefore , fell barely a degree beyond the normal range of variations , and the regulating function was not seriously overtaxed .
This was the result aimed at , as a previous experiment had shown that a more severe and rapid removal of body heat introduced disturbing factors and gave a different result .
The effect on the output of uric acid was to increase it more than 80 per cent , in comparison with the mean of the four preceding days .
The figures observed are given in Column C of Table I appended .
Three days later , May 27 , the exposure to cold was repeated , only with this difference that active muscular exertions were introduced .
The subject was stripped for two and three-quarter hours and kept his skin wet by repeated immersion in , and sponging with , cold water , T. ' 59 to 60 .

] On Uric Acid and Heat Production in the Body .
543 the intervals quick-running movements , maintained for five minutes at a time , and dumb-bell exercises , sufficient to cause pronounced hyperpnoea , were carried out .
In this way actual shivering was almost entirely avoided , although the periods of immersion , longer than those on the 24th , and the sponging with water 10 ' colder than that at the swimming bath , the measures that is for removing body heat , were more drastic than on the former occasion .
The body temperature , which was 100''4 at 4.10 p.m. when the treatment began , was still 100 ' at 5.30 ; it was lowest ( 98'*8 ) at 6.30 , but was slightly raised again ( 99'*1 ) at 6.50 , when the treatment ended .
The effect on the output of uric acid , shown in Column D of Table I , was in the succeeding 24 hours to increase it , but only to about half the extent to which it was increased by the cold without muscular exertions three days before , and if the comparison be made with the output of the 24 hours immediately preceding , i.e. , 312 milligrammes , the increase is less than 20 per cent. , and during the three hours of the treatment the output was remarkably low .
Three days later , on May 30 , the subject of the experiment , dressed in winter clothing , with , in addition , a thick knitted jersey , spent the greater part of two and three-quarter hours in severe muscular exertions .
At 3.10 p.m. , with the rectal temperature at 99'*8 , a sharp walk of 2\ miles , lasting half an hour , raised the temperature to 102'*4 .
Then , after an interval of a quarter of an hour for food , a heavy floor rubber was worked to and fro for half an hour , at the end of which time the temperature was 101'*8 .
The walking was then repeated ( T. ' 102*1 ) and finally the work with the rubber for half an hour more giving a temperature at 5.50 p.m. of 102 ' .
The output of uric acid fell from 311 milligrammes in the preceding 24 hours to 223 in those including and succeeding the exercise .
The figures are given in Column E of Table I. Finally , four days later , on June 4 , an attempt was made to repeat the experimental conditions of the first exposure to cold on May 24 in the swimming bath .
It was not possible to do this exactly , because the air temperature was 8 ' lower , 56 ' F. , and at this temperature the loss of heat was sufficient to cause shivering , which was fairly continuous for two hours .
The body temperature was 98'*4 at 4 p.m. as compared with 98'*8 at the same time on the earlier occasion , but at 5.30 , just before dressing , it was a trifle higher than the first time , 98 ' instead of 97''7 .
Whether these differences in the conditions account for the result shown in Column E , which is of the same character though not so pronounced as that in Column C , we are not yet prepared to say .
The output in the 24 hours preceding the final exposure Dr. E. P. Cathcart and Mr. J. B. Leathes .
[ June 22 was 311 milligrammes , this was raised to 386 milligrammes .
This is less than the output on the former occasion , but , as on that occasion , the figures for each of the periods in the 24 hours are above the average and particularly that for the period ending at 7 p.m. , which included the greater part of the exposure to cold .
On May 19 , the third day of the diet , the body weight was 70-5 kilogrammes ; on June 4 it had risen to 73*2 kilogrammes .
The results of this experiment point to the inference that one of the factors largely concerned with the production of uric acid in the body and its appearance in the urine is the reaction of the body to loss of heat ; and that a part , it may be a large part , of the endogenous uric acid is , so to speak , the-chemical expression for the intensity of this reaction ; further , that this reaction involves some form of activity distinct from voluntary movements of the skeletal muscles , since such voluntary movements have , on the contrary , , the effect of diminishing the output of uric acid , at any rate while they are going on .
At the same time we are not prepared to say that the activity for which , the chemical expression is the output of uric acid , has no other physiological expression than heat production in response to increased loss of heat .
That , indeed , would not at all represent our view .
For it is at any rate clear , from-this experiment taken by itself , that the reaction set up by exposure to cold may last on for a considerable time after the exposure .
A glance at the column in Table II , in which the output of uric acid for each 24 hours throughout the experiment is shown , makes it obvious that the interval of * three days that elapsed between each abnormal phase of the experiment was not sufficient to allow a complete return of the rate of output to its value in the days before the first exposure .
The nature of the activity concerned in this reaction to cold , and certain other points arising out of the data in Table II , will be entered into more fully on another occasion .
