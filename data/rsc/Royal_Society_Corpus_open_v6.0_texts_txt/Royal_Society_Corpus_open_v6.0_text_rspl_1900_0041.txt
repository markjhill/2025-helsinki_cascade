This expedition was one of those organised by the Joint Permanent Eclipse Committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society , funds being provided from a grant made by the Government Grant Committee .
The following were the principal objects which I had in view in arranging the expedition:\#151 ; To obtain a long series of photographs of the chromosphere and flash spectrum , including regions of the sun 's surface in mid-latitudes , and near one of the poles .
The photographs to be obtained with a long focus prismatic camera , on a large scale , in order to be able to discriminate clearly between high levels and low levels in the chromosphere .
The photographs to include as much as possible of the ultra-violet region of the spectrum , for the purpose of verifying the results obtained with a smaller instrument in 1898 , and to give more accurate values of the wave-lengths determined from those results .
This report may be conveniently divided into the following four sections , viz.:\#151 ; 1 .

( 1 ) Selection of Observing Station .
A consideration of the conditions under which the lowest layers of the chromosphere are presented during a total solar eclipse showed that a very great advantage would be gained by selecting a station situated near the limit of the zone of total eclipse , where the two internal contacts would be separated by a small angle on the sun 's limb .
At such a station the motion of the moon relative to the sun is in a direction approximating to parallelism with a tangent to the sun 's limb at the points of internal contact , the result being that the excessively shallow layer giving rise to the so-ca'led " flash spectrum " is .
Solar Eclipse of May 28 , 1900 .
occulted by the moon comparatively slowly .
Much more time isi therefore available for taking a series of photographs than is the case at stations near the central line of the eclipse , where the moon 's motion is at right angles to the layer , and opportunities for obtaining photographs of the very lowest strata are reduced to a fraction of a second only at each internal contact .
I decided therefore to choose some point situated well within the zone of total eclipse , but so far from the central line that the two ' internal contacts would be separated by an angle of about 39 ' on the sun 's limb .
This would give a duration of totality equal to one-third that at the nearest point on the central line ; and the time available for photographing the flash spectrum would not be less than 30 seconds .
At mid-eclipse the moon 's limb would overlap the photosphere about 1 " , so that even at that time the flash spectrum layer would not be entirely hidden .
Under these circumstances , also , one of the contacts would take place at , or very near to , one of the poles of the sun , the other being in latitude 51 ' .
A succession of photographs taken during totality " would therefore give a series of images of the flash spectrum ranging from solar latitude 51 ' to the pole .
In selecting the most suitable station , dryness of climate was considered to be the most important factor for securing extension of the spectra in the ultra violet ; I therefore selected Algeria in preference to Spain , although the altitude of the sun would be less in the former country .
The best position in Algeria for realising the greatest solar altitude was a point on the coast west of Algiers , and on the southern border of the eclipse track .
This region was therefore decided upon at the outset , and in order to realise the favourable conditions mentioned above , two stations were selected provisionally beforehand , and for these Dr. Downing kindly computed for me the durations of totality according to the data used by the Nautical Almanac Office .
The first station , near to the village of Zeralda , was found by him to have a duration of 45 seconds , i.e. , more than one-half the central line duration .
The other station , three miles further south , and near tO ' Maelma , was computed to have a duration of 29*5 seconds with a. possible error of \#177 ; 10 seconds .
As the required conditions would , apparently , be very nearly fulfilled , at the latter station , I decided to place my camp either at that precise spot , or at some point situated on a line passing through it , and parallel to the direction of the shadow track in that region .
The actual station eventually chosen was 6'5 kilometres distant from the station near Maelma , in a direction bearing West 25 ' North .
Here it was estimated that totality would last 30 seconds .
Unfortunately , as .
the event proved , the value of the diameter of the moon adopted by : Mr. J. Evershed .
\#166 ; our Nautical Almanac Office is too large , and the limits of error given above were very misleading .
Instead of a duration of 30 seconds , the eclipse at my station was never quite total .
( 2 ) Instruments , Methods of Mounting , and General Arrangement of .
It was my intention originally to take out a fine 18-inch silver-on-glass concave mirror made by the brothers Henri , which was given to me by the late Mr. Ranyard , This mirror , having a focal length of 117 inches , would have given images on a scale of 1*08 inch to the sun 's diameter Many experiments were made with this mirror to determine the amount of aberration produced on star images at considerable distances from the axis , and with various apertures .
It was found that when the ratio of aperture to focal length did not exceed 1/ 15 , good images were obtained 4 ' from the normal axis , the aberration being very slight .
As this would admit of a very wide range of spectrum being photographed with good definition throughout , I decided to adapt my large reflecting telescope for eclipse work .
Owing , however , to the difficulty of obtaining a prism of large angle and not less than 6 inches aperture , I had , most unfortunately , to abandon this scheme and construct a much smaller apparatus .
Through the kindness of Dr. Rambaut I eventually obtained a fine 4-inch prism of light flint glass and 45 degrees angle .
This prism , which was generously placed at my disposal by Sir Howard Grubb , proved most efficient for the work , although I was unable to utilise the full aperture .
Three spectrographs were finally made : a reflecting prismatic camera \#166 ; of 3 inches aperture and 74 inches focus , an ordinary prismatic camera of 2 inches aperture and 47 inches focus , and a quartz prismatic camera of 1 inch aperture and 24 inches focus .
These were mounted together inside an observing hut , and were supplied with light from a 12-inch \#166 ; coelostat .
The Reflecting Prismatic Camera .
This was an ordinary reflecting telescope with a mirror of 9 inches aperture and 74 inches focus .
It was fitted with a strong wooden tube , adapted for carrying two large prisms near the upper end .
The prisms used were the 4-inch 45-degree prism , lent me by Sir Howard Grubb , and a 3-inch 60-degree prism lent me by Dr. Common .
These were mounted eccentrically within the tube , in such a manner that the incident light , after passing through the prisms , made an angle of about 1^ ' with the normal axis of the mirror .
After reflection from the mirror the rays returned over the upper surface of the 60-degree prism , and came to focus about an inch outside the end of the tube .
Solar Eclipse of May 28 , 1900 .
373 The end of the tube was closed by a block of wood having an aperture 8 , inches long by 3 inches wide , a little above the middle .
Outside this a long slide was arranged , at right angles to the telescope , and bolted at the upper end to two stay rods attached to the telescope near the mirror .
s A plate holder , 3 feet long by 10 inches wide , taking two plates 81-inches square and four plates 8| by 4^ inches , was arranged to move along the slide by means of rackwork and a pinion wheel .
One revolution of the pinion moved the plates 2'13 inches , whereby four images could be obtained on the square plates and two on each of the narrow ones ; the sixteen images all being equal distances apart and symmetrically placed on the plates .
The revolutions of the pinion wheel were controlled by a spring catch acting on the crank handle , and holding it firmly in position after each revolution .
The .whole slide , carrying the plate holder , \amp ; c. , was attached to the telescope in such a way that the distance of the plates from the mirror could be varied a small amount for focussing .
The tube of the instrument was firmly bolted down to the sloping side of a solid pier of stone and cement , built up within the observing hut near the north end .
It was adjusted so that the plane of dispersion of the prisms was in a meridian passing through the coelostat , and inclined to the prime meridian 68 ' ( the hour angle of the sun at mid-eclipse ) .
The dispersion was therefore in a north and south ' direction .
The internal contacts were computed to occur near to the south point of the sun , and on either side of it .
The centre of the flash spectrum arcs was therefore midway between the edges of the spectrum in the photographs obtained at mid-eclipse .
The 21-inch Prismatic Camera .
This instrument was the same which I employed successfully at the Indian eclipse in 1898 , excepting that it was fitted with a specially corrected l , ens of 47 inches focus instead of the visual objective previously used .
The images were therefore on a somewhat larger scale , and larger plates were used .
The sliding plate holder , constructed on the same lines as the larger instrument already described , was made to hold three plates , 6^ by 4^ inches , placed lengthwise in the holder ] and the crank handle moving the slide was arranged to stop at each half revolution , moving the plates 1*12 inches between each exposure .
\#166 ; The two 60 ' prisms of this instrument are made of specially selected crown glass , and are exceptionally transparent for ultra-violet [ rays .

struments were arranged nearly parallel , the 2-inch spectrograph being screwed to the side of the reflector with its aperture alongside that of the latter .
The camera end with the sliding plate holder was at the lower end .
The Quartz Prismatic Camera .
This was rigged up while in camp , as it was found that a small portion of the ccelostat mirror was available to supply light .
It consists of two double quartz prisms of 60 ' and 40 ' angle respectively , each prism having 1^-inch square faces ; and a single quartz lens of 24 inches focus .
It was screwed on the top of the 2-inch spectrograph , with its aperture just within the elliptical beam of light from the ccelostat .
My brother arranged a very convenient exposing shutter , which he was to open near mid-eclip3e for a single exposure of 10 seconds .
Methods of Focussing.\#151 ; All three spectrographs were approximately focussed by taking a series of photographs of the spectrum of Venus .
; Having determined the focus of the reflecting prismatic camera in this way within very narrow limits , I used this instrument as a collimator for the 2-inch spectrograph , removing the large prisms , and adjusting a slit in the position occupied by the plates when photographing Venus .
The 2-inch instrument was attached to the wall of the hut , with its aperture inside the tube of the reflector , and directed towards the mirror .
With the north door of the hut widely open , the slit was illumined by light from the sky , and a series of photographs was obtained of the Fraunhofer spectrum .
For some reason the focus was not so sharply defined , and the definition of the lines was not so good as in photographs I had obtained by the same method before leaving England .
A third method was therefore tried .
After having adjusted the 2-inch spectrograph in its correct place , photographs were obtained of the sun itself on Sandell triple plates ; the focus being determined by the images which were most sharply defined along the edges .
A final method , which was adopted for the two larger instruments , was to adjust the focus visually during the eclipse itself , using the Fraunhofer lines , which become sharply defined shortly before totality .
Programme of Exposures.\#151 ; The two larger prismatic cameras were each to have sixteen exposures made simultaneously , by removing a plate of aluminium from the common aperture of the two instruments .
The first , second , fifteenth , and sixteenth exposure were to be of about 1 second duration each , and the remaining exposures of 2 seconds duration , excepting the exposure nearest to mid-eclipse , which was to have 10 seconds .
The quartz prismatic camera was to be exposed near mid-eclipse also for 10 seconds .
Solar Eclipse of May 28 , 1900 .
37 5 :\lt ; These relatively long exposures were designed to secure density in the ultra violet , at the risk of over-exposing in the region near G. Having ascertained by rehearsing that the time required for exposing all the plates would be about 90 seconds , I arranged that the first exposure should be timed at 45 seconds before the computed time of mid-eclipse The succeeding exposures were to follow each other at the shortest intervals , turning the handles deliberately , and allowing ample time for shake to subside before each exposure .
I was to use my discretion to some extent in making the long exposure at mid-eclipse , but otherwise 1 intended to bo guided solely by the chronometer .
The exposures were to be made by myself , standing at the north door of the hut and facing the large spectrograph .
I used my left hand to work the exposing shutter , and my right to rack the plates forward in the slide .
My brother , sitting on his bed in the hut , was to move the plates of the 2 inch spectrograph , turning the handle half a revolution after each exposure .
He was also to expose the quartz spectrograph at a signal from me .
% The Coelos A 12-inch coelostat was used to supply light to the three spectrographs in the hut .
It was placed about 6 feet from the north-east corner of the hut , and was arranged to reflect the sun in a meridional plane j the angle between the incident and reflected beam being in | this case a minimum , viz. , declination of sun x 2 .
The reflected beam was in a direction W. 30 ' S. , and was directed upward at an I angle of 3| ' with the horizontal .
The instrument was mounted on a steel plate fixed on the top of a I masonry pier , and about 3 feet from the ground .
The plate had a I straight channel cut in it just wide enough to take the ends of two of I the four levelling screws , the other two resting on the planed surface I of the plate . .
With the plate placed approximately level and the channel approxi-I mately north and south , the whole instrument could be shifted bodily I north or south without disturbing the adjustments of the axis in I altitude and azimuth .
In this way the adjustment of the beam of light I with respect to the apertures of the three spectrographs was very I easily managed , and the coelostat could be shifted about to suit the I varying declination of the sun on occasions , previous to the eclipse , !
when it waa desired to observe the spectrum and adjust the spectro- I graphs .
% .
\#163 ; " | The coelostat was provided with slow motion independent of the ?
driving gear , and this was controlled from inside the hut by means of a | rod , 8 feet long , which my brother laboriously cut from a 3-inch plank .
Mr. J. Evershed .
The driving clock was bolted down to the north end of the ccelostat pier .
It was driven by a weight suspended from a large tripod erected near .
The %\-inch Telescope .
In addition to the photographic instruments I had a 3J-inch equatorial telescope , and a high dispersion solar spectroscope .
The telescope was mounted on a packing case outside the hut , and was useful in a variety of ways .
With the spectroscope attached it was used for the observation of solar prominences on the day of the eclipse , and on several other occasions .
The Observing Hut .
This was a rectangular wooden shed , the sides enclosing a space 14 by 9 feet and 6 feet high .
The sloping roof was covered with boards up to about 1 foot from the centre beam .
A large sheet of canvas was stretched above the boards , leaving an air space between : this allowed of the free circulation of air between the canvas and the wood , and was designed to prevent the interior from becoming unbearably hot during the day .
This arrangement , however , was anything but water-tight , as we found to our cost during a spell of bad weather .
We subsequently^ procured a large rick cover , which was tied securely over the canvas and down to the ground on the weather side of the hut .
This hut was designed by my brother for the accommodation of the somewhat unwieldy reflecting spectrograph and two camp beds .
Th\#174 ; frame was constructed by him before leaving England .
The accompanying ground plan shows the general arrangement of the camp .
( 3 ) Narrative of Expedition and Observations made on the Bay of the * Eclipse .
The expedition , consisting of my brother ( Mr. Harry Evershed ) and myself , left England on April 30th , and travelling Paris and Marseilles arrived at Algiers on May 3rd .
: At Algiers we received every attention and assistance from the British Consul-General , Mr. Hay Newton , to whom our acknowledgments are due .
He procured for us a letter from the Prefecture to the Mayor of Maelma , ordering the latter to assist us in every possible way in selecting a site for our camp .
^ ^ We also received assistance and advice from M. Tr^pied , of the Algiers Observatory , who very kindly called at our hotel and discussed with us our plan of operations .

Having obtained letters of introduction to some landowners in the district we intended to occupy , we went at once to the village of Zeralda , about 20 miles west from Algiers , and making this our headquarters for a few days we explored the neighbouring country .
The people to whom my brother had letters received us with the greatest civility , and we desire to mention in particular M. Buloff , Mr. J. Evershed .
administrator of the ' estatel of the Comte de Perigord , and formerly Professor at Stonyhurst .
This gentleman was much interested in our mission , and we are practically indebted to him for giving us a letter to a colonist , M. Alvado , upon whose farm near the sea coast we eventually found an excellent site for our camp .
It was evident at the outset that the wild hilly region near the village of Maelma would be more difficult of access than the country further west near the coast .
Maelma itself we found to be poverty-stricken and unpromising .
The mayor , whom we found in his mairie busy with the coming elections , was obliging enough to visS our document from the Prefecture ; or rather he got his secretary to do so , being unable himself , apparently , to read or write .
Having had our letter duly visM we abandoned Maelma , and proceeded to the Mazafran River , near the coast , to conclude negotiations already entered into with Alvado .
These presented no difficulty , for M. Alvado was " un homme tres brave , " and offered us his whole territory , vineyards or cornfields , for our camping-ground .
We were , however , limited in our choice to a line bearing West and 24| degrees North from Maelma , in order to secure the same duration of totality as had been computed for that place .
The position finally chosen was near to the mouth of the Mazafran River on the east side , and about 1 kilometre from the sea .
The position of the Mazafran bridge , about 400 metres distant , was ascertained from a recent survey to be North latitude ... ... ... ... 36 ' 41 ' 35 " East longitude ... ... ... ... .
2 48 30 The position of the camp , which my brother carefully determined by triangulation from the bridge , was as follows :\#151 ; North latitude ... ... ... ... 36 ' 41 ' 47 " East longitude ... ... ... ... .
2 48 41 It was 17 metres above sea-level , and 6'5 kilometres from the station near Maelma , in a direction bearing West 25 ' North .
As the direction of the shadow track in this region was ascertained to be 24 ' 39 ' North of West , we concluded that the above position would be safe for a duration of 30 seconds of totality .
Having settled all preliminaries we returned to Algiers to arrange for the transport of the instruments .
This was effected without difficulty by means of the light railway recently constructed from Algiers to the Mazafran .
On May 9th we returned to Alvado 's farm , and the next day the work of erection was begun .
Solar Eclipse of May 28 , 1900 .
S7^ Our hut , which was to serve as sleeping and living room as well as observatory , we had ready for occupation the same evening .
During the fortnight preceding the eclipse , our time was fully occupied in erecting and adjusting the three spectrographs , coelostat , and other instruments , and in taking trial photographs for determining focus .
We also made daily observations of the sun with a sextant and artificial horizon for determining time , and checking the rate of a chronometer which we had hired for use in our camp .
Being far from any telegraph station in direct communication with Algiers , we were obliged to depend entirely on observation for our time on the day of the eclipse .
Working with instruments of very second-rate quality , my brother usually succeeded in determining local time within one or two seconds of error , taking the mean of a day 's set of observations ( usually employing the method of double altitudes ) .
During the whole time we were in camp , we were ably assisted by our host , M. Alvado , who took a most intelligent interest in all our operations , and was ever ready and at hand to help us in any and every difficulty with which we were confronted .
We take this opportunity of expressing our high appreciation of his services , and esteem for his character , and that of his wife , Madame Alvado .
The latter attended most assiduously to all our personal wants , and in this way furthered most materially the objects of the expedition .
Observations made on the Day of the Eclipse .
Between 6 and 7 A.M , on May 28th I observed in the spectroscope ; the position angles and approximate heights of all the prominences then visible on the sun 's limb .
The results were then written out in accordance with a previously arranged code , and sent on to Zeralda to be telegraphed to Mr. A. C. D. Crommelin , at Algiers , for the use of intending observers of the coronal structure near to prominences .
The following table gives the position angles and heights observed:\#151 ; Position angle .

Soon after noon all slides were filled ready for the eclipse ; and lastly , the 9-inch mirror and the coelostat mirror were both dusted and carefully polished with rouge to remove all trace of tarnish .
3'60 Mr. J. Evershed .
Fifteen minutes before mid-eclipse the large spectrograph was slightly readjusted-for focus by observing with a lens the spectrum image of the diminishing crescent .
This was effected without any difficulty or uncertainty .
I then attempted to focus the 2-inch spectrograph in the same way , using the Fraunhofer lines near G , which were then rapidly becoming sharply defined .
As the last determination made photographically appeared to be correct , I set it again to the same position .
Five minutes before mid-eclipse my brother wound up the coelostat clock , and three minutes later I gave the order " Stand by .
" The light waned rapidly , and I began the exposures at 4'1 16m 58s .
At 4h 17m 30s I found it difficult to see the seconds hand of the chronometer , and a few seconds later I opened for the 10-second exposure , giving at the same time the signal to expose the quartz spectrograph .
The absence of any sound from the shutter warned us that the latter had failed to act .
At 4h 18m I could again see the chronometer face clearly .
I continued the exposures according to the programme , finishing the last at 4h 18m 18s .
A minute or two later , after removing all the plate holders from their slides , I observed the large prominences on the south-west limb in the spectrosoope attached to the 3-inch telescope .
They appeared , of course , exceedingly brilliant in the line Ha .
Unfortunately , I was unable to make a critical examination of the spectrum , for at this time a crowd of sight-seers inundated the entire camp , and further observation for the time being was impossible .
Later , 1 observed the time of last contact with the spectroscope .
This took place at 5h 21ni 34s per clock .
+ 58 assumed error of clock .
At this moment the moon 's limb was seen as a black line projected on the chromosphere .
( 4 ) Results .
Notwithstanding the fact that my station was outside the zone of total eclipse , * the photographs show that there was quite half a minute * From the descriptions given us immediately after the eclipse by M. Alvado and others who undertook to determine accurately the duration of totality , it appeared certain that the photosphere never wholly disappeared , a small point of sunlight remaining visible at the moment of mid-eclipse .
The edge of the moon 's shadow was , moreover , clearly seen traversing the sea and the sand dunes a short distance north of our camp , which escaped the shadow by a few hundred metres only .

available for obtaining good images of the flash spectrum No. 9 spectrum , for instance , is one of the finest of the series , and shows about as many bright lines as the mid-eclipse photograph yet it was \#166 ; exposed 15 seconds before mid-eclipse .
Several other photographs taken earlier than No. 9 also show a large number of flash spectrum ^Tthink this result demonstrates the very great advantage gained at stations near the limit of total eclipse for studying this spectrum .
In cleaning the lens of the quartz spectrograph shortly before the eclipse , I unfortunately jammed the exposing shutter in such a way that it would not work at the critical time , and no photograph was obtained with this instrument .
, Sixteen photographs were obtained with the 2-mch spectrograph , .and sixteen with the reflecting spectrograph .

and at the edges of several of the spectra , where the direction of the .

lines , the focus appears to be quite perfect through the whole length of the spectrum .
This suggests that the lens , which was a thin one , was under some strain in its cell , and it accounts for the difficulty experienced in finding the true focus .
In the mid-eclipse photograph ( No. 11 ) the bright lines are fairly well defined at the extreme end of the spectrum , and they can be traced in this photograph to X 3320 .
All the lines between X 3340 and X 3500 can be identified with those shown on the best plate obtained in 1898 .
The following table gives the wave-lengths and identifications of these lines as determined for the spectrum obtained in India .
In identifying the lines with the elements given in column 4 , I received great assistance from Mr. L. E. Jewell , who also supplied me with a revised list of wave-length values for the solar lines given in column 5 .

The sixteen images of the cusp and flash spectra obtained with the reflecting spectrograph are in good focus throughout.* Each spectrum * The very strong chromosphere arcs , such as H and K , show a faint coma on the more refrangible side .
This has since been traced to slight irregular refraction at the base of the 60 ' prism .
The fault is , however , too slight to appreciably affect the definition of any but the strongest lines .
384 Solar Eclipse of May 28,1900 .
is 8 inches long , and extends from A 350 to A 510 .
The width corresponding to the sun 's diameter is 0'68 inch .
The finer flash spectrum lines in many of the photographs are particularly well defined in the ultra-violet .
The first four photographs of the series are much over-exposed and fogged , and only the stronger chromosphere arcs are visible at the edge of the continuous spectrum .
In the succeeding images , the sky illumination becoming much diminished , the bright lines show up clearly on a light background .
In No. 9 the flash spectrum is fully developed in a rift in the continuous spectrum .
This rift extends from position angle 140 ' to 148 ' , and includes a region between 67 ' and 75 ' south latitude .
The bright lines crossing the rift are beautifully defined throughout the spectrum , and in the ultra violet they can be traced nearly as far as the continuous spectrum .
The Fraunhofer lines are well defined upon the continuous spectrum , where the latter has not been over-exposed , and the whole spectrum in the ultra-violet is a mixture of bright and dark lines .
Accurate determinations of ware-length will result from the measurement of this negative .
No. 11 .
This was exposed for 10 seconds at the greatest phase of the eclipse .
The continuous spectrum is broken up into five narrow bands , and the flash spectrum lines form long arcs crossing the bands .
Most of these arcs extend over nearly 80 ' of the limb , and cover the entire south polar region , from latitude -75 ' on the east side to latitude - 28 ' on the west ... ... ... ... . .
The bright lines on this negative are more strongly impressed than on any of the others , and they can be clearly traced up to the end of the continuous spectrum at A 350 .
The dark lines of the Fraunhofer spectrum are still traceable on the narrow strips of continuous spectrum .
This negative will give good wave-length determinations for all the finer lines between A 350 and A 510 .
Good images of the flash spectrum are also impressed on photographs Nos. 10 , 12 , and 13 .
" " General Conclusions .
( 1 ) In its main features the flash spectrum at the south pole of the sun is the same as in low latitudes .
( 2 ) No essential change is shown after an interval of four years ; the spectra photographed by Shackleton , in 1896 , and those obtained in 1898 and 1900 , all appear to be identical so far as it has been possible to compare them .
( 3 ) The flash spectrum , therefore , is probably as constant a feature of the solar surface as is the Fraunhofer spectrum .

With regard to instruments , the reflecting prismatic camera has Droved to he a most efficient form of spectrograph for eclipse work The uniform focus over the entire range of spectrum , and the facility with which the adjustment for focus can be effected , are advantages which those who have worked with prismatic cameras will ^Another important advantage in the use of the reflector is the proximity of the exposing shutter to the plate holder , both of which can easily be controlled by one person .
There is no signalling-between the man at the plates and the man at the shutter .
There is again the advantage that there is no selective absorption of ultra-violet rays which occurs in lenses , and if the mirror is freshly polished there is no selective reflection for any of the rays which can , Fin concluding , I have to acknowledge my great indebtedness to my brother for his untiring devotion to the interests of the expedition throughout .
In all the negotiations necessary on arrival in the country he took a leading part , and was successful in obtaining the- , goodwill of every person with whom we came in contact .
The fine series of photographs which we obtained bear witness to-his skill in carrying out , to the letter , the somewhat troublesome arrangements which I had planned for erecting and adjusting the instruments .
