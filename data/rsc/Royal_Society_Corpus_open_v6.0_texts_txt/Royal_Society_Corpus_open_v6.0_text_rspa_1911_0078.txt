] The first published account I can find of the ultra-violet spectrum of boron is by W. N. Hartley in 1883 , * who obtained it by submitting saturated solutions of boric acid and of borax to the action of an induction spark .
He describes it as consisting of three strong lines , of wave-lengths 3450*3 , 2497*0 , and 2496*2 .
Rowland , in his " New Table of Standard Wave-lengths , 'gives the wavelengths of two boron lines as 2497*821 and 2496*867 .
He does not mention .a third line .
In 1893 J. M. Eder and E. YalentaJ gave a list of 17 lines in the ultraviolet spectrum of boron , their wave-lengths being:\#151 ; 3957 *9 2689 *0 2266 *4 3941 *7 2686 *2 2088 *8 3829 *3 2497 *7* 2088 *4 3824 -5 2496 -8* 2066 *2 3451*3* 2388 *5 2064 *6 3246 *9 2267 '0 # The lines so marked are the dominant lines .
In 1897 F. Exner and E. HaschekS recorded eight lines in the ultra-violet spectrum of boron , their wave-lengths being :\#151 ; 3451 -4* 2687 *3 2267 *03 3246 *7 2497 *8* 2266 *47 2688 *2 2496 *88* # The lines so marked are the dominant lines .
In 1902 Exner and Haschek again took measurements of the lines in the ultra-violet spectrum of boron from a sample of boric acid obtained from Merck , and gave the wave-lengths of the three lines as 3451*49 , 2497*79 , and 2496*87 .
In 1904 A. Hagenbach and H. Konen|| published photographs of the boron spectrum in which the wave-lengths of the dominant lines are given as * 4Roy .

On the Spectrum of Boron .
3451 , 2498 , and 2497 .
The spark was taken between carbon poles with boric acid .
Many other lines are shown , but the authors ascribe these to the electrodes .
In March , 1901 , I was examining the silicon spectrum , using fused silicon electrodes , and a pair of lines were seen at about 2497 and 2498 which could not be found in any silicon spectrum photographed by other observers .
I soon identified these strangers as lines given by a boron impurity in the fused silicon .
A pure sample of fused silicon supplied by Johnson and Matthey did not show these lines .
Properties of Boron .
Amorphous boron when pure is a fine dark brown powder .
Its conductivity for electricity is very poor , and it is difficult to manipulate so as to get an induction spark through , as it is readily blown away .
I could not fuse it in the arc .
Quite recently Dr. Weintraub , of the West Lynn Research Laboratory , .
General Electric Co. , U.S.A. , has prepared boron in a solid state and chemically pure .
Hitherto the physical properties of this element were unknown , notwithstanding the efforts of many chemists who had worked on the subject .
Moissan , who came nearest to obtaining the pure element , .
only succeeded in getting it in the form of an amorphous powder .
He said it was not possible to melt or volatilize boron in a carbon crucible or arc as it was changed into carbon boride , and concluded that boron passed from the solid to the gaseous state without becoming liquid .
Dr. Weintraub has not only obtained boron in a state of purity , but has prepared it in a fused homogeneous form .
His process consists in running one or more alternating current arcs , fed by a high potential transformer , between water-cooled or air-cooled copper electrodes , in a mixture of boron chloride with a large excess of hydrogen in a glass or copper vessel .
The boron is thrown off in fine powder on to the walls of the vessel , or agglomerates on the ends of the electrodes , where it grows in form of small rods .
After a while the arc runs between two boron electrodes , and if the current is of proper value the rods melt down to boron beads which eventually fall off , whereupon the same process repeats itself .
The first specimens I received from Dr. Weintraub were deposited from a vaporous state from boron chloride and hydrogen in the manner already described .
Subsequently I received some lumps of fused boron which had been prepared from magnesium boride obtained in the reaction between boric anhydride and excess of magnesium .
The magnesium boride dissociates at a relatively low temperature ( 1200 ' ) , especially in vacuo , and with rapidity Sir W. Crookes .
[ Sept. 25 , at 1500 ' .
The fusion is effected between copper electrodes .
Under the conditions of the experiment no disintegration takes place , and according to my informant , the affinity of copper for boron is so slight that it can be directly fused on to the electrode without being contaminated with copper .
Another way of fusing boron is in what Dr. Weintraub terms a mercury arc furnace , based on the fact that most refractory bodies , such as tungsten , tantalum , boron , etc. , have no affinity whatever for mercury .
The fused lumps of boron obtained by the reaction between boron chloride and hydrogen were found by Dr. Weintraub to be quite pure , analysing from 99*8 to 100*2 per cent. , the difference being due to errors of experiment , and perhaps to a trace of silica abraded from the agate mortar during pulverisation .
The boron prepared by fusing that obtained by the gas process is not quite so pure .
The sample sent me contains about 97 per cent , boron , the main impurities being nitrogen in the form of boron nitride , magnesium in the form of magnesium boride , a trace of iron , and a trace of carbon .
The most interesting property of solid boron is its extraordinary rise in electric conductivity with slight increase in temperature .
A piece of fused boron measured by Dr. Weintraub , which at the room temperature ( 27 ' C. ) had a resistance of 5,620,000 ohms , dropped to 5 ohms at a dull red heat .
Another noteworthy property of both the melted and agglomerated boron is extreme hardness .
It comes next to the diamond in hardness , a splinter easily scratching corundum .
Its fracture is conchoidal , and when melted no decided crystalline structure is seen .
The agglomerated boron , deposited in the arc from boron chloride and hydrogen , is , on the contrary , highly crystalline .
A rod of boron heated to whiteness before the blowpipe shows no sign of fusion , but the flame is coloured green , and when the cold rod is microscopically examined it is seen to be covered with minute globules of fused boric anhydride .
The first samples of boron under experiment were of the agglomerated variety , in the form of thin flakes deposited from the vaporous condition in the reaction already described .
Several fragments were clamped together to form the electrodes .
It is not easy to get the spark to pass between cold boron poles owing to its high electrical resistance .
When the two pole pieces are held in brass clips in front of the spectroscope , the spark passes across from one clip to another ; it is only when the boron poles get heated by the spark that they begin to conduct sufficiently to let the current pass .
The light of the spark is somewhat feeble , and exposures from 1 to 2 hours are required to bring out with intensity the three dominant lines .
Generally , when the boron 1911 .

39 electrodes are well heated the current assumes the form of a minute arc , starting from a luminous point at one edge of the pole , which soon becomes red-hot .
Occasionally an intense yellow-green flame shoots from a corner , which immediately fuses , but this only lasts a few seconds .
After the current has passed for 40 or 50 minutes an accumulation of boric anhydride causes a resistance to the current , and it then again begins to pass across between the brass clips .
The melted boron is easier to manipulate in the spectrograph .
In the form of solid blocks the electrodes do not get so hot , and very little oxidation takes place .
The spark is of a faint apple-green colour , and when the poles have become sufficiently hot to carry the current it passes quietly for hours without change .
The spectrum of boron consists essentially of three lines , the wave-lengths of which , according to careful measurements made in the manner described in 1903 , are 3451*50 , 2497*83 , and 2496*89.* For easy comparison I give in a tabular form the wave-lengths of these lines measured by different observers:\#151 ; Hartley ( 1883 ) 3450 *3 2497 2496 *2 Rowland ( 1893 ) \#151 ; 2497 '821 2496 *867 Eder and Valenta ( 1893 ) 3451 *3 2497 -7 2496 *8 Exner and Haschek ( 1897 ) .
3451 *4 2497 -8 2496 *88 " ( 1902 ) .
3451 *49 2497 -79 2496 *87 Hagenbach and Konen ( 1908 ) .
3451 2498 2497 Crookes ( 1911 ) , 3451 *50 2497 -83 2496 *89 Besides these three lines two others of wave-lengths about 3274 and 3248 were seen on the photographs of each sample of boron , the agglomerated and the melted , the lines in the melted being the stronger .
The fact that no other observer had noticed these lines , and their being of different intensities in the two samples , proved that they were due to some other element accidentally present .
A run over my photographed spectra of the elements soon showed these lines to be the dominant copper lines , 3274*096 and 3247*688 .
A short time ago Sir Walter Noel Hartley !
traced the occurrence of these two copper lines in the spectrum from pure cadmium electrodes to the proximity of his laboratory to the overhead conductors of the tram-lines .
The condensation of the vapour of copper following the sparking at the rubbing contact yielded a dust of extreme tenuity , such as could not arise from mechanical abrasion of the solid metal .
Sir Walter Noel Hartley found that the amount of copper passing between the sparking terminals sufficient to produce an impression of the copper lines on the * " The Ultra-Violet Spectrum of Radium , " ' Roy .

[ Sept. 25 T photographic plate need not be more than from 0*001 to 0*0014 mgrin .
This explanation could not apply to my own case , for no tram-lines are near the laboratory , and nothing was going on that could give rise to a dust of copper .
The atmosphere of my laboratory was perfectly free from any trace of copper , but the clips that hold the electrodes in front of the slit of the spectrograph were made of brass .
When the spark first passes the boron is cold , and in that condition is a very bad conductor ; consequently , some discharge may take place between the brass clips .
After a little time , however , the boron gets hot enough to conduct the whole current .
To guard against such an accidental contamination , I made a pair of clips of pure gold for boron and other electrodes , and repeated the spectro-graphic tests with ea6h sample of boron .
My reasons for selecting gold as the material for the clips were that it shows no lines near those in question of copper or aluminium ; that it is a soft metal well adapted for clips holding hard bodies ; that I had convenient blocks of it in a state of purity ; and that all the lines of gold have been measured and mapped with accuracy .
The poles of agglomerated boron after sparking for two hours\#151 ; using gold clips\#151 ; gave a spectrum in which no trace of copper lines could be seen , whereas a similar experiment in which melted boron was used in the gold clips showed decided lines of copper and traces of magnesium .
Another pair of lines occurred in the neighbourhood of wave-lengths 3082 and 3093 in the spectrum given by the melted boron , but not in that of the agglomerated plates .
This pointed to other impurities in the melted boron .
On comparing these lines with spectra of other elements it was soon discovered that they were two of the dominant lines of aluminium , 3082*275 and 3092*818 .
Experiments were now made to see if by greatly prolonged exposures in the spectrograph other boron lines could be brought out .
Melted boron , sparked for seven hours in gold clips , gave a photograph showing many additional lines , which , however , were for the most part ill-defined air lines ; four , however , occurring between wave-lengths 3930 and 3970 , were definite and sharp , although faint .
These four lines might be due to boron , or to impurities , or they might be air lines .
To ascertain if they were air lines , a control experiment was tried by photographing the spectrum of pure tungsten sparked for seven hours .
Tungsten was selected as the metal to put in comparison with boron because in its spectrum there is a blank space where the four lines brought out by long exposure of boron occurred .
Had any of these four lines been brought out by long exposure in the tungsten spectrum it would show that they were common to both and not peculiar to Crookes Roy .

Close examination of the tungsten spectrum showed no trace of the four lines .
The two photographs were enlarged , and most of the lines in common were found to be air lines .
It having been proved that the four lines in question were not air lines , the remaining alternatives were\#151 ; ( a ) they were boron lines , or ( b ) they were due to impurities in the boron .
To test the first hypothesis ( a ) , that they were boron lines , several different specimens of boron , prepared by Dr. Weintraub and others , were examined in the spectrograph , and it was seen that the intensities of the lines varied considerably in comparison with known boron lines , being strong in some samples and almost absent in others .
This pointed to hypothesis ( b ) as probably the true one , and a search was made for likely impurities having strong lines in the critical position .
Measurements were made of the four lines , and their wave-lengths were calculated from those of adjacent iron lines , and the figures left no doubt that they were traces of the calcium lines 3933*825 and 3968*625 and the aluminium lines 3944*160 and 3961*674 , Rowland 's wave-lengths .
This was confirmed by comparison with my photographed maps of the calcium and aluminium spectra .
The result of my work on boron is to show that its photographed spectrum consists of three lines ; that the 14 other lines given by J. M. Eder and E. Yalenta , and the five other lines given by F. Exner and E. Haschek , failed to record themselves on my photographs , notwithstanding the excessively long exposures I gave in the attempts to bring out additional boron lines .
The collotype illustrations ( Plate 1 ) are from the original negatives , and are entirely untouched .
The grain of the process somewhat diminishes the sharpness of the lines .
To economise space and avoid unnecessary complications , I have given photographs of only that part of the spectrum adjacent to the boron lines .
Had the whole spectrum been given as photographed , the length would have extended to more than 10 feet .
The upper half of each strip shows the iron lines used as standards , with their wave-lengths according to Rowland 's latest measurements .
The lower halves contain the boron lines , with their wave-lengths as calculated from the iron standards .
