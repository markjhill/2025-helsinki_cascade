" On the Tangential of a Cubic .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received February 11 , 1858 .
( Abstract .
) In my " Memoir on Curves of the Third Order , " Phil. Trans. vol. cxlvii .
( 1857 ) , I had occasion to consider a derivative which may be termed the " tangential " of a cubic , viz. the tangent at the point ( x , y , z ) of the cubic curve ( , Xx , y , z)3=0 meets the curve in a point ( 4 , , ) , which is the tangential of the first-mentioned point ; and I showed that when the cubic is represented in the canonical form x3+y3 +z3+ 6lxyz= 0 , the coordinates of the tangential may be taken to be x(y3-3 ) : y(z3-x3 ) : z(x3-y3 ) .
The method given for obtaining the tangential may be applied to the general form ( a , b , c , f , g , h , i , j , k , lsx , y , z)3 : it seems desirable , in reference to the theory of cubic forms , to give the expression of the tangential for the general form ; and this is what I propose to do , merely indicating the steps of the calculation , which was performed for me by Mr. Creedy .
V. " On the Constitution of the Essential Oil of Rue .
" By C. GREVILLE WILLIAMS , Esq. , Lecturer on Chemistry in the Normal College , Swansea .
Communicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received February 15 , 1858 .
( Abstract .
) The essential oil of rue and its products of decomposition have been examined by several chemists .
Will analysed it many years ago , and deduced the formula C28 I28 03 as the result of his analyses .
The principal investigation of it was made by Gerhardt , who regarded it as the aldehyde of capric acid .
The production of capric acid from it by the action of nitric acid , as observed by Gerhardt and also by Cabours , has been considered as corroborative of the 20 carbon formula .
It is evident , however , that the formation of capric acid merely indicates the aldehyde to contain not less than 20 equivalents of carbon .
