" Of the ultimate distribution of the Air-passages , and of the modes of formation of the Air-cells of the Lungs .
" By William Addison , Esq. , F.L.S. , Surgeon , Great Malvern .
Communicated by R. B. Todd , M.D. , F.R.S. After reciting the various opinions which have prevailed among anatomists regarding the manner in which the bronchial tubes terminate , whether , as some suppose , by cells having free communica ?
tion with one another , or , as others maintain , by distinct and sepa ?
rate cells having no such intercommunication , the author states that having been engaged in investigating , with the aid of the micro ?
scope , the seat and nature of pulmonary tubercles , he could never discover , in the course of his inquiry , any tubes ending in a cul-desac ; but , on the contrary , always saw , in every section that he made , air-cells communicating with each other .
He concludes from his experiments and observations , that the bronchial tubes , after dividing dichotomously into a multitude of minute branches , which pursue their course in the cellular interstices of the lobules , terminate , in their interior , in branched air-passages , and in air-cells which freely communicate with one another , and have a closed termination at the boundary of the lobule .
The apertures by which these air-cells open into one another are termed by the author lobular passages : but he states that the air-cells have not an indiscriminate or general inter ?
communication throughout the interior of a lobule , and that no anastomoses occur between the interlobular ramihcations of the bron ?
chial themselves ; each branch pursuing its own independent course to its termination in a closed extremity .
