[ May 10 , towards the north-east .
The anticlinal fault of Charnwood Forest , so far as known , satisfies these conditions , and it is highly probable that the earthquake was caused by a slip of this fault .
The beginning of the sound preceded that of the shock in all parts of the disturbed area ; the end of the sound followed that of the shock in the central district and in the neighbourhood of the minor axis , but preceded it near the end of the major axis .
Thus the sound apparently outraced the shock in the direction of the major axis , but not in that of the minor axis .
These time-relations of the sound and shock can be readily explained if the area over which the fault-slip took place were several miles in length , for the sound in all probability is due to small and rapid vibrations proceeding chiefly from the margins of that area .
The intensity was greatest at and near Woodhouse Eaves , and it is probable that the fault-slip began in the neighbourhood of this place , gradually diminishing in amount in either direction , rather rapidly towards the north-west , and much more slowly towards the south-east ; the rate at which the slipping advanced being greater than the velocity of the earth-wave .
The total length of the fault-slip may have been as much as 12 miles or even more , and there can be little doubt that it was continued for some distance under the Triassic rocks on which Leicester is built .

Report on Results obtained with the Slit Spectroscopes.* ' By E. H. Hills , Capt. R.E. Communicated by the Joint Solar Eclipse Committee .
Received March 7 , 1894 .
The parties in Brazil and Africa were both supplied with these instruments , two being sent to each station .
The instruments were arranged to take one photograph only during the eclipse with an exposure as long as possible .
It was considered that the amount of light available would not allow of more than one successful exposure being made .
Of the four resulting photographs , one of those taken in Brazil was unfortunately not finished before the sun reappeared , whilst the other shows a faint corona spectrum with a strong sky spectrum on both sides , and a considerable amount of general fog over the plate .
I have been able to detect nothing of interest in this photograph , for the Fraunhofer lines overlap the corona spectrum to such a degree that it is impossible to distinguish any bright lines with certainty .
The instrument employed in Africa consisted of two spectroscopes , on one equatorial mounting .
The first spectroscope had two prisms , 1894 .

Condensing lenses , 35 in .

Both spectroscopes were fixed on stout mahogany base-boards , and were completely adjusted before leaving England .
To attach them to the mounting , a mahogany tube , about 6 in .
square and 2 ft. long , was bolted to the top of the declination axis , and the base-boards of the spectroscopes were screwed on either side of it .
A small telescope of in .
aperture was attached on the other side of the tube to act as a finder and for purposes of adjustment .
The mounting was one that was made for the eclipse of 1886 .
It consisted of a tripod stand composed of pieces of angle iron with the polar and declination axes , and circles of the Corbett equatorial .
It was found to be easy to set up and rigid .
On arrival at Fundium , a site was selected , and a concrete base was formed .
On this the instrument was set up , and no trouble was experienced in getting it into adjustment .
The slits of the two spectroscopes were placed parallel to each other and tangential to a circle of declination , and were adjusted so that they cut across opposite limbs of the sun , that of the two-prism spectroscope being across the upper or western limb , and that of the one-prism spectroscope across the eastern limb .
For several days before the eclipse , trial plates were taken , in order to obtain reference spectra , and for getting the focus as perfect as possible , as well as for the sake of practising the development of the plates .
The plates used were Cadett 's most rapid make , and various developers were tried , but no special peculiarities of behaviour were noticed ; pyrogallic acid was used for the eclipse plates .
Before leaving England the plates were backed with a solution of asphalt in benzole , for the purpose of destroying the halation or reflection from the back surface of the glass .
At the eclipse the shutters of the two cameras were opened about ten seconds after the commencement of totality , and closed about ten seconds before the end , giving a total exposure of three minutes fifty seconds .
During the progress of the eclipse I observed the corona and the upper or western limb of the sun through the small telescope with a magnifying power of 40 .
The corona in this region showed very faint radial markings and several rosy-pink prominences were seen .
The largest of these was one at the W.IST .
W\ limb , which is the one of which a strong spectrum was obtained with the two-prism spectroscope .
The plates were developed the same evening on 22 Capt. E. H. Hills .
[ May 10 , board the " Alecto .
" The resulting photograph in the case of the two-prism spectroscope shows a prominence spectrum on both sides of the dark body of the moon , and outside these a corona spectrum with a faint solar ( dark line ) spectrum on its extreme edge .
The H , K and some other lines extend oyer the dark moon and on both sides beyond the limits of the corona spectrum .
That of the one-prism spectroscope shows the same general character , but there is a prominence spectrum on one side only .
Both these photographs were over-exposed , better results would have been obtained if two or even three exposures had been made in the same time .
Measurement of the Photographs .
The following is the method of measurement adopted .
A very accurate micrometer by Hilger , reading to 0*001 mm. , was employed throughout .
The large number of bright lines in the prominence spectrum rendered the use of the reference spectra unnecessary .
The hydrogen series , together with the lines at wave-lengths 4215*3 , 4471*2 , and the b group gave a sufficient number of fixed points through which to draw an interpolation curve .
The micrometer readings of these lines having been taken with the greatest possible accuracy , an interpolation curve was constructed on a large scale , two curves being drawn for each photograph as a check on each other .
The micrometer readings of the remaining prominence lines were then determined and their wave-lengths taken from the curves .
The micrometer readings of the corona lines were next taken .
It was impossible to get both sides of the photograph in the field of the microscope at the same time , so each side was taken separately , thus getting four series of scale-readings representing possible coronal lines .
The wave-lengths corresponding to these scale-readings were then determined from the interpolation curves , and lists were made\#151 ; first , of lines common to both photographs ; second , of lines occurring on both sides of one photograph ; third , of lines which had been observed in previous eclipses .
New measurements of the photographs were again made , with the same care as the first , and all lines in the lists were struck out which were not plainly visible in this second scrutiny .
It is possible that this final list may contain some wave-lengths of lines due to accidental marks ; this must be rare , however , as any mark so treated must have been parallel to the lines .
A comparison of the measurements of the two photographs will give a good idea of the limits of accuracy of these results .

23 The Prominence Spectrum .
This list gives the wave-lengths of all the lines in one prominence from each photograph .
The second prominence on the two-prism spectroscope plate is of a similar character to the one given , but contains fewer lines .
The intensities of the lines are given approximately by the numbers from 1 to 6 .
The most interesting feature of this spectrum is the extended hydrogen series .
There seems no reason to doubt that the lines at wave-lengths 3692-5 , 3687 , 3682 , 3678 , 3675 , 3672 , 3669-5 , and 3667 are members of it .
M. Deslandres has obtained a photograph showing five hydrogen lines beyond the one at wave-length 3699 ; this photograph carries the series three lines further .
The line at 3680 is the iron line , whose wave-length is given by Cornu as 3680"3 , and by Hartley as 3679*5 .
The new notation for the hydrogen series has been used as convenient .
H/ 3 is F , H\lt ; y the line near G , and so on , consecutively .
The Corona Spectrum .
This is the final adopted list , as described above .
It is almost impossible to estimate the intensity of these feeble lines by eye , so no attempt has been made to do so ; but in the column headed " intensity " is placed the number of occurrences of the line in the two photographs , the maximum number being four , viz. , on each side of both photographs .
Opposite each line in the table is placed the corresponding line that has been noted in previous eclipses .
For a complete list of the observed corona spectrum , see Dr. Schuster 's report on the eclipse of 1886 ( 'Phil .
Trans. , ' vol. 180 A , p. 335 ) .
It will be observed that the 1474 K , or so-called corona line , is placed in the prominence and not in the corona spectrum .
This line is shown very faintly on the extreme limit of one photograph , in which it certainly appears to belong to the prominence .
It is true that it extends into the corona , but at the same time it also extends in the opposite direction , over the dark body of the moon .
Its appearance is somewhat similar to that of the strong hydrogen lines , whose apparent extension into the corona spectrum is probably due to atmospheric haze .
This region of the spectrum has never been specially photographed with the slit spectroscope during an eclipse , and I think a serious attack on it should most certainly be made at the first opportunity , by using plates which can now be prepared , which are specially sensitive to this region of the spectrum .
