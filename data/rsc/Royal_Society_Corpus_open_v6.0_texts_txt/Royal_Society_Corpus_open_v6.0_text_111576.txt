( Abstract .
) The tangent is a line passing through two consecutive points of a plane curve , and we may in like manner consider the conic which passes through five consecutive points of a plane curve ; and as there are certain singular points , viz. the points of inflexion , where three consecutive points of the curve lie in a line , so there are singular points where six consecutive points of the curve lie in a conic .
In the particular case where the given curve is a cubic , the last-mentioned species of singular points have been considered by Plucker and Steiner , and in the same particular case , the theory of the conic of five-pointic contact has recently been established by Mr. Salmon .
But the general case , where the curve is of any order whatever , has not , so far as I am aware , been hitherto considered ; the establishment of this theory is the object of the present memoir .
