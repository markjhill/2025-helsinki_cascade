VL Observations on the diurnal changes in the position of the horizontal needle , under a reduced directive power , at Port Bowen , 1 825 , By Lieutenant Henry Foster , JR .
N. F. R. S. Communicated January 12 , 1826 .
A he daily variation of the horizontal needle is a subject which has , for nearly a century , attracted the attention of several accurate observers , whose object was principally limited to determining the hour of the day , when its amount was the greatest , and the times of the needle 's successive easterly and westerly motions .
From these observations , however , it could not be ascertained whether the cause of this daily variation proceeded from an actual change in the direction of the magnetic axis of the earth , or whether it arose from some foreign force , , acting transversely on the needle , impelling it out of its natural direction .
To submit this question to the test of observation , Mr. Barlow , in 1823 , undertook a set of experiments on the daily variation of a horizontal needle nearly neutralized by the application of artificial magnets ; under an idea , that if the daily variation proceeded from an actual change in the direction of the earth 's magnetism , the needle in this case , as when in its natural state , would merely take up its new direction without any increase of amount ; but if it proceeded from a foreign force acting transversely upon it , the needle now having less intensity of direction than when in its natural state , it would yield more easily to this transverse force and give a larger expression , which would serve to mark with more precision than heretofore , all the circumstances of this daily change .
On trial , the amount was found to be very considerably increased ; and he , still in pursuit of the same object , now undertook to ascertain the direction which the daily variation impressed upon the needle , when balanced at different azimuths ; which was easily done by a slight adjustment of the magnets ; and in this way he found that in two positions of the needle , viz. when its north end was directed either to N i6 ' W , or S i6 ' E , no daily variation , or a very little took place , and that on one side of this line , the needle passed in one direction , and on the other side in an opposite one .
In the memoir which the Author published relative to these experiments , he expresses a wish that some other persons would pursue this enquiry ; and as the parts in which we were likely to winter in the recent voyage of discovery under Captain Parry , seemed highly favourable for the purpose , I determined to avail myself of this circumstance , and to make a regular set of such observations .
With respect to the daily variation , it was soon found , as was expected , that the needle being nearly neutralized by the great amount of dip , no artificial means would be necessary for increasing its amount : all the observations , therefore , on this head , were made with the needles suspended in their natural state , and the following are entirely devoted to the second object , viz. of determining the direction which the needle takes in consequence of the daily variation when directed to different points of the compass , and to ascertain the line of no daily variation , or at least that line in which the motion is a minimum .
Mr. Christie , in pursuing the experiments above referred to , and in those on the effects of temperature on magnets , had made use of an instrument admirably suited to such purpose ; and he very obligingly superintended the construction of one somewhat similar for my use ; a description and drawing of which he has given in his paper on the effects of temperature on magnets , published in the Phil. Trans , for 1825 .
In these experiments , the apparatus was frozen to three firm stone supports , erected in a house built of snow , having the top covered with canvas ; the zero on the compassbox was made to coincide with the direction of the needle at 6h A.M. , that being , although somewhat arbitrarily considered ( from the mean of the preceding month 's observations on the daily variation ) , the magnetic meridian .
The needle used was made of clock spring , very delicate and light , in length 4,5 inches , its greatest breadth at the centre was 0,45 inches , and its extremities terminated in sharp points ; the pivot on which it rested was also repolished previous to the commencement of the observations .
Having considerably reduced the directive power of this needle in its natural direction , by the action of two bar magnets , placed in the magnetic meridian , and in the same horizontal plane with it ; I began on the 14th of February to register the amount of the daily change at stated intervals throughout the twenty-four hours , the Officers of the ship kindly assisting me , by taking the observations at the times of my attendance to other duties .
The states of the two thermometers placed upon the instrument , were also noted at the time of every observation ; and to preserve the intensity pf the magnets from being affected by any sudden change of temperature , produced by the approach of the observer , or other causes , they were thickly covered with snow after every adjustment .
During that part of the day when the needles suspended with floss silk indicated westerly variation , the direction of this needle is marked towards the right hand , when the north end passes to the right hand of a person standing outside of the compass-box y and facing the north end of the needle ; and to the left , when it passes towards the left hand .
In the following details is given a short description of the adjustment of the magnets to the needle , at the commencement of the observations in each position of its north end ; and also the time in which it performed one vibration when imder their influence , as well as the ratios in which the ditective/ force was reduced by them ; but it must be remembered , that these ratios are mere approximations , since the directive force was always so much diminished , that a sufficient nuhiber of vibrations could not be counted , to estimate the duration of one With the required exactness .
In the annexed tables every phenomena , such as halos , aurora borealis , winds , sitate of the weather , and position of the moon , are inserted ; together with such remarks , as suggested themselves at the time of observation .
There is also inserted in o italics in the column of remarks ; max .

The magnets being placed to the north and south of the needle , with their axes coinciding with the magnetic meridian , the north magnet had its north pole , and the south magnet its south pole , directed towards the needle , at the distance of 31,5 inches from the centre of the compass-box .
In this position of the magnets , the needle made one vibration in 15 seconds , so that the directive force was reduced in the ratio of 0,14 to 1 nearly .

Midn1 200 -30 17 55,5 It will be seen , that when the north end of the needle pointed towards the east or west , the direction of its motion during the time of westerly daily variation , is not specified according to the mode described ; I have not ventured to do so , in consequence of the many irregularities in its direction , produced by the variations of horizontal intensity , which were always indicated by this needle , and which rendered its direction as to the right and left hand during the time of westerly daily variation , very doubtful .

North end of Needle to the S. 83o W. The following summary of the observations at this point , is given here , merely to prevent breaking the preceding series : they were commenced at 6 o'clock in the morning , at which time the north end of the needle was at S. 83o 30 ' W. where it remained until\#163 ; past 9b ; it then moved to S. 85o W. and became nearly stationary until about nh 3om , at which time it was at S. 8 1 ' so7 W. and soon after , I observed it vibrating rapidly in very small arcs , which were continued with different degrees of intensity for the space of a quarter of an hour .
During this time , simultaneous observations on the times of vibration of a horizontal needle were made , and as great fluctuations were observed in the intervals of 10 vibrations , I have inserted them in detail , as follows , in order to show the variations of horizontal intensity which take place in short intervals , and to which must be attributed the irregular vibratory motion observed in this needle .

h. m. s , 41 10 3 4,8 Jt appears by these observations\#187 ; that 44 13 33 the intervals of 10 vibrations\#187 ; exhibit 47 !
^5 3 3 &gt; 5 changes of horizontal intensity to the 50 19 3 2,5 amount of -^th part of those intervals , 53 20,7 3 1,7 in the space of quarter of an hour .
56 Z2,5 3 1,8 In the foregoing observations , when the north end of the needle was directed towards the east or west points of the compass , it will be seen , that the various deflections of the needle rendered it difficult to discover which way its north end had proceeded during the time of westerly daily variation .
This anomalous action of the needle exhibited itself so strongly on the 23d of February , that I was induced to compare the nature of some of its deflections , with simultaneous observations , on the times of vibration of a freely suspended horizontal needle ; and as I found , in every instance of comparison , a decided relation between the changes of horizontal intensity , and these deflections , I began to watch the action of this needle more closely , at the times that fluctuations in the directive force of the horizontal needle , had hitherto been observed to take place ; and from its indications , I frequently stated to the Gentlemen making the observations on horizontal intensity , what I considered would be the nature of the intervals they were about to obtain ; which proving correct , no longer left any doubt on my mind , of the cause of these * apparent irregularities .
In order , however , to point out more satisfactorily the relation between the changes of horizontal intensity , and the various deflections of this needle , at other positions of its north end , I have annexed the observations on the times of performing 60 vibrations by a horizontal needle , taken during the same time ; but this will not explain all the anomalies alluded to , without also stating , that the fluctuations which frequently took place in the intervals of 10 vibrations , were sometimes observed to compensate one another , so as , in the mean of sixty , to leave no indications of such changes having taken place ; and it is only on these occasions , that the expression for the magnetic in* tensity of the horizontal needle is at variance with the irregular motion of the neutralized needle .
On looking over the observations it will also be seen , that when the north end of the needle was directed to the souths ward , between N. 85o E. and S. 85o W. its motion during the time of ^westerly daily variation was generally towards the left hmd9 but when directed to the northward , between N* 85o E. and S\#187 ; 85o W. its motion was then most commonly to the right hand ( see the figure in Plate IV .
) ; and that when held between N. 85o E , and north , a greater daily change obtained than &amp; t any of the other positions , amounting in one instance to 50 degrees ; byt when directed to S. 85P W. no daily variation , or at least a minimum , exhibited itself .
With respect to the effect produced on the needle when held between N. 85o E , and north , it appears , from observations on the times of vibrations of a horizontal needle , that an increased intensity generally took place about noon , at which time also , the maximum westerly daily variation generally happened ; and as we have already seen , that the motion of the north end of the needle in this position , during the time of westerly daily variation , was to the right hand , or towards the magnetic meridian , the effect of an increased intensity would be to draw it still further in that direction* and therefore , produce the extraordinary amount noticed , But with the north end of the needle , held between S. 85 ' W. and north , where its motion is still to the righi hand at the time of westerly daily variation , the effect of increased intensity then , would be to draw the north end of the needle to the left hand ) or towards the magnetic meridian ; from whence it is inferred , that these contrary effects balance each other at\#352 ; .
85o W. and produce what has hitherto been termed the line of minimum daily variation .
Nevertheless it is a singular coincidence , that the true bearing of this line at Port Bowen ( viz. S &gt; 38o 4 E &gt; ) agrees nearly with Mr. Barlow 's deteiv mination at Woolwich .
It would , however* be desirable to have other observations* at plaees differing much in magnetic position\#187 ; before drawing any conclusions as to the probability of its dependence on $ome general cause ; especially , since the needle after remaining absolutely stationary for three\#191 ; ueeessive dap at S.\#171 ; s ' W , commenced moving with its north end towards the left hand , o\#345 ; west point of the compass\#187 ; at half-past three P. M. on the\#191 ; 7th of March ; without any apparent cause whatever , and that it did not again become stationary during the rest of the observations at this point , which were continued until the 5th of April ; in the course of which , as will be seen , its north end sometimes proceeded towards the kft , and at others towards the right handy during the tioie of westerly daily variation .
Whether this movement of the needle , on the 27th of March , took place in consequence of the changes of intensity in the opposing magnets ( which were Covered With snow ) &gt; arising from the effects of temperature , or from the cudden variations of intensity of the horizontal needle which take plate in short intervals of time , to which jI am most disposed to attribute it , Is difficult to decide ; it was not considered to be due to the effects of electricity , as there was no appearance of the Aurora the existence of that phenomenon , in the atmosphere , detected by the electrometer .
Towards the end of May , however , I commenced another set of observations ( at S. 85o W. ) , but the needle never became stationary throughout their continuance ; its north end sometimes proceeding towards the north , at others towards the south , during the time of westerly daily variation , and that occasionally the needle was observed to vibrate in small arcs ; as already noticed at its other azimuthal positions .
It will also be seen , on looking over the preceding observations , that the times of maximum westerly , and easterly daily variation , by this needle , differ on many occasions very considerably from those by the suspended needle v this difference it may be observed , arises from the circumstance of the observations on each needle not being made simultaneously , as well as from the minuteness of some of the phenomena escaping observation by the suspended needle ; but which were elicited by this needle , proportionally to its reduced directive force .
Besides these observations on the daily changes of the horizontal needle , I also attempted a similar set on the dipping needle , but the difficulty of adjusting the magnets was such , as to prevent me from obtaining any satisfactory results .

from about N. E. to N.W. at an elevation of from 10 to 20 degrees , with streamers sometimes shooting towards the zenith .
At times when it was brightest , although not very brilliant during any part of the winter , I have frequently watched this needle , without ever being able to detect a change , that could be ascribed to its influence .
