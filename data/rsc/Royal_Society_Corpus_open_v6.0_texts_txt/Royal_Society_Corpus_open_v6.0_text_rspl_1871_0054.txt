277 Dr. A. Dupre on the Elimination of Alcohol .
tion of the iodoform test , had already discovered the presence of a volatile substance in human urine , as well as in that of various animals , which gives the iodoform test .
Working on larger quantities of urine , he has arrived at the conclusion that this substance is not alcohol .
M. Lieben also has failed to isolate and identify the substance , owing to the very small quantity present in the urine 5 he thinks , however , that it may be one of the odoriferous constituents of the urine .
According to the author 's experience this cannot , however , be the case , since , first , the quantity of substance yielding the iodoform does not seem to be diminished by distillation over animal charcoal , whereas the urinous odour is thus almost entirely removed ; secondly , the urinous odour of the distillate , in case no animal charcoal was used , is not destroyed by heating with the bichromate solution , which nevertheless produces acetic acid ; thirdly , a somewhat similar substance seems present in the breath .
It might be , however , that the substance giving the iodoform test and that yielding the acetic acid are two different compounds ; this must be left to future researches to decide .
In conclusion , it may not be uninteresting to point out that the quantity of substance which yields the acetic acid apparently falls below the normal proportion just after the effect of a dose or .
doses of alcohol has passed off ; after which it gradually rises again to the normal standard .
A somewhat analogous effect was observed by Dr. Bence Jones and the author , in their research on the passage of quinine into and out of the tissues \amp ; c. , to follow the administration of quinine .
In this case the natural fluorescence of the extracts from the tissues , due to the presence of a substance resembling quinine , and therefore called animal quinoidine by the discoverers , frequently fell below the normal standard just after the effect of the quinine had passed of^ , gradually rising again to the normal proportion .
A closer study of this relation might perhaps throw considerable light on the physiological action of alcohol both in health and in disease .

On the Polymerides of Codeia .
In Part IY .
of these researches reasons have been adduced for the following general conclusions , viz. that codeia and morphia are capable of forming polymerides ( with the elimination of methyl in the case of codeia ia some instances ) , which yield derivatives containing certainly not less than C68 , and probably not less than C130 ( C72 and C144 in the case of those codeia derivatives where methyl has not been eliminated ) .
Experiments now in progress tend to show that the formulae of codeia and morphia are really double of those formerly ascribed to these bases , e. are O30 H42 N2 06 and C H38 N 06 respectively , the proof of which is ( as will be shown in a subsequent communication ) that the first products of the action of hydrocMH acid on these bases appear to'contain chlorine and carbon in the proportions C36 and Cl , C34 and Cl respectively , instead of C18 and Cl , C17 and Cl. It might be anticipated , therefore , that intermediate polymerides might be formed containing respectively :\#151 ; Morphia series .

Tetracodeia .
In the case of codeia these anticipations have been verified .
^ In order to obtain these supposed polymerides before their alteration by secondary reactions , the action of acids other thanaH hydracids was examined .
Acetic acid seemed a probable agent for purpose ; but no appreciable quantity of any thing different from ordin^ codeia was obtained after sixty-four hours ' digestion at 100 ' of one part o this base with three parts of glacial acetic acid .
On precipitation of t .
product by Na2 C03 in large excess , extraction with ether , and agitation of the ethereal extract with H Cl , a crystalline mass was obtained whi developed a smell of acetic acid on standing in contact with a slight excess of H Cl ; but on analysis this gave numbers agreeing with those required # codeia hydrochlorate , and from it nothing different from codeia could *t obtained ; probably therefore only a trace of acetyl-codeia was formed .
The action of phosphoric acid , however , was found to lead to the deal result without the formation of bye-products beyond colouring-matters formed by the high temperature employed ; by heating codeia with 3 p* of glacial phosphoric acid and 5 of water for several hours at 100 ' , no p\#174 ; 1872 .

ceptible change is produced .
The same result follows on boiling for twelve hours ( boiling-point 105 ' ) with an inverted condenser attached to prevent loss of water by evaporation ; but if the boiling-point be allowed to rise slowly from evaporation , the mixture being very gently boiled in a longnecked flask , the product gradually acquires the power of giving an immediate amorphous precipitate with Naa C03 ; no large amount of new substances are , however , formed until the boiling-point has risen to about 200 ' , beyond which point the evaporation cannot safely be pushed .
The viscid chestnut-coloured liquid , while still hot , is dissolved in boiling water and allowed to cool ; nothing separates on cooling : when cold , the liquid is nearly neutralized by caustic soda , and then precipitated with Naa C03 ; the precipitate is collected on filters , drained from mother-liquors , dissolved in weak H Cl , and reprecipitated by Naa C03 , to get rid of traces of unaltered codeia mechanically retained ; finally , the drained precipitate is exhausted with ether .
The ethereal solution yields on agitation with H Cl a crystalline hydrochlorate , which may be purified by solution in water , fractional precipitation with Naa C03 , and repetition of the ether process , and finally by recrystallization of the resulting hydrochlorate .
The portion of the first Naa C03 precipitate insoluble in ether is dissolved in H Cl , and fractionally precipitated by Naa C03 , to remove colouring-matters as much as possible : the last precipitate , after thorough washing and drying , forms a light buff-coloured amorphous powder that does not soften at 100 ' when perfectly dry , but clots to a resinous mass if heated in the water-bath while still moist ; it is soluble in alcohol , is precipitated from this solution on addition of ether , and yields salts that have no vestige of crystalline characters .
Both the crystalline and the non-crystalline hydrochlorates yield on analysis numbers identical with those required for codeia hydrochlorate ; for the reasons developed in the subsequent sections , they are regarded as respectively di- and tetracodeia .
The filtrate from the original Naa C03 precipitate contains much unaltered codeia ; by extracting with ether and agitation of the extract with excess of phosphoric-acid solution , a mixture of phosphates is obtained , from which a further quantity of each polymeride is obtainable by simply boiling down the liquid till the boiling-point reaches 200 ' .
The hydrochlorate of tetracodeia obtained as above described forms a brownish brittle tar , not fusible at 100 ' when dry ; dried at 100 ' it yields the following numbers :\#151 ; Specimen A. 0*325 grm. gave 0*773 COa and 0*186 HaO .

_384 16-06 C ; 44H168N8024 2392 100-00 In appearance and most physical properties , tetracodeia and its salts bear a great resemblance to chloro- and bromo-tetracodeia ; and they further agree in that all yield a blood-red colour on warming with silver nitrate and nitric acid , or with nitric acid alone ; it differs from chloro-tetracodeia in that the aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate does not precipitate on the addition of strong H Cl , the salt being apparently as soluble in diluted II Cl as in water ; also the free base does not oxidize so readily .
In all respects tetracodeia agrees with the description given by Anderson of his " amorphous codeia " * obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on codeia .
On comparison with the product obtained by Anderson 's process , no essential differences could be detected between the two substances , except that the phosphoric-acid product was somewhat darker in tint , owing no doubt to the presence of colouring-matters from the higher temperature employed in its production .
The hydrochlorate of dicodeia obtained as above described crystallizes with 3II20 for every C13 contained , this water of crystallization being wholly lost at 100 ' and partially by standing over sulphuric acid .

192 16*06 C73H84N4012 1196 100*00 If the solution of the hydrochlorate be concentrated , the addition of Na2 C03 solution throws down tarry globules consisting of a mixture of the base and its hydrochlorate , the salt being sparingly soluble in the NaCl solution formed by the decomposition .
Dicodeia and its salts do not yield a blood-red colour with N03 H , only a slight orange tint ; Fe2Cl6 , also S04H2 + K2Cr207 , give no colour-reactions .
In general properties , and in the fact that the water of crystallization possessed by the hydrochlorate is lost at 100 ' , dicodeia hears a great resemblance to the u isomer of codeia55 obtained by Drs. Matthiessen and Armstrong by the action of diluted sulphuric acid on codeia* .
On comparison with the product obtained by Armstrong 's process , no difference whatever was discernible provided the hydrochlorate obtained by the action of sulphuric acid \amp ; c. were several times recrystallized .
The crude hydrochlorate contains , besides the dicodeia salt , the hydrochlorate of another polymeride which differs from dicodeia hydrochlorate in that it is non-crystalline , drying up to a gummy , extremely hygroscopic and deliquescent substance ; it yields a blood-red colour with N03H , and with S04 H2 + K2 Cr207 a very evanescent purplish red ; Fe2Cl6 gives no coloration at first , * Chem.

Action of Hydrochloric Acid on the Polymerides of Codeia .
( ?
) Tetracodeia.\#151 ; Tetracodeia hydrochlorate was boiled for six hours with a large excess of strong HC1 ; no perceptible evolution of methyl chloride took place ; and on examining the resulting product no change was found in the ratio of carbon to chlorine .
Hence no substitution of Cl for OH had taken place , and apparently no action at all had ensued .
( ?
) Tricodeia.\#151 ; Tricodeia hydrochlorate was heated to 100 ' for 1| hour with a large excess of strong HC1 ; on adding water to the product , a tarry substance was precipitated , whereas the original tricodeia hydrochlorate is readily soluble in dilute HC1 : precipitated by Na2 C03 and the precipitate exhausted with ether , a viscid non-crystalline hydrochlorate was obtained on agitation of the ethereal extract with HC1 .
The reactions of this product appear to be identical with those of tricodeia , excepting that the reddish purple tinge with Fe206 appears instantaneously instead of only after standing a short time .

' ' From the great similarity observed between this product and " apocodeia " made by Mat-thiessen and Burnside 's process* , it appears probable that the product of the action of zinc chloride on codeia is a mixture of bodies of general formula ( C18 Nl9 N02)m , wHCl , in which the derivative where n=6 greatly predominates : experiments on the action of zinc chloride on morphia now in progress in conjunction with Herr L.

The physical properties of this substance are almost identical with those of the bodies of analogous constitution ( containing C136 ) formerly obtained from both codeia and morphia ( Part IV .
) .
Carbonate of sodium throws down a precipitate almost insoluble in ether , showing that polymerization to the tetra series has taken place ; agitated with a large bulk of ether , this precipitate furnishes an extract which , on agitation with dilute nitric acid and boiling with AgN03 and N03 IT of the nitrate thus obtained , yields a precipitate of Agl , showing that iodine is contained in the precipitated base .
The substance itself , boiled with AgNOs and HNOs , produces a deep orange-colour , intermediate in tint between the blood-red produced by the derivatives of polymerized CnII19N03 , and the deep yellow of those of polymerized C17II21 NOs , a result confirmatory to some extent of the formula deduced from the analysis , this being capable of representation as 8(C17H20NO3 ) + 9HI-4H2O .
From this it appears pretty evident that the formulae hitherto attributed to the tetra bases ( containing CC3\#151 ; C72 ) are only half the true ones , which contain C136 \#151 ; C144 .

N03H and AgN03 give a blood-red coloration with this product , showing , as the analytical numbers indicate , that it is derived from polymerized C17 H19 N03 , and not from polymerized C17 H20 N03 , or C17 H2l N03 .
The foregoing results show that the methyl group in codeia is unaltered during the polymerization to dicodeia and to tetracodeia , and furnishes another proof of the conclusion come to in Part IV .
S 2 , that the addition of H2 for C17 , when HI and P act on morphia or codeia , takes place and not after the final polymerization ; even polymerization to dicodeia could not precede this addition of H2 , as the product obtained from that polymeride has only II added on for C17 .

Prom which it is clear that dicodeia is intermediate between tetracodeia and ordinary codeia .
From the fact that the basic 4HI for 8(C17 ) are added on in the case of the first product before the elimination of 4H2 O , as in the second substance in the list , it may be inferred that the action is not a true substitution of iodine for hydroxyl ; analogous facts have been observed in the chlorinated substances obtained by the action of HC1 on codeia and morphia , the first action being apparently a direct addition of the elements of HC1 , the subtraction of the elements of Ila O taking place at a later stage .

Action of Sulphuric Acid on Codeia and its Polymerides .
The results detailed in the previous sections show that the action of sulphuric acid on codeia is to polymerize it with the formation of di- , tri .
, and tetracodeia , the substances obtained by Armstrong and by An-derson by this means being identical with the first and last of these bases .
It appears probable that tetracodeia may be formed by the further poly , merization of dicodeia , whereas it would seem as though tricodeia were not likely to be obtained from dicodeia ; on the other hand , it is pos-sible that tetracodeia is directly produced from codeia , and that it could not be formed from dicodeia .
To settle this point , pure dicodeia was heated to very gentle ebullition with sulphuric acid diluted with its own bulk of water for five hours , the operation being conducted in a long-necked flask , so that no appreciable concentration by evaporation took place .
At the end of this time the dicodeia was wholly converted into a base , of which ether dissolved only traces , and hence no tricodeia was formed .
After precipitation by Na2C03 and drying , the free base was dissolved in alcohol and fractionally precipitated by ether .
If the alcoholic solution be nearly free from water , the ether throws down solid amorphous flakes ; but if 10 or more per cent , of water be present , the ether precipitate is a tarry fluid containing water , alcohol , and the base .
Flakes of tetracodeia were thus obtained identical in all respects with that obtained by the action of phosphoric acid ; a trace of some product of the further action of sulphuric acid appeared to be present , however , as the free base turned slightly green on drying , without , however , absorbing so much oxygen as to make any appreciable difference in its composition .

From these results it would appear that codeia produces cerebral congestion and increased reflex excitability without vomiting ; whilst di- and tetracodeia produce profuse salivation and some depression , with vomiting in several instances , no evidence of cerebral congestion and but little of increased reflex excitability being noticeable .

Conclusions .
The foregoing results suggest the probability of other bases being capable of forming similar polymerides .
In anticipation of this result experiments are in progress with morphia .
Ilesse has shown* that by the action of HC1 on thebaine there are produced two isomerides of that base , one forming crystalline salts , one amorphous salts ; not improbably these are respectively dithebaine and tetrathebaine .

] writer 's observations indicate that the former substance is more stable than the latter , which rapidly becomes more or less coloured ; not improbably these two forms are polymerides , the first being C21 H26 N2O0+H2 O , the second ( C)2 Hl3 N03)M wH2 O. Opianic acid* on heating , furnishes an anhydride of formula C40 H38 019 ; this tends to show that the formula of this acid is not less than C20 H20 O10 ; not impossibly , therefore , the formula of narcotine may be double that usually ascribed to it , and the dimethyl-nornarcotine , methylnornarcotine , and nornarcotine of Matthiessen may be derivatives not of ordinary narcotine , but of its polymerides .
The different modifications of the cinchona alkaloids are not impossibly polymerides of one another .
The Table ( p. 288 ) exhibits the principal differences between codeia and the polymerides above described .

( Abstract .
) The authors present in this paper the third instalment of the determination of the areas and heliographic positions occupied by the sun-spots observed by the Kew photoheliograph , comprising the years 1867 , 1868 , and 1869 .
They announce that the fourth and last instalment is in active progress , and will be preceded by the final discussion of the whole ten-yearly period , during which the photoheliograph has been at work .
This final discussion will contain the determination of the astronomical elements of the sun on the basis of photographic observations ; and this work , they anticipate , will not only settle the question of rotation for a considerable time to come , but will also throw light upon many points which have only recently been brought under the consideration of scientific men .
The results in general , they believe , will prove the superiority of photographic sun-observations over previous methods .
The second question which will be discussed is the distribution of sun-spots over the solar surface .
The facts already brought out indicate that the progress of the inquiry may lead to some definite laws which regulate the distribution ; there appear to exist centres of great activity on the sun , and the different solar meridians seem to have various but definite intervals of rest and activity .
In conclusion the authors point out the necessity of devoting in future greater attention to the study of the faculse , and express a hope of seeing photographic sun-observations carried on in this country on a more extended system , connecting from day to day solar phenomena with terrestrial meteorology and magnetism .
