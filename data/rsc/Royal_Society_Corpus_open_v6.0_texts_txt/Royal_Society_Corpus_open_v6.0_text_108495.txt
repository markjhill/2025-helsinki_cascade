from the theorems of art .
1 , that the coefficient of dyr dys dx{ dx , on the right will reduce itself to unity , and that of each of the remaining terms to zero ; so that we shall have , writing nowj , i for r , s , dyj dy .
Z { [ a , aq ] d(y , y- ) .
) In order then that the expression i-Y should vanish identically for every binary combination of indices , it follows from ( 28 .
) that it is sufficient , and from ( 27 .
) that it n(n-1 ) is necessary , that each of the 2 terms [ a , , aj should vanish , and vice versa .
It will be observed that the terms [ a , , aq ] cannot vanish otherwise than identically , since they do not contain any of the constants a , , a2 , &amp;c. , and it is by hypothesis impossible to eliminate all these constants from the equations ( a. ) .
It follows then that when the conditions [ ap , aq ] =subsist , the values of y , , ... y , expressed as above , are identically the partial differential coefficients of a function of x1 , ... X.n a , , ... a , .
We have thus established the theorem enunciated at the beginning of this article .
13 .
The preceding theorem may he made somewhat more general as follows : If we divide the 2n variables into any two sets of n each , so that no two in the same set are conjugate ( as for instance X1 ) X2 ... Xr3 yr+l , * " In YI , Y2 , ).Yr Xy r+ l *iX xn ) , and denote one set by and the other and the other by + ?
; , +_1 , ... ?
n , taking the + or sign according as ni represents yi or xi , it is obvious that the expression E d( , , a , ) is identical with [ ap , a ] ; and therefore whenever all the terms [ a. , a ] vanish , if the set , 2 , ... , ,n can be expressed by means of the equations ( a. ) of the last article , in terms of , i , , ... , , a , , a,. .
a , , , their values will be the partial differential coefficients with respect to 9 , , 21 ... , of a function of these variables and of the constants .

Theorem.-If of the system of 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order , dZ , dZ ( xi-d ' **** d-y , .

( where Z denotes any function of x , ... x. , yi , ... y and t , and accents denote as usual 85 total differentiation with respect to t ) there be given n integrals , involving n arbitrary constants a , , ... a , , as at=Pi(xlI x , ... x ) , yl , y , ... yW , t ) , the remaining integrals may be found , whenever the ( -1)conditions [ a , , aj]=0 are satisfied .

) the conditions dyj dyi d-~ --0 ... ... ... ... ( b. ) dxdx7.(0 ) Let ( Z ) represent the result of substituting in Z these values of y , ... , y , so that ( Z ) is a given function of x , , ... x , a1 , ... an , t. We shall have d(Z ) dZ dZ die , dZ dye dx-i dxdydxi dy2 di x " which the equations ( I. ) and ( b. ) reduce to d(Z)_ , ,dyi , die d(Z ) dyi d +i yi+ dl I -X2+ .
consequently d -d ... ... . .
( c. ) Looking now at the assemblage of equations ( b. ) , ( c. ) , we see that they express the following proposition : The values of yl , y2 , ... .
, Y , -(Z ) , are the partial differential coefficients with respect to x , .
x , ... x , t , of one and the same function .
Let this function be called X ; we have then dX dX dxi--y , , -t =-(Z ) ; ... ( II .
) and since y , ... , yX , ( Z ) are given filnctions of v , , &amp;c. , a , , &amp;c. , t , the function X can be found by simple integration .
Let us then suppose X to be known , and let us take the total differential coefficient dX 'hall have with respect to t , of da we shall have ( dX\ ) d2X d2X d. X daidt+ dadx + daidx 2 which , by virtue of ( I. ) and ( II .
) , becomes\daxi )y ldd ai , d dai + " ' 86 d(Z ) dZ die dZ d ~~~but " ^"-rdady1 dai ( since ( Z ) is derived from Z by introducing the values of yi , ... y " , in terms of xI , &amp;c. , a , , ... an ) , hence the second member of the preceding equation vanishes , and we have so that 'i is constant , and we may write dX dai ... ... ( I. ) and bi is an independent arbitrary constant , as it is easy to prove ; it is however unnecessary to do so here , because we have in fact already proved it in showing that the elimination of a , , ... an , bl , ... b , from the system of equations ( II .
) , ( III .
) , leads to the differential equations ( I. ) ( see art .
6 .
) .
The n equations ( III .
) give therefore the remaining n integrals of the system ( I. ) , of which ( II .
) and ( III .
) together are the complete solution .
The system of equations ( II .
) , ( III .
) being the same as that discussed in the preceding articles , all the conclusions there obtained will continue to subsist .
15 .
Suppose the expression for Z ( see the last article ) in terms of the variables is Z =/ ( XI , 2,. .
t , yI , y2 ... yW t ) Z is changed into ( Z ) by the substitution of l for y , &amp;c. ; and since is ( identi cally ) =-(Z ) , the equation dX ix dX dX 1dt+/ _ tdx dax t)=o ... .(X .
) is a partial differential equation satisfied by the function X. We have thus arrived , by an inverse route , at the point from which Sir W. HAMILTON'S theory , as improved by JACOBI , sets out .
JACOBI , namely , has shown ( by a demonstration immediately applying only to a particular form of the equation ( X. ) , but easily extended ) , that if X be any " complete " solution of the equation ( X. ) , that is , a solution involving ( besides the constant which may be merely added to X ) n arbitrary constants a , , a , ... a , , in such a way that they cannot be all eliminated from the n+1 equations obtained by differentiating X with respect to x , , ... x , , t , without employing all those equations , then X possesses the properties of Sir W. HAMILTON'S " ' Principal Function , " or in other words , gives all the integrals of the system ( I. ) by means of the system ( II .
) , ( III .
) .
It will be desirable briefly to indicate the mode in which this demonstration may be made to apply to the general form ( X. ) .
Assuming that a complete solution X , of that equation , is given , put d=Ys ; then 87 differentiating the equation ( X. ) with respect to xi , and employing the equations die , p dyq dxq dxp dyi df df dyi df die ?
we have t+d+ +f ?
*+ = ?
; wt e dx + die , da , die + dx .
on the other hand , taking the differential coefficient of yi with respect to t , without assuming anything as to the nature of the relations between t and the other variables , we find y=+ dyi dyi ... .

16 .
It is obvious , from the considerations given in art .
13 , that instead of the equation ( X. ) of the last article , we might employ any one of the analogous equations obtained by distributing the variables as explained in the article referred to , and then writing dfor ; i in the expression for Z. The function Q will be a " principal function .
" In particular , if we take the equation die , die die dtL J`ld**dyl they ' ylY2 , ** t}=02 any complete solution will give the integrals of the differential equations ( I. ) by means of the system die die x- , b--ba .
dyi^ dar"0 The whole number of partial differential equations from each of which a " principal function " can be obtained , will obviously be 2 " .
The relations between these different principal functions will be apparent from the conclusions of art .

If xl , x , , ... n represent all the independent coordinates ( of whatever kind ) in any ordinary dynamical problem , and T the expression for the vis vivat in terms of x , &amp;c. , x ' , &amp;c. , the equations of motion are , as is well known , dT\ ' dT dU\d } d xi dx .
' ( T. ) where U is a function of x1 , ... x. , which may also contain t explicitly , but not x'\ , &amp;c. LAGRANGE , to whom these formulae are due , was also the first to employ the expressions dT as new variables , instead of ax .
But Sir W. HAMILTON first showed that this subdxi stitution ( putting d=y ) would reduce the n equations ( T. ) to the 2n equations of the first order of the form ( I. ) , art .
14 .
His demonstration , however+ , depends upon the circumstance that T is , in dynaamical problems , necessarily homogeneous with respect to x , ... .
x , and I am not aware that any other case has hitherto been contemplated .
The investigations of the preceding articles will however enable us to apply a similar transformation to the equations ( T. ) , in the case in which no limitation is imposed upon the form of the function T , as I shall now proceed to show .
18 .
Putting T+U=W , we shall have ( since U does not contain x1 , &amp;c. ) dW dW ( W. ) dx dxi dW Let =yi ; then if we take dziX z=-(W ) , ( +( X)y + ( ; )y2+ ... + ( ) in ... ... .
( V. ) ( where , in the terms enclosed in brackets , x ' , x , &amp;c. are to be expressed in terms of y1 , y , &amp;c. , x1 , x2 , &amp;c. ) , we shall have , by the theorems of the former articles ( see equations ( 6 .
) , ( 8 .
) , ( 9 .
) of arts .
2 and 3 , putting x\ instead of xi and xi instead of p , in those equations ) , , dZ azd xi= and dW dZ dxi dxi so that the equation ( W. ) becomes dZ S=-b ... ... ... . .
and ( a. ) , ( 3 .
) are of the form in question* ( ( I. ) , art .
14 .
) .
Thus , so far as the application of any methods of integration , founded upon the preceding principles , and the theories of Siir W. HAMILTON and JACOBI , to the system ( T. ) , art .
16 , is concerned , there is no restriction to the form of the function T. This extension is probably at present of no practical importance , but may perhaps be thought of some interest in a purely analytical point of view .
19 .
Returning now to the suppositions and conclusions of art .
14 , let us further suppose that Z does not contain t explicitly , so that z ( dZ dZ )- ?
by virtue of the system ( I. ) ; in this case Z=h ... ... ... ... ( h. ) is one of the integrals of the system , and if we suppose this to be one of the n given integrals from which the principal function X is to be found , so that h , al , / ,2 ... an_are now the n arbitrary constants , and the conditions [ a , aj]=0 , Ch , aajo= subsist , it is plain that we shall have ( Z ) =h , In the case in which T is homogeneous and of the second degree , in 1 , c. , it is obvious that the expression for Z reduces itself to -2(T ) -W , or ( T)U .
90 since the expression for Z must reduce itself identically to h when the values of y , ... y obtained from the integrals are substituted in it .
Hence dX d-t h , and therefore X=--ht+V , dX dV V being a function not containing t explicitly .
We have then --=-- , so that V is to be fouhd from the n expressions dV die Txi Lastly , the n remaining integrals will be dX dX i d= , dai(r representing the arbitrary constant conjugate to h ) ; and , substituting in these the above expression for X , we obtain dV d. .
V v=t+ dV h. ** ( 29 .
) dh -dai ... ... .
The function V now satisfies , and may be defined by , the partial differential equation f ( x,. .
, .
) - ... =h , ... . .
( V. ) wheref(xi , ... x , , y , , ... in ) is the expression for Z in terms of the variables .
This , in dynamical problems , is the case in which the so-called " principle of vis viva " subsists .
I shall , in the rest of this paper , use h exclusively in the above signification , and call it , whether actually referring to a dynamical problem or not , the " constant of vis viva " whilst the integral Z=h may be called the " integral of vis viv'a .
20 .
When the 2n integrals of the system of differential equations ( I. ) , art .
14 , are expressed in the manner which has been explained , it follows from the conclusions of former articles , that when these integrals are put in the form ai= OX *1 .
, i x , y ... y , t ) b , = , ( xl , ... .
, x , yl ... , t ) , the conditions [ a , b]= 1 , [ a , bj ] =0 , [ bm , bj]=0 will subsist , as well as [ at , aJ ] =0 .
I shall call any system of 2n integrals in which these conditions are fulfilled , a " normal solution , " or a system of " normal integrals , " whilst the 2n arbitrary constants contained in such a system may be called " normal elements .
" Any pair ai , bi , may be called ( as before ) conjugate elements .
In the case considered in art .
19 , h and r are conjugate elements , these letters being used instead of a , b , merely from obvious motives of convenience , It has been one principal object of these investigations to ascertain what advantages could be gained-either for the actual integration of a system of equations of the N2 91 form ( I. ) , or for the transformation of known solutions into forms convenient for the application of the method of variation of elements-by making the discovery of principal functions depend upon that of n integrals satisfying given conditions , rather than upon the solution of a partial differential equation .
Having now prepared the way for this inquiry , I shall proceed with it in the following section , SECTION II , 21 .
Theorem.-If p , q , r be any three functions whatever of the 2n variables x1. .
, , y , , ... y tLen [ [ p , ] , q rl +[[+ , rE , p , J+EL[r , p ] , q= ... ( 30 .
) ( The symbols have the same signification as in the last section .
See art .
9 .
) This may be proved as follows .
It is evident that if the above expression were developed , each term would consist of a second differential coefficient of one of the functions p , q , r , multiplied by aJirst differential coefficient of each of the other two .
Consider then the terms in which p is twice differentiated ; these will be of the three forms d_p dq dr pd dq dr and dpdq dr x*iddj dxj die di y dydyj lidyj d dx each of which will arise from the first and third terms of ( 30 .
) only .
( It is to be observed that i may =y .
) Now if we examine each of these forms , we see easily that for every term arising from thefirst terma of ( 30 .
) , there is a similar term with the opposite sign arising from the third term of ( 30 .
) ; and since a similar proposition would be true of the terms in which q , r , respectively , are twice differentiated , the whole expression on the left of the equation ( 30 .
) vanishes identically .
The theorem is therefore established .
It is obvious that p , q , r may contain , explicitly , any other quantities ( as t ) besides the 2n variables with respect to which the differentiations are performed .
Let J represent , either , one of the 2n variables x , , &amp;c. , y , &amp;c. , or any other quantity whatever , explicitly contained in p and q. It is evident that we shall have d dq d[P , ] q ] ... ... . .
( 31 .
) 22 .
Resutning now the consideration of the 2n simultaneous differential equations discussed in the first section , namely , , dZ , dZ xi dy= -d.= ... ... . .
( I. ) we shall be enabled , by means of the theorems ( 30 .
) , ( 31 .
) of the last article , to give a very simple and direct proof of the proposition indirectly demonstrated in art .
9 .
For let u be any function whatever of the variables x , , &amp;c. , y , &amp;c. , t ; then du .
du i du , \ u= die +i +Y 92 and if the values of x , y ' given by ( I. ) be substituted in this expression , it becomes , du =t + [ Z , u ] ... ... . .
( 32 .
) Let u.=[p , q ] , then ( making use of ( 31 .
) ) [ P ) V]'= IF q]+ , + +Z , [ C , q ] .
Now suppose that , by virtue of the differential equations ( I. ) , the values ofp and g are constant ; or , in other words , that p= , ( xl , &amp;c. , y , , &amp;c. , t ) q=,4(x1 , &amp;c. , yi , &amp;c. , t ) are any two integrals whatever of the system ( I. ) ; p , q representing two arbitrary constants .
The equation p'=O gives ( see ( 32 .
) ) %+t+CZ , pI=- , ~or d=[z , P-I , hence [ , q]=-[[Z , p ] , q]=[ , [ Z , p]j In like manner [ p , ]f =P , [ q , Z ] ] .
Thus the expression given above for [ p , q ] ' becomes Ip3 q]'=[p [ .
z]]2+[q ) [ z , p]]+[Z [ pZ , ?
] which is identically equal to 0 , by the theorem ( 30 .
) .
Consequently , for any two integrals p and q , [ p , q= ] constant ... ... ... . .
( 33 .
) This theorem , as has been already mentioned , was discovered , in the case of the dynamical equations , by POISSON ; and the fact that he was able to arrive at it through so long and complex a process as that which he has given in his first memoir on the Variation of Arbitrary Constants* , must be looked utpon as a remarkable instance of his analytical skill .
I am not acquainted with any attempt to simplify the demonstration , except that of Sir W. HAMILTONt ; in fact it is probable that no material simplification was attainable without the help of the transformation of the differential equations to the form ( I. ) , towards which POISSON ( as JACOBI has remarked ) only made a first step .
Sir W. HAMILTON'S demonstration may certainly be considered simple as compared with that of POISSON .
That which I have given above will , I hope , be regarded as a further improvement .
23 .
In what follows I shall use such expressions as " the integral c , " as an abbreviation for " the equation c=(p(x , , &amp;c. , y , &amp; c , ) .
" It is of course understood that the function on the right contains neither c nor any other arbitrary constant explicitly .
Let then f , g be any two given integrals of the system ( I. ) .
It has been shown that we shall always have j , g ] = constant ... ... ... .
( K. ) But this equation may be true either ( 1 ) identically , or ( 2 ) not identically .
In the first case the expression [ f , g ] may either be identically =0 , or it may reduce itself identically to a determinate constant which might always be made unity by multiplying one of the integrals by a factor .
( In the case of a " normal -ystem " of integrals ( art .
20 .
) , it has been seen that every binary combination gives either 0 or 1 .
) But if the above equation ( K. ) be not identically true , so that f , g ] obtains a constant value only by virtue of the differential equations , then the constant on the right of ( K. ) is an arbitrary constant , and that equation is itself an integral .
But here again there are two cases ; for the function [ f , g ] may be only a combination of the functions on the right of the two integrals f ; g ; and then ( K. ) is not a new integral , but only a combination of the two given ones ; or , on the other hand , [ f gn may be a function independent of / ; g ; and then ( K , ) is really a new integral , which cannot be produced by merely combining the other two , Thus it appears that POISSON 's theorem may in some cases lead to the discovery of new integrals , when two are known .
On this subject , and others connected with it , I refer to the interesting memoir of M. BERTRAND in LIouvILLE 's Journal ( 1852 ) , " Sur l'intgration des 6quations diff6rentielles de la M6canique .
" 24 .
Let c , , c , ... cm be any m integrals , and let A , g be any two functions of the m constants c , , c , ,. .
, , so that f , g are also two integrals ; and considering f , g as functions of c } , ... , c and , through them , of the variables , we have exactly as in art .
9 , equation ( 24 .
) , V , g ] .
, ,,..* ... ( L. ) d ) ( i , Ii ) the summation extending to all binary combinations of the m constants c , &amp;c. If then we suppose k , , kI , ... , k to be m functions ( such as A , k ) of the m constants c , ... , c , we shall have for any pair kp , k , [ kp kq ] fd(kp kq ) [ c [ ~ ]=I-.q terms of cl , &amp;c. are not all independent ; a supposition which we exclude , in order that kl , ... k may represent m distinct integrals .
The equations above written lead obviously to the following conclusions(1 .
) Iff be a given fulction of the m constants cl , ... c , ; then the determination of another function g , such that [ f , g ] =0 , depends in general upon the solution of a linear partial differential equation of the first order .
( 2 .
) It is impossible that the conditions [ k , , kj ] = can exist for every binary cornbination of k k , ... , kn , unless [ ci , c3 =0 for every binary combination of ci , ... , c. 25 .
As an illustration of the first of these conclusions , we may take a case which actually occurs in many dynamical problems .
Let c , , c2 , c , be three integrals , such that [ c2 , c , ]=C , [ 3 , l]= 2 , [ c1 , cI , c]= ... ... ( C. ) and let it be required to find a function g of cl , c , c3 , such that [ c1 , g]= 0 .
The equation ( L. ) of the last article gives , if we putf= cl , and introduce the conditions ( c. ) , Cdg dg=O C dcs The solution of which is g=.~(qc+c2 ) , .
, ... ... ..* ( g. ) k being an arbitrary function ( which may evidently also contain c , in an arbitrary manner ) .
If , instead off=c , , we putf=-(c ?
t.d+-+c ) , it will be found that the expression on the right of the equation ( L. ) vanishes identically ; so that in this case , if g be any arbitrary function of c , , c2 , c , , the condition f , g ] =0 will be satisfied .
26 .
If a , a2 ... ab &amp; , b^2.* b. be a system of normal elements ( art .
20 .
) , we have ( equation ( 25 .
) , art .
9 .
) d(ai , bi ) where f , g represent any two functions of the elements , or in other words , any two integrals whatever .
If in the above equation we put successively f=ai , f=b , , we obtain C[a , ]-=I[ , b. , = ]=dg. .
( 36 .
) [ ai , 9 ] 4[ bi 'g ] = ( 36 .
) In the case where the principle of vis viva subsists , we may suppose the constant of vis viva , h , to be one of the elements .
In this case ( see ( 29 .
) , art .
19 .
) the element conjugate to h is r , and t appears in none of the integrals explicitly , except one , namely , the integral conjugate to h , which is dV If , then , g be any integral whatever , not ctaining t explicitly it cannot contain r since any combination of the normal integrals involving T , will involve it in the form 95 y+t .
Consequently , for every such integral we shall have , by ( 36 .
) , [ g , hi=0 , ... ... . .
( 37 .
) since =0 .
dr This particulat consequence of the formula ( 36 .
) follows also immediately from ( 32 .
) , art .
22 , since the equation g'=0 gives , by ( 32 .
) , [ Z , g-=0 , and in this case Z=h , so that [ Z , ]= [ h , g ] .
In this manner the theorem expressed by ( 37 .
) has been already obtained by M. BERTRAND .
Examples of the preceding Methods .
27 .
I shall now exemplify the principles which have been explained , by applying them to two of the most familiar as well as important problems of dynamics .
First then let it be required to obtain in a normal form the integrals of the differential equations which determine the motion of a material point , acted on by a force emanating from a fixed centre and depending only on the distance .
Taking the centre of force as the origin of a system of rectangular coordinates , let mn be the mass , and x , y , z the coordinates of the moving point .
Then T= m ( x2 ty2+ z , % ) and U ( see art .
17 .
) is a given function of r , say p(r ) , where r2=2+y2t+z .
Let -us put dT dT dT ; 'P , d=T , =w so that , referring to the notation used in the preceding pages , we have x , y , z instead of x , xI , x^ u , v , w instead of y , y , y.3 Moreover , u=mxI , v=my ' , w=mz ' .
Hence we obtain Z=(T)--U=-m-(u+v2+w2)--(r ) so that the integral of vis viva , or Z=h , becomes m(u2+v2+w2)--(r)=h ; and the three integrals which express the conservation of areas become ywZv= C zu-xw= -V--YU C3 .
These integrals are immediately seen to satisfy the conditions [ c2 , C. ] =-c , , [ C.l C , ] =-c2 , [ EC1 , cJ = - .
8 from which it follows ( see art .
25 , the result of which is obviously unaffected by the negative signs ) , that if we take k=(+ +c ) , the condition [ c , k]=0 will besatisfied 96 ( as is easily found to be true ) ; and since neither of the integrals c3 , k contain t explicitly , the conditions [ h , c,3]=0 , [ h , k]=0 will subsist also ( art .
26 .
) .
Hence it follows that if we solved algebraically the three integrals h , c,3 , k so as to express u , v , w in terms of x , y , z , their values would be the partial differential coefficients of a function V , from which the three remaining integrals could be found ( arts .
12 and 19 .
) .
But it is more convenient to adopt a different system of coordinates .
Reverting then to the primitive form of the three integrals which we have chosen , and writing c instead of c , , we have T-U=h ... . .
( i. ) m(xy'-yx ' ) c ... .
( ii .
) m2(r2(xI2+yf2+z r2 ) r2r'2). .
( iii .
) 28 .
Let us now employ , instead of x , y , z , the three coordinates g , 0 , z ; where z is the same as before , g is the projection of r on the plane of xy , and 0 is the angle between g and the positive axis of x. We shall thus have f2+z2=r2 , x= cos 0 , y=g sin 0 , and T= m(f2+ 2 +2 ) .
Let dT dT dT Let T^ WW d--u , dv , d 'w ( where u and v have now a new signification ) , then f u , __ v , z , ; m mg m and the three integrals at the end of the last article become , after obvious reductions , -(u2++ w2)-=h+(r ) ... . .
( i. ) v= c. ( ii .
) r2 ( gw _)2 ... ... ... ..iii The conditions [ h , c ] =0 , [ h , k ] =0 , [ c , k]=O0 continue to subsist with reference to the new variables ; the two former necessarily , because ( ii .
) and ( iii .
) do not contain t ( art .
26 .
) , and the third actually , as is seen on trial ( not accidentally , as will be shown hereafter ) .
We know , therefore , that the values of u , v , w , found from these equations , will be the partial differential coefficients with respect to g , 0 , z of a function V of these latter variables .
C2 The two first give u2W2-=2m(h+p(r))-- , and if we multiply this by 2+Z2--=r , and subtract ( iii .
) , we obtain ( introducing the condition ( ii .
) ( gu + zw)2=2mr2(h+~p(r ) ) k2 .
97 Lastly , if this be combined with ( iii .
) , the following expressions are found for u and w : ur22mr2(^h+p(r))-k2 } r{k2 rC22 w=5 { 2mr2 ( h+ ( r))-k2 }2 + { k2r c2J ( in which it is to be remembered that r=2=2+f2 ) , and if to these we join the equation ( ii .
) , the values of u , v , w are explicitly given in terms of the conjugate variables , , 0 , z. We have then ( art .
19 .
) V= ( ud+vdo+wdz ) ; or , substituting the above values , V= c+J{ d+ zdz ( 2mr2(h+p(r))--k2 + dz-zd~ ( k2 --rc2 ) 2 The term under the integral sign is easily seen to be ( as we know a priori it must be ) a complete differential .
It is convenient however to transform it thus .
First , we have gdg+zdz=rdr ; next , let the latitude of the body ( or the angle between r and the plane of x , y ) be x ; then tan k=Z , and gdz zdfg=r2d , r= sec2 x. Making these substitutions , the expression for V becomes V= c+ f(2mr2(hA+ ( r ) ) -k 2 ) +Jd(k.--c2 sec2 .
) .
The integration in the second term cannot be effected till the form of the function p(r ) is given : that of the third term may be more conveniently periformed after the differentiations with respect to c and k , as in the next article .

Let = cos ; then ---= cot , and the equation ( v. ) becomes tan.= tan,.sin ( --3 ) , ... .
( v.a ) which expresses that the orbit is in a plane whose inclination to the plane of x , y is i. Also 3 is evidently the longitude of the node , reckoned from the axis of x. The last term on the left of ( vi .
) becomes sin A\ Now if 2 be the " argument of latitude " or the angle between the node and the radius vector r , we have evidently sin 5= sin _ , so that the above term is simply , , and the integral ( vi .
) becomes _--=k 2 krmr2(h + ( r))-k2}.(vi.a ) 30 .
To apply the above expressions to the case of the undisturbed motion of a planet , we have only to put p(r)=Lm , where m is now the mass of the planet , and pr the sum of the masses of the sun and planet , the origin of coordinates being placed at the sun .
It would be useless to give the well-known expressions to which the integrations now lead , my object being merely to obtain a set of normal elements .
Now in this case we have ( by well-known theorems ) , if a be the semiaxis major , e the excentricity , and , as before the inclination , h-2 k= V/ ja(I -e2 ) , and therefore c= Up , a( I -e2).cos .
Also , if we take for the inferior limit of the integrations in ( iv .
) and ( vi.a ) the minimum value of r , or the perihelion distance , it is plain that a will be the longitude of the node , reckoned from the perihelion in the plane of the orbit , and -r the time of perihelion passage .
Thus we have the following six elements , arranged in conjugate pails:2--9 -(time of perihelion passage ) 2d v4 , a( l-e2 ) , ( angle between node and perihelion ) V/ pa(l --e2).cos , ( longitude of node ) .
o2 99 It is obvious that we may change the signs of the first pair .
And generally , that iff , g be any two conjugate elements , we may substitute for them / , -Ig , where X is any determinate constant , i. e. not a function of the elements* .
The above elements coincide with those given by JACOBI .
My object has been merely to illustrate a mode of obtaining them which seems capable of useful applications .
31 .
As a second example I shall apply the method to the case of the motion of a solid body about a fixed point .
Let the fixed point be taken for the origin , and the principal axes of the body through that point for the axes of x , y , z. Let , v , ' refer to the same origin and to axes fixed in space ; a , b , c being the direction-cosines of the axis of x referred to the fixed axes of 6 , , 9 and a ' , b ' , c ' ; a " , b " , c " being respectively the direction-cosines of the axes ofy and z. Let 0 be the inclination of the plane of x , y ( or " equator " ) to that of % , v ( orl " ecliptic " ) ; 4 the longitude of the node , reckoned from the axis of I , and p the right-ascension of the axis of x. Then if A , B , C be the Moments of Inertia , and p , q , r the angular velocities , about the axes of x , y , z , the expression for the vis viva is T= ( Ap2+Bq2+Cr2 ) , where p =- ' cos p-- ' sin p sin 0 q= ' sin -- , ' cos f sin 0 r= p ' + ' cos 0 .
Let u , v , w be the variables conjugate respectively to 0 , % , 5 , so that dT dT dT U=7-0 , v=- , w=- , de " VdW d+ " the following expressions will be found without difficulty : Ap = -u cos P+sn(v cos --w ) A--u lco si cos +i Bq=u sin P+ sin0 ( v os -w ) Cr=v .
Considering at present only the case in which no forces act , we have the integral of vis viva T=h , which becomes 1-u cos P+ sin ( v cos d-w ) ) ( u sin p+ iCO ( v cos O-w ) +Cv=2h ... ... ... ... ... ( i. ) The three integrals which express the conservation of areas , namely , Aap+Ba'q+Ca"r=e , Abp+Bb'q+Cb"r=f , Acp+Bc'q+Cc"r=g , become , after simple reductions , sin , -u cos -sin ( v-w cos)=e cos 4 , -u sin +sin ( v-w cos ) =f w=-g .
Let e2-f2+-g2=k2 ; we have , adding the squares of these three equations , u 2+_w2_(v-w cos 02 ( ii U2+W2+ sina =- , ). .
( ii .
) and we may take the three equations ( i. ) , ( ii .
) , and w=-g ... ... . .
( iii .
) as three normal integrals ; the conditions [ g , h]=0 , [ h , k]= , [ k , g]= being obviously satisfied .
These three equations determine u , v , w as functions of 0 , p , P4 ; and supposing the three former variables to be explicitly expressed in terms of the latter , we should have at once the three partial differential coefficients d-dV dV- ; the determination of V would therefore depend upon simple integration , and the remaining integrals would be given by means of the three equations dV dV dV dh t , dg C1 , dk =C2d r , c1 , c2 being new arbitrary constants .
In the general case , however , the algebraical solution of the equations ( i. ) , ( ii .
) , ( iii .
) is impracticable , since the elimination of v and w leads to an equation of the fourth degree in u ; nor does it seem possible to evade the difficulty by choosing a different combination of integrals , since it may be shown that the necessary conditions cannot be satisfied unless two at least of the combinations chosen are of the second degree in u , v , w. 32 .
Mr. CAYLEY has given* a solution of this problemn , which , though differing totally in form and method from the above , resembles it in arriving exactly at a corresponding point .
For in Mr. CAYLEY'S equations ( 27 .
) , ( 28 .
) , ( and v are to be expressed as functions of v ; but this requires the algebraical solution of the system ( 18 .
) for p , q , r , and is therefore impracticable .
( The two equations ( i. ) , ( ii .
) of the last article are merely transformations of the two first of Mr. CAYLEY'S ( 18 .
) ; and ( iii .
) , though not identical with the third , is of the same degree ; so that the algebraical difficulty is precisely the same in both methods .
) 33 .
If we suppose A=B , the algebraical difficulty disappears , and the solution of the problem can be explicitly completed .
But on account of the importance and interest of this case I shall make it the subject of a separate section , in which it will also be shown that the solution of the general case may be made to depend upon it , by means of the variation of elements .
( See Section III .
) 34 .
Suppose any complete normal solution of the system of differential equations ( I. ) , art .
14 , be known , i. e. a solution involving the 2n elements m , a2 , ... an .
bb,..* .
bn which satisfy the conditions ( 23 .
) , art .
9 ; then an infinite number of other sets of normal elements can always be found .
For if we determine the 2n quantities n , ... a , ... 3f , as functions of a , &amp;c. , b , &amp;c. by the 2n equations dA_ dA_ da-r^ ' =pi daj where A is any arbitrary function of it is obvious that the whole of the reasoning by which the formulae ( 19 .
) , art .
7 , were established may be repeated , merely putting A in place of X , and a , f3 instead of x , y. And repeating in like manner the reasoning of art .
9 , mutatis mutandis , it will follow that iff , g represent any two of the 2n quantities i , , &amp;c. , P3 , &amp;c. , the expression d(f , g ) d(bi , ai ) will be equal to unity iff , g be a pair of the form a , j , and will vanish in every other case .
But it was also shown ( ( 25 .
) art .
9 ) that the above expression is equivalent to --I , g ] ; it follows then that Etz= , =*E , =[CI l]=[ -]o* ; or , in other words , that a , , ... , , 3i , ... *3 , , are a new set of normal elemtents .
This method however can hardly be of much use in practice , because we cannot ( at least without the solution of partial differential equations ) detelDrmine what form of the function A will cause any of the new eletments to be given functions of the old .
But the problems most likely to occur may be solved in another way , as follows .
35 .
Assumling for the set , , , a2 , ... , , given functions of the set a , , a , ... a , only , it is required to find 1 , , ... , , ( It will be observed that the conditions [ a , a]i=0 are necessarily satisfied in this case by virtue of ( 25 .
) , art .
9 , since a , , &amp;c. do not involve b , , &amp;c. ) It is plain , that if the principal function X had been found from the n integrals a , , a , , ... a , ( as in art .
14 .
) , it would be changed into that which would be found from the n integrals a , , a2 , , a , , , merely by introducing the expressions for a , , ... a , , in terms of , , ... a , ; which expressions would be found by algebraical inversion of the assumed equations which give the latter set as functions of the former .
Let X represent the fuilction X thus transformed ; we have then dX dX daXl daX fe i-d.c7da desi d ... da , da .
b dad = bd+ +b2 + b.n. .
( 38 .
) Thus fPi is determined as a function of the old elements , since L &amp;c. may be expressed in terms of the latter .
In like manner we should have a set of inverse equations bi=t3 , d +p32+* ... -+ *- , ... .
( 39 .
) dai 2da i which may be used instead of ( 38 .
) .
It is apparent that 3 , , &amp;c. will involve in general the elements a , , &amp;c. as well as b , , &amp;c. Conversely , if we assumed for 3 , , &amp;c. given functions of the set b , , ... b , alone , we to ( 19 .
) , but would not answer our present purpose .
I regret to use symbols with a meaning different from that which custom has to some extent sanctioned ; but there seemed to be only a choice of difficulties .
Mr. SPOTTtSWooDE has suggested to me the employment of the symbols ( analogous to Mr. SYLVESTER 's umbral " notation ) L V , W ... , zddd -iedy , ***.d Lais ? ? ?
?--J L d- ` Tie dz J ?
instead of those which I have used , namely , d(u , v , w , ... ) d I , ; .
x &gt; , * , d(X , y , z , ... ) If these were adopted , the two forms ( p , q ) , [ p , q ] might be used without confusion in their usual significations .
See note to art .
9 .
But although the " umbral " forms are more suggestive of the properties which belong to the above expressions as dterminants , the other forms bring more into view the analogies which connect them with the differential calculus ; and therefore , for the purposes of this paper , I have preferred them .
And it is perhaps better , for the present , that different notations should be tried* than that any attempt should be made to fix upon a definitive system for subjects so recent as those connected with the theory of determinants .
103 should have , for determining , , &amp;c. , either of the systems oi=2 , ( a , - ) , ar=2(g ) .
, .
( 40 .
) ai =v ai dg I ai db , We might obtain in this way an indefinite variety of sets of elements for the case of elliptic motion , beginning with those given at the end of art .
30 .
But it will be better to defer this illustration till after the discussion of the Method of the Variation of Elements , which will form the subject of a future Section .
36 .
It results , from the investigations of this and the preceding Sections , that if a set of n integrals al , a2 , ... an be given , satisfying the 2 conditions [ ai , aj =0 , the determination of n more integrals b , ... b , , constituting , with the given ones , a complete normal set , is a determinate problem , admitting of a unique solution , and always reducible ( setting aside algebraical difficulties ) to quadratures .
But if , out of a complete normal set , n be given of which one or more pairs are coqjugate , then the completion of the set is no longer a determinate problem , since the remaining n integrals , containing also one or more conjugate pairs , admit , to some extent , of arbitrary transpositions and combinations , as is evident from considerations similar to those employed in arts .
13 and 35 .
Hence we should expect a priori that the problem would require the solution of partial differential equations .
It appears , indeed , at first sight , that having any n of the elements given functions of the variables , the relations established in art .
9 , with the others included in the formula ( 21 .
) , art .
9 , would furnish more than a sufficient number of equations to determine explicitly all the partial differential coefficients of the remaining elements in terms of the variables* , at least in the case in which the principle of vis viva subsists , and the given integrals do not contain t. But it is certain from the above considerations that this cannot be the case , and therefore that the equations furnished by those conditions cannot be all independent .
I have not at present attempted to show this directly , though it would probably be easy to do so .
Note on , art .
2 , Section I. The theorem established in this article may be morne shortly demonstrated as follows : Since d2(x:yi ) i(xdyi ) + , ( yidx ) and i , ( y , dx)-=dX ( by ( 5 .
) ) , we have 2i(xidy , )=d(--X+i(xiyi ) ) an equation which must become identical when x , , x , &amp; c , on each side are expressed in terms of y , , y , &amp; c , But the right side being then a complete differential of a function of y , , y , &amp;c. , the left side must be so also ; hence the conditions dyj=-dy must subsist .
The investigation of art .
2 shows that they do subsist , and is therefore perhaps to be preferred .
SECTION III.-On the Equations of Rotatory Motion .
37 .
In this supplelnentary section I propose further to exemplify the preceding theory by exhibiting the application of it to the problem of rotation in a more detailed form than was consistent with the plan of the former part of this essay .
For this purpose it will first be desirable to anticipate the subject of a future section , so far as to give a concise deduction of the method of the variation of elements in its simplest form .
38 .
Variation of Elements.-Suppose a complete normal solution of the system of differential equations dZ dZ x=^d y ; +d=O .
* ... .(I .
) has been obtained , so that we have 2n elements , divided into two conjugate sets a , , a2 , ... an ; b6 , b2 , .
, bn as in the former articles , so that [ ai , b ] = 1 , [ at , aa ] = [ bi , bj ] = [ a , 1b ] =O0 It is required to express the solution of the system dZ dfn dZ dil x+ +--+ Y =0.0 ... ... .
0 idyi dyi ddi dx ( I. in the same form by means of variable elements .
The disturbing function Qf may be a function of all the variables x1 , &amp;c. , yl , &amp;c. , and may also contain t explicitly .
In the undisturbed problem we have a'=O , b=,0 ; i. e. the equations t+[Z , ai]=0 , d+[Z , b , ]=0. .
( e. ) ( see art .
22 .
) subsist identically when x , , &amp;c. , y , , &amp;c. are expressed in terms of the elements and t. In the disturbed problem , x1 &amp;c. , yi , &amp;c. are to be the same functions of the elements and t as before ; hence the equations ( e. ) continue to subsist identically , and therefore the values of a , b ' , namely , dai a ; = +i [ Z , a ] + E[f , aJ b , = dt+ [ , b , ]+ [ n , b , ] 105 become simply a =[2 , a , ] , b'=[fn , bi ] .
In these expressions Q , ai , b , are supposed to be expressed in terms of the variables .
Now -[Q , a ] ?
d( in , ai d(yx , ax ) but , by equation ( 26 .
) , art .
10 , this is equivalent to d ( , ai ) d(bj , a , ) ' in which Ql is expressed as a function of the elements and t ; and this last expression obviously reduces itself to the single term In like manner the expression for [ Q , bi ] reduces itself to + - ; thus the equations for determining the variation of the elements are , dQ , _ dQ , a= a= , **** ... ... ( E. ) in which fl is to be expressed as a function of the elements and tM .
This will be a sufficient account of the method for our immediate purpose .
39 .
The following propositions in spherical trigonometry will be required .
If a , b , c be the sides , and a , 3 , y the opposite angles of any spherical triangle , then ( cos + cos is)2 _1 cos a cos p cos ( a+b ) = l-cosin ... ... .

) sin C si'n and if the sides be considered as functions of the angles , then da db dc Ccosy+ cos. ( 42 .
) da db+ d d7=cos ?
^+cosP ... ... .
( 43 .
) The two last are easily verified ; but as the others are not so obvious , I shall give the demonstration .
Putting x for the expaession on the right of the equation ( 40 .
) , we easily obtain COS2-f sinl COs--_ -x 222 -/ + a+4+y -+ -_ os02 co sin---2 22 Cos2COsCOS cos CosCos +222 COS -2 tan2 C tan2 a -2a+P 22 COBS2 wtlence it is plain that x= cos ( a+b ) , and in like manner may the equation ( 41 .
) be established .
40 .
Returning now to the problem of rotation , and supposing , for convenience , that the question refers to the motion of the earth about its centre of gravity , the following will be the signification of the symbols employed .
A , B , C are the moments of inertia , about the principal axes of the earth , viz. the axes of x , y , z ; the last being the polar axis , and the arrangement being such that the positive direction of z is to the north pole , and that the positive axis of x follows that of y in the actual rotation about the polar axis : p , q , r being the angular velocities about the three principal axes , the usual convention will be adopted as to their signs ; so that in the actual case r is positive .
The arrangement of the fixed axes of ; , v , g is supposed similar to that of x , y , z , the plane of 5 , v being a fixed ecliptic , and the axis of e the origin of longitudes unless another origin be expressly indicated .
Then 0 is the oliquity , 4 , the longitude of the vernal equinox , and p the right ascension of the axis of x ; all referring to the fixed ecliptic .
Let the " principal plane " signify that which , in the undisturbed problem , is the " invariable plane .
" Then i is the inclination of the principal plane to the fixed ecliptic , andj is the inclination of the equator to the principal plane .
In the case of the earth , A is nearly equal to B , 0 never differs sensibly from i , and j is therefore always small .
But these conditions are not supposed in what follows .
It is assumed however that C is the greatest of the three moments of inertia .
These conventions , in which it is very desirable to avoid any ambiguity , may be illustrated by the annexed figure , in which 0 represents the origin of longitudes .
The angles of the spherlical triangle formed by the intersection of the three planes with a spherical surface are i , j , r-O ; and the sides opposite to them will be denoted by I , J , 0 .
Thus we shall have os I cos icosj cOS os J cos i os c co I cos J--- ... .
i sj 0s sin i sin 0 cos 0= cos i cosjsin i sinj cos. 2 107 And , in the figure , OT=- , , and e is measured from T in the direction Indicated by 0\^ ^ / \ e. X tT -YX ' ' ' the arrow , which is also the direction of the rotation about the polar axis .
Moreover , if the direction-cosines of the axes of nx , y , z referred to the fixed axes , be respectively a , b , c ; a ' , b ' , c ; a " , b " ' , c " , we shall have a= cos 4 , cos psin 4 sin s cos 0 at cos 4 sin psin 4 cos p cos 0 a"=sin s sin 0b= sin 4 cos p+ cos 4 sin p cos 0 b ' =sin 4 sin p+ cos 4 cos cos c b"cos 4 sin 0c -= sin sin gc =cos p sin 0 C"COS a p=-cos p-'sin p sin 0 q=f0 sin p- ' cos p sin 0 r='+P'r cos 0 , hence we obtain the expressions for u , v , w employed in art .
31 , viz. ud-= Ap cos p+Bq sin p dh v= =Cr dw=sinsin cossin w= =.--Ap sinp sin --Bq cos P sin 0+Crcos 0 , 108 from which the following also are easily deduced : A+B A-B uA+B'+A 2 B( ' cos 2+t sn sin 2sinp ) v=C('+ , c ' cos 0 ) , A+B A-B wU~ +2 sin2 0+C cos 0 ( '+40 'cos )+2 sin 0 ( O ' sin 2 , p-4/ sin 0 cos 2p ) .
41 .
Resuming the three integrals ( i. ) , ( ii .
) , ( iii .
) of art .
31 , we may put the first in the following form : Z+=h , ... ... ... ... ... ... .
( i. ) I 1/ 1\ / IY ( vcos 0-Wu\ ) v3 in -which 2Z=(+ )(+ i ) -1/ 1/ 1 / z ( vcos-w)2\ 2u(v cos -w ) %2 z2 A-B/ 2t)2sin c sin sn and the other two are , as before , ( v-w cos ) ( ii .
) U+U / sin = ... ... ... w=g , ... ... ... . .
( iii .
) in which k is the sum of areas on the invariable plane , and g the sum on fixed ecliptic ; moreover v=Cr is the sum of areas projected on the plane of the equator ; hence we have g=kcosi , v=kcosj .
It has been seen that the complete solution of the problem is impracticable in the general case , on account of an algebraical difficulty .
If however we suppose B=A , this difficulty disappears ; and after completing the solution on this supposition we may take account of the terms arising from the inequality of A and B , by treating the function denoted above by Ql ( equation ( i. ) ) as a disturbing function , and applying the method explained in art .
38 .
Thus when the action of disturbing forces is considered , the whole disturbing function will consist of two parts ; one depending upon the forces , and the other the function which has just been assigned , and of which the effect , as will be seen , is extremely simple .
42 .
We proceed then first to complete the solution on the supposition A=B .
The three integrals ( i. ) , ( ii .
) , ( iii .
) give in this case C2 C , A2(k ... . .
( 44 .
) u=sin a k'-v-w2+2vw cos 0-cos2 in which latter expression the above constant values of v and w are to be introduced .
We may put , as before , g_== cos i , v=k cosj , j being now constant ; and the expression for u becomes u=s-i 1cos icos2j+2 cos i cosj cos 0cos ... ( 45 , ) ^ ?
e ?
j 109 and we shall have ( art .
19 .
) V=-k(Ycosi+Pcosj)+ udO .
( 46 .
) and we will take h , cosi , cosj for normal elements* , so that k is to be considered as a function of these elements , given by the equation ( see ( 44 .
) ) 2AC/ k_= I..(47 .
) C-(C-A ) cos2j * *** It is to be observed , that , according to the hypotheses admitted above , k is positive ; also , the expression for u at the end of art .
40 becomes , in the case now considered , u=AdO .
Thus u has the same sign as 0 ' ; and since 0 is evidently comprised between i-j and i+j , if we suppose i andj both acute ( as in the figure ) , sin d is always positive ; hence in the expression ( 45 .
) for u , we have to attribute the sign + or to the radical , according as 0 is increasing or diminishing , or according as ?
is between o and r , or not ; thus , in the position represented in the figure , the negative sign must be taken .
43 .
If we put +Q for the radical in question , the expression for udd is easily transformed into the following , namely , k sinOdO{ 1 ( cosjcos i ) 1 ( cosj+ cos i)2 udQ+ 12 1cos 021+ cos 03 in which it is evident that the part within brackets is positive upon the whole , but each of the two last terms is essentially negative .
The integration is now easily performed , and the result is fud= + kP , where the sign is that which belongs to the radical Q , and P is given by the equation p= cs- ' cos 0cos i cosj sin i sin j ( cosjcos i)2 1 -cos 01+ cos i cosj 2 sn ( cos scos i)cos ( cosj + cos i)2 C 1 .
l+14cos8 -l-CO^CC0 +(cosj+ cos i ) cos- ' + an arbitrary function of i , j , h. This apparently complicated expression has a very simple geometrical signification for , referring to the figure , and using the theorems ( 40 .
) , we see that it is equivalent to cosj + cos i P= cos-(cos O)-+ 2 cos(cos(I+J ) ) cosjcos i CS-O -2 cos-(-cos ( I-J))+K , where K is put for the arbitrary function .
Now the expression for udO ( from which this is derived ) shows that the three terms in the above value of P must be so interpreted that the differential coefficient of the first ( with respect to d ) shall be positive , and those of the two others negative .
These conditions will be satisfied by taking* cosj+ cosi +P= -O-+c 2 ( I+J ) cos_Cost C -o -S ( _--(IJ))+K ( in which the upper sign is to be taken when O is between o and r , and the under sign when ?
is &gt; r ) .
Hence , assuming the arbitrary K so as to destroy the constant part of the expression , we have , without ambiguity , for all values of the variables , fudo=k(@-I cosj-J cos i ) , so that , finally , V=k{(4--I)cosj+(--J)cosi+ } ... ... .
( 48 .
) It will be observed that without attention to the proper interpretation of ambiguous symbols , a completely erroneous expression for V might have been obtained .
44 .
The final equations will be ( art .
19 .
) dV Y dV dV ( %*"'dh-t d cosr id cosj r , a , f being three new arbitrary constants , namely , the elements conjugate respectively to h , cos i , cosj .
In performing the differentiations , it is to be remembered that I , J , ?
do not contain h ; and that , by the equations ( 42 .
) , ( 43 .
) , art .
39 , the termas arising from the differentiation of I , J , ?
with respect to i and j , disappear identically , so that these functions may be considered as exempt from differentiation .
Also we have dk k dk dh2h ' deosi 0 ) dk ( C-A)ks cosj deosj2ACh ( see equation ( 47 , ) ) , and the final equations become , after simple reductions , a cos i+ cosj k_ e^ 00 k +X(t+ ) 1I cosj.(t+ ) ... .
( R. ) ?
i-J-K^( These equations comprise a normal solution of the problem .
The first gives immediately " O ... . .
/ k.\ a cos i-f cosj\ cos O= cos i cosj-sin i sinj cos ( ( t+)k ) ( see art .
40 .
) ; and since I , J are given explicit functions of 0 , the three variables d , p , ,4 are determined explicitly as functions of t. The third equation ( R. ) simply expresses that the invariable plane intersects the ecliptic in a fixed line , whose longitude is 45 .
Let us now introduce the supposition that A and B are unequal , and that the body is acted on by disturbing forces .
We must ( see art .
41 .
) put -( ?
Bn ) instead of A in the equations ( R. ) of the last article ; these equations will express the solution of the problem , the elements being now variable , and determined as functions of t by the system of equations h= dd ' ( cosi)'d(cosj)'= dId _dd i_ doj =d-h d cos j ' cosJ where q ) is the disturbing function , expressed in terms of the elements and td 46 .
If there are no disturbing forces , &lt; D reduces itself simply to i2 ( art .
41 .
) , which is now to be transformed by means of the equations ( R. ) , art .
44 , as follows .
Since v=k cosj , and w=k cos i , we have v cos 9-w _ cos cosj cos. sin GW sin 0 -ksinjcosI .
Also the expression for u , art .

The above expression for f2 does not contain the elements i , a ; hence , when there are no disturbing forces , we shall have ( cos i)'=0 , a'=0 , or i and a are constant ; also k dk dQ dk df k dh d-r deosj dp3 an expression which is easily found to vanish identically ( see the values of dk dk d ' deosj in art .

Thus k is also constant ; and the " principal plane " is still the " invariable plane , " as we know a priori .

If we now suppose the attraction of another body to be introduced as a disturbing force , we shall have to take for the disturbing function ( D=1P , where n is the same as above , and P is the potential of one body upon the other , expressed as a function of the elements and the time* .
And it follows from the remarks of the last article , that the variation in the position of the principal plane depends wholly upon P , and not upon f2 .
I shall here conclude this part of the subject , as it would be beyond the scope of this essay to enter into the details of any of the various problems which might be taken in illustration of the theory , such as those which relate to precession and nutation , or .
to the motion of the moon about its centre of gravity .
The investigations of this section have been introduced , because the results , so far as they go , appeared interesting in themselves , and afforded a remarkable example of the application of the general method .
P.S. Since the last sheets of this essay were in type , I have seen for the first time two papers by Professor BRIoSCHI , in TORTOLINI'S Annali for August and October 1853 , of which the titles are I Sulla variazione dell costanti arbitrary nei problemi della Dinamica , " and " Intorno ad un teorema de Meccanica .
" I have not had an opportunity of examining them sufficiently to judge how far any of the preceding investigations may have been anticipated in them .

On a Class of Diferential Equations , including those which occur in Dynamical Problems.-Part L. By W. F. DONKIN , M.A. , F.R.S. , F.R.A.S. , Sawilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford .
Received February 23 , -Read February 23 , 1854 .
THE Analytical Theory of Dynamics , as it exists at present , is due mainly to the labours of LAGRANGE , POISSON , Sir W. R. HAMILTON , and JACOBI ; whose researches on this subject present a series of discoveries hardly paralleled , for their elegance and importance , in any other branch of mathematics .
The following investigations in the same department do not pretend to make any important step in advance ; though I should not of course have presumed to lay them before the Society , if I had not hoped they might be found to possess some degree of novelty and interest* .
Of previous publications with which I am acquainted , those most nearly on the same subject are , Sir W. R. HAMILTON'S two memoirs " On a General Method in Dynamics " in the Philosophical Transactions ; JACOBI'S Memoir in the 17th vol. of CRELLE'S Journal , " Ueber die Reduction der partiellen Differential-gleichungen , " &amp;c. ; and M. BERTRAND'S " Memnoire sir l'integration des equations diff6rentielles de la M6canique , " in LIOUVILLE'S Journal ( 1852 ) .
The relation in which the present essay stands to the papers just named will be apparent to those who are acquainted with them , and it would be useless to attempt to make it intelligible to others .

] this equation would become identical if x , x , ... x~ , in its second member , were expressed in telrms of y , y25 , ... y , ; hence , differentiating each side , on this hypothesis , first with respect to yi , and then with respect to yj , we obtain dyx die x dyi ddx die i d ' dyi xli + y , dx2 +9 _d O-l Tie + dyi dj ld=l d yj-ddyj + " ' + o ( d ' ) where j is any index different from i. These theorems are given by JACOBI in his memoir " De Determinantibus functionalibus .
" They are however only particular cases of more general theorems , which may be investigated as follows .
If we represent by i , j , k , ... .
p , q , r , ... any two determinate sets of m indices each , selected out of the series 1 , 2 , 3,. .
, then the determinant formed with the m2 differential coefficients dyi die dyj dyj C &amp; dap dxq dxp dXq possesses properties remarkably analogous to those of a simple differential coefficient .
This analogy was pointed out by JACOBI , and has been further developed by M. BERTRAND in his sc " Mmoire se sir Dterminant d'un systeme de Fonctions " ( LJOUVILLE'S Journal , 1851 ) .
It appears to me that such functional determinants might be appropriately and conveniently denoted by a symbol analogous to that of a common differential coefficient ; thus d(yi , yj , Yk , ... ) d(X Xq , Xqr ** .
) and I shall adopt this notation in the present paper .
For example , d(u , v ) d(x , y ) would represent the determinant du dv du dv dx die die da [ The expression ( D. ) is not a mere arbitrary symbol , but , like a simple differential coefficient , is a realfraction .
For if we denote by d(xp , xq x , ... ) the determinant formed with the m2 quantities d , xp , daXq , dXlr , *. .
d2XtX , dxp , xd2Xt , dmxp , dxdm , x , , 72 and attribute a corresponding meaning to d(y yj , y , *-Y ) , where d , , d , ... d. are symbols denoting n distinct and independent sets of variations , so that dy=.+ die .+ + dryi=drxi+d + +dYid ~~x , +tdrX2 + ... + +drxn , then it follows from well-known properties of determinants ( as M. BERTRAND has shown ) that the complete functional determinant formed with the n2 differential coefficients dy1 die , , d ... .
&amp;c. dxl dx , d. i ' dx , , is equal to the quotient of the two determinants which I propose to denote by d(yl , y2 y3 These two theorems ( expressed in a different notation ) may be found in the memoirs above cited .
But the following , which we shall have occasion to employ hereafter , has not , so far as I am aware , been explicitly stated .
dyi dyi Inasmuch as y-=1 , -y-0 , it follows that the determinant represented by d(y , , y2 , , ... Ym ) d(yp , yp2 , ... y. .
) .
( .
is =1 if ( i , ( 32 , ... PM be the same combination of indices as o , , a , , ... aC , but is =0 in every other case .
( For in the first case the determinant is formed with 1 , 0 , 0 , ... ; 0 , 1 , 0 , ... .
; 0 , 0 , 1 , ... ; &amp;c. , but if there be one index Pi which is -not contained in the series oc &amp; ,2 &amp;c. , then one row of terms in the determinant will consist wholly of zeros .
) Now considering y , , y , &amp;c. as functions of x , , x2 , &amp;c. , and again considering these latter as functions of y11 , y2 &amp;c. given by the inverse equations , we have , by the preceding theorem , for the value of the determinant ( E. ) above written , the expression Vm= e d(ya ya ... yj* Theorem.-Retaining the suppositions made at the beginning of the last article , let X be a given function of x , , x , , ... .

I in which the brackets indicate that x , , x2,. .
x , are to be expressed in terms of y , y , ... y , so that Y may be a function of the latter variables only .
It is easy to show h posteriori that the expression ( 8 .
) verifies the equations ( 6 .
) , but I pass on to some further considerations .
( See note at the end of Section II .
) 3 .
Suppose the function X involves explicitly , besides the variables x , , x2 , &amp;c. , any other quantity , so that the expressions ( ( 1 ) , ( x ) , &amp;c. ( or the values of x , x2 , ... in terms of y , , y2 , &amp;c. ) will also involve p explicitly , and we shall have d(X ) dX dX d(l ) dX d(x , ) dc dp+dxl d dx dp +* dX d(l ) d(x2 ) ~~dp1 ' ' dpY -T'2 dp ^ Now , differentiating the equation ( 8 .
) with respect to p ( so far as it contains p explicitly ) , we obtain die d(X ) d(xl ) d(x , dp~ dp.y d2 dp + ... which the equation above written reduces simply to dX die dp+Sp= ? . .
( 9 .
) In the particular case in which X is a homogeneous function of x , , x2 , ... x , and of m dimensions with respect to those variables , the equations .
( 8 .
) and ( 9 .
) become Y=(m-l)(X ) dX+( d(X ) d)****. .
( 10 .
) m and it is easily seen that Y is also homogeneous and of -l dimensions in y , y2 , ... y , .
4 .
The theorems ( 8 .
) and ( 9 .
) are cases of more general ones which are easily proved in a perfectly similar way , and which I shall therefore only enunciate .
If , by means of the equations ( 5 .
) , art .
2 , we express a set of n out of the 2n variables , consisting of r x 's and n-r y 's , of which no two indices are the same , for example , X1 , X2 , ... Xry , Yr'n , *. .
, * ... . .
( 0o .
) in terms of the remaining n variables , yl , yl , *Yr rl * ... , + .
and dX dQ = , as before* ; but the equations corresponding to ( 10 .
) will not subsist unless X be homogeneous with respect to the r variables x , , x , ... x. 5 .
Let us now suppose that the function X contains , explicitly , besides the n variables xi , x2 ... x , , another variable t , and also n constants a , , a , ... an ; and that these last are contained in such a way that the n equations dX dX dX da , da2 a ... ( 11 .
) would be algebraically sufficient to determine a , a2 , ... an in terms of b,1 b2 , &amp;c. , x1 , &amp;c. Then taking Xb--(X ) + ( al)b +(a2 ) b +. .
+ ( a ) b ( the brackets indicating that a1 , a2 , &amp;c. are to be expressed as above supposed ) , we shall have , by the theorems of arts .
2 and 3 , dXb dXb dXb db -a , db =a , ... .d n(12 .
) and also , for all values of i , dXb dX dx ^-i=* ; * *..* ... .
( ( 13 .
) to which we may add dXb dX die dt dt dt ******* ( 14 .
) Now assuming the 2n equations ( 5 .
) and ( 11 .
) , namely ( for all values of i ) , dX dX -=y ' , bi , we may suppose each of the 2n variables x , x2 , ... y y , ... .
to be expressed by means of them as a function of the 2n constants a , , &amp;c. , bl , &amp;c. , and t ; or , conversely , each of the 2n constants to be expressed as a function of the variables x1 , &amp;c. , yl , &amp;c. , and t. On the former hypothesis each of the variables xl , ... yl , ... .
is given as an explicit , and on the latter as an implicit function of the single variable t , which we will consider as independent ; and total differentiation with respect to t will throughout this paper be denoted by accents , which will be used for no other purpose .
Thus , p being any function of all the variables , we shall have dp dp , dp , P =/ t +d+"X-++ +.- .
For the rest , we may , when necessary , distinguish the meanings of the various partial differential coefficients employed , by referring to the hypotheses on which they are taken , and which I shall denote as follows : Hyp. I.-The 2n variables x , , x , ... y , y2 ... expressed as functions of a , , a , ... b , , b ... and t. Hyp. II.-The 2n constants a , a , ... b , , b2 , ... expressed as functions of x , , x,. .
y , 2 , ... and t. Hyp. III.-The n variables y , , y , ... y expressed as functions of the n variables X , , x2 ... xC , the n constants a , , a , ... a , and t ( as by equations ( 5 .
) ) .
Hyp. IV.-The n constants b , , b2 ... b1 expressed as functions of the n variables x1 , ... x , the n constants a , , ... a , and t ( as by equations ( 11 .
) ) .
6 .
Differentiating totally the equation ( 11 .
) , dX da with respect to t , we obtain ( observing that d dj by virtue of the conditions ( 5 .
) ) , d2X die die die daidt+da +a 2+ +'= ' ( where ~-a , &amp;c. are taken on Hyp. III .
, art .
5 .
) Now let ( Z ) be a function of x , , ... x , t , a , , ... a , , defined by the equation dX ( Z)= , ... ... .
( 15 .
) the above equation then becomes If this equation be multiplied by di and the result on each side summed with respect to i , it will be seen thatthe coeffents of the second se side all vanish except that of x , which reduces itself to 1 ( see art .
1 , equations ( 1 .
) ( 2 .
) ) ; so that we have d(Z ) dal d(Z ) Ld d(Z ) dan , dal dy1j da2 dyj + dan dy7xe Now the expression on the left of this equation is equivalent to dZ dy1 if by Z ( without brackets ) we denote the result of substituting for a , , a , ,. .
an in ( Z ) , their values in terms of all the variables ( Hyp. II .
) , so that Z is a function of the variables only .
We have then , finally ( writing i instead ofj ) , ,dZ ( 16 .
) x , = ... ... ( 16 .
) dyi + + .
Again , we have ( Hyp , III .
) die .
die +y .
die y= d+ d~xI + '~ + ... .
78 which , by ( 5 .
) , ( 15 .
) and ( 16 .
) , becomes , +d(Z ) dz dyi d die d(Z ) dZ dZ die , dZ die .
, but it is plain that dZ d+ dyld dy2d+ ( since ( Z ) would be derived from Z by substituting in the latter the expressions for y3y ' , ... Hyp. III .
) .
And since dyd-Yi &amp;c. , comparing the two equations last written , CvQi TX C we obtain dZ y(=- ... ... ... .
( 17 .
) The system of 2n equations ( 16 .
) and ( 17 .
) express the result of eliminating the 2n constants from the equations ( 5 .
) and ( 11 .
) and their differential coefficients with respect to t. In other words , ( 16 .
) and ( 17 .
) are a system of 2n simultaneous differential equations of the first order , of which ( 5 .
) and ( 11 .
) , or again , the equations supposed in Hyp. I. or II .
, art .
5 , are the 2n integrals .
7 .
There are other remarkable relations between the partial differential coefficients of the expressions supposed in Hyp. I. and II .
, art .
5 .
For if we differentiate the dX equation ai-bi with respect to aj ( Hyp. I. ) , we obtain d2X d2X dx1 d2X dx =2x-4.^x^l4.^x , ^ .
+o =(a .
) daidaj daidxl dayjdaidx2 daj * ** e which gives , putting bj for dX and yg for dX , dabda* ~~ dx~.(b .

, adyd d ' , &amp;c. to Hyp. .
) respect to i , to he sum of the first terms is d ( Hyp. 11 .
) , and for the rest , the coeffidyk cient of a reduces itself to unity , whilst those of the remaining terms vanish ( art .
1 , equ .
( 1 .
) , [ 2 .
) ) .
Thus we have -bj dxk dyk daj ... ) ( where the first side refers to Hyp. II .
, and the second to Hyp. I. ) .
Now if we treat the equations die die dyi= da--79 ( see equations ( 6 .
) and ( 9 .
) , putting ai for p in the latter ) exactly in the same way , it is plain that the result may be deduced from ( 18 .
) by interchanging x and y , and changing the sign of b ; thus dbj dyk dxZk daj Lastly , from the equations dXb -a dX -(see ( 12 .
) and ( 13 .
) ) , we should find in a similar manner da _dxk .
dyk dbj and from the analogous equations ( the existence of which is obvious ) dYb dYb dyi~ ' i dbi =-a daj dyk we should obtain -= -ddxk dbj Collecting these results , and changing the indices , we have the system dxi db dci_daj 1 da dyi ' dbj dyi ( .9 .
) die _ db dyi _da daj dxi dbj dxi in each of which equations the first member refers to Hyp. I. , and the second to Hyp. II .
( art .
5 .
) ; and it is to be remembered that there is no relation between the indices of the variables and those of the constants , so that the case of i=j has no peculiarity* .
8 .
Let , A be symbols denoting two distinct sets of arbitrary and independent variations attributed to the 2n constants ; then the equations dX dX dxi dai-b0 give AX= i(yixi+aiMb ) ; and if the operation A be performed on each side , we have AsX=-2(Ayiix+A2ajbi ) +(yAsx , +a , Ab ) .
If from this we subtract the corresponding equation obtained by inverting the order of the operations A , , remembering that Azu=-A , u , we obtain i(x , a--ax y , ) + , ( a , ab , --a , )-o ... ... ( 20 .
) , ( The use here made of the double operation As , is clue in principle to Mr. BOOLE .
See his demonstration of a well-known theorem of LAGRANGE , of which the equation ( 20 .
) is a more general formt ) .
If in this equation we suppose 4x , gy , &amp;c. to be expressed in terms of Sa , , 6b , &amp;c. ( Hyp. I. ) , and ai , ab , , &amp;c. in terlms of A ) , 4Ag , &amp;c. ( Hyp. Il .
) , and compare the terms on the two sides , it is easy to derive the relations ( 19 .
) .
I preferred however to deduce them by a more direct method .
9 .
If xi be expressed in terms of the 2n constants and t ( IHyp .
1 .
) , and then each constant be expressed in terms of the variables ( Hyp. II .
) , the result is an identical equation .
Differentiating then with respect to x , x1 , yk , we obtain the three equations dxi dal dxi dbl dx dt dxi db2 + da~ dxi db di da dzi db ? .
o=.+d 1+ d+ + &amp; +.c daI dxj1d dbI dx da dx{w db dx dxi da , dxi db dx da+i , dxi db 0=7 2+ 3+ awe + &amp;c. daI dyk dbi dyk da2 dyk db2 dyk Three similar equations may be obtained by treating yi in the same way .
And if we apply to these six equations the transformations given by the system ( 19 .
) , art .
7 , the resulting theorems may be comprehended in the following statement .
If p , q be any two of the 2n variables x , ... x , y~ , ... in , then dp dq dp dq\ ( dbi dai dbi dai\ ~-~ , k~ ~-2 2-= -+1 , or =o. .
( 21 .
) tkdbh dai da , db , Tkdp dq dq dp or according as p and q are or are not a conjugate pair , i. e. a pair of the form xj , y. .
( The value +1 belongs to the case in which p=xj , q=y- , and to the converse .
) Here p and q are a determinate pair of variables , and the summation refers to the constants , extending to the n conjugate pairs .
More important however are the converse theorems obtained in a perfectly similar way by expressing a , , or bi in terms of the variables ( Hyp. II .
) , and supposing the variables to be again expressed in terms of the constants and t ( Hyp. I. ) .
Differentiating the resulting identical equation with respect to ai , aj , b , b , , and applying the transformations ( 19 .
) as before , we have , putting h , k for a determinate pair of constants , / dh dk dh dk\ / dyi dxi dxi dyi\ ... , die dd dydh dk a + , o* * ( 22 .
) according as h , k are or are not a conjugate pair , i. e. of the form aj , b. ( The value +1 belongs to h=aj , k=b , , and --1 to the converse .
) According to the notation proposed at the beginning of this paper , the above formula may be written d(h , k ) d(yi , Xi ) d x(yi , xi)d(h , k ) -o .
By a usual and convenient abbreviation , the sum d(h , k ) d(yi , xi ) may be denoted by the symbol* [ h , k ] .
We have then , by ( 22 .
) , [ a , b ] = [ b , , ai ] = [ ai , bj ] = [ ai , aj]= b , b , .
( 23 .
) j being different from i ; and , obviously , [ ai , ai ] = [ bi , bi ] =0 .
Now letf , g be any two functions whatever of the 2n constants a , , &amp;c. bl , &amp;c. ; when the latter are expressed in terms of the variables ( Hyp. II .
) , f , g become also functions of the variables ; and if h , k represent , as above , any pair whatever of a , , &amp;c. , b &amp; , &amp;c. , we have ( see art .
1 .
) d(f , g ) d(f , g ) d(L k ) d(y i , i ) d( , ) 'd(yti , i ) the summation referring to h , k , and extending to every binary combination .
If , now , we sum each side of this equation with respect to i , we obtain [ f , g ] ={[h , k ] d(f ' ) ... ... ( 24 .
) ( the summation referring as before to h , k ) .
But , by ( 23 .
) , [ h , k ] is 0 unless h , k be a conjugate pair , and then it is +1 ; so that ( 24 .
) becomes simply fg id(adi bl ) * .
( 25 .
) an equation which , written at length in the common notation , is ik\dyi dxs dxi dyi ) t da db dbi dai The expression on the right being a function of the constants al , &amp;c. , b1 , &amp;c. only , the equation ( 25 .
) expresses obviously the following theorem .
If f=((xl , x2 , ... Xn , y , , Y2 , ... in , t ) g==(/ ( x , x , ... Xn , yl2 , 2- , in , t ) be any two integrals of the system of simultaneous equations ( 16 .
) , ( 17 .
) , art .
6 , then the expression [ f , g ] , or rj dq dc die , f ldyi dx dxi dyiJ is constant ; i. e. it becomes a function of the arbitrary constants only , if for xi , &amp;c. , yi , &amp;c. be substituted their values in terms of the constants and t. In the case in which ( 16 .
) and ( 17 .
) represent the dynamical equations , this is identical with the remarkable theorem discovered by POISSON .
We shall have occasion to return to it presently .
10 .
If we treat the equations ( 21 .
) of the last article exactly in the same way as we have treated ( 22 .
) , putting u , v for any two functions whatever of the 2n variables X1 , X , ,.* **X yl , yI , * other quantities whatever , except a , , &amp;c. It is assumed that these equations are algebraically sufficient to determine each of the n variables y , , ... y , , , as a function of the other n variables x , ... xn and the constants .
Then the theorem in question is as follows : If , by means of the equations ( a. ) , the n variables yi , ... y. be expressed as functions of x , , &amp;c. , then in order that the conditions die _ dyj dxj-dxi may subsist identically , it is necessary and sufficient that the expression [ a , , ajl ( defined as in art .
9 .
) shall vanish for every binary combination of the n equations .
This may be proved as follows : Putting h , k for any two of the constants a1 , a2 , &amp;c. , let h=p(xj , &amp;c. , y , , &amp;c. ) represent one of the equations ( a. ) above written .
If in this equation the values of y , ... yn be expressed , as above supposed , in terms of x , , &amp;c. , a , , &amp;c. , it becomes identical .
Differentiating it , on this hypothesis , with respect to xi , we obtain dh dh dy , dh dy2 dh dyn dxi +dy dxi dd + " ' dy dx , ; and in like manner dk dk dyl dk dy , dk dy _+ +_ a-=-O ; dk dh Txi dy xi dY2 dxi ** dyn dxi Z and if we multiply the first of these equations by dand the second by dand subtract , there results an equation which may be written as follows:dh dk dh dk Jdy/ dh dk dh dk\l dyi dxi_ dZx dyi X dyj dy-Y dyi dy , fJ ' or , putting now a , , aq instead of h , k , and employing the same notation as before , d(ap , a f ) [ dyj d(a , aq)1 d(yi , Xi ) i~\dx d(yj yi)J If now the terms on each side be sunmmed with respect to i , the result on the first side is [ ap , aj ; and observing that on the second side the term multiplied by will only differ in sign from that multiplied by dyX ' we shall have a. a]=i &gt; { ( x-dx-dc ) ( ( Y y ) } .
