Some experiments on the fungi which constitute the colouring matter of the red snow discovered in Baffin 's Bay By FRANCIS BAUER , Esq. F. L. S. In a Letter addressed to the Right Honourable Sir JOSEPH BANKS , Bart , G.C.B. P , R.S. &amp;c. &amp;c. Read May Iith , i8so .
SIR , TH E continuance of the severe cold weather , and the frequent falls of snow , during last winter , afforded me ample opportunity for investigating the nature and economy of the fungi , which constitute the colouring matter of the red snow , discovered in Baffin 's Bay , on the 17th of August , 1818 , during the Northern Expedition , under the command of Captain Ross ; and I have now the honor of laying before you , the result of my investigation ; and if you should consider it to merit the notice of the Royal Society , I should feel highly honoured by its being communicated to that learned Body , through your favour .
Since the month of March , 1819 , I preserved in a small glass , a portion of the original sediment of the red snow , brought from Baffin 's Bay , during which time the fungi , which constitute that sediment , had considerably increased in number ; but the newly formed fungi remained ever perfectly colourless , and formed a kind of whitish crust , at the top of the red sediment .
With a view to ascertain whether those fungi really vegetate , and propagate in the snow , after draining off the water , I carefully separated the colourless crust , and taking out of the glass the greatest part of the red sediment ( which I intended for another experiment , but which failed , and shall be described hereafter ) I filled the glass again with water , and left it at rest for several hours ; when the few fungi which were left in the glass , formed a slight sediment of about s part of an inch in thickness , at the surface ot which the colourless crust , about 3j parts of an inch in thickness , remained .

) is a correct representation of the glass , and the quantity and proportion of its contents .
On the 10th of December , 1819 , when we had the first fall of snow , I marked with a diamond on the glass the precise height of the mass of sediment it contained , and after carefully draining off the water , I filled the glass with snow , which I pressed in as hard as I could , by which means the fungi became completely mixed and immersed in the snow .
Thus prepared , I put the glass into a wire bird cage , to prevent its being disturbed by birds , or any thing else , and placed the cage in a N. W. aspect , in the open air .
The weather was then very cold , and on the following morning , the ilth of December , the thermometer was 26 degrees below the freezing point .
On the Sith of December the weather suddenly changed and became milder , and about noon the snow in the glass was entirely dissolved ; on examination , after the glass had been fifty-two hours in the open air , I found the whole contents had formed a sediment , and had become of the same red colour as the original sediment was ; but no increase in quantity was then perceptible ; see Fig. .
I immediately poured off the water , and filled the glass again with snow , in the same manner as before , and exposed it in the open air , where it remained until the morning of the 17th of December , when a general thaw had begun ; on examination I found the snow in the glass was not quite dissolved , but was a lump of ice , perforated , and full of cells , like a honeycomb , and the mass of fungi was raised in little pyramids ; see Fig. 3 .
From the i7th of December till the 28th , the weather continued very mild , and we had no snow till the morning of the 28th ; on that day I filled the glass again with fresh snow ; but perceiving a slight increase in a very small portion of fungi that were accidentally smeared on the corner of the mouth of the glass , when on the 13th of December I took out some of the sediment for examination , and sunk the small glass , with its contents , into a larger cylindrical glass , also filled and pressed with snow , to afford to that portion of fungi room for increasing and spreading in the snow ; and in that state I exposed the whole in the open air .
From the 28th of December , 1819 , to the loth of January , 1820 , the cold and frost continued very severe , but on the latter day , after the glass had been buried fourteen days under the snow , I took it out , to see what change might have taken place during that time ; on clearing away the external snow and ice , I found the appearance of the contents of the small glass , exactly as represented in Fig. 4* The snow was frozen to a hard mass of ice , which was beautifully perforated and full of small cells , and the whole mass of fungi was raised in a pyramidal form , almost to the 167 mouth of the glass , filling and occupying the perforations and cells in the ice ; and from the base of the sediment , innumerable small air bubbles were visibly and rapidly evolving , by whose means , I think , the fungi are raised in the manner they are found during the time that the snow is dissolving .
The small portion of fungi in the corner of the glass had also considerably increased , and spread in the snow above the small glass : see Fig. 4 .
After making a drawing of the above described appearances , I deposited the small glass again into the larger one , which was filled with snow , as before , and exposed in the open air , where it remained till the 19th of January , 1820 , when the weather chlanged , and a sudden and general thaw set in ; after all the snow and ice were dissolved , and the glass stood several hours at rest , I had the satisfaction to find the appearance of the contents of the small glass , exactly as represented by Fig. 5 .
If the sediment in the glass , represented in Fig. 5 , is compared with that of Fig. 2 , it is evident that , ( though a considerable portion of the sediment had at several times been taken out of the glass for examination , and by the frequent changing of the water , some loss was sustained ) the increase of fungi , within less than two months , has been more than double .
The only difference I observed , on examining the individual fungi of the newly formed sediment , was , that the number of larger than ordinary sized full grown fungi was greater in the newly formed sediment , than I ever found in the original sediment , brought from Baffin 's Bay , where the ordinary size of the full grown red fungi is about a 7~g .
part of an inch in diameter , and the largest are about part of an inch in diameter ; the number of large fungi , in proportion to those of the ordinary size , is as i to lo0 ; but in the newly formed sediment , after the above described experiments , I found many of the larger fungi to be as large as os~ part of an inch in diameter , and the number of large fungi , in proportion to those of the ordinary size , as 1 to 1o .
I also found that , notwithstanding the snow in the glass had so frequently been changed , and though the fungi had sometimes been not more than three or four days in the snow , the water , after the snow was dissolved , always acquired the same disagreeable smell and taste as the original water imported from Baffin 's Bay .
The above described experiments I attempted to repeat on a larger scale , and for that purpose I employed a glass of about twelve cubic inches in contents .
The original red sediment which it contained was about f of an inch in thickness ; and after marking on the glass with a diamond the precise height of the whole mass , I drained off the water , and divided the sediment in three equal parts ; on the i2th of January , 18o0 , I put the different portions of sediment into three equally sized glasses , which I afterwards filled and pressed with snow , and exposed them in the open air , as in the former experiments .
The first few days , the weather continued very cold and favourable for the experiment , and the appearance in the glasses was the same as in the former experiment .
The fungi in some glasses had risen and spread in rays and pyramids of near three inches in length , and the increase appeared considerable and rapid ; but during the day of the 169 19th of January , the weather suddenly changed , and the snow in the glasses entirely dissolved ; but the following night it froze again very hard , and two out of the three glasses burst and fell to pieces ; the following morning , the 2oth of January , it suddenly thawed again ; and before I discovered the accident that had happened , a great part of the snow in the glasses was dissolved , and consequently the greatest part of the fungi they.contained was lost ; however , I collected all the sediment left in the unmelted snow and ice of the broken glasses , and put it into that which remained entire ; after the whole was melted , the sediment which then was produced , certainly appeared considerably increased ; but the original glass which had been marked with a diamond being destroyed , I could not fotm a correct estimate ; judging however from the previous appearances , I have every reason to believe , that if the accident had not happened , the result of this experiment would have been equally satisfactory as that of the experiment on the small scale .
On the 22d of January I again filled the glass , containing the remains of the sediments of all the three glasses , with fresh snow , and exposed it in the open air as before ; but the next day the general thaw began , and after that day we had no more frost nor snow ; I left the glass in the open air till the end of the month , when I examined its contents again , and found no particular change in the substance ; but within the glass , which was not quite full , round the surface of the water 1 observed a kind of crust , consisting of a light yellowish green substance , which on examination in the field of the microscope , proved to consist entirely of the same sized and shaped globules as the original red fungi .
I immediately decanted the water and red sediment into another glass ; when , on examining the empty glass , I found the appearance of the green substance was not only confined to the top of the glass , above the water mark , but I found many very minute clusters scattered , not only over the sides , but also over the bottom of the glass .
I filled that glass with melted snow water , and closed it with a bladder , and in that manner I have kept it ever since .
I examined the glass this morning , and find that a considerable increase of the green fungi has taken place since the G1st of January , when I filled it with water ; the green substance forms now an entire crust over the whole inner surface of the glass , particularly the bottom , where the new globules now form a sediment that is visible to the naked eye , and the whole glass is -now of a greenish tinge .
To what cause this change of colour is to be attributed , I cannot guess .
The experiment mentioned in the beginning of my letter as having failed , was owing to an idea I conceived , that the red fungi would vegetate on the surface of the snow ; and with that view I filled on the loth of December , 1819 , a large glass cup with snow , pressing it hard , and giving it a perfectly smooth surface , on which I made an impression with a sixpenny piece ; the cavity thus produced I filled carefully with the original sediment of red fungi , expecting that on the slightest increase taking place , the fungi must come over the limits thus set them ; but the degree of cold at that time was so great , that , soaked in water as they then were , they froze almost before they came in contact with the snow .
On examining them the next morning , when the thermometer was s6 degrees below freezing , I found them of nearly a black colour , and almost entirely raised up , and detached from the snow ; and when on the igth of January the snow dissolved , the mass of fungi sunk to the bottom of the glass , and gradually changed their colour to a dirty brown , being evidently dead .
The same experiment was repeated several times , and the result was always the same .
I subsequently collected the different masses of fungi that had been made use of in these experiments , and immersed them in snow , in one glass , and exposed them to the open air , as in former experiments ; but though there was no visible change in the appearance whilst they were in the glass , I found , the latter end of January , when I examined them in the field of the microscope , that many new fungi had been produced during the time the dead sediment had been under the snow ; and that the newly produced fungi were not only small and colourless , but had also many full grown bright red fungi amongst them .
From this circumstance I conclude , that though the excessive cold , and the exposure in the sharp air and wind , may kill the primitive fungi , their seeds still retain sufficient vitality to vegetate and propagate , if immersed in the snow , which appears to me to be undoubtedly the natural soil of those fungi .
The season having passed by , I was unable to make any farther experiments on this subject .
I have the honour to remain , &amp;c. &amp;c. FRANCIS BAUER , Kew Green , May 7 , I82o .
