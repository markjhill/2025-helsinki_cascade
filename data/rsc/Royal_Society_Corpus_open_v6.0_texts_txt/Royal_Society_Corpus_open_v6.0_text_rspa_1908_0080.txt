278 On Helium in Saline Minerals , and its Probable Connection Potassium .
By the Hon. R. J. Strutt , F.R.S. , Professor of Physics in the Imperial College of Science , South Kensington .
( Received July 31 , 1908 .
) In a former paper* I mentioned that saline minerals were often comparatively free from contamination with radio-active material of the uranium-radium series .
Accordingly they afford special opportunities of testing whether or not helium is generated by the other elements present , namely , sodium , potassium , magnesium , calcium , sulphur , chlorine , oxygen , hydrogen .
In this paper determinations are given of helium and radium in some of the saline minerals of Stassfurt .
These minerals occur in strata of triassic age , though the age of some of them may be less , for there is evidence that secondary alterations have taken place in the salt deposits .
Helium was liberated by solution of the mineral in water .
The powdered substance was placed in a flask fitted up as shown in the preceding paper .
The flask was exhausted , washed out with oxygen , again exhausted , and sealed off from the pump .
Water , well boiled , and allowed to cool in a vacuum , was admitted through a tap .
Heat was applied to promote solution , and when this was complete the gases set free were driven out by boiling and collected over mercury .
Carbonic acid was removed by potash , and other constituents by sparking .
The small residue was then examined as described in ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' A , vol. 80 , p. 592 , liquid air being generally used to cool the charcoal .
When helium had been determined in this way , uranium was determined in the same solution , by the usual method of boiling out the radium emanation generated in a definite period .
Previous to this determination the solution was acidified , to dissolve any slight sediment that remained and to prevent precipitation of radium as sulphate .
The results were as follows :\#151 ; * ' Koy .

In a specimen of carnallite purchased from another source , helium was scarcely detectible .
This may have been due to the specimen having been allowed to deliquesce before it came into my hands .
If so , it must have been dried again before I received it .
f In these cases the amount of emanation was too small to be accurately determined .
The values given are rough approximations only .
The following were also examined qualitatively :\#151 ; Kainite ( MgS04KC13H20 ) .
Krugite ( 4CaS04MgS04K2S042H20 ) .
Astrakanite ( Na2(MgS04)24H20 ) .
Langbeinite ( K2S042MgS04 ) .
Polyhalite ( 2CaS04MgS04K2S04 + 2H20 ) .
Schoenite ( K2Mg(S04)26H20 ) .
Tachyhydrite ( CaMgCl6l2H20 ) .
In none of them was the quantity of helium at all comparable with what was observed in carnallite or sylvine , though D3 could generally be seen .
R*eturning to the quantitative experiments it is noticeable that very high ratios of helium to uranium oxide are met with in these two minerals .
It seems altogether improbable that the minute traces of uranium and radium present can account for so much helium .
On the other hand , the helium in rock salt is very much of the order to be expected from its geological age , if it originates from the uranium family of radio-active bodies .
In view of Campbell and Wood 's observations on the radio-activity of potassium , * I am disposed to regard that element as the source .
It is true that the other potash salts examined do not contain much helium , but , in view of the imperfect retention of the gas in some cases , such negative evidence has not much weight .
The possibility of thorium as a source must not be overlooked .
It would be very difficult to determine experimentally whether the small quantity requisite was present ; but in view of the freedom of sylvine from more common impurities I think it must be considered unlikely .
