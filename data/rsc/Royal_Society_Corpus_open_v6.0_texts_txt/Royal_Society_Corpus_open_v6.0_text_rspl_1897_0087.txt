Received October 26 , \#151 ; Read November 18 , 1897 .
Last July , M. T. Moureaux , of the Parc Saint-Maur Observatory , near Paris , brought over to England the travelling instruments employed in his magnetic survey of France , and a comparison was made between these and the standard magnetic instruments at Kew Observatory .
At the expressed desire of the Kew Observatory Committee , I submit on their behalf a brief account of the comparison and its results .
The comparison serves to connect the standard instruments at Kew Observatory with the standard French instruments at Parc Saint-Maur , the latter , as M. Moureaux has had the goodness to N 2 Dr. C. Chree .
inform me , being in excellent agreement with his travelling instruments .
Parc Saint-Maur may be regarded as the base station for M. Moureaux 's great survey of Finance and Algeria , while Kew Observatory performed a similar function in the surveys of Great Britain and Ireland , by Professor Rucker and Dr. Thorpe .
The existence of the English Channel introduces uncertainty into any conclusions based on the trend of the magnetic lines in France and England , and the instruments employed in the two countries are sufficiently dissimilar to justify scepticism as to their close agreement in the absence of direct experiment .
The interest of the comparison is thus far from being limited to the two observatories most immediately concerned .
M. Moureaux 's observations at Kew Observatory occupied the afternoon of July 26 , and the forenoons of July 27 , 28 , and 29 .
On the afternoons of the last three days , observations were made with the Kew standard instruments , by Mr. T. W. Baker , chief assistant at the Observatory .
All the observations were made in the " magnetic house " in the Observatory garden .
The comparison was really between M. Moureaux 's absolute instruments and the Kew absolute instruments , but the observations , being made at different hours of the day , had to be connected through the intermediary of the curves from the self-recording magnetic instruments .
The elements recorded photographically are the declination , horizontal force , and vertical force .
The value in magnetic units of 1 cm .
of the ordinates is known , but the value of the base lines , answering to zero ordinates , of the several curves is to a certain extent variable .
The usual practice at Kew Observatory is to treat each month separately , deducing the value of the base line for any element from a comparison of the absolute observations for that month with the curve ordinates at the times of the observations .
In the case of the declination and horizontal force , the standardization of the cuiwes is comparatively simple .
In the case of the vertical force , the influence of temperature is nnfortunately somewhat large , a rise of 1 ' F. equalling in effect a fall of O'OOOl C.G.S. unit in the vertical component .
There is also the complication that what the curve gives is the vertical force , while what the absolute instrument gives is the inclination .
Thus to compare inclinometers used at different hours , one has to follow a circuitous route by way of the horizontal and vertical components , allowing a correction for changes of temperature in the magnetograph room during the observations .
M. Moureaux observed the iuclination early , and Mr. Baker late , in the day , and there happened to be a slight difference in the mean temperature of the magnetograph room at the times of their observations .
Comparison of Magnetic Instruments at Kew Observatory .
157 Taking* into consideration the above facts , and the further fact that M. Moureaux 's visit occurred at the end of a month , it was decided to standardise the curves exclusively from Mr. Baker 's special observations , on July 27 to 29 .
These g-ave three or more complete determinations of each element , under conditions which might be described , on the evidence of the curves , as an almost perfect magnetic calm .
Mr. Baker 's absolute observations and the corresponding curve measurements were in good agreement , especially in the case of the horizontal force , where the individual calculated values for the base line of the curves showed no difference greater than 0*00002 C.G.S. unit .
Owing to the less direct method of comparing the inclinometers , I regard the results obtained for them as somewhat less trustworthy than the others .
The figures under the heading " Observatory\#151 ; Moureaux " are to be regarded as the excess in the readings of the absolute Kew instruments over those of M. Moureaux 's instruments , supposing the former to have been read simultaneously with the latter .
The times specified are actually those occupied by M. Moureaux 's observations .

In judging of the results several things merit consideration .
Neither inclinometer read to less than 1 ' , decimals arising from arithmetical operations .
The Kew unifilar magnetometer reads to 10 " , but with M. Moureaux 's much smaller instrument readings , could not be taken to less than 30 " .
The great skill of the two observers is beyond question , and the mean of several results obtained without mental bias may possess an accuracy greater than that which any individual reading can lay claim to .
Still , personally , , I should be very sorry to claim accuracy of the order of 1 in the last significant figure of the mean differences .
In the use of the results , one should remember the possibility , or rather probability , of the occurrence of change in magnetic instruments .
This is a vicissitude to which travelling instruments are probably most exposed , but even in an observatory standard it is certainly not impossible .
The constant " P , " appearing in the factor 1 \#151 ; Pr-3 , which allows for the departure of the horizontal force magnet from the ideal infinitely short magnet , appears to be to some extent variable , at least in the Kew instrument .
This particular variation does not necessarily affect the calculated horizontal force , because the proper value of " P " for a special set of observations can be calculated from the experiments themselves .
This precaution was , in reality , actually adopted in the present case .
Still the fact that a change does take place , which , if undetected , wrould appreciably influence the results , shows that assumptions of absolute constancy are at present acts of faith , not reason .
Until there exists a regular system of intercomparison of the instruments at different observatories , our information on this head is likely to be limited .

unit in the corrected readings of the French standard , wras postponed until the French survey should be completed , though the necessity for it has been recognised for some years .

] Compavison oj Magnetic Instvuments at JcLew 159 After this remark , I think I may safely utilise the present comparison to extend a table , * in which Professor Rucker and Mr. W. Watson embodied the results of their comparison of the standard instruments at various English and Irish observatories , made by means of travelling instruments , in 1895 .
The differences between the declination , horizontal force , and inclination instruments are given in order , one below the other , the unit in the case of the horizontal force being O'OOOOl C.Gr .

The table is to be read as follows " Standard declinometer at Kew reads higher than that at Parc Saint-Maur by O'5 ' , but lower than that at Falmouth by 0-8 ' , " and so on .
The last column gives the differences from the mean instrument , so to speak , of the five observatories .

The fact that the Kew standard instruments agree so closely with the imaginary mean instruments was , it may be observed , not noticed by the writer until after he had constructed the table .
In his opinion the phenomenon is probably purely fortuitous .
In searching , however , for explanations of the discrepancies between the several instruments , or m attempting to remove them , a consideration of the departures from the means might be profitable .
