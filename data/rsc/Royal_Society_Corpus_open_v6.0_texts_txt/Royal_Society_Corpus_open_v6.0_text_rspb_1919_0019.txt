) Introduction .
The research described in this report was planned on the following lines:\#151 ; In October , 1918 , portable Haldane analysers and other apparatus were installed in the Research Sub-section of the Welfare and Health Section of the Ministry of Munitions , and the three authors carried out a considerable number of determinations upon themselves , both with the object of acquiring or regaining familiarity with the experimental technic and in order to determine what form of respiratory apparatus would be most suitable for use in the study of factory conditions .
Ultimately , a system was evolved which conforms to the rules afterwards laid down for the guidance of investigators by the Metabolism Research Sub-Committee of the Royal Society Food ( War ) Committee .
Having acquired the necessary experience , it was decided to proceed on the following general lines:\#151 ; Permission having been granted to make observations in a national projectile factory in the north-east of London , we arranged to make measurements upon women engaged on the various operations of the factory , while attention was coincidently directed to the cooling power of the air in the workrooms ; or , more exactly , in each experiment on a worker , the cooling power of the air was ascertained in a position as near as possible to the worker during the experiment , that is to say , for the purpose in view , practically in an identical position .
The respiration apparatus used was a modification of the Douglas bag combined with a face mask ( approved by the Metabolism Research Sub-Committee ) and needs no special description .
The measurements in the factory were made by A. E. T. and C. H. , who were also responsible for the gas analysis .
M. G. and his statistical assistants have reduced the analytical readings , the method being that described in Catlicart 's recent paper.* As advised by the Sub-Committee , air analyses ( of the room air ) have been made at frequent intervals to check the efficiency of the apparatus .

63 later section some remarks on the experimental error will be made ; here it is sufficient to observe that the analytical accuracy of the work of C. H. , upon whose results the greater part of the calculations of the energy values depend , was tested in a combined experiment , samples of the same expired air being analysed by Mrs. Hodson , Miss Hargood Ash , and Dr. M. S. Pembrey .
The agreement between these three workers was sufficiently close to make it probable that the conclusions here detailed are trustworthy within the limits implied or expressed throughout the paper ( vide infra ) .
Section 1 contains a general description of the factory conditions .
Section 2 deals with the salient features of individual processes studied ; in Section 3 the results are criticised from the experimental point of view ; in Section 4 the interpretation of the figures in summary form is taken up ; and in Section 5 the economic implications of the results are briefly discussed .
Section 1 .
The whole of the experiments were carried out during November , December , January , February , and March , 1918-19 , in a factory manufacturing 6-inch shell cases .
At the time when the experiments began , the output of the factory was small ; the efforts then being made to speed up production were relaxed owing to the Armistice , the number of workpeople was reduced by more than , and the individual output by at least , 50 per cent. Consequently , the atmosphere of the factory has changed , and , during our observations , there was no hurry or bustle , no cumulative fatigue effects .
An attempt was made to stimulate the workpeople volunteering for respiration tests to work up to their piece-work speed during each experiment , but this cannot have sufficed to reproduce the earlier conditions .
Perhaps it would be fair to say that the circumstances more closely resembled those of ordinary industrial life , at least in trades the average earnings from which are above the margin of subsistence , than would have been the case had we carried out the research a few months earlier .
The atmospheric conditions experienced by a worker in this factory varied widely from place to place as regards temperature and moisture\#151 ; ranging at the same moment from practically those of the open air at the time to those of uncomfortable warmth and stuffiness according to the position chosen .
The operations also presented a widely contrasting range of types of work .
Two factors , which made largely for success in experimenting in this factory , were , firstly , the cordiality with which the staff assisted the investigators , moved in many instances by a genuine interest in the enquiry ; and , secondly , the fact that one of us ( A. E. T. ) had already spent some time in the shops , had won the confidence of all the shop managers and of a great 64 Messrs. M. Greenwood , C. Hodson , and A. E. Tebb .
many of the charge hands , and was popular with the operatives , who , encouraged by him , volunteered much more readily for the tests than might otherwise have been the case .
The factory has three main parts , the press-house , or forge , and two great shops .
The press-house consists of a shed with one side open to a level of 12 feet , the general dimensions being some 100 by 26 yards superficially , with an elevation of 10 yards .
There are seven furnaces , placed near the centre , with eight adjacent presses .
Both on account of this construction and the use for which it is designed , the general temperature of and the local temperatures in this press-house may all vary enormously .
At times of great pressure , with a still air outside , it becomes , even in cold weather , terrifically hot ( for with all the furnaces busy , and an accumulation of rough forgings in all states of heat nearly covering the floor , sources of radiant and convected heat have become , after a few hours ' work , very numerous ) , and the heat escapes but slowly into still outside air , even through the open side of the press-house .
On the other hand , with fewer forgings the general heat production will be much less , and also with certain winds , even though forgings be numerous , an icy blast will sometimes sweep the place from end to end , and cooling will in consequence be very rapid .
For similar reasons , the local temperatures in this forge at one and the same moment are subject to wide variations .
The two great workshops are alike in structure and arrangements ; both contain the machinery requisite for completing the shell case .
The length of each shop is over 200 yards , portions being screened off at one side to make tool-rooms and stores .
Lighting , heating , and ventilation are from overhead , but a free circulation of air is aided by numerous doors at the sides and sliding panels at the ends .
The heating apparatus is quite inadequate , pipes being placed so high as to have little noticeable effect in the body of the shop .
In cold weather it has to be supplemented by large coke fires in pails .
Closed rooms for the warm processes ( varnishing and pickling ) are partitioned off at one end of the main shop .
Lathes occupy two-thirds of the floor space , the largest for rough turning , and diminishing in size down to the small models used for fashioning base plates .
Near the centre of the shop are a few nosing furnaces ( for shaping the shell head ) , and others serve to heat the copper bands , which are fitted to the cases in a hydraulic press .
There are also two small cabins , where the inner surface of the shell is sandblasted .
The system of overhead " runs " for lifting and moving the shell to and from the lathes is carried throughout the building , and at the ends the lathes give place to benches for gauging and assembling the cases .
Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers .
65 The atmosphere of the tool room and that of the varnishing room deserves comment .
In the former , where high speed steel is being ground on corundum wheels and rockers , there is an odour of burning , in the latter the air is warm and feels stuffy , possibly on account of fumes generated by the gas heaters used for ovens and cauldrons .
The temperature of this room varies considerably at different times , both on account of the stoves in it , and of the piles of cooling shells removed from them ( after their varnished interiors have been sufficiently baked ) , as well as from the fact that two large doors at one end are periodically thrown open wide to let out a trolley full of shells , when the temperature suddenly falls , it may be , many degrees .
Section Such being the general atmosphere of the factory , we pass to the relevant details of the several operations studied .
The Press-house.\#151 ; The work of the press-house is generally regarded as the most arduous in the factory .
Men work the forges and remove the cooled forgings ; the intermediate process is carried out by gangs of three women , viz. , the press driver , the tonger , and the ringer .
The press driver , standing on a small platform , works the press by means of three levers ; a pedal for the right foot releases one ; the handles are at about elbow height , and the levers are pulled and pushed , using the weight of the body which is thrown as far forward as possible , and the degree of pressure has to be exactly regulated .
The press driver also keeps the press cooled by turning on water after each forging and periodically steps down to tar the mould and punch .
The tonger moves the yellow-hot billet from the forge table and drops it into the press , from which she afterwards lifts the forging and tips it on to the ground .
The tongs are about 5 feet long and are suspended by a wire from the overhead run which bears both the weight of billet and tongs , and the chief exertion consists first in applying the necessary grip , at the moment of raising the billet from the table , and again when the last few inches of the forging are levered out of the press ( it being automatically pushed through about five-sixths of the mould after the punch has been withdrawn ) , the body weight is thrown on to the tongs to give leverage , this being necessary because the forging is practically never raised quite to the mouth of the mould .
The ringer drops one or more iron rings on to the billet ( which increases the depth of the mould and prevents the rising edges of the forging sailing over outwards ) and removes them as the forging rises out of the mould .

also throws coal dust upon the hot billet and trundles the hot forging away after it is tipped off the press on to the floor .
Under the present conditions of slack work there are many intervals between sets of forgings ; usually six to nine billets are drawn out of the forge in series and then there is a pause .
Fortjr billets in the hour is an average piece rate ; in one of our early experiments seven forgings were turned out in 5 minutes 12 seconds .
These billets weigh about 150 lb. apiece .
Lathe Work.\#151 ; In classifying our experimental results we have grouped lathe workers as on " heavy turning , " on " turning " without a qualifying word , or on " light turning .
" This classification does not correspond exactly with an ordinary factory nomenclature .
In our analysis " heavy " denotes shell turnings only , and applies to the first rough turning when the shell head has not yet been shaped , and a clutch adjustment is required for fixing the object , so that both fixing and removing are laborious .
Turning includes both base-facing ( where a clutch is used ) , and those later processes on the shell where fixing is done merely by screwing .
Light turning only includes the turning of gas containers : ( a ) the rough turning on first process ; ( 6 ) the boring done on a small capstan lathe ; ( c ) the finishing operation .
Of these three operations the first involves very little work , the lathe , once set , runs for some time and little measurement is necessary ; in boring , the full weight of the body is sometimes brought to bear upon the wheel to drive the tool home in the internal finishing ; the final processes are very exact , the lathe tools being often changed , while gauging is repeated at very frequent intervals , and the task is described as " worrying " work .
In these lathe operations the temperamental factor is probably more important than in any others .
While the body of the shell or of the gas container is being machined , there is a period of " standing to " ( longest in heavy turning and correspondingly reduced when smaller units are in question ) .
A quick and eager worker will fill up all this interval with small movements , e.g. , gauging , cleaning portions of her machine , sweeping off swarf , preparing for the next job , and so forth .
A phlegmatic worker may sit quietly waiting .
This fact emphasises the contention made later on that very long series of observations are needed to reach a correct average value .
Banding.\#151 ; ( Band Turning ) .
Is very accurate work , each stage of the operation lasts barely three seconds , the whole but three or four minutes while gauging is constant and exacting .
The shell is held on the lathe by a false bottom , the end plate , which has to be hammered on before the turning is done and hammered off afterwards .
There is no waiting in this work .
Cleaning and Drying.\#151 ; The shell case is rolled to and fro upon a bench , Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers .
67 at elbow height , with one hand while the interior is swabbed with a mop held in the other hand .
The woman stands sideways to the table and rolls the shell 2| to 3 feet each way , the weight of the body being thrown from one foot to the other with a swinging motion .
Shell Hoisting.\#151 ; This is a part of the copper banding process , a clutch is put inco the mouth of the shell , attached to a rope passing over a pulley on the overhead run , and the shells are lifted into the banding press , out again and then across the gangway to the next bench .
We may here remark that a female worker often moves heavy shells from one position to another but always by means of mechanical aid .
In the press-house the suspended tongs acts as a lever , while at the lathes the shell-lifter is only another form of pulley allowing the shell to be gripped in a horizontal position .
Tool Setting.\#151 ; There are all forms of grinding and some exertion was evidently needed in using one or two stiff machines , especially when the worker so set the stone as to give a maximum amount of friction .
In all machines there were two adjusting wheels one for each head .
On the Gisholt machine it is only the stone which is fixed , the machine ( which grips the tool ) swinging backwards and forwards against it .
File grinding appeared to need fine adjustment of every movement and both hands were used ; the friction did not seem great .
The value of observations in this department is reduced by the notorious idleness of the operatives after November 11 .
Often the work under experimental study was all the work done in the hour .
Gauging or Examining.\#151 ; Three types of work are covered by this heading : { a ) The large shell cases are rolled to and fro horizontally while calipers test the thickness of the walls .
When this is over the shell is stood upright and tipped over to the opposite side of the bench .
The ordinary method is to bend the knees , drop the elbows and , gripping the shell mouth with both hand , to spring slightly upwards , thus raising the weight without strain .
( b ) Gauging the tops of gas containers : spring bungs are removed before gauging and hammered in afterwards , the examiner stooping to pick them up from the ground .
This work is done while seated , ( c ) The final testing of gas containers : here the shell stands upright on the bench and a screw gauge is screwed in and out , the whole container is screwed loose from the shell and the shell shunted back upon the bench ; the hands are working on a level with the chin .
Stamping.\#151 ; Marks are cut upon the sides and ends of the shells as they lie upon the bench .
The stamp resembles a short cold chisel , of which the sharp end is the stamp to be impressed ; it is given a smart blow with a heavy hammer .
68 Messrs. M. Greenwood , C. Hodson , and A. E. Tebb .
The ends of the shell are approached in an uncomfortable stooping attitude , there are many dies in the stamp box but the right one is rapidly selected .
The marks to be stamped are chalked on the shell and great accuracy is needed .
The rate is seven blows in 10 seconds .
Labouring { Sweeping and Barrow).\#151 ; Steel filingsare removed from trays under the lathes with large shovels and placed in iron barrows , the loaded barrows are then wheeled away and the contents dumped outside the shop .
We have also included ordinary rubbish sweepings , which seemed to be equally laborious work .
This is the only type of work seen to produce sensible perspiration and , as will appear , the experimental results confirm the opinion that a lightly regarded and relatively ill-paid task is physiologically the most costly of all .
Walking and Carrying.\#151 ; The few observations under this heading refer to persons carrying such objects as boxes of bullets , a tea tray , gas containers , etc. In no case was the load heavy ; perhaps of the order of an ordinary coal scuttle or a marketing basket .
Sect , ion 3 .
At this point it will be advisable to touch upon the material accuracy of qur experiments , merely as experiments , quite apart from the interpretation of experiments deemed to be in themselves exact .
When the whole volume of expired air is analysed , as for instance in the research of Benedict and Cathcart upon the metabolism of cyclists , the only error involved is due to inexact graduation ( fineness of the weighing technic ) of the apparatus or defective absorption by the chemical reagents .
In the sampling method errors of this type persist , and there is in addition a series of errors introduced due to ( a ) incorrect measurement of the volume of expired air\#151 ; whether dependent upon faults of the gas meter or failure to express the bag , or again to inaccurate measurement of temperature and barometric pressure ; and ( b ) failures of technic in transferring samples to the gas analyser whereby , in particular , contamination with room air may be produced .
With respect to errors of class ( a ) , in our earlier experiments the measurement of temperature was imperfect because the thermometer was not inserted into the meter 's inlet , and it was found , on subsequent investigation , that the temperature of the expired air at the moment of its volumetric measurement was understated to the extent of about 2 ' C. ; this error was subsequently corrected .
So far as the volume of expired air is concerned , careful experiment showed that with the light bag used in most of the experiments any error due to incomplete expression- of the contents through the meter was very small .
The combined effect of error classified Report on the Metaholism of Female Munition Workers .
69 under ( b ) and those inherent in any method of gas analysis was certainly more serious .
We have attempted to appraise roughly the magnitude of such error in the following way .
It is well known that if we have a series of paired readings of a magnitude , then the square root of half the mean square of the differences between the paired readings is a suitable measure of the error of observation , provided there be no correlation between the errors of paired determinations or between the magnitude of the error and that of the quantity measured .
The former assumption cannot be strictly accurate because of secular change , that is to say , the more experienced the worker the smaller his error , so that some positive correlation surely exists between errors in each member of a pair , both will be smaller after some months ' work than at the beginning of the research ; the assumption would probably be quite correct if the analyst had had years of experience before the trial period .
The second assumption was tested by correlating the difference between members of a pair with the mean value of the pair and it was found that the correlation in the series tested was not significant with respect to its error of sampling .
The first assumption , despite its unsound theoretical basis , had to be retained owing to the impossibility of estimating satisfactorily the extent of the correlation mentioned .
In the case before us we have two variables , viz. , the CO2 readings and the O2 readings , , and the error in the final estimation of calories expended is a function of the errors in each reading and the error correlation between CO2 and O2 readings ( a correlation which will be in general negative for if , for instance , between the analyses a leak has occurred , which might easily happen , the CO2 reading will go down and the O2 reading go up ) .
The square roots of the mean square errors ( calculated on the above assumptions ) and the correlation in error of oxygen and carbonic acid measurements were estimated twice , in the first case upon 23 paired analyses including -results of both C. H. and A. E. T. , in the second case upon 15 pairs in which both analyses were the work of C. H. Since the majority of the analyses used for calculation were due to C. H. , more weight was assigned to the latter series which did not , however , differ very greatly from the former except in giving a lower value for the standard deviations of the oxygen errors and a somewhat lower value of the negative correlation between errors of CO2 and errors of O2 estimates .
We reproduce the second set of data ( Table I ) .
From these errors , the errors of all the subsequently computed averages ( respiratory quotient , 02 use , etc. ) can be deduced by algebraical reductions , and we finally reached the result that the error of estimate for the important constant , viz. , the calorie use per minute , was of the order of 2 per cent. This result is in good accord with the estimate of C. H. 's working error reached by a quite different route .

H. using a small analyser , and by M. S. P. , a much more experienced gas analyst , using the larger model .
In one experiment , C. H. 's reading was 987 per cent , of M. S. Ps\ , in the other 100-2 per cent , of his value ( expressed as calories per unit ) .
It would therefore seem that differences between two results reached by C. H. exceeding , say , 6 per cent , are unlikely to be attributable to errors of technic .
It must , however , clearly be understood that we do not regard this estimate as more than a rude approximation .
Quite apart from the doubtful truth of the theoretical assumptions , it is plain that the deduction of constants from so short and irregular a series as the one quoted here is hazardous ( the deduced values are of course themselves subject to large errors of sampling ) , and , for that reason , we shall not reproduce the necessarily intricate arithmetical calculations requisite to determine the errors of the various constants .
When two or three hundred paired analyses are available for statistical treatment it will be possible to import some degree of precision into this branch of the research .
Had our enquiry been continued ( as would have been the case if the war had not , fortunately , come to an end ) we should have discussed the subject at length .
We now pass to a still more difficult topic , viz. , the interpretation of differences between experimental findings which lie outside the range which we have provisionally adopted as a margin of purely experimental error .
It is recognised that the likelihood that the difference between the mean values of two series of variable quantities has been produced by the operation Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers .
71 of " chance " can be measured by calculating the respective " probable errors " of the averages .
Not to pause upon the fact that the validity of this process in its ordinary application depends upon the assumption that the factors of chance variation are numerous , small , and result in a particular type of dispersion , we must recollect that in the present case we have special difficulties .
If , for instance , we find that , judged by this criterion , the average energy expenditure in the press-house exceeds that in a lathe operation , to what extent is the difference contributed to by ( a ) a real difference of physiological demand made by the two kinds of work ; ( b ) personal differences in the energy output of the workers themselves under all circumstances , functions of age , or temperament ; ( c ) gross irregularities due to our having chanced upon keen workers in one operation and slack workers in another .
It would have been possible to appraise ( had we been able to measure the basal metabolism of our subjects , few though these were , but this we could not do owing to the conditions under which the research was done .
If our numbers had been multiplied tenfold , it would have been fair to assume that differences under ( c ) were smoothed and equally distributed through the categories .
But , things being as they were , the research being brought to an end when only a few hundred instead of a few thousand experiments had been made , we have no right to assume that ( a ) alone has been responsible for such " significant " differences as are to be discerned .
The gross number of observations is so small that statistical manipulations and sub-tabulations designed to isolate the several factors ( in addition to those above enumerated , are considerable variations of external temperature and cooling power ) can only lead to a spurious air of precision .
We have accordingly contented ourselves with a summary analysis , now to be detailed .
The complete protocol of each experiment has been deposited with the Metabolism Research Sub-Committee , and the detailed particulars will be of use when sufficient material has been accumulated by other investigators to admit of a numerically adequate tabulation .
The time for this is far distant , and the industrial aspects of metabolism cannot yet be fully elucidated .

Shell hoisting ( with pulley ) 1 5 129 31 -7468 24-6 \#177 ; 9-576 A consideration of the detailed Tables shows that , in a majority of operations , the range of variation from subject to subject is very great , in some cases the largest individual mean is as much as twice the size of the smallest .
In some , for instance , tool setting , the subjects of several experiments come out fairly well together\#151 ; the outlying value being based on but one experiment .
In others the highest value is contributed by subject 16 ( this is the case in gauging , walking , and finishing ) who was not a trained operative .
But no obvious extrinsic factor such as this will account for the general run of the results .
Whether the extent of the variation is due to individual peculiarities of metabolism or to great variations in the amount of physical work actually performed by the various subjects during the several experimental periods , or whether both factors contributed , cannot be ascertained .
We do not think anything of value would result from a numerical analysis of the data from this standpoint , and , a fortiori , we do not propose to relate the variations to those of temperature or cooling power .
Both analyses must be undertaken , when the supply of similar observations has been increased twenty or a hundredfold .
Provisionally , and with the greatest possible reserve , we should group the figures on the basis of the general means , bringing together those which , from the rough indications afforded by the probable errors , seem to fall into the same class .
Upon this basis it is seen that our subjects fall into four groups :\#151 ; First , we have light turning , turning , forging , which need in round numbers about 100 calories per square metre per hour .
The second group includes five operations , tool setting , heavy turning , Messrs. M. Greenwood , C. Hodson , and A. E. Tebb .
stamping , finishing , copper bands , shell hoisting , all needing some 125 calories per square metre per hour .
The third group covers gauging and walking and carrying , to which 160 calories per square metre per hour may be allotted .
The fourth and last group contains labouring and cleaning and drying , which seem to need 180 calories per square metre per hour .
In using these provisional figures to assess the energetic requirements of the factory operative , we are to remember that the trend of public opinion points unmistakably to the conclusion that ' the industrial day will not for women exceed eight hours , and , if so , it would be improper to assume that more than a maximum of seven hours would be devoted to physical exertion approximating to that measured in our experiments .
We accordingly think that the work contribution to the daily needs of an average woman in each of our classes will be reached if the above approximate values are multiplied by the product of 7 and T6 , the latter being the larger of the two values for average body surface put forward in the Food ( War ) Committee 's recent memorandum .
Our four work quotas are accordingly 1120 , 1400 , 1792 , 2016 calories .
In the memorandum just cited the allocation for needs outside working hours ( including 240 calories for travelling and household work ) amount to 1333 calories , to which we must add a further 77 calories , because the Committee envisaged 8 hours of actual industrial work , while we are contemplating only 7 hours .
Hence , the quantity to be added to the work quota is 1410 calories , and the complete energy needs of our four classes are:\#151 ; 2530 , 2810 , 3200 , 3425 calories .
Or , making the customary allowance of 10 per cent , between net energy and food eaten , 2810 , 3120 , 3555 , 3805 calories .
In comparison with the results deduced by the Committee from Becker and Hamalainen 's figures our highest class makes greater demands than any of theirs , our second highest figure being practically the same as that of the most strenuously employed women in the other series .
While we are very far from thinking that our experiments are sufficient to provide a trustworthy figure , they are perhaps more representative of the requirements in a class of strenuously employed industrial women than those of Becker and Hania-lainen .
The unweighted mean of the food requirements is 3322 calories , and Dunluce and Greenwood , in their analysis of the dietaries of 19,213 munition Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers .
81 workers ( the large majority women ) , reached 3463 as the average man value.* Hence 2874 would be the value for an average woman .
But this general summary includes some hostels for which the values were extremely low , and their largest homogeneous sample ( about 7000 women in a great explosives supply factory ) yielded a " man " value of 3951 calories and a " woman " value of 3279 substantially identical with our experimental approximation .
Perhaps this concordance gives a somewhat greater credibility to our provisional conclusions .
It is even possible that the 3279 represents a slight excess , because , if allowance is made for 1| rest days ( vide infra ) , our experimental figures of 3322 is reduced to 3039 .
One important inference may be drawn from these figures .
The energy requirement of the lightest class is about 74 per cent , of the heaviest .
But the remuneration of the kinds of work included in our heaviest class is much less than that of several operations needing many fewer calories .
If we supposed that so small a sum as 10s .
would purchase an adequate weekly diet for a member of the lowest class , then assuming that the 1| non-working days require the same allowance , which we may put at 1800 calories per diem , for all classes , the total weekly needs are 16,615 calories and 21,538 calories , so that the worker in the heavier class must spend nearly 13s .
a week .
Section 5 .
The issue raised at the end of the last section is of such importance that we may be permitted to discuss it in more detail than might seem fitting in a physiological report .
The data collected by the Board of Trade in 1904 showed that for families in receipt of less than 25s .
weekly , 67'3 per cent , of total outgoings were expended upon food , the proportion only falling as low as 57 per cent , in families earning 40s .
or more weekly .
Even in the families of the poorest class studied by Rowntree , where the expenditure upon food was estimated to provide less than a maintenance diet , 51 per cent , of outgoings were for food .
The Working Classes Cost of Living Committee which reported in 1918 ( Cd .
8980 , 1918 ) provided data from which the following percentages have been calculated:\#151 ; * Medical Research Committee , Special Report , No. 13 .
82 Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers .
Percentage of total expenditure devoted to the purchase of food .
1914 .
1918 .
Skilled workers 54 -8 60 6 Semi-skilled workers 56 -2 63 -4 Unskilled workers 56-7 64-9 These figures refer to families composed of 4'57 " men .
" Let us now suppose that the average earning , viz. , 75 5 per week , is adequate to maintain the minimum standard of comfort in such a family , and that the principal wage earner is a " man " occupied as in our lightest class.* Dividing the mean income by 4'57 and multiplying by 06 ( on the assumption that the expenditure upon food is now about 60 per cent , of total outgoings ) , we find that the cost of food per " man " is almost exactly 10s .
a week .
If then the wage-earning " man " of a family similarly constituted in all other respects is in our heaviest physiological class , the general standard of living can only be maintained if the gross family income increased by nearly 3s .
When it is remembered that the subsidiary earnings of other members of the family ( which have always been relatively more important in the lower grades of manual labour ) must be reduced by the new education proposals , the grave importance of taking into account the physiological element of working class expenditure is manifest .
In any scientific appraisement of the income needed to maintain an agreed upon standard of life , it is essential to determine the minimum expenditure necessitated by the occupation of the wage earner .
This investigation , fragmentary as it is , suffices to show that the variations of physiological demand when translated into terms of money are considerable .
We cannot but express the opinion that the amount of attention which has been devoted to this aspect of the problem by economists and statesmen has been inadequate .
Our inquiry has not been extensive enough to provide any basis for economic proposals , but does at least demonstrate the urgent need of further measurements .
In conclusion , we desire to express our sense of gratitude to the Ministry of Munitions for permission to carry out the work , to the manager and staff of the factory in which it was done , and to various scientific colleagues , in particular Prof. E. P. Cathcart , Dr. Leonard Hill , and Prof. E. H. Starling , for advice and criticism during its progress .
