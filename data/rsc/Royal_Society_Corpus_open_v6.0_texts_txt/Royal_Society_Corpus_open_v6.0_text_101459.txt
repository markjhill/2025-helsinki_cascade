Of a remarkable Spring , about Paderborn in Germany .
An inquiring Gentleman of those parts writes to his Friend in London , as follows ; In this Diocese of Paderborn , about 2 leagues from that Town , is a treble Spring .
called Metborn , which has three streams , two wherofare not above one foot and and a half distant from one another , and yet of so differing qualities , that whereas one of them is limpid , bluish , lukewarm , bubling , and holding Sal-armoniack , Ochra , Iron , Vitriol , Alum , Sulphur , Niter , Orpiment , used against Epilepsies bad Spleens , and the Worms ; the other is Ice-cold , turbid and whitish , much stronger in taste , and heavier than the former , holding much Orpiment , Salt , Iron , Niter , and some Sal-Armoniack , Alum and Vitriol ; Ofthis all Birds , observed to drink of it , doe dye ; Which I have also privately experimented by taking some of it home , and giving it to Hens , after I had given them Oats , Barly and Bread-crums : For , soon after they had drunk of it , they became giddy reeled , and tumbled upon their backs , with convulsion-fitts , and so dyed with a great extention of their leggs .
Giving them common-falt immediately after they had drunk , they dyed not so soon ; giving them vinegar , they dyed not at all , but seven or eight days after were troubled with the Pipp .
Those that dyed , being opened , their Lungs were found quite shrivelled togetherYet some men , that are troubled with Worms , taking a little quantity of it , and diluting it in common water , have been observed by this means to kill the Worms in their bellies , so that a great number of worms come from them ; whereupon though they are sick , yet they dye not .
As to the third stream , that lies lower than the other two , about 20 paces distant from them , it is of a greenish colour , very clear , and of a sour sweet taste , pleasing enough .
It hath about a middle weight between the other two ; whence wee guess , that it is mixed of them both , meeting there together : to confirm which , we have mixed equal quantities , of those two , with an addition of a little common well-water , and have found that they , being stirred together and permitted to setle , made just a water of the same colour and taste of this third stream .
