Two sending instruments can work at once on the same aerial bisected electrically , and at the distant station two receiving instruments can receive independently and simultaneously from the corresponding halves of an aerial there .
7 .
Under these non-earthed conditions every other station , even near and powerful ones , can be tuned out and their disturbance eliminated .

The importance of the possession of power thus to hold conversation in the midst of disturbance , without being affected by it , and the naval danger of being without such power , are emphasised .
On the Influence of their State in Solution on the Absorption Spectra of Dissolved Dyes .

) In a previous investigation of the absorption spectra and sensitising properties of some 'isocyanine dyes , * the influence of the solvent was examined and it was found that the absorption maximum was shifted toward the red as the refractive index of the solvent increased .
This is in accordance with Kundt 's law .
The absorption in water , however , differs markedly from that in organic solvents .
In the latter the spectrum consists of a prominent band in the orange and a half-shade nearer the blue.f In water this half-shade has become a separate band comparable in intensity with the orange .
Absorption curves in alcohol and water are shown .
It is convenient to term the band near the red the ^-(organic ) band , the one nearer the blue the a-(water ) band .
It appeared desirable to investigate this difference further .

257 The Action of Alkali .
Aqueous solutions of the isocyanines are very sensitive to traces of acid , even the C02 from air being sufficient to discharge the colour .
The change from a colourless to a coloured state is probably due to the salt formed having a different structure.* But whilst the first additions increase the colour , beyond a certain point further increase of alkali lessens the intensity of the a-band , whilst leaving that of the / 8-band relatively unaltered .

change in the ratio of the absorptions was followed spectro-photometrically , the instrument being an improved form of the Hiifner spectro-photometer.f In Tables I and Ia measurements for two different isocyanines are given .
The action of alkali is complex and not easy to interpret .
At first it increases the total absorption , which we may attribute to the formation of the true dye , tautomeric with the colourless form .
The concentration of this in presence of excess of alkali should remain constant : actually the intensity * This question is discussed in the papers cited , t See 'Theory of Photographic Process ' ( Longmans , 1907 ) , p. 28 .

The increasing turbidity , amounting finally to precipitation , suggested that the change involved was one of aggregation , the dye being present in various stages of aggregation , from true solution to suspension , and that the alkali coagulated the finer particles .
On this view the a-band is due to a suspension , the / 3-band to a colloidal solution , but one very near true solution .

( To economise space , only the curves are given , and not the tables of extinctioncoefficients .
) It is evident that the dyes are contained in quite different form in water and in alcohol , or organic solvents .
The evidence that they are partially in suspension , partially in colloid solution , was as follows:\#151 ; ( a ) They are coagulated by concentrated solutions of KC1 , more rapidly by di- and trivalent cations , as Zn , Mg , Al .
The process could be followed microscopically in the manner used by Linder and Picton with colloidal As2Ss .

On the Influence of their State [ Mar. 9 , ( b ) Aqueous solutions are coagulated by repeated heating and cooling , though not so completely as by electrolytes .
( c ) The aqueous solutions show the Tyndall cone with an intense beam of light .
The further ultramicroscopic appearance is given in the tables .
The remarkable difference in the absorption-curves of aqueous and organic solutions of pinacyanol and pinachrome blue is shown in the curves .
Further , it is interesting to note that the addition of KC1 in quantity insufficient to precipitate the dye immediately shifted the absorption still further toward the blue .
This points to the particle-size as being one factor in modifying the absorption .
Colloid Solutions of Dyes .
Eecent investigations have shown* that a very considerable number of dyes exist in pseudo- or colloid solution in water .
Michaelis , from their ultramicroscopic appearance , divides them as follows :\#151 ; ( a ) Optically , completely resolvable , showing granules at the greatest .
dilutions .
Such are many sulpho-dyes , as induline , violett-schwarz , aniline-blue .
( b ) Partially resolvable , showing granules to an increasing degree above a certain concentration .
Such are fuchsin , methyl violet .
( c ) Not resolvable .
Generally fluorescent .
As fluorescein , toluidine blue , eosine .
From the experiments detailed above it would seem that pinacyanol and pinachrome blue belong to the first classy cyanine and isocyanine and sky-blue extra to the second .
But all pass into the third in organic solvents , and the important point is , that this change in the state of aggregation is accompanied by a marked change in the absorption spectrum .
It appears that care must be exercised in correlating all colour changes with structural modifications .
Action of Temperature .
Whereas so far the disaggregation producing true solutions was only obtained by changing the solvent , the important result was obtained that on heating the aqueous solutions of pinachrome , pinacyanol , m\gt ; cyanine , and cyanine , the pseudo-solutions passed into the state of true solution , the colour gradually changing , and the optical heterogeneity disappearing .
With pinacyanol the change appeared to be complete above 100 ' .
The change was followed quantitatively for m\gt ; cyanine and pinacyanol .

263 was employed .
The method was to compare two exactly similar solutions , one kept at 20 ' , the other heated to a known constant temperature .
Two exactly similar tubes of 20 cm .
length were constructed , the ends being closed with plate glass and having apertures for thermometers .
One was heated by a coil of wire through which passed the lighting current ; by means of a variable resistance any desired temperature up to 80 ' could be obtained , constant to 0o,5 .
One slit of the spectrophotometer was illuminated directly , the other by reflection from a right-angled prism , and this was effected by two Aver burners fed from the same gas tap .

On the hiflue of their State in [ Mar. 9 , the differences between the hot and cold solutions .
From the known extinctions for the cold solution at 20 ' , the curves for the different temperatures were constructed ( curves 6 and 7 ) .
It will be seen that there is a gradual transition from the spectrum of the pseudo-solution to that of the true solution as shown in alcohol ( compare with curves 2 and 3 ) .
The change of temperature has precisely the same effect as the addition of an organic solvent miscible with water such as alcohol or acetone .
In the hot solutions very few grains were visible and electrolytes had no effect .
On cooling , the solutions returned to their former colour and state .
The phenomena are similar to the behaviour of starch , which at or above the boiling point of water gives true crystalloid solutions of high molecular weight , * showing in the ultra-microscope only the diffuse beam due to " amicrons , " or particles too small to be rendered visible.f On cooling , the starch solution becomes opalescent .
The behaviour is characteristic of reversible colloids forming at high temperatures unsaturated crystalloid solutions , at low ones very supersaturated and colloidal ones .
J Apparently the pinacyanols and probably other dyes belong to this class , i.e. , they spontaneously dissolve in water to a colloid solution , or reach a very fine state of* division but one still remote from molecular dimensions .
It is possible that this change of aggregation may in part account for some of the interesting changes in the absorption-curves of other dye solutions with change of temperature noticed by Nichols .
S Influence of Acid on Alkali .
Michaelis noticed that nile blue sulphate and alizarin blue with soda lye give pseudo-solutions .
A considerable number of dyes were found to change their degree of aggregation when acid or alkali was added , but there are of course in many cases chemical changes masking this .
The dyes were also examined for electric transport , and the results were in agreement with the previous datum of V. Henri and A. Mayer , | ] that OH ' and H ' ions flock or clear positive or negative colloids respectively .
Linder and PictonH noticed that congo red in alkaline solution filters readily through a porous cell but was retained in neutral or acid solution .
In the majority of cases there are undoubtedly chemical changes , but these are accompanied or preceded by changes in the state of aggregation .

The curves should coincide , if Beer 's law held .
From these and other measurements it is concluded:\#151 ; { a ) Completely optically resolvable dyes , i.e. , such as are in true solution , show the least change in the form of the curves ; the maxima are not displaced .
If chemically stable , Beer 's law is followed.* ( b ) Dyes partially in colloid , partially in true solution or complete solution , show deviations , sometimes displacement of maxima , at very high concentrations .
These results are in agreement with the observations of Kalandek.f The State of Dyes in Membranes .
Since the absorption-spectrum shows itself to some extent as a criterion of the state of aggregation in liquid " solutions , " it is an obvious step to apply it to the investigation of the state of dyes in solid media .

267 the present investigation , the " colloidality " of the dyes was tested by their dialysis through collodion sacs , prepared according to Malfitano.* It is interesting to note that a definite osmotic pressure was obtained with certain colloid dyes , persistent after sufficient dialysis to have removed crystalloid impurities .
The dyes were : Congo blue , aniline blue , primuline , all resolvable optically .
That such colloids can show a definite osmotic pressure has already been shown by Linder and Picton , and by E. S. Lillie.f Other .colloid dyes were completely absorbed by the collodion , as pinacyanol .
And here the interesting fact was observed , that the dye , in pseudo-solution in water , gave the colour and absorption spectrum of the true solution in collodion .
The following table gives a brief survey of some of the absorption results .
The degree of absorption is indicated thus : -f = strongly , m = moderately , \#151 ; not absorbed .

On the Influence of their State in [ Mar. 9 , this appears to be an important factor in absorption .

269 Now we have found the bands at ca .
590 and 640 as characteristic of true solution , so that it appears , that just as in membranes , one component in so-called " complex-colloids " may be partially in true solution in the other .
Spectrophotometric examination of other complexes should yield valuable information as to the nature of this union .
Dyeing and the Nature of Solution .
The experiments detailed here seem to support the view that " solution " is a continuous phenomenon , from mechanical suspension down to true solution ( Linder and Picton , Zsigmondy , and others ) .
The author is of the opinion that the process of dyeing in solid media is strictly analogous to the " solution " of dyes in liquid solvents , in that all phases or grades may be found .
It seems permissible to parallel the solution states in liquid and solid media as follows:\#151 ; Liquid solutions .

^Soluble starch .
i. Crystalloid solutions .

i Adsorption .

i ( Dyeing .
) Solid solutions proper ( including iso-morphous mixtures and alloys ) .
In solutions of dyes , either in liquid or solid media , all grades may coexist , the conditions for forwarding or diminishing the degree of solution may be grouped as follows :\#151 ; - Toward true solution .
Diminishing particles .
Dilution .
Admixture of other solvent .
Acid or alkali .
Eise of temperature .

These conclusions are not novel , * but it seems worth while to point out that concomitant with " solution , " in this sense , the absorption spectrum * In particular , cf. R. Zsigmondy , ' Sir Erkenntniss d. Kolloide ' ( Fischer , Jena ) , and C. Dreaper , ' The Chemistry and Physics of Dyeing , ' 1906 .
Absorption Spectra tends to change from broad and ill-defined bands ( cf. Licht-blau , p. 261 ) to sharp ones , whilst in certain cases a quite new spectrum is formed .
( I hope to point out elsewhere the resemblance between the absorption spectra of colloid dyes and those of colloid metals , such as gold .
) At the same time it appears probable that there is a progressively increasing combination between the " solute " and the solvent .
Summary .
( a ) In the aqueous solutions of certain dye-stuffs\#151 ; isocyanines , pina-cyanols , cyanine\#151 ; the dye is present partially or wholly in colloid solution , and the absorption spectrum is quite different from that of the true solution .
The influence of various agencies , as heat , acid and alkali , electrolytes on the absorption was examined quantitatively .
( b ) Iii other dye solutions , the change from true solution to the colloid state is accompanied by broadening and diffusion of the absorption curve , consequent on the increase in number and size of the colloid particles .
Deviations from Beer 's law result .
( c ) The state of dyes in solid media is comparable with that in liquid , and the absorption spectrum is similarly affected .
The absorption of a number of dyes by membranes was studied .
( d ) The solution of dyes appears to be a combined process of disaggregation of the solute , accompanied by a progressive combination with the solvent .
If the same stage of solution is attained in different solvents , the absorption maxima are displaced according to Kundt 's law .
This investigation was carried out in the spring and summer of 1908 in the laboratory of Physiological Chemistry of the Sorbonne , Paris ; the author desires to express his great thanks for the hospitality and facilities afforded him : in particular to the director , Prof. Dastre , and to M. Victor Henri for his continuous advice and interest .
