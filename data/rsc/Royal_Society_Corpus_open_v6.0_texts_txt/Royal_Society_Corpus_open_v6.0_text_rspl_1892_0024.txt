It is well here to call attention to what might prove confusing otherwise .
In what follows E , e , F , \lt ; J\gt ; , and some allied symbols stand for certain external forces .
But there are three different meanings given indifferent parts of the paper to these symbols .
They are originally defined as the whole external forces of the different types .
But in treating of frictional forces , \amp ; c. ( SS 35 to 42 ) , it is convenient to regard them as meaning only those parts of the forces which are due to friction and the like .
Again , from S 50 onwards , it is convenient to regard them as meaning only those parts of the forces which are independent of friction and the like .
This inconvenience is incurred to avoid the greater evil of a large additional array of symbols .
With this exception , * and one or two other trifling ones , which are noticed in their places , nowhere has the meaning of a symbol been changed throughout the paper .

( Abstract .
) Hitherto the determinations of stellar luminosity have been made solely with regard to the relative intensity of the stars apart from any reference to a known terrestrial unit .
The various methods which have been employed do not denote actual intensity , and the present inquiry was , therefore , undertaken with the view of elucidating this question , especially with regard to those stars whose colour has presented a difficulty .
As a preliminary , the author prepared a standard series of artificial stars of various colours and known intensity , in terms of the English standard candle .
These range in value from one candle to 0'000018 candle , and when placed at a distance from the telescope form a standard series for comparison .
The evaluation of the coloured lights was made by means of the author s modified " star " disc , by the use of which comparisons of various coloured lights can be readily obtained .
* Since completing the paper I have discovered a notable exception , which is not otherwise noticed than in this foot-note .
It does not seem likely to lead to confu-sion ; therefore I retain it .
Must frequently in the present paper stands for the typical scalar coordinate of a dynamical system , but it is not infrequently used , as in the former paper , for the quaternion of the rotation-operator q( )q~11892-3 Stellar Photometry .
405 The second portion of the inquiry was directed to the most suitable means of comparing a star with the standard .
Such a method must provide for the estimation of the total luminous energy , irrespective of the fact that in the case of a Btar the light practically emanates from a point , whilst that from the standard emanates from a surface .
This fact precludes the use of the wedge photometer .
The methods employed by the author were three in number .
The first was by means of reflection from a plane mirror mounted in front of the telescope object glass , in such a manner that the light of one of the radiants is * seen by reflection through one half of the lens , whilst that of the other is viewed through the other half , by direct vision , both radiants being thus simultaneously seen in the same field of view .
When the two images are placed out of focus to an equal extent , so as to be equal in size , comparisons of intensity can be made .
By this system it matters not whether the light emanates from a point or a surface , as it is the degree of illumination of the respective portions of the object glass which is measured .
Errors due to the unequal transmitting power of the different portions of the lens , and also those due.to the loss of light by reflection , \amp ; c. , are corrected by repeating the observations after the whole of the apparatus has been reversed ; i.e. , if the star is seen by reflection in the first observation , it is to be viewed by direct vision in the second , when the standard light will be viewed by reflection .
The second method employed was a modification of Zollner 's lamp , the standard used being the author 's pentane Argand burner , in which air carburetted with pentane is employed as a combustible .
This is mounted on the eye-end of the telescope .
Next to the burner is placed a plate of ground blue glass , carefully adjusted to reduce the colour of the gas flame , so that it is , as nearly as possible , comparable with that of daylight .
This glass is mounted permanently in front 'f an aperture , 0*08 inch in diameter , in a brass plate .
At a distance of 24 inches from this is placed a second plate of brass , having an aperture of 0*013 inch diameter .
A lens , fixed at 2 inches from this second plate , projects the image of the illuminated surface of the blue glass by a reflecting prism , to the eye-piece of the telescope , io which it is viewed as a circular disc of light , side by side with fliat caused by the illuminated image of the telescope object glass .
The ground surface of the blue glass affords a slightly granulated appearance , exactly imitating that of the object glass when a star 18 vi\#174 ; wed out of focus .
By arranging the position of the eye-piece mitil the two images are exactly of the same size , the imitation of " a star is so striking that it is all but impossible , when the colours are alike , to discern the difference .

These can be conveniently brought into position for modifying the colour and intensity of the comparison light .
The coefficient of absorption of each of the coloured glasses was determined photometrically , and tables prepared by reference to which corrections for their use can be made , As this method was found to present an objectionable , feature in regard to the uncertainty attending the use of multiple glasses for reducing intensity , the third method was employed .
The lamp was placed on a graduated bar in such a manner that its distance from the ground blue glass could be conveniently altered , and the illumi-nation of that glass reduced on strictly photometrical principles .
This method was found to answer so well that the experimental apparatus first employed is being altered and improved .
When it is completed , a further and extended series of observations will be made .
In the meantime , the results already obtained may be discussed .
Details of the observations are given in the tables presented with the paper .
By plotting the average results on a diagram a mean curve is drawn .
From the value thus found , the relative intensity of stars of all other magnitudes can be calculated .
It then only remains to convert the comparative into actual values by the correction for the distance of those stars whose positions are known , when their actual intensities will be ascertained .
The following series is given of the average results of the determinations of the intensity of a sequence of stars in descending order of brightness , together with their respective magnitudes , and a comparison of their theoretical intensities on the assumption that a second magnitude star equals 0-00075 candle placed at a distance of 109 feet , which factor is deduced from the mean curve of all the determinations made :\#151 ; 1892 .

Eight determinations of the light of Jupiter have been , made , the average result being to ascribe to that planet a light equal to 0*020 candle placed at a distance of 109 feet .
Determinations of the light of the planet Venus and of the Moon are also given , and the necessity for farther observations referred to .
The total quantity of light afforded by the stars ( apart from the planets ) is calculated from the above results combined with Arge-lander 's estimate of the number of stars down to the ninth magnitude .
Assuming that the light afforded by these is equalled by the innumerable stars of lesser magnitude than the ninth , and by nebulae , total starlight will equal that from 1*446 candles when placed at a distance of 109 feet .
If it be further assumed that only one-sixth of the stars are capable of illuminating a given surface at the same foment , then such illumination will be equal to that afforded by one standard candle placed at a distance of 210 feet .
