( Abstract .
) This communication contributes the sequel of the author 's " Report on Earthquake-Wave Experiments " ( made at Holyhead ) , as published in part 3 of the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1861 .
At the conclusion of that paper the author expressed his hope of being able soon to lay before the Royal Society some experiments for the determination of the modulus of elasticity of perfectly solid portions of both the slate and the quartz rock formation through which his wave-transit experiments had been made at Holyhead , with a view to throw light upon the relations between the theoretic velocity of transmission ( if the rocks were all solid and homogeneous ) and the actual velocity as determined by experiment .
He has now determined the elastic modulus for both rocks , and for each rock in two directions , viz. parallel to and transverse to its lamination ; and hl has extended his determinations to specimens of [ May 8 , 84 each rock of maximum and of minimum compactness and hardness , so that the series of experiments upon the compressibility of these rocks ( from which the modulus is deived ) assumes the following divarication , viz. Haest .

Involving thus eight distinct series of experiments .
The compressions were conducted at the Royal Arsenal , Woolwich , by the aid of the excellent American machine belonging to the Royal Gun-factories , permission to use which was accorded to the author .
The specimens of rock submitted to pressure were all equal cubes of 01707 inch on the edge , presenting thus a surface on each side of 0'5 square inch-a dimension presenting facilities for tabular , reduction , &amp;c. The cubes were cut from the chosen rock specimens ( selected with care as fairly representative ) by means of the lapidary 's wheel , and had opposite faces rigidly parallel and equal .
The pressures advanced by 1000 lbs. per square inch of surface , from zero up to the crushing point of the specimen ; and at each advance the actual compression of the column of rock was measured by instrumental arrangements that admitted of reading space to '0005 of an inch .
The results are given in Tables numbered 1 to 8 , referred to above , and these are compared in two Tables numbered 9 and 10 .

] Crushing usually took place at 1000 to 2000 lbs. additional pressures beyond the above limits , up to which the compressions were tolerably uniform .
The discussion of these Tables fully presents some interesting and novel results .
Generally the quartz rock is less compressible than the slate ; the softest quartz , however , is much more compressible than the softest slate in a direction parallel to the lamination of both .
In this direction also the hardest slate is more than double as compressible as the hardest quartz .
Transverse to the lamination , however , both the hardest slate and quartz have nearly the same coefficient of compressibility , which is very small for both .
In the latter direction also the softest slate and quartz have almost the same coefficient , but one aboutfour times as great as for the hardest like rocks .
The author points out several conclusions of much interest deducible from these experiments as to the physical and geological conditions under which these rocks were formed and consolidated .
The compression by natural forces has already been greatest in directions transverse to the lamination .
The great compressibility in the opposite directions , or parallel to the lamination , appears to arise chiefly from the mass of the rock being made up of minute wedge-shaped mineral particles , deposited all with their largest dimensions on the plane of lamination , and so acting on each other like wedges .
Some curious circumstances in the mode of giving way of the rocks under pressure are shown by the author to be probably connected with their mass being formed of an aggregate of several simple minerals .
He points out the great differences in wave-transmissive power in directions transverse to and parallel to the lamination which these experiments disclose .
The specific gravities of the several specimens of rock are then given , to enable the modulus of elasticity to be obtained in feet , and the general results of the experiments are comprised in the following Table ( p. 87):The author then proceeds to apply these results to the comparison of the theoretic and actual transit-periods of the wave of impulse .
The general expression for elastic wave-propagation in a homogeneous medium may be expressed by an equation of the form V= / gL= 8-024 V/ L 86 [ May 8 , HOLYHEAD ROCK COMPRESSION .
