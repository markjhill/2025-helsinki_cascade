] The specimen of the fossil skeleton , described in the author 's last paper , having proved that the animal had four legs , and that its progressive motion through water is similar to that of fishes , he was led to look for its place in the scale of gradation between amphibia and fishes .
With this view he examined the vertebrae of the Proteus , which he found cupped at both extremes , in which respect it resembles the fossil animal : it is also nearly allied to it in having feet ; and were it not that the bones of the chest show that the lungs were more capacious , and that in the largest specimens there is not sufficient space between the occiput and first rib for gills , Sir Everard would have ventured to have called it Proteus ; but as it is highly probable that this animal breathed by lungs only , and appears to have been capable of the two kinds of progressive motion , it may be called Proteo-saurus .
