] This piece of work was undertaken at the suggestion of Prof. W. 1ST .
Hartley , who pointed out that it would be of interest to photograph the absorption spectra of sulphur vapour at temperatures corresponding to the two molecular masses S8 and Sa , the existence of which has been proved from vapour density determinations .
The absorption spectra of the vapour were photographed at temperatures varying from 530 ' C. up to 900 ' C. at atmospheric pressure , and at constant temperatures under pressures reduced down to about 10 mm. of mercury .
The results and their deductions may be briefly summarised as follows :\#151 ; The photographs at constant pressure with the above variation of temperature show the presence of two distinct absorption spectra , which undoubtedly correspond to two definite molecular complexes .
These two spectra are , from reasons stated later , attributed to the oscillations of the S8 and S2-molecular systems , the former producing , by taking up vibrations of certain frequencies , a series of absorption bands between frequency n(= 1/ \ ) 2000 and n 2600 and having maximum absorption about n 2500 , whilst the relatively lighter S2 system , by taking up vibrations of greater frequencies , produces a series of bands lying between n 2900 and n 3820 , with maximum absorption about n3750 .
Moreover , since only two distinct spectra are evident , it is concluded that the equation S8 = 4 S2 represents the sole reaction that occurs in the dissociation of sulphur vapour on heating from its boiling point , 448 ' C. , up to about 900 ' C. The interpretation of the photographs of the absorption spectra of the vapour at different ( constant ) temperatures , but with reduction of pressure , shows that above 580 ' C. the dissociation of the molecule S8 is simple , that is to say , there is direct ( and complete ) dissociation into S2 molecules , but at or below 520 ' C. the dissociation takes place with the formation of molecules intermediate in complexity between the above two aggregates .

Absorption Spectra of [ May 12 , The work of previous investigators* has shown that the absorption spectrum of sulphur vapour changes with variation of temperature .
Thus at the boiling point of the element , only the red end of the spectrum is transmitted ( a thickness of 500 mm. being examined ) , but if the temperature be raised , groups of dark bands are seen furrowing the violet and blue , the maximum intensity of each band being at the more refrangible side .
All these observations were , however , made visually , and no mention is made of the approximate temperature ( except when examined at the boiling point ) .
Experimental.\#151 ; The sulphur vapour in the following series of experiments was examined in a vitreous silica tube with two approximately parallel sides , the thickness of the vapour being about 5 mm. , since preliminary experiments had shown that , for varying temperatures , only a small thickness of sulphur vapour could be satisfactorily examined .
To produce a tube of this description was at first a source of some difficulty ; however , finally , the following method was employed and found to work satisfactorily:\#151 ; A flat piece of graphite of the required thickness was placed inside a vitreous silica test-tube ( special precautions being taken to free the latter from all basic matter ) , and the opposite sides of this were then blown flat against the graphite , using an oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe flame ; a tube was thus formed having two walls practically parallel .
For the source of continuous rays , a spark passing between two metallic uranium electrodes , and condensed on the slit of the spectrograph by a cylindrical lens ( a method devised by Prof. Hartley ) , was used in taking most of the photographs ( see Plate 5 ) , while a series of photographs was also taken with the vapour at varying temperatures , but constant pressure , using an ordinary acetylene flame .
This flame gives a continuous spectrum , extending approximately to n3000 , being , however , greatly weakened from about n 2500 .
For the plate of fig. 1 , the test-tube , prepared in the manner described above , was fitted with ( a ) a small quartz tube sealed at one end and containing a thermocouple ; ( b)a second small tube to allow the excess of sulphur to escape .
Two to three grammes of pure recrystallised sulphur having been introduced into the apparatus , the latter was fixed in a horizontal position between the source of light and the cylindrical quartz lens .
The rays from the spark ( or acetylene flame , as the case was ) thus passed through an approximately uniform thickness of sulphur vapour , and were then focussed on the slit of the spectrograph with the aid of the lens .

] Sulphur Vapour at Different , etc. 313 The apparatus was heated by means of a large rectangular-shaped Mecke burner , the temperature of the sulphur vapour being varied by altering the position of the burner and regulating the height of the flame .
The spectrograph , lens , etc. , were protected from the strong heat of the flame by sheets of asbestos , a horizontal piece being placed just above the silica tube to deflect the heat downwards again , so that there might be the least possible difference in the temperature of the vapour in the upper and lower portions of the tube .
The temperature was measured by means of a platinum-platinum-rhodium thermocouple , connected to a reflecting galvanometer , the deflection of the latter being noted at the commencement and end of the exposure at each different temperature ; as the apparatus was heated up very slowly and carefully , the temperature remained practically constant during this period , the mean deflection , however , being taken .
The spectrograph employed had one Cornu 's quartz prism of 60 ' , and lenses of 15-inch focus .
The photographs were taken on 5 x 4 panchromatic ( backed ) plates , supplied by Messrs. Wratten and Wainwright .
The apparatus , etc. , being arranged in the manner described , photographs of the absorption spectra of the sulphur vapour were taken at temperatures ranging from 530 ' C. up to 900 ' C. , using the spark spectrum of uranium as the source of continuous rays .
Fig. 1 , Plate 5 , is the reproduction of this series ; thus , spectrum 2 of this figure is taken through the vapour at .
530 ' C. , spectrum 3 at 610 ' C. , spectrum 4 at 770 ' C. , spectrum 5 at 840 ' C. , spectrum 6 at 870 ' C. , and spectrum 7 at 900 ' C. On this figure only the portions of the spectra lying between n 2000 ( or 5000 ) and 3500 ( 2860 ) are shown .
A similar series was then taken , using the acetylene flame instead of the uranium spark , the temperature being varied from 490 ' up to-900 ' C. The measurements of the spectra were made with a micrometer fitted with a travelling microscope* and capable of reading to 1/ 10,000th of an inch , and also by means of an ivory scale , graduated to 1 / 200th of an inch , , but capable of being read to 1/ 500th of an inch with the aid of a lens .
The latter method was found , on the whole , to be the more satisfactory of the two , as , owing to its high power , the microscope did not reveal some of the bands distinctly .
Each spectrum was measured once with the micrometer and twice with the scale .
These measurements were made in l/ 100ths of an inch , and the corresponding wave-lengths ascertained from an interpolation curve ( previously made for this spectrograph ) on which measurements ( in l/ 100ths of an inch ) of the principal lines of the cadmium , * For more detailed description of this instrument , vide W.

Absorption Spectra [ May 12 lead , and tin spark spectra were plotted against their known wavelengths ( Angstrom units ) .
On each of the plates the spark spectrum of alloys of Cd , Pb , and Sn ( not reproduced ) was taken to check the measurements of the absorption spectra .
The bands observed all show a maximum absorption towards the more refrangible edge ; the edges are not well defined , so that it is difficult to tell where the bands really commence and where they end ; they are therefore described by measurements of the positions of maximum absorption in .each case .
The width of the bands present in the visible region corresponds to about 25 Angstrom units , that of the bands in the ultra-violet ( about %3750 ) to approximately 15 Angstrom units .
The maxima of absorption of the bands are stated in wave-lengths and also in oscillation frequencies \#166 ; ( n ) ; owing to the comparatively small dispersion employed , and the difficulty .of determining exactly where the strongest absorption in the bands occurs , these measurements can only be relied on to within 5 or 10 Angstrom \#166 ; units , according to the position of the bands .
Again , in measuring some of the very faint bands , it was not always easy to tell whether certain weakenings of the spectra were due to absorption by the sulphur vapour or .to the general diminution of intensity of the uranium spark spectrum .
To \#166 ; decide this point , careful comparison of the absorption spectrum was made with a spark spectrum of uranium of practically the same intensity , and in this way the bands , whose wave-lengths are given later on , were shown to be undoubtedly due to the absorption by the sulphur vapour .
Turning to an examination of Plate 5 , fig. 1 , in spectra 2 and 3 it will be noticed that a series of bands occurs in the violet region , becoming apparently stronger in the more refrangible direction , until merged into complete absorption ; thus , in spectra 2 and 3 , there is complete absorption beyond %2440 .
In the next spectrum ( 4 ) , at 770 ' C. , there is a marked \#166 ; change ; at this temperature we still have the bands in the violet , with strong absorption beyond n 2425 , but about n 2650 we get the spectrum again transmitted , extending to .
n3170 , whilst a second series of bands , starting about n 2850 and lying fairly close together , extends to the end .of the spectrum .
As the temperature is raised the absorption in the region w2425 to n2650 becomes weaker , being resolved into a series of bands , the maxima of any two consecutive bands differing , on an average , in oscillation frequency { n ) by about 30 , and finally , at 900 ' C. , the spectrum is transmitted practically continuously over this region .
The .series of bands starting about n 2850 remains pronounced , extending further into the ultra-violet as the vapour diminishes in density ( i.e. as the 1910 .
] Sulphur Vapour at Different , etc. temperature is raised ) .
In No. 7 ( i. .
at 900 ' C. ) it is found that the spectrum is again faintly transmitted far down in the ultra-violet ; that is to say , at this temperature we have practically continuous transmission as far as n 2850 , then a series of bands , stretching as far as n 3330 ( the absorption becoming stronger towards the more refrangible end of the spectrum ) , beyond this there is complete absorption as far as n 4270 , but from this point , however , there is faint continuous transmission to about n 4400 .
At relatively low temperatures , therefore ( i.e. 500 ' to 700 ' C. ) , we have strong absorption in the blue and violet , stretching even for a short way into the ultra-violet , the mean position of maximum absorption being about n 2500 .
As the temperature is raised this absorption becomes resolved into a series of bands , the maximum absorption of the individual bands being in each case toward the more refrangible edge , and finally , at the highest temperature of the experiment ( 900 ' C. ) , these bands disappear almost entirely .
At this temperature , however , the strong absorption in the ultra-violet is still evident , the mean position of maximum absorption being about n 3750 .
Other experiments at this temperature , with a relatively smaller thickness of vapour , indicate that this absorption is , in reality , composed of a series of bands ( some of which , indeed , are shown on Plate 5 , fig. 1 , spectra 4 to 7 ) , the maximum absorption of each of these bands being , as in the case of those occurring in the visible region , towards the more refrangible edge ; these bands extend as far as n 3820 , beyond which there is transmission of the continuous spectrum again , for a short distance further into the ultra-violet .
Prom these descriptions , it is evident that we must here be dealing with two distinct vibrating systems , which yield absorption spectra of great .similarity , and which may conveniently be referred to as and B , where\#151 ; A is that system existing in greater proportion at lower temperatures ( i.e. 500 ' to 700 ' C. ) , and producing a series of absorption bands between n 2000 and n 2600 , having a mean position of maximum absorption about n 2500 , whilst\#151 ; B is that system which , coming more into evidence at higher temperatures ( about 900 ' C. ) produces by its vibrations a series of absorption bands similar in character to those produced by A , but extending from 2850 to n 3820 , with a mean position of maximum absorption about n 3750 .
( See fig. 4 , Plate 5 .
) At temperatures intermediate between 500 ' and 900 ' C. , we thus have a mixture of the two spectra .
With an increase in the number of the oscillating systems A or B , the .bands evident in the two regions of the spectrum mentioned become merged 316 Mr. J. I. Graham .
Absorption Spectra of [ May 12 into strong broad absorption bands ; for example , at 770 ' C. , the number of systems A present , being greater than at the higher temperature 840 ' C the bands , evident in the spectrum at the latter temperature , become merged into strong absorption between n 2425 and n 2650 ( i.e. between X4125 and X 3770 ) .
From the numerous investigations on the vapour density of sulphur , * the existence of the molecular aggregates S8 and S2 has been proved beyond dispute , the eight-atom complex occurring in greatest proportion about the boiling point of the element , whilst above 900 ' C. ( and up to 1600 ' C. ) the vapour is evidently composed solely of S2 molecules .
There can be no doubt , therefore , that the absorption spectrum described as due to the vibrating system B is produced by the intra-molecular motions of the S2 aggregates .
The question then becomes , to what molecular complex may we assign the absorption spectrum produced by the system A ?
At the lowest temperature at which the vapour was examined in taking the plate for fig. 1 ( i.e. 530 ' C. ) , the value for the vapour density lies between the figures corresponding to S8 and Sg respectively , approximating more nearly to the latter complex ; accepting Biltz 's figures at 534 ' C. , there must , however , be quite an appreciable proportion of S8 molecules , even assuming that no S2 aggregates are present .
Now , if the series of absorption bands in the blue and violet be due to the vibrations of the Sg systems , and since the series of bands in the ultra-violet is , without doubt , due to the presence of S2 molecules , it seems perfectly legitimate to assume that the S8 complex would produce absorption of some description in regions less refrangible than the blue , and that this absorption would diminish with rise of temperature .
No such absorption , however , or change in absorption , has been observed between n 2090 and 1600 , when the temperature of the vapour was varied from 530 ' C. to 900 ' C. It seems reasonable , therefore , to attribute the two , and only two , distinct absorption spectra observed when sulphur vapour is heated from about 500 ' C. up to 900 ' C. to the presence of the two molecular complexes S8 and S2 .
From evidence of the absorption spectra , we must therefore come to the conclusion that , on heating sulphur from its boiling point up to 900 ' C. , there is direct dissociation of S%into \gt ; S2 molecules , without the production of complexes ( such as / Sg or S\#177 ; ) intermediate in size between the above-mentioned aggregates .
It will thus be seen that these results verify the conclusions of Biltz , who , * Deville and Troost , ' Compt .

] Sulphur Vapour at Different Temperatures , etc31 from the course of the curve connecting the vapour density of this element with rise of temperature , felt justified in making the following statement:\#151 ; " Demnach besitzt der Schwefel nur zweierlei Molekeln , namlich Molekeln S8 , und zwar im gelosten Zustande , und ferner Molekeln S2 , die rein im Schwefelgase oberhalb 850 ' , und mit Molekeln S8 gemisclit im Schwefelgase bei niederer Temperatur vorliegen " ( ' Ber .

The Absorption Spectra of Sulphur Vapour at Different ( Temperatures , under Reduced Pressures .
Having arrived at the conclusions already stated , for the dissociation of the S8 molecule under the action of heat , at constant pressure , it seemed advisable to examine the change produced in the absorption spectrum under reduced pressures , but at constant temperatures , in order to ascertain , if .
possible , whether under these conditions there is evidence of the existence of molecules other than the S8 and S2 complexes .
This part of the work was especially desirable , since it has been shown by G. Preuner , from examination of the isotherms of dissociation of sulphur vapour at different temperatures , that the presence of molecules intermediate in size between S8 and S2 is highly probable .
The deductions of Preuner , * from the isotherm of dissociation at 448 ' C. , point to the occurrence of S8 , S8 , S4 , and S2 molecules , but lately this author , in conjunction with W. Schupp , j* has come to the conclusion that only the complexes S8 , S8 , and S2 are present during the dissociation produced by reduction of pressure , at temperatures between 300 ' C. and 850 ' C. Experimental.\#151 ; For these experiments another silica test-tube was flattened in the manner already described .
This tube was fitted with a rubber bung , through which passed ( aa closed tube holding the thermocouple ; ( b ) the exit tube , through which the apparatus was exhausted .
Some asbestos fibre was wrapped round the tube containing the thermocouple , in a position just above the point where the test-tube had been flattened , in order to prevent the molten sulphur condensed in the upper portion of the tube from running down the parallel faces , and thus preventing free transmission of the light .
The rubber bung was wired into the tube , after introducing the sulphur , and on testing , the apparatus was proved to be gas-tight .
The tube was fixed in a vertical position between the uranium spark and the cylindrical focussing lens , the exit tube ( ) being connected to a Topler evacuating pump ; the silica tube passed through two horizontal sheets of * Preuner , ' Zeit .

Absorption Spectra of [ May 12 asbestos , in order to keep the upper portion as cool as possible , while the lower , flattened portion remained at a constant temperature .
In taking the plate for fig. 2 , a horizontal Mecke burner was used for heating purposes , the temperature of the vapour remaining constant at 580 ' C. In the series reproduced in figs. 2 and 3 the pressure was gradually reduced from atmospheric down to about 10 mm. , photographs being taken at different intermediate pressures .
To obtain the photographs in fig. 3 , i.e. with sulphur at 450 ' C. , it was found necessary to place the tube containing the sulphur in a small heating apparatus , composed of two vertical curved copper cells , mounted on a flat piece of copper , and containing an alloy of aluminium and zinc ( melting about 600 ' C. ) , the two cells being sufficiently far apart to allow the passage of light through the silica tube containing the sulphur vapour .
This cell was heated from underneath by means of a large Mecke burner , and in this way it was found possible to keep the vapour at a constant temperature , which however , could be varied by regulating the Mecke burner .
It was found that different pieces of silica apparatus varied in their capability of transmission of light .
Thus the tube used in the case of fig. 1 was found to be very transparent ( see spectrum 1 , fig. 1 ) , whilst that used in the experiments under reduced pressure ( figs. 2 and 3 ) was found to exert rather a considerable general weakening of the spectrum ( compare spectra 1 and 2 on fig. 2 , spectrum 1 being the uranium spark spectrum , spectrum 2 the same after passing through the silica tube , the same period of exposure ( 30 seconds ) being given in each case ) .
The fact that the spectra exhibited on the plates of figs. 2 and 3 were much weaker than those on the first plate is attributed to this absorption by the silica apparatus .
Fig. 2 shows the effect of reduction of pressure at 580 ' C. , the series of photographs being taken through 4\#163 ; mm. of sulphur vapour , the pressure varying from atmospheric ( 756 mm. ) down to 25 mm. In this figure spectrum 3 shows the absorption at 756 mm. , spectrum 4 that at 691 mm. , spectrum 5 at 616 mm. , and so on , the pressure being gradually reduced to 25 mm. ( spectrum 10 ) .
A glance at the reproduction of this plate shows the similarity to fig. 1 .
Thus spectrum 3 is altogether cut off about n 2325 , spectrum 4 is cut oft about n 2380 , then there is absorption as far as n 2715 , but from this point we have the spectrum again transmitted to n 3095 , beyond which there is ^ complete absorption .
In this spectrum bands are present in the violet region coinciding in position with those previously measured on the plate of fig. 1 .
In the next spectrum ( 5 ) the bands in this region are still evident , 1910 .
] Sulphur Vapour at Different Temperatures , etc. 319 whilst bands are to be seen in the ultra-violet , starting about 3040 .
As the pressure is reduced the absorption in the violet region becomes less , whilst the series of bands beyond n 3040 becomes more pronounced , extending further into the ultra-violet , until at a pressure of 272 mm. ( spectrum 8 ) there is continuous transmission as far as n 3040 , then the series of bands mentioned above , the spectrum being cut off about n 3420 .
As the pressure is still further reduced , more of the spectrum is transmitted , until at 25 mm. there is continuous transmission as far as n 3040 , then a series of bands occurs ( the maximum absorption of each band being , as in the series shown in fig. 1 , towards the more refrangible edge , whilst from the measurements of the spectra the maxima of these bands were found to have the .same wave-lengths as those measured in fig. 1 , in the corresponding region of the spectrum , and previously attributed to the presence of S2 molecules ) .
The absorption becomes stronger towards the more refrangible end , until about n 3580 there is complete absorption , stretching to approximately n 4130 , from which point , however , as far as n 4400 there is faint continuous transmission .
( Note.\#151 ; The change in the absorption spectrum on fig. 2 is roughly outlined , in order that the variation of absorption may be more evident , whilst some of the bands are dotted , in order to indicate their positions more clearly .
) A careful comparison of figs. 1 and 2 , with reference to the measurements of the absorption bands , positions of maximum absorption , etc. , makes it evident that here we are dealing with a case of dissociation , similar in every respect to that taking place when sulphur is heated from its boiling point up to 900 ' C. at constant pressure .
In other words , the dissociation the sulphur molecides a , t a temperature of 580 ' C. , and produced by reduction of pressure , evidently takes place according to the equation S8 = 4S2 , without the formation of molecules intermediate complexity .
Other series of photographs showing the variation in the absorption spectrum of the vapour with reduction of pressure , whilst at constant temperatures , were then taken ; thus photographs were taken showing the effect at temperatures of 450 ' ( fig. 3 ) and 380 ' C. respectively ( the latter plate not being reproduced ) .
A comparison of the series in fig. 3 with figs. 1 and 2 shows at first glance that here we must evidently be dealing with a case of dissociation different in the extreme to that already described .
There is , under these conditions of temperature and pressure , no evidence of any band or bands in the violet region , the only effect of reduction of z 2 320 Mr. J. I. Graham .
Absorption Spectra of [ May 12 pressure being to cause an extension of the spectrum towards the more refrangible end , until pressures below 90 mm. are reached , when it is seen that bands begin to appear in the ultra-violet .
Thus , in spectrum 8 we have a series of bands starting about n3340 and extending to n 3530 , where the spectrum has become exceedingly weak , and beyond which there is complete absorption .
As the pressure is further reduced , these bands extend for a greater distance into the ultra-violet , until at 11 mm. ( spectrum 10 ) the bands are evident to about n 3820 , beyond which point the continuous spectrum is again faintly transmitted , being finally cut off about n 3870 .
The wave-lengths of the maxima of these bands were found to agree with the figures for the bands occurring in fig. 2 , spectra 9 and 10 , and which have been attributed to the intra-molecular motions of the S2 complexes .
At the temperature of 380 ' C. , a similar effect was produced on the absorption spectrum by reduction of pressure , bands being present at pressures below 80 mm. , coinciding in position with those measured on fig. 3 in the ultra-violet .
A similar set of photographs through the vapour at a temperature between 450 ' and 580 ' was then taken ; this showed a series of absorption spectra when the temperature of the sulphur remained constant at 520 ' C. It was evident from a study of this plate that at the latter temperature the course of dissociation , as interpreted by change in the absorption spectrum , is similar to that taking place at the lower temperatures .
Let us suppose , for the moment , that molecular complexes such as S6 and S4 exist ; from what has previously been said concerning the connection between the absorption spectra attributed to the S8 and S2 molecules , one would expect that absorption spectra similar in character to the two types already observed and assigned to these two molecules would be produced by aggregates such as S6 and S4 .
That is , for the S6 molecules we might expect a series of absorption bands having strongest absorption somewhere about n 2800 , and for the S4 molecules a series of bands with maximum absorption about n 3200 ( the mean position of maximum absorption for the S8 and S2 aggregates being , as already pointed out , at % 2500 and w3750 respectively ) .
Suppose now we have a gaseous mixture composed of the four sets of molecules , S8 , S6 , S4 , S2 , the most probable effect on the absorption spectrum of the vapour would be that bands similar to those measured on figs. 1 and 2 in regions less refrangible than n 3200 would not be seen distinctly , owing to the overlapping of the four different spectra , due to the intra-molecular vibrations of S8 , S6 , S4 , and S2 complexes , but a general weakening of the spectrum might be expected from about n 2300 ( or further towards the ultra1910 .
] Sulphur Vapour at Different Temperatures , etc. 321 violet , depending on the concentration of the S8 molecules in the mixture ) .
On referring again to the spectra in fig. 3 , it will be noticed that in this series in no case does the spectrum appear sharply cut off , but there is distinct evidence of a weakening from a certain region to the end of the spectrum ; thus in fig. 3 , spectrum 3 , a gradual weakening is noticeable from about ?
t2350 to the end of the spectrum at ?
t2570 .
Similarly in the other spectra a corresponding weakening is evident , whilst by comparison of fig. 3 with fig. 1 the difference between the sharp cutting off of the spectra on the latter and the shading off of the spectra on the former figure is clearly shown .
The obvious conclusion to be deduced from these results is that molecules intermediate in size between the eight-atom complex and that containing two atoms are formed as products of the dissociation of the complexes , when this takes place at temperatures below 520 ' whereas at 580 ' ( ) the equation S8 = 4 $2 evidently expresses the sole reaction that occurs .
It will thus be seen that results obtained from a purely spectroscopic source give independent evidence in confirmation of the thermodynamic deductions of G. Preuner , * given in 1903 , in explanation of the course of dissociation of sulphur vapour at 448 ' C. ; the recent conclusions , however , arrived at by this investigator ( in collaboration with W. Schupp)f from the isotherms of dissociation of the vapour at temperatures above 550 ' C.'do not appear to be in agreement with the interpretation given in this paper of the changes produced in the absorption spectrum of sulphur vapour at 580 ' by reduction of pressure .
A plate , which has not been reproduced , was taken especially for the red end of the spectrum , employing the acetylene flame .
On this plate a fetv weak bands , lying in the blue and indigo , were measured , which were not evident on the plate of fig. 1 .
These bands gradually disappeared as the temperature was raised , vanishing altogether above 870 ' C. The following were the wave-lengths of these bands :\#151 ; 4775 , 4705 , 4645 , 4580 , 4530 , 4465 , 4405 , 4350 .
In addition , the bands measured on the plate of fig. 1 , in the violet , were also evident on this plate .
It has been already pointed out that the bands lying between %2000 ( X , 5000 ) and n 2600 ( X 3846 ) , ( measured on the plates of figs. 1 and 2 ) , may be attributed to the presence of the S8 molecules , whilst those occurring beyond n 2920 in the more refrangible direction are due to S2 molecules .

] Sulphur Vapour at Different , etc. 323 These tables contain what are believed to be the principal bands due to the molecular complexes S8 and S2 , but there is no intention of implying that they are the only bands due to these two molecules .
It is interesting to note that the difference in wave-length between the two extreme bands of each series is approximately the same in both cases .
Thus , in Series A , the first and last bands , given above , differ by 790 Angstrom units ; whilst in Series B there is a difference of 795 Angstrom units .
The two series of bands , A and B , are shown on Plate 5 , fig. 4 , mapped in oscillation frequencies , the black lines and shading indicating absorption .
The position of maximum absorption of each band is towards the more refrangible edge , whilst the individual bands of each series appear to become stronger also in the more refrangible direction .
When mapped in this fashion , the similarity between the two series becomes more evident .
Apologies must be made for the reproductions , which in several cases do not bring out portions of the spectra , bands , etc. , that were clearly shown on the original plates .
Above portions of certain of the spectra , horizontal lines have been drawn to indicate the presence of the continuous spectrum transmitted beyond n 3820 , whilst some of the bands are indicated by dots .
An approximate scale of oscillation frequencies has been affixed to each plate .
It is hoped to repeat these experiments shortly , employing much greater dispersion , in order that the bands given by the sulphur vapour may be further examined , and more accurate determinations made of their wavelengths and oscillation frequencies .
With finer measurements , attempts will be made to see whether these bands conform to any law similar to that given by Deslandres* for the band spectrum of nitrogen .
In conclusion , I have to thank Prof. Hartley for his kindness in giving me many fruitful suggestions , and also for the trouble he has taken in the revision of this paper .
