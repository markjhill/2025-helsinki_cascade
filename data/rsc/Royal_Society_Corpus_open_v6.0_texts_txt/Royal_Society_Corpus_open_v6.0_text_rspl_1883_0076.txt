On the Discharge of Nitrogen .
11 a vacuum the phenomena observed bj Savart do not take place , all kinds of powder collecting at the nodes .
In the investigation of this , as of the other problems , the motion is supposed to take place in two dimensions .
It is probable that the colour phenomena observed by Sedley Taylor* on liquid films under the action of sonorous vibrations are to be referred to the operation of the aerial vortices here investigated .
In a memoir on the colours of the soap-bubble , t Brewster has described the peculiar arrangements of colour accompanied by whirling motions caused by the impact of a gentle current of air .
In Mr. Taylor 's experiments the film probably divides itself into vibrating sections , associated with which will be aerial vortices reacting laterally upon the film .
The third problem relates to the air-currents observed by Dvorak in a Kundt 's tube , to which is apparently due the formation of the dust figures .
In this case we are obliged to take into account the compressibility of the fluid .

" The Influence of Bodily Labour upon the Discharge of Nitrogen .

( Abstract .
) The scope of this inquiry has been strictly limited to one question , viz. , that of the influence of labour in modifying the normal relation between food and excreta .
No attempt has been made to investigate the mode in which nitrogenous products jcome into existence in the organism .
The researches immediately bearing on the subject of this paper are those of Dr. Parks ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vols .
16 and 21 ) , and those of Dr. Austin Flint , made on the pedesti'ian Weston ( " New York Med. Journal , " June , 1871 ) .
Dr. Parks found that bodily exercise caused a slight increase in the nitrogen discharge during or immediately after labour .
The increase was , however , so inconsiderable that it may well be questioned whether it could not be accounted for as dependent on the more perfect absorption of food ; for although the diet of the soldiers experimented upon was carefully regulated , and the nitrogen it contained determined by analysis , with the result that before work the quantity of nitrogen taken in considerably exceeded the quantity discharged , the two became practically equal during the work period .
Consequently if the whole period of observation is * " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " 1878 .
f " Edinburgh Transactions , " 1866-67 .
Mr. W. North .
Influence of [ Nov. 15 , taken into account , the nitrogen discharged is found to be more than balanced by that of the food .
Dr. Austin Flint , on the other hand , found that over the whole period of work the excess of discharge was so large that no such explanation appeared to him admissible .
If , however , comparison be made of the intake with the output of nitrogen during the whole time of observation , comprising three periods of five days each , before , during , and after labour , it is found that the two are unequal , the difference in favour of the nitrogen of the food amounting to 217 grs. in a total of 5075 .
These results were subjected to careful experimental criticism in 1876 by Dr. Pavy ( " Lancet , " 1876 , vols .
i and ii ) , who showed as the result of his own analyses that the immediate effect of labour in increasing the nitrogen output is more than compensated by the concomitant and subsequent intake .
It is further to be considered that whatever results had been obtained by Dr. Austin Flint , they could not have been received without some misgiving , for his methods of research were insufficient as bases for quantitative statement .
Thus the nitrogen of the urine was throughout determined by a process which is known to be liable to errors of variable amount , and which no care on the part of the worker is adequate to guard against .
So also as regards the intake of nitrogen .
Dr. Flint 's estimates were founded for the most part not on actual analyses of the material used , but on calculations based on the percentages given in M. Payen 's tables ( " Traite des Substances Alimentaires , " 1865 ) , which are known to be at best only approximately correct ; moreover , the diet of Weston was of so complicated and variable a composition that , even if each constituent had been analysed , the result would still have been open to question .
The circumstances under which Dr. Austin Flint had to make his observations , probably made it impossible for him to secure uniformity of diet .
In this respect the conditions of Dr. Parkes ' experiments were immeasurably superior .
Fully recognising that uniformity was essential , he fed his men in the simplest possible way ; he was not , however , able to accomplish this without employing a diet which Was so different from that to which , as soldiers , they were accustomed , that , however satisfactory its elementary composition might be , it could scarcely be considered as natural .
Notwithstanding this difficulty , the experiments of Dr. Parkes render it , to say the least , highly probable that the immediate effect of labour is to increase the discharge of nitrogen ; they leave it undecided whether or not this increase occurs at the expense of stored material independently of any concomitant or subsequent increase of intake .
The decision of this point is the object of my experiments .
1883.1 Bodily Labour upon the Discharge of Nitrogen .
13 It will be obvious from the consideration of the experiments above mentioned , that in approaching this question , methods of research are of prime importance .
These divide themselves very naturally under two heads\#151 ; first , the diet , and secondly , the investigation of the excreta in order that the results may be satisfactory .
It is essential first that the daily intake of nitrogen should be accurately known and admit of exact regulation , and secondly that the mode of analysis of the excreta should not be open to question .
The use of the method of combustion with soda-lime effectually disposes of the latter difficulty ; the former is not so readily overcome .
It is a matter of common knowledge that the composition of the ordinary food-stuffs in their usual state is , from the chemist 's point of view , exceedingly variable .
The first consideration then is how to reduce them to such a state that this objection shall disappear .
The mode in which I have overcome this difficulty constitutes the chief difference between my experiments and those of other observers .
It would occupy too much space , and is indeed unnecessary , to describe in detail the process of preparation of the food-stuffs , and it will here suffice to say that I have acted on the principle that only fluids or powders can be accurately sampled and analysed ; all my food-stuffs have been reduced to one of these states , and I may here enumerate them\#151 ; Meat ( dried and ground to powder ) .
Flour .
Vegetables ( dried ) .
Potato ( Edward 's patent desiccated ) .
Condensed milk .
All these articles can be obtained in quantity ; all admit of being easily and accurately weighed and measured ; they are in a state which readily admits of accurate analysis , and will keep indefinitely .
Further they are the constituents of an ordinary mixed diet , and except in their palatability and mode of preparation , involve no serious departure from one 's usual food .
By the use of these materials I can , knowing their composition , adjust the intake of nitrogen with the greatest possible nicety , and maintain it at any desired level for almost any length of time , besides having it in my power to use , not merely a similar , but precisely the same , diet at any time when it may seem desirable to repeat an experiment .
My plan of experiment was as follows :\#151 ; Believing as I do that previous food may materially affect the results of an experiment , arid that the body has the power of storing nitrogen at one time which can be discharged at another as occasion Mr. YV .
North .
Influence of [ Nov. 15 , requires , I regulated my diet for some four or five days before beginning an experiment , and took rather more exercise than usual in order to get rid of any possible surplus in the body ; in the latest experiments I have adopted the plan of abstaining from food on the first day of an experiment , in order to effect the discharge of this surplus , and I am inclined to regard this as the best method to pursue .
I then place myself upon a regulated diet of accurately known composition for nine or ten days , and about the middle of the period I perform a certain amount of muscular labour .
In all experiments made thus far the labour consisted in walking a known distance , and carrying a load whose weight was accurately determined .
By observing the relation of the nitrogenous intake to the output from day to day , I was enabled to determine with very considerable accuracy the effect produced by the labour upon it .
In addition to the nitrogen the phosphoric and sulphuric acids were accurately determined in the food and excreta , and so I was able to institute a comparison , and observe the effect of the exercise in modifying the relationship .
It is impossible in a brief abstract to enter into the immense mass of detail which these experiments involve , but the following tables will , I think , suffice to exhibit the general nature of the results obtained .

My results , while they confirm those of Dr. Parks , show that the disturbance produced by very severe labour is much more immediate and of much greater intensity than that which Dr. Parks observed , the explanation obviously being that in his experiments the exertion imposed on the soldiers who were made the subjects was inadequate .

] Bodily Labour upon the Discharge of Nitrogen .
17 I have farther been able to show as the result of a very lengthy experiment in which several days of complete abstinence from food were introduced , and of which it is impossible in a short abstract to give the figures , that just as in Dr. Parkes ' experiment on the effect of privation of nitrogenous food the diminution of the nitrogen stored in the system was followed by retention , i.e. , by a state of things in which the intake was greater than the output , so , after the disturbance of the nutrition of the body which is produced by severe labour , the immediate effect of which is to diminish the store of nitrogenous material in the system , there follows a corresponding diminution of discharge ; so that the result is the same , viz. , to use Dr. Parkes ' own words " an insufficient supply at one time must be subsequently compensated " whether the insufficiency be due to privation of food or to exercise .
A third result of importance is this : that this storage of nitrogen is the expression of a tendency of the organism to economise its resources , which is much more constantly operative than has hitherto been supposed .
Finally , as regards the phosphates and sulphates , it has been shown that unless the exertion be very severe the phosphates are not increased , whilst the output of sulphates is distinctly increased in every case , the increase being in general terms proportional to that of nitrogenous material .
It is a matter of regret that the total sulphur of the food was not .estimated ; it is known that the percentage of sulphates contained in the food was insignificant as compared with that excreted in the urine , and consequently almost all the discharge must have been a product of oxidation .
I beg leave in conclusion , to state that the expenses of the present research , which have been extremely heavy , have been defrayed by a grant of the British Medical Association .
I desire to express to the Association my most grateful thanks .
