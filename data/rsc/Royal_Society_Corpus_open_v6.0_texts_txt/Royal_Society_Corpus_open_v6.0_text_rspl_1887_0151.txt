As no determinations appear to have been made of the number of micro-organisms in moorland air , the following results obtained last summer may be of interest as forming a small contribution to our knowledge of the distribution of micro-organisms in the air of different localities .
Our determinations were made u on the heather " in the neighbourhood of Midtown , in the parish of Tanadice , in Forfarshire .
This forms a part of the Clova district , so well known to botanists as the habitat of many rare mountain and moorland plants .
Midtown is situated at a height of about 1000 feet above the level of the sea , and is far removed from towns and other sources of contamination , as is evidenced by the fact that the nearest railway is about six miles away .
We also made simultaneous estimations of the carbonic acid by Pettenkofer 's method .
The process employed for the determination of the micro-organisms was the " flask method , " which we have already described in a previous paper .
The samples of air were taken at a height of about 3 feet from the ground .
The results obtained are represented in the following table .
10 litres of air were aspirated in each case .
More determinations would have been made , but owing to an accident the remainder of the flasks were unfortunately spoilt .

[ Feb. 16 , The weather had been fine and dry for a long time previous to August 9th , but between that and the 15th there were several days of rain .
It will thus be seen that not a single sample contained , and that all the micro-organisms obtained consisted of moulds , amounting on the average to 3'5 per litre .
Now Miquel and Dr. P. Frankland have each shown that the air is much richer in micro-organisms during the summer than during the winter , there being a minimum about midwinter and a maximum about July and August , thus : \#151 ; Miquel .

4-8 37-0 30 It hence follows that the number of moulds we found in moorland air was probably a maximum , since the determinations were made in August , and that bacteria are absent all the year round in pure air from moors and hills away from towns .
In order to give an idea of the number of micro-organisms in moorland air as compared with air from other localities , the following table is appended , more especially as many of these data are not generally accessible to chemists :\#151 ; 1888 .
