( Abstract .
) The theory of the 27 lines on a surface of the third order is due to Mr. Cayley and Dr. Salmon ; and the effect as regards the 27 lines of a singular point or points on the surface , was first considered by Dr. Salmon in the paper " On the triple tangent planes of a surface of the third order , " Camb .
and Dub .
MVath .
Journ. t. iv .
pp. 252260 ( 1849 ) .
The theory as regards the reality or non-reality of the lines on a general surface of the thirdorder , is discussed in Dr. Schlaffle 's paper , " An attempt to determine the 27 lines , &amp;c. , " Quart .
Math. Journ. t. ii .
pp. 56-65 , and 110-120 .
This theory is reproduced and developed in the present memoir under the heading , I. General cubic surface of the third order and twelfth class ; but the larger part of the memoir relates to the singular forms which are here first completely enunciated , and are considered under the headings II .
to XXII .
, viz. II .
Cubic surface with a proper node , and therefore of the tenth class , &amp;c. , down to XXII .
Ruled surfaces of the third order .
Each of these families is discussed generally ( that is , without regard to reality or non-reality ) , by means of a properly selected canonical form of equation ; and for the most part , or in many instances , the reciprocal equation ( or equation of the surface in plane-coordinates ) is given , as also the equation of the Hessian surface and those of the spinode curve ; and it is further discussed and divided into species according to the reality or non-reality of its lines and planes .
