Upon the different Qualities of the Alburnum of Spring and UWinterfelled Oak Trees .
By Thomas Andrew Knight , Esq. F.R.S. Read April 20 , 1820 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1820 , p ; 156 .
] It has long been believed that oak timber felled in winter is superior to that felled in spring ; but the cause of the superiority has not been inquired into , and the practice of winter-felling has been discontinued , in consequence of the superior value of the spring bark .
In the spring of 1817 , the author selected two oak trees , not quite a century old , and growing near each other : the one was barked and suffered to remain standinrg ; the other felled , and being immediately stripped of bark , was placed in a situation protected from sun and rain .
The following December , the other tree , still alive , was cut down , placed in the same situation , and pieces of each , from similar parts , were subjected to the following experiments , at different subsequent periods .
The specific gravity of the spring-felled alburnum was 0 666 ; that of the winter-felled , 0-565 .
Equal blocks of each alburnum were cleaved into thin pieces ; and , when perfectly dry , suspended in a damp room for ten days .
One thousand grains of the alburnum of the spring-felled tree gained 162 grains , and of the winter-felled 145 ; so that there is an obvious difference in the properties of the two ; and Mr. Knight doubts not , by taking the bark off in the spring , and not felling the tree till winter , that the timber would be materially improved .
He also thinks that these observations are applicable to the heart wood as well as to the alburnum , though he has not at present any very conclusive evidence to offer on that subject .
