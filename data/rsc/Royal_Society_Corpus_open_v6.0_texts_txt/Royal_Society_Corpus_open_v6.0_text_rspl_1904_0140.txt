446 On the Compressibility of Cases .
The gall bladder presents a very striking instance of the equivocal or antidrome blaze current .
In conclusion I should like to be allowed the pleasure of thanking my husband for continual help and sympathy in my work , and to record my appreciation of and gratitude for the method of investigation , and simplified arrangement of electrical apparatus which renders it easy to study the many fascinating problems of animal and vegetable electricity .

( Abstract .
) The present memoir contains a detailed account of the observations referred to in the Preliminary Notice of February , 1904 .
In addition , results are now given for air , carbonic anhydride , and nitrous oxide .
In the following table , are recorded the values of B for the various gases at specified temperatures , B denoting the quotient of the value of pv at half an atmosphere by the value at the whole atmosphere Gas .

Berthelot the compressibilities at 0 ' C. are inferred , and applied to deduce the ratio of densities as they would be observed at 0 ' C. under very low pressures .
According to Avogadro 's law these are the relative molecular weights .
From the densities of nitrogen and oxygen we get N = 14-008 , if 0 \#151 ; 1\#174 ; * Again , from the densities of oxygen and nitrous oxide we n N = 13-998 .
The former is probably the more trustworthy .
