" The Calling of the Sea .
" By Richard Edmonds , Jun. Communicated by W. J. Henwood , Esq. , F.R.S. In this communication the author states , that in the neighbourhood of Penzance there is often heard inland a rmurmuring or a roaring noise , locally termed " ' the calling of the sea , " which on some occasions extends to the distance of eight or ten miles ; whereas , at other times , although to a person on the shore the sea may be equally loud , and the state of the weather may appear equally favourable , no sound from the sea can be heard at the tenth part of that distance .
From his observations ( luring six years , he concludes , that when the calling of the sea proceeds from a direction different from the wind , or when it occurs during a calm , it is usually followed within six hours by a wind from the quarter from which it is heard .
