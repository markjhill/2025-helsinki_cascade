" A new Ozone-box and Test-slips .
" By E. J. LOWE , Esq. , F.R.A.S. , F.L.S. &amp;c. Communicated by JOHN LEE , LL. D. Received April 16 , 1860 .
The ordinary form , of Ozone-box being very cumbersome , the present one has been contrived to supersede it* .
The box is simple in construction , small in size , and cylindrical in form ; the chamber in which the test-slips are hung is perfectly dark , and at the same time there is a constant current of air circulating through it , no matter from what quarter of the compass the wind is blowing .
The air either passes in at the lower portion of the box and travels round a circular chamber twice , until it reaches the centre ( where the testslips are hung ) and then out again at the upper portion of the box in the same circular manner , or in at the top and out again at the bottom of the box .
Fig. 1 represents a section of the upper portion of the box , showing Fig. 1 .
Fig. 2 .
, _ 7 the mannier in which the air enters and moves along to the centre chiamber ( where the test-slip is hunig at A ) , and figure 2 represents a section of the lower half of the box where the air circulates ill the opposite direction , leaving the box on the side opposite to that on which it had entered .
The box has been tested and found to work well .
On three different dates , when there was much ozone , test-slips were hunig in one box , whilst others were hung in another which had the two entrances sealed up in order that no current of air should pass thirough ; the result was satisfactory , viz. Example .

10 ~929934 10 55 S2 0 The ozone-box is capable of being suspended at an elevation above the ground ; and this appears to be a great advantage , because elevation seems necessary in order to get a proper current of air to pass across the test-slips ; indeed as an inistalnce it may be mentioned , that at any elevation of 20 feet there is almost always more indication of ozone than at 5 feet .
The plan adopted here is to suspend the box to aT support , it being drawn up to its proper place by mneans of a thin rope passing over a pulley ; and there is less trouble in examining and chaniging the test-slips in this manner than there was in the old method .
The box , as described , is made by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra of -latton Garden .
It has been tirged that a box was scarcely rnecessarv for ozonle tst-slips ) i but as the ptapers fade on exposuire to light , it must be evident that in order to register the maximum amount of ozone a dark box is required .
Test-slips Paper-slips being so fragile , I have substituted others made of calico .
The calico is to all intents and purposes chemically pure , containing only a few granules of starch , used in the first process of its manufacture , which it is very difficult to remove , being enveloped in the cotton fibre ; it is , however , thought to be purer than the paper that is used for these test-slips , every precaution having been taken to make it so .
