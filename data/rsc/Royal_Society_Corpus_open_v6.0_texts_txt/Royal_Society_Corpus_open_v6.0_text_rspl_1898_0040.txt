Aluminium as an Electrode in .
* 329 he mean value we have found for the susceptibility of liquid x/ en is 324x10"\#174 ; , and many of our values for it are exactly 3ix 10"\#174 ; .
seems therefore possible that for paramagnetic bodies over wide -rts of density and temperature we may find that the magnetic iaeptibility varies directly as the density and inversely as the dilute temperature .
'e desire to add that our thanks are due to Mr. J. E. Petavel ..rv Mr. J. T. Morris , for their assistance in carefully carrying out hBedious work of the ballistic observations , necessary to determine h field of the electro-magnet we have used .

ftftaJ electric arc with aluminium and carbon poles for the purpojofa rectifying an alternate current .
Part I. Direct Currents .
Two sizes of cells have been used in these experiments , having aluminium and carbon electrodes .
The large size con- !
of one aluminium plate , ^ inch thick , and one carbon plate , \ A thick , separated by ebonite bolts and nuts , the distance betweerhev plates being \#163 ; inch .
The surfaces thus opposed to one another i 111 electrolyte of saturated potash alum in water have each an arei\#174 ; i 36 square inches .
The aluminium plate was not bought as b:"f ?
* specially pure , and may have 2 per cent , impurities .
After mab$ preliminary experiments with alternate and direct currents ov:a lapse of four days , the following experiment was made with this and was repeated .
An exploring electrode was inserted midway between the pi* ' and consisted of a platinum wire sealed into a glass tube .
The T\lt ; i 1 beyond the tube had a length of about 2 inches , and was coiled Wi a small spiral , the plane of the spiral being parallel with the surfWi of the plates .
A Kelvin quadrant electrometer was arranged wit two-way switch , so that the potential between this electrode f in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents .
331 4t ; are the carbon or aluminium plate could be observed .
The cell UP placed in series circuit with another , similar in all respects , K pt that the distance between the plates was inch instead of .
j:h , an adjustable resistance , and an ammeter .
By means of a arsing switch this circuit could be reversed across the poles of wtity-two storage cells having a potential difference of 44 volts .
It temperature of the cell was about 12 ' C. The negative pole of h. storage cells was connected to the aluminium plate and the uent adjusted to 3'6 amperes , the potential difference between the hainium and carbon plates being 4'4 volts , and gas evolved freely .
Ireversing the connections , that is , placing the positive pole of the hging battery to the aluminium plate , the current , so far as this imeter could show , was zero , the potential between carbon and ininium being about 22 volts .
The surface of the fluid was untamed in a state of agitation , but no gas was evolved , except tiery small quantity , if any .

The time between the two reversals in Table I was -minutes .
There is no doubt but that the current , when reversal tik place from 3'6 amperes , first crossed the zero and acquired an cposite sign , finally coming to zero of the instrument .
This is an important point , and was fully established during 332 Mr. E. Wilson .
Aluminium as an Electrode another set of experiments undertaken to find the resistance cthe \#171 ; | electrolyte .
For this purpose the plates were separated to the e:eni of lx8a inch , and two platinum exploring electrodes used , thelis .
tance between them in the electrolyte being inch , along a 8tr ?
H i line perpendicular to the parallel surfaces of the plates .
Each m. reversal took place from negative to aluminium , to posith to 4 aluminium , the potential between these electrodes changed signed b gradually returned to near zero .
The results of the experiment on 3 resistance show that at this temperature the resistance of a lay 0f electrolyte of area equal to the area of the plate submerged , { an of length equal to the distance between the electrode and the.flte** that is f inch in the experiment of Table I , is 0063 ohm .
The or- f rection is therefore small with current 3'6 amperes , and is neglipk t when the positive pole is connected to the aluminium .
The next set of experiments were carried out with alurnkm i Ta inch thick , of 905 per cent , purity , the electrolytes being specilj | .
pure , and only distilled water used .
The cells used are of a smter size , and each consists of one aluminium plate , If inches vie .
i having a carbon plate on each side of it , the distance between ie \#166 ; ' aluminium and carbon being inch , the carbon plates being 2f inn s I wide and f inch thick .
The aluminium plate was submerd J 2j inches in the electrolyte , so that the total area for currenis a ' square inches .
Two such cells were prepared , one with a 10 per cent , by valve 1 solution of HaS04 in water , the other with a saturated solutioi t | potash alum , and left for forty-seven hours with a current of ampi f passing through each in series , the positive of charging cells beg il connected to aluminium .
At the end of this time , and with 1 * current , the potentials across the cells were 2'4 volts for the U2\gt ; ' .
) solution , and 9 volts for the alum solution .
On breaking e I circuit , the potential of the H2SO4 solution cell fell to about O'38 v't f in one minute , and rose fairly gradually to 2'4 volts on making circi .
The alum solution cell lost its potential immediately on break ' ' circuit , that is , the electrometer needle appeared to return to ze !
as though there were no opposing electromotive force .
When t* current was reversed , that is negative to aluminium , and still of t* value ^ ampere , the H2SO4 solution cell gave 0'24 , and the alt solution 1'29 volts .
The aluminium plate which was formed in the H2SO4 solutio together with its carbon plates , were next washed in distilled watt and placed in a saturated solution of alum .
Eleven storage ce !
were connected without extra resistance in circuit to each of the cells positive to aluminium , and the resulting current noted .
Tl | plate which had been formed in H2S04 allowed about 0 2 ampe to pass , and in 4 hours 10 minutes this current had risen to abot in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents .
i.mpere , the temperature of the cell having risen .
The plate f'.med in alum solution only allowed 0'083 ampere to pass .
The t\gt ; cells were then placed in series and left for 13 hours , with ampere passing from the aluminium to carbon plates in each .
The following test was then made .
The cells had opposed to tim , aluminium to positive , in turn from 1 to 20 storage cells , whout extra resistance , rising a cell at each step , the resulting o rent and potential across the terminals being noted .

The experiment already made on the resistance of the electrolyte will only account 0'043 volt at 13'5 ' C. , and 0-025 volt at 57 ' C. with the currents 0*125 and 0*141 ampere as given in Table III .
The conclusion is tha ) temperature has an effect upon the apparent high resistance of 8\#174 ; aluminium plate and its film , the subject of this paper .
This point ; to the fact , that in practice for high apparent resistance , it would necessary to cool or circulate the electrolyte with such dissipation ol energy , that the cell would otherwise acquire a high temperature* in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents .
335 i ..['able III we see that as the cell cools with a smaller current of lit 0*051 ampere , the potential between the aluminium and carbon iflies rises .
In this case at 56 , and 12 ' C. , the electrolyte would ifount for 0*0093 and 0*017 volt respectively .
- was thought that if a plate of aluminium with its film were ttnerged in mercury , the resistance between the metal and mercury uiht give an idea as to whether resistance , pure and simple , played important part in the effects observed .
The plate originally coed in H2S04 solution was carefully removed , washed in distilled were and dried , and half submerged in clean mercury .
Storage 1*3 ranging in number from 1 to 15 were applied as in Table II , i\gt ; , in each case the poles were also reversed so as to test the insula-u with the two directions of currents .
The results show that this , i on aluminium is a fairly high insulator , but it was not stable .
A times the resistance was zero , when a sharp noise occurred in the \lt ; *\lt ; like sparking between points in air , and the insulation was -mediately restored .
With 16 volts applied , the apparent resistance tw about 10,000 ohms , whereas from Table II we see the apparent ) instance of the whole cell is 230 ohms at 14 volts , the positive pole bag connected to aluminium .
I should say , judging from the anber of times the film broke down , that it was more stable when t positive pole of the charging battery was connected to the rminium ; but in either direction the resistance , when established , til the same order of magnitude .
Up to six cells , no extra resistance vs included in the circuit as the film was stable , after this a resist-aje was inserted so as to keep down the current when the film broke dvn , as then the potential between A1 and Hg was zero .
Even at 8volts the film was able to restore its insulatin^properties , but very vely .
On removing the plate , a film was left on the mercury where and been in contact with the film on the aluminium plate .
Another set of experiments was made with two cells having \#171 ; electroly tes a 5 per cent , solution of H2S04 in water , and a saturated Nation of potash alum in water .
The area of the pure aluminium }ite exposed to the fluid was 17 square inches in each cell .
A ' rrent of 1 ampere was passed for four hours through the H2S04 -ution cell , and three hours through the other .
At the end of these ties the temperatures were respectively 33 and 51 0 .
With the 'impere passing from A1 to C , the potentials between the plates were Dpectively 6*3 and 20 volts .
The cell containing the plate formed potash alum solution was then heated , the current through it being ' !
pt fairly constant by means of a considerable external resistance *d 110 volts .
It was then cooled by placing it in a freezing mixture i W ether and carbonic acid snow .
The temperature in this case w\amp ; s duced somewhat rapidly , and a portion of the electrolyte at the ttom was frozen , probably a cryohydrate , leaving liquid above .

with the results of Table III , one must remember that the arts of the plates in the electrolyte are 17 square inches in Table II and square inches in Table III .
This paper does not deal wi the chemistry of the effect discussed .
It is known that a cle aluminium plate acquires this film , when simply submerged in air solution , in the presence of oxygen , without the passage of curren : We have seen that with a given film time is required to develop ti effect .
[ Note added 19th May , 1898 .
The film on these plates has been examined by Mr. Herbert Jacl son , of the Chemical Department , King 's College , London , and tl following is his communication .
" King 's College , London , 1 _ w " May 12 , 1898 .
Dear Wilson , I waited to send you the results of my examination of $ aluminium plates until I had looked at them carefully with tb in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents .
337 u'oscope .
Not much information , however , is to be gained from s. The skin over the plates is , however , seen to be full of minute cks in everj direction , giving the impression of a dried gelatinous , licle ; not an unexpected appearance if the plate had been covered en wet with a thin coating of the gelatinous aluminium iroxide .
The analysis of the film over the metal shows it to isist of basic aluminium sulphate .
The origin of this may of irse have been the formation in the first place of aluminium Iroxide which subsequently reacted with some of the alum solu-n to give the basic compound .
How far the formation of this y have anything to do with electrolysis would , I should think , I difficult to say without further and more elaborate experiment , .
1 it must be remembered that a similar coating can be obtained ( an aluminium plate by immersing it in an alum solution and ving this freely exposed to the air .
" Yours sincerely , " Herbert Jackson .
" 1 have tried an experiment which I think shows that a film formed aluminium by first being placed in contact with an alum solu-n and then exposed to the air , gives the same effect as a film .med in the cell when a current is passed from the aluminium to carbon plate through the electrolyte .
Two similar bright alu-nium plates were prepared with carbon plates on either side of em , the area of aluminium in the electrolyte being 8^ square dies .
The electrolyte consisted of a saturated solution of potash lm in water .
One plate was left in the solution for seven hours th no current passing , and then exposed to the air fox* 16|- hours .
ie other plate was submerged in the fluid and immediately readers were taken of the current passing and potential difference in Its between the aluminium and carbon plates .
The effect in this se was exactly what was previously observed .
That is to say , the '\#166 ; rent being maintained constant at 0'055 ampere by about 2000 ohms \#166 ; ing inserted in circuit with the cell across about 110 volts , e potential difference immediately passed from a small negath e lue through zero , and after three minutes and forty minutes , had spectively the values 1'8 and 2'27 volts ; the temperatures being and 15| ' C. The test was continued .
For the next hours \gt ; e current was 0'204 ampei'e , it was then dropped to 0'055 ampere id kept at this value for 16^ hours .
At the end of this time the itential was 10 volts with 0'055 ampere , and 28'6 volts with 0 163 npere , the temperature being lo ' 0 .
The other plate was submerged in its solution , the potential diffei-ice and current being immediately noted as before .
The results in fis case show that the potential , with 0'054 ampere , rose immediately 338 Mr. E. Wilson .
Aluminium as an Electrode from a small negative value of about 02 volt to a positive valuef 1-8 volts .
After four minutes and forty minutes respectively potential with current 0*054 had the values 2*07 and 2*56 volts t\gt ; temperatures being 13 and 15-5 ' C. This , I think , shows that a fill formed by exposure to the air after being submerged in a saturatl alum solution , has the same effect as another formed in this electroly during the passage of current .
This test was continued .
Aft twenty-four hours , during which the current was 0 0523 ampere , t potential was 11 volts , with this current passing , and the temperatn The two cells were then placed in series and an average current* 0 048 ampere passed through them from the aluminium to carbi plates for fifty hours .
At the end of this time , with current 0 Oi ampere , the potentials were 10 in the case of the plate partial formed without current , and 10*3 in the case of the other ; tl temperatures being 19 and 17^ ' C. respectively .
With current 012 ampere , the potentials were 26*2 and 27*4 respectively at temper* tures 21 and 19^ ' C. ] Sodium hydrate forming a weak solution in water was tried as a electrolyte , the area of the A1 plate being the same as before , 17 squai inches .
The forming current of 0*8 ampere was passed from Al to i for 2 hours 20 minutes , when the potential between the plates wa 13 6 volts , the aluminium plate being covered with a thick blac deposit .
Part II .
Alternate Currents .
The experiments with alternate currents were undertaken in orde : to investigate the instantaneous values of potential and current One object was to see if the effect we have dealt with in the firs* part of this paper has time to properly develop with ordinarj frequencies , and if so under what conditions .
Another object was tc see if aluminium is a valuable metal for use in condensers for alternate currents .
Aluminium-Carbon Cells .
If the time taken to develop the effects dealt with in the first part of this paper were very small compared to the time of a complete period of an alternating potential applied to the cell , one would expect to get a practically uni-directional current in the circuit of the cell under favourable conditions as to temperature and apply \lt ; l potential .
This is not the case with the cells and frequencies dealt with in this paper .
In all these experiments the author wl endeavoured to make the cells the controlling part of the circuit , in Cells for Direct and A lternate Currents .
it is to say between the terminals of the alternate current machine small non-inductive resistance and a Siemens dynamometer were 3 only part of the circuit other than the cells experimented upon , e copper resistance of the circuit including armature was from 1 i 5 ohms .

Another ell of the same size as the above was placed in series with this cell , 'our smaller cells were used in some of the experiments as will be et forth .
Each of these consists of a thin aluminium plate opposed o a carbon plate , the opposed surfaces in a saturated solution of lum have each 8 square inches area , the distance between such urfaces being f inch .
In Table IV the arrangement of these cells was as follows:\#151 ; Experiments ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) all the six cells in series .

Aluminium as an Electrode phase difference but the effect we are looking for , namely , a Lrr ratio between the maximum coulombs in the two halves of a mainly develops with large currents for a given frequency accn-panied by high temperature and small phase difference .
The avei^e watts have been deduced from the product of instantaneous v\gt ; ts and amperes at twenty equal intervals during a period .
The experiments in figs. 1 , 2 , 3 give results obtained with n exploring electrode inserted between the plates in the electrolyte in the first portion of this paper .
The aluminium and carbon plus in one of the large cells were separated to inch , and the two ola kept in series as in experiments ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) Table IV .
The cum refer to this cell , and provision was made for obtaining the insti-taneous values of the current in the cell , and the potentials betwu the exploring electrode and either the aluminium or the carln plate .
In figs. 1 , 2 , the Siemens dynamometer in the circuit register ] the same current , namely S'97 amperes , but the frequencies are 5 and 985 respectively .
We see that second is too short to alb the effect we are looking for to fully develop , since the ratio of 1 ' maximum coulombs is 1-47 .
On the other hand , if we examine two sets of curves we see that at 98 periods per second the potent !
difference between the exploring electrode and aluminium has .
maximum value of 3'63 volts during the half period when b coulombs have the smaller maximum , whereas at 16 periods p second , the same maximum current is produced with a large in Cells for Direct and Alternate Currents .
1 ximura potential , namely , 6'27 volts .
That the aluminium plate an anode during the half period when the maximum coulombs Tree a minimum , was proved by noting the direction of the electrolier deflection , when the positive pole of a Clark 's cell was con-^ted to the insulated quadrant , and examining the observed 1 ection of the deflection during the experiment .
Experiments / llde upon the resistance of the electrolyte with two exploring tyk tetrodes , employing alternate currents , show that at the tempera342 Mr. E. Wilson .
Aluminium as an Electrode ture at which these experiments were made , namely , 13| ' for e [ frequency , and 11C .
for the 98 5 frequency , the resistance^ \#171 ; layer of the electrolyte of area equal to the area of the la|* submerged , and length equal to the distance between the elecodS and the plate , has a value of about 0'063 ohm .
The cur^ 0f potential in fig. 2 have been corrected for this , and the dotted in# show the results .
The average watts dissipated by electriytic hysteresis at the carbon and aluminium plates at 98-5 period per second , fig. 2 , are 069 and4-5 respectively .
This takes no accoutof the resistance of the electrolyte , and has been obtained by tang instantaneous products of potential and current at twenty tual intervals during the period .
Daring the first half-period we : is supplied at the carbon plate on the average at the rate of 4T wtsf during the second half-period the plate does work on the sjeiffl at the average rate of 2'7 watts .
The aluminium plate retrn\#171 ; j practically nothing to the system .
In fig. 3 , the frequency is 101 , the ratio of the maximum coulahs in the two halves of the period is 1*7 , and the Siemens dynamoEK : in the circuit registered 20*6 amperes .
The average temper ; ' : during this experiment was about 55 ' C. , but had a maximui of 64 ' C. at the end of the test .
Under these conditions , evaporati ; of the electrolyte was rapid .
The experiments on the resistance oiiie electrolyte at this frequency and temperature give 0*033 ohm , nd the potential curves have been corrected , the result being showhy the dotted lines .
The average rate of dissipation of energy du to electrolytic hysteresis at the aluminiam plate during the peric is 153 watts , whereas at the carbon plate this rate is only 9'8 w-We see that the maximum volts during the half period when t maximum coulombs are a minimum have risen to 13 , whereas du -r the other half period the maximum volts are only 7^ .
The paper by Graetz already alluded to , deals with alter : ' currents ; and two groupings of cells with aluminium plates as " one electrode are given , whereby he proposes to rectify alter : currents .
He gives 22 volts as the potential an aluminium ce ; ' capable of opposing , and states that the current could not ' measured with a delicate galvanometer .
The first grouping of tU cells- consists of placing between the poles of the alternator 1 circuits in parallel , in each of which he places four cells in ser The poles are reversed so that in the one circuit the predominate current will be positive , whereas in the other it will be negate-The other grouping of these cells is shown in fig. 4 , and the aut1 states that he gets a unidirectional current in the circuit xy .
_ this circuit he has operated a direct current motor , and deposi copper .

Aluminium as an Electrode of sufficient size 95 to 96 per cent , of the energy of the alt\#169 ; ate current can be changed into direct current .
The efficient 0f such a system as shown in fig. 4 will obviously be the ratio oitbe rate at which work is done on xy to the rate at which work is me on the whole system by the alternate current machine .
If this : to be 95 per cent. , then only 5 per cent , must be dissipated in the else .
An important point in connection with the working of these ills is the wearing away of the aluminium .
The thin metal used ir , he small cells above alluded to is perforated with small holes , k , 1 have not noticed so much deterioration in the thicker sheet , 'he evaporation of the electrolyte is another matter which needs jn .
sideration if the temperature is raised fairly high in working .
1 Two Aluminium Plates in Alum Solution .
These experiments were undertaken to find what effect as a on-denser this metal with its film has with varying frequency tempi ture and current .
The aluminium plates in the two large cells aJve experimented upon were opposed to one another in a saturated am solution .
The distance between them was g- inch , and the oppml areas in the solution are 36 square inches on each plate .

An examination of , ble V shows that maximum phase difference develops with the taller currents at lower temperature .
In experiment ( c ) the iximum amperes are 2-5 , the maximum volts 53 .
The curve of tential difference has a maximum rate of change of about .5 volts in second , so that an ordinary condenser with iximum current 2'5 amperes would have a capacity of about microfarads .
We see , therefore , that aluminium is suited for the ates of condensers .
The average watts in Table V have been duced from the instantaneous product of potential and current at -enty equal intervals during a period .
The foregoing experiments employed saturated potash alum solu-m as electrolyte .
The following experiments deal with soda , monia , and potash alums , first when the solutions were saturated , id second when non-saturated .
In each of the non-saturated lutions the proportions were thirteen parts of saturated solution at \gt ; out 12 ' C. by volume and seventy equal parts of distilled water , hree cells were constructed , each containing two aluminium plates 99'5 per cent , purity , separated ^ inch apart , and each having 1 square inches of surface in the electrolyte opposed to the other , he results of the experiments are given in Table VI .
With regard to the saturated solutions one may say that at the w frequency 7'5 Table VI the results are not so good as at the gh frequency 92'4 Table V. The non-saturated solutions also low a better result with regard to efficiency at the higher equency .
These plates were not specially formed with direct currents and irbon cathodes before starting the above experiments .
In a pi e-minary experiment of about one hour s duration , before the first iries at frequency 33 in Table VI were made , and starting with lean polished plates , the maximum volts for the soda , ammonia , and otasli were , a few minutes after starting , 4'4 , 21'5 , and 32 .
The laximum current was 0 48 ampere and the phase differences in each as about 70 ' .
The frequency was 23 and the temperature of each ell about 14 ' C. .
Au experiment was tried in which two aluminium discs G inc us iameter and separated As ' inch on an ebonite spindle weie su merged to within f inch of the centre in a saturated potash alum olution and rotated at 108 revolutions per minute by a small electric notor .
In this manner more than half the discs weie continuous y xposed to the atmosphere .

The frequency was 73 , the temperature 18 ' C. , and square root mean square value of current about 1 ampere .
No perceptible ierencewas observed in phase difference between potential and rent when the discs were rotated and at rest in the electrolyte .
'he conclusion is that the effect investigated in this paper takes e to develop , and is not fully developed with alternate currents of juencies sixteen and ninety-eight complete periods per second .
It i be increased by increasing the current density for a given film , and greatly influenced by temperature .
The metal aluminium with its ni is suitable for use as the plates of condensers , if due regard be en to current density and temperature .
It might in some cases found useful as an equivalent to a metallic resistance .

Contributions to the Study of ' Flicker .

Communicated by Lord Rayleigh , F.R.S. Received May 13 , \#151 ; Read May 26 , 1898 .
Much work has already been done on this subject , though little of a antitative character .
Many observers have described the curious our sensations which rapid alternations of light and darkness can 3ite under certain conditions , admirably exemplified in the " spec-im tops .
" Foremost amongst those whose experiments and writings ve led to the present very general interest in the subjects of flicker , d of the sensation of light and colour , may be mentioned Helmholtz , ivanus Thompson , Shelford Bidwell , Henry , Charpentier , and tod ; whilst the first to try experiments on the relative sensitive-ss of the eye to flicker in light of different colours , seems to have en J. Plateau , who , however , employed pigments , and not the lours of the spectrum .
The writer 's first experiments were made to ascertain the exact lative rotations at which the flickei ' just vanishes in the different lours of the same spectrum , and were carried out ( a ) as suggested f Professor Rood in his 'Modern Chromatics , ' with a balanced , ackened , opaque disc , having a broad semicircular arc removed , 1(1 ( J\gt ; ) on a cardboard disc , half black , half white , viewed in the fferent colours of the spectrum of the second order of a Rowland s an diffraction grating of 14,434 lines to the inch .
Two sources ought were employed , ( a ) direct sunshine , ( \#163 ; \gt ; ) lime-light .
