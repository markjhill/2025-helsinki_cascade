The condition of marked swelling of the lymphatic glands is one of , if not indeed the most evident pathognomic feature of the disease .
The contagium exists as a primary infection in the lymphatic glands .

A very mild attack of rinderpest , such as is produced by injection of blood of greatly decreased virulence , does not convey absolute immunity , this latter being produced in proportion to the severity of the attack through which the animal had passed primarily .
An animal seemingly affected may have a relapse of the disease , which may go on to fatal issue or be mild in type , leading to recovery .
Animals in the latter case always acquire immunity of a high degree .

Continuing the researches on which we are engaged on the Dielectric quality of matter at very low temperatures , we have examined a number of organic bodies and measured their dielectric constants at and above the temperature of liquid air .
The apparatus and arrangements for effecting this measurement are described in a former communication by us on the same subject.* ' The frequency of the reversals of the electromotive force used in charging the condenser in the experiments here described was , as before , 120 .
The condenser used was the gilt cone condenser described in the communication mentioned .
In another paperf we have given the results obtained by us on the measurement of the dielectric constants of glycerine , ethylene dibromide , and nitrobenzol at very low temperatures , and shown that in the case of glycerine the very high value of the dielectric constant possessed by this body , above -100 ' C. , is reduced , on cooling to \#151 ; 185 ' C. , to a value not far from 3'0 .
We have also shown that a similar great reduction in the value of the dielectric constant takes place in the case of ethyl alcohol when frozen at \#151 ; 185 ' C.J # See Fleming and Dewar , " On the Dielectric Constants of Certain Frozen Electrolytes at and above the Temperature of Liquid Air , " ' Roy .

Constants of certain Organic Bodies at Low Temperatures .
359 We have now examined , in addition , the following organic bodies , viz. , formic acxd , methyl alcohol , amyl ethylammonium hydrate , and carbolic , and we find that these bodies have , in the liquid or solid condition and at temperatures above \#151 ; 100 ' C. , high , or very high , dielectric values , but all have their dielectric constants reduced to a value not far from 2-5 when they are cooled to the temperature of liquid air .
In addition , we have measured the dielectric constants of castor oil and olive oil , and find that they are reduced in value when these oils are cooled to \#151 ; 185 ' C. We have also measured the dielectric constants of bisulphide of carbon , ether , ethyl nitrate , solution sulphur in bisulphide of carbon , and absolute alcohol with 10 per cent , of metallic sodium in it .
We find in all these cases that there is a reduction in the value of the dielectric power , large or small , these bodies possess at normal temperatures .
These experiments further confirm the view that the presence of the radicles hydroxyl ( HO ) , carbonyl ( CO ) , and the organic acid radicle ( COOH ) always produce relatively high dielectric values in the bodies containing them when these bodies are in the liquid condition or at temperatures not very far below their freezing points .
When these bodies are , however , frozen and cooled to the temperature of liquid air , all of them suffer a reduction in dielectric power , and their dielectric constants are reduced to values not far from 2'5 , or between 25 and 2'6 , at the temperature of \#151 ; 185 ' C. or a little below .
The action of the low temperature is thus to annul the effect of the radicle .
We have not found , so far , any exception to the rule that pure organic bodies have a dielectric constant of from two to three times that of vacuous space when they are cooled to the temperature of boiling liquid air , no matter what value their constant may have when in the liquid condition .
The following tables give the numerical results , and the observations are delineated graphically in the chart in fig. 1 .
All the tables are headed by a statement giving the galvanometer scale deflection in centimetres when the condenser has air as dielectric .
This is to be understood as the constant , for the time being , representing the capacity of the condenser when its dielectric is gaseous air at normal pressure and temperature .
The numbers in the columns headed " Dielectric constant , " under each substance are obtained by dividing the number in the second column of the tables , headed " Mean galvanometer deflection , " by the above air capacity constant , after having applied a correction to the galvanometer reading for the charging voltage and for the capacity of the leads .
The numbers headed " Mean galvanometer deflection , " when corrected for voltage and the capacity of the leads and vibrator , represent , to the same scale as the corrected air capacity constant , the capacity 2 c 2 360 Profs .

The last column in the tables gives the electromotive force , in volts , used to charge the condenser The frequency of reversals was in all cases 120 per second .
The observations were stopped in each case at that temperature at which any sensible true conductivity made its appearance in the dielectric , and this , as we have already shown , takes place in the case of many bodies quite suddenly , and at temperatures far below their melting point .
Thus it is impossible to carry up the dielectric constant measurement , by the method we employed , ol formic acid 01 methyl alcohol much above about \#151 ; 120 ' , because at that point Constants of certain Organic Bodies at Low Temperatures .

The observations on castor oil , olive oil , and bisulphide of carbon are of considerable interest .
In the first place they show that the method we are using gives results at normal temperatures which are in agreement with those of other observers .
Thus Dr. J. Hopkinson* found the dielectric constant K of carbon bisulphide at 20 ' C. to be 2'67 : we find it to be 2*64 .
The square of the refractive index of carbon bisulphide for the D ray at 10 ' C. is *2"673 , and accordingly this body is generally said to be one of those which obey Maxwell 's law , in that its refractive index is nearly equal to the square root of the dielectric constant .
If , however , we calculate the square of the refractive index of bisulphide of carbon for waves of infinite wave-length using at least * Sec ' Roy .

On Dielectric two terms of the Cauchy 's formula , * we find that for carbon bisulphide the value of O\#174 ; )2 is 2'01 , and this is somewhat less than the value ( 2-67 ) of K at ordinary temperatures .
It is , however , much nearer to the value ( 2*24 ) which we find for K at the liquid air temperature .
Again , Dr. J. Hopkinson 's value for the dielectric constant of castor oil at normal temperature is 478 , and the square of the refractive index of this body for infinite waves is 2153 .
Our value for the dielectric constant of castor oil is 4'23 at 20 ' C. and 279 at-185 ' C. Hence , in the case of castor oil at the temperature of liquid air there is practically a very fair agreement between the values of K and O* , )2 for a low frequency of electromotive force reversals , whereas at normal temperatures K has nearly twice the value of ( / too ) .
The same fact holds good for olive oil .
At normal temperatures its dielectric constant K is 3'16 , and the square of its infinite refractive index OO2 is 2-131 .
At the temperature of liquid air we find the dielectric constant of olive oil to be 2*18 for low frequency .
Hence , in these cases a large part of the difference between K and \lt ; Ao\gt ; )2 which exists at normal temperature disappears at very low temperatures , and castor oil and olive oil then make in this respect even a better agreement than carbon bisulphide .
One other point is of interest .
The temperature variation of dielectric constant for both olive oil and carbon bisulphide appear to be negative at ordinary temperatures , -|- that is to say , their dielectric constants decrease with rise of temperature .
At low temperatures , however , we find their constants to have a positive temperature coefficient ; in other words , they increase with temperature .
Hence , it follows that , like ice and glycerine , they have at some temperature a maximum value for their dielectric constant .
The following table shows the relative values of the dielectric constants ( K ) of certain of these organic bodies at 15 ' and at \#151 ; 185 ' C for low frequency .
At the same time the value of ( / i\#174 ; )2 calculated by Cauchy 's formula is placed against them as far as we have been able to find it determined .
It is clear , therefore , that in all the above cases a very low temperature extinguishes the high dielectric values many organic bodies have in the liquid condition , and it produces the same effect , therefore , as a sufficient increase in the frequency of the electromotive force reversals .
Either of these operations tends to bring down the high value of the dielectric constant to a value much more comparable in magnitude with the square of the optical refractive index as calcu* We here make the assumption that even for a highly dispersive body like carbon bisulphide , the Cauchy formula is applicable for calculating an assumption perhaps not warranted .

The determination of the actual values of the refractive indices of these bodies at the liquid , air temperature is a work of great difficulty , and one which we have not yet attempted .
There is no question that it is important also to determine whether these very low temperatures have any effect in altering the absorptive power of these organic bodies for ultra-red rays , and removing that anomalous dispersion which appears to exist in some of them beyond the limits of the visible spectrum .
We are much indebted to Mr. J. E. Petavel for assistance in the work of taking the above described observations .
