Further observations on Planariae .
By J. R. JOHNSoN , M.D. F. R. S. Read March lo , 1825 .
ABOUT three years since I presented to the notice of the Royal Society a few observations on the genus planaria .
From that period to the present having had no opportunity of extending my researches to more than two or three species in addition to those formerly described , I was unwilling to trespass upon the time of the Society by any further remarks , until I had ascertained the remaining species of this genus .
A circumstance , however , attending some experiments in which I have been lately engaged , of rather a strange character , forming another interesting feature in the history of these very extraordinary animals , induces me to lay before the Society the present communication .
The circumstance to which I allude , is that of the P. cornuta obtaining a second or additional head by an artificial incision , thus constituting a double headed planaria .
At the period of my transmitting my former paper to the Society , I was not aware that any English author had written upon the same subject ; but was afterwards much surprised on learning that a Gentleman of Edinburgh , Mr. DALYELL , had published an account of these animals in 1814 , in a work , having for its title " Observations on some interesting Ph(momena in Animal Physiology , exhibited by several species of planaria .
" Failing to procure this work at the booksellers .
I was at length fortunate in obtaining it through the liberality of its very ingenious author , who obligingly presented me with his only remaining copy .
This Gentleman , after noticing the considerable reproductive powers of the planarie in general , but more particularly conspicuous in that species he terms the P. felina , and which from his description I conjecture to be the P. cornuta , observes , that having occasionally seen some of these creatures deviate from their natural figure in having two tails , &amp;c. ( an event however of so rare an occurrence , that I have in no instance met with such in the many thousands submitted to my inspection ) it occurred to him that monstrosities of this kind might be obtained by artificial means , founding the practicabily of this measure on what had passed under his reviews .
One of these monstrosities he thus describes , c the planaria in relation to others was of small size , its tail was bifid , and out of the cleft grew a body , separated and distinct from the main trunk of the animal , which by some strange and anomalous proceeding had been surmounted by a head , lively and well defined .
In subjecting this planaria to the microscope , numerous black specks , the supposed eyes , appeared surrounding the larger head , and they environed the margin of the smaller head also .
In the course of a week or little more the posterior head had separated by spontaneous division , and had disappeared .
But soon afterwards a kind of projection occupied its place ; and it was not without amazement that I beheld this projection vegetate into a new head , resembling the one which had been lost .
About a month having elapsed , it was well shaped and entire .
My belief being thus corroborated in the probable effect of experiment , 248 it was reasonable to conclude , that if separating parts became complete animals , if a mutilated trunk regained the defective portion ; and if a head , the most important of all organs , was evolved from every inconsiderable fragment , supernumerary parts might , by some particular operation , be produced ; yet it was long before reiterated trials were rewarded with success , and I had almost determined to abandon the enquiry , conceiving that a certain nicety , of which I was not master , should be practised , and that it had been beyond my ability to detect the secret cause of failure .
" Notwithstanding the unpromising commencement of this Gentleman 's labours he still persevered , and at length noticed , that one of the planariae upon which he had made an incision a little below the head , had , to quote his own words " an unnatural prominence , which interrupted the general contour of the side .
October 25th , nearly four weeks after the operation , the superfluous reproduction was clearly recognised to be the rudiments of a new head .
On the l8th of November the operation of nature was fully accomplished ; a new and perfect body crowned by a head had grown out of the side of the parent animal , distant about two thirds of the total length from the extremity of the tail .
" The work , from which the above extracts have been copied , being now out of print , I have taken the liberty of transferring the delineation of this double-headed planaria , under a magnified form , to the drawing accompanying this paper .
Vide Plate XVI .

With the view of ascertaining whether , in my hands , these experiments would prove equally successful , I took the ear.49 liest opportunity of putting them in practice , but with evident mistrust as to the result ( not however in the slightest degree doubting the accuracy of the above report ) , conceiving that no circumstance of this nature had yet occurred , in the many and repeated experiments I had performed upon these animals during the past and the preceding summer .
Having a considerable number of the P. cornut'e in my possession , I took at least one hundred of the most active , and made an incision on the side of the body in each , but only succeeded in one solitary instance in obtaining the wished for result .
Looking over these planariax after the lapse of nearly a fortnight , I discovered that the incisions had , in by far the greater number healed , so that no evident difference existed between them and perfect unmutilated planariae .
Preternatural excrescenses had taken place in several , and others had separated at the place of incision so as to become two animals , but only one planaria , as before noticed , exhibited the very singular and astonishing circumstance of a double head .
The additional head was in about six weeks equally perfect and well formed with the other , although it had not yet acquired the usual deep colour .
In fig. 1 .
is a delineation of this double headed planaria , such as it appeared under the microscope when at rest ; fig. 2 .
as seen when in motion .
In about two months after it had acquired this additional head , a fragment separated from the tail ( the most usual place of separation ) and was in progress towards its entire reproduction , when it was accidentally lost-a second , and ultimately a third fragment was spontaneously separated from the same 2go animal .
A delineation of these as they at present appear , ( magnified ) is given in fig. 4 and 5 .
The light portions show the parts renewed .
The planarice submitted to my experiments were , it must be confessed , from their long previous confinement , but ill adapted for the purpose ; I think it therefore more than probable , that a different result would have followed , had these planariae been active or vigorous , or but recently taken from their native abode .
From the number of experiments made both by Mr. DALYELL and myself , and from the very few instances in which they proved successful , it may be reasonably inferred , that the production in the same animal of a second or additional head , is a circumstance of unusual and extraordinary occurrence , and as such may not be unworthy a record in the pages of the Philosophical Transactions .
In addition to my former remarks on the P. cornuta and P. torva , I have to observe , that I kept a considerable number of each of these species the whole of the last and the former summer , and not having noticed , during that period , any other mode of perpetuating their kind , than that of their detaching small fragments either from the head or tail , I am of opinion they do not , like the other planaria--at least those I have examined , propagate by eggs ; and this may sufficiently account for the reproductive power being so very conspicuous in these species .
The P. torva , however , does not possess this principle in so high a degree as the P. cornuta .
In one instance , I recollect one of the latter species casting off two fragments from the tail , the very same night it was taken , which were only prevented from becoming perfect animals , by an accidental occurrence .
Having found the hirudo vulgaris or common rivulet leech to produce its young in greater number when kept separate , I thought the planaric might be similarly affected .
To ascertain this point , I took several of the P. cornutr and placed them singly in separate vessels , and in another vessel , by way of contrast , about an equal number together .
During the first fortnight scarcely any fragments were detached from the latter , whilst the former , with but few exceptions , had each gone through this process ; some indeed throwing off or detaching more than one fragment .
This spontaneous separation occurring so soon in those planarise kept apart , led me to think it was owing to the necessity then existing of continuing their species .
Hence it would also appear , that this process is at all times under command of the animal , and may be called into action upon any particular emergency .
And this I think the more evident , from the circumstance of my having lately placed three lively planariae in the glass globe where the double headed planaria had been hitherto confined alone-that spontaneously divided within the short space of four days , ( Dec. 24th ) in the manner represented in fig. 6 , 7 , 8 .
In regard to the planarike placed together , although at first extremely indolent , yet they ultimately threw off as many fragments as in the former case ; thus proving , that their being kept together or separate makes no further difference , than that where the demand is strong upon them to perpetuate their kind , this process is sooner brought into operation , e-2,5 The following is the result of this experiment during the first month .

15 placed together , threw off 16 10 separately 3 !
.5 produced 29 These 25 planarize , now placed together , detached in the course of the second month s3 additional fragments , making a total of 62 .
Supposing therefore this operation to continue in full force eight months in the year , ( and I find it unchecked even in the present month of January ) we should have in the whole 248 fragments , an average of about 10 to each planaria ; but if we allow these creatures to multiply in a double or treble degree when at liberty , and supplied with proper food , we may then form a tolerable estimate of the extent to which their reproductive powers might be carried .
In concluding this history of the P. cornuta , I may remark , that the smallest portion detached from the tail , so small indeed as to be scarcely perceptible , is sufficient to constitute the active principle or germ of the .
future animal ; but in this case these animals when perfect are so extremely small , as to lead one at the first glance to believe that the parent animals produced their young perfect and in a living state ; that they were in fact viviparous .
I shall close this paper by a few general observations on the planaria nigra , the most common of the British planariae !
85S P. nzgra .
Planaria oblonga , nigerrima , antice truncata .
Long. 5 lin. Lat. 2 lin. Body , of a fine glossy velvety black , convex above , with an elevated ridge in thecentre ; plain beneath , truncated before , slightly pointed behind ; two ventral foramina ; numerous eyes .
This little animal , of which a front view is given of its natural size in fig. 9 .
is the most sluggish and inactive of all the planariae I have yet examined .
It is commonly found in ditches , attached to the under part of leaves , stones , &amp;c. ; it is often seen traversing the surface of the water in an inverted position like the glossoporc .
This species , like those formerly described , is furnished with a retractile trumpet-shaped proboscis , issuing from a circular aperture in the middle of the abdomen , and so capable of extension , when in search of food , as to equal in length the animal itself .
A delineation of this curious apparatus , ( which I shall in future take as a characteristic type of the genus I am describing ) is given in a magnified view of the under part of one of these planaria in fig. lo .
This singular apparatus by means , of which these animals take their food , is not the least of the many strange features in their history ; it is indeed so far removed from the common mode of receiving aliment , that doubts might well be entertained as to its real office , were it not clearly pointed out by MULLER , and the ingenious author of the work to which we have recently alluded .
The P. nigra is oviparous ; each ovum , or more properly speaking , capsule , producing from 2 to 6 young .
The period at which the young are excluded varies with the prevailing temperature ; the shortest period as seen by the following tables being 20 , the longest 53 days , making a difference in this respect alone of more than a month .

The P. nigra , if artificially divided in two or more parts , will have the lost portion restored in about a fortnight or three weeks .
One of these under a magnified form , with a renewed anterior extremity , is delineated at fig. 11 , for the purpose of showing a circular range of black specks , or what are commonly called eyes , surrounding the outer margin of the head .
This species does not , as far as I have been able to ascertain , separate like the P. cornuta by spontaneous division ; although , in common with the genus to which it belongs , it is enabled to repair any mutilation to which it may have been exposed .
