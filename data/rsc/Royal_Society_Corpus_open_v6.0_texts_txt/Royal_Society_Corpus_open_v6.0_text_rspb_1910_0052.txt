A New Method for the Quantitative Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid in Vegetable and Animal Tissues .
By Dr. A. D. Waller , F.R.S. ( Received June 17 , \#151 ; Read June 30 , 1910 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , South Kensington .
) The evolution of hydrocyanic acid by laurel leaves ( ) in consequence of congelation , or of their exposure to the action of anaesthetic vapours , was first pointed out by Raphael Dubois.* It has been studied more recently by GuignardJ who has introduced an extremely delicate test for the presence of hydrocyanic acid by sodium picrate paper , and quite recently this test has been applied by F. E. Armstrong^ for the rapid detection of ferments of the emulsin class .
The reaction was first studied by HlasiwetzS in 1859 , who gave the following equation :\#151 ; C6H3N307 + 3KCN + 3H20 = C8H4KN506 + C02+NH3 + 2KH0 .
v____v____ ; Potassium isopurpurate .
* The reaction appeared likely to afford a convenient instance for the simultaneous observation of chemical and electrical changes taking place in living protoplasm under the influence of anaesthetics , and the immediate purpose of this investigation was to determine the parallelism or the want of parallelism between the course of the two changes\#151 ; chemical and electrical .
Qualitative experiments in which the evolution of hydrocyanic acid from laurel leaves was followed by means of picrate paper , the leaves being enclosed in corked tubes containing the vapour of ( 1 ) chloroform ; ( 2 ) ether ; ( 3 ) alcohol ; and ( 4 ) water , gave results in the order of intensity ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , * K , .

] Quantitative Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid , .
575 and ( 4 ) , both as regards evolution of HCN and decline of electrical response .
In chloroform vapour the evolution of HCN was greatest , and the abolition of electrical response most rapid .
In water vapour there was no evolution of HCN and no diminution of electrical response , so that it appeared at first sight as if the two kinds of effect , increasing in the first case , decreasing in the second , were the associated consequence of the same disturbance of protoplasm .
But on further examination , more especially by quantitative experiments in which the degree of anaesthetic action was graduated and the evolution of hydrocyanic acid estimated , this view proved to be untenable .
In order to make quantitative experiments it was necessary to use the anaesthetic reagents in aqueous solution .
By preliminary trials it was found possible to do so in weak solution of sodium picrate , which , in the absence of an anaesthetic , was found to have little or no toxic action upon the leaves .
A leaf immersed in " picrate fluid"\#151 ; 0'05 per cent , picric acid + 0'5 per cent , sodium carbonate\#151 ; remains alive for many days , with an undiminished electrical response and without any evidence of HCN evolution , whereas a leaf immersed in the same solution + 0*4 c.c. chloroform per 100 c.c. loses its electrical response and reddens the liquid , in a few hours at ordinary temperatures ( 16 ' to 18 ' ) , in a few minutes at a temperature of 40 ' .
Similar results are obtained with " picrate fluid " + 5 c.c. ether per 100 c.c. , or 20 c.c. ethyl alcohol per 100 c.c. The varying tints obtained , obviously dependent upon varying amounts of hydrocyanic acid evolved , led me to make experiments with various mixtures containing known small amounts of hydrocyanic acid , in order to see whether a reliable colour scale could be obtained .
Equal volumes of picrate fluid and HON solution ( titrated by AgNOs ) at concentrations 0T , 0*01 , 0'001 , and O'OOOl per cent , gave tints which on appropriate dilution were found to be reasonably concordant , and stable even when exposed to direct sunlight .
It was found necessary that the picrate should be taken in great excess in relation to the cyanide , and that in any case , by reason of the slowness of the reaction , comparisons of tint should be taken 24 hours after mixture at ordinary temperatures , or after an hour or two in an incubator at 40 ' .
The Colour Scale.\#151 ; The mixture adopted as standard is made from equal volumes of picrate fluid and 0'002-per-cent .
HCN left for 24 hours in an incubator at ' 40 ' .
This mixture contains 10 milligrammes HCN per litre , and has a red colour of an intensity T10 , where T1 denotes the tint corresponding with 1 milligramme HCN per litre , or 1 millionth gramme per 1 c.c. The colour T 10 is nearly matched by the colour of a 5-per-cent .
Dr. A. D. Waller .
Method for the [ June 17 , solution of potassium bichromate .
It is a very " fast " colour\#151 ; not being appreciably affected by direct sunlight or by boiling .
Thus a tint of T 1 in 1 c.c. liquid represents 0-000001 gramme HCN .
T1 in 15 c.c. " 0-000015 T 5 in 20 c.c. " 0-000100 T10 in 100 c.c. " 0-001000 For actual comparison it is preferable to dilute a given liquid , if very highly coloured , so as to bring it below the intensity T 10 .
For delicate estimations , as e.g. of HCN in the blood of an animal poisoned by inhalation of HCN , it is possible to distinguish with certainty tints below the intensity T 1 ( vide infra , Experiments 11 and 12 ) .
The rate of development of colour in the reaction between picric and hydrocyanic acid is illustrated by the following figure .
At 20 ' the colour of Hours Fig. 1.\#151 ; Curves showing the rate of development of colour , i.e. of the formation of sodium isopurpurate , in a mixture of equal volumes of picrate fluid and of O'002 per cent. HCN , at 20 ' and at 40 ' .
a mixture of equal volumes picrate and HCN ( 0002 per cent. ) reached one-half its maximal value in 40 minutes , three-quarters its maximal value in 80 minutes .
At 40 ' these times were shortened to 10 and 20 minutes respectively .
From which , admitting that the time of intensification to within 1 fn of maximum depth of tint varies as the logarithm of n , we may calculate times of intensification to within 1/ 100 of its full depth at different temperatures .
Thus the tint of a mixture should reach to within 1/ 100 of fulness , i.e. to 99/ 100 , in 4 hours 46 minutes at 20 ' and in 1 hour 6 minutes at 40 ' .
Distillates should therefore be left in the incubator for at least an hour before their tints are estimated .
This method , by which it is easy to estimate minute quantities of HCN , counting by thousandths of a milligramme , with an error by manipulation and reading that does not , at present , amount to 10 per cent , of the reading , and that , no doubt , will be reduced by further experience , is very generally 1910 .
] Quantitative Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid , etc. 577 applicable .
On laurel leaves under the influence of anaesthetics , the daily or hourly evolution of HCN can be followed in a series of tubes from which the contents are decanted at stated intervals ( infra , figs. 2 and 3 ) .
On animals ( and on man ) the tenor in HCN in blood , or in other tissues , can be quantitatively estimated by the colours of distillates from known weights of material into suitable volumes of picrate ( vide infra , Experiments 1 to 25 ) .
As regards its application to the particular question stated above , as to the parallelism between chemical and electrical phenomena in laurel leaves , it has furnished what , in my judgment , is a clear and unmistakable answer , to the effect that the evolution of hydrocyanic acid\#151 ; so far from being a sign of life in the sense that the electrical response is a sign of life\#151 ; is a sign of loss of life , and , at any rate as to its main bulk , a post-mortem phenomenon .
On the Time-Relations of Electrical and Chemical Changes taking Place in Ancesthetised Laurel Leaves .
The earliest time after exposure to 0HC13 vapour at which an evolution of HCN can be detected has , in my observation , been 5 minutes .
The electrical response to a strong induction shock , i.e. the ingoing homodrome or antidrome blaze-current ( which , as has been described at length elsewhere , * is a characteristic sign of life ) , is completely abolished as early as one minute after exposure to chloroform vapour .
( Young tender leaves are best adapted to this experiment .
Older leaves , by reason of their high electrical resistance , are not suitable .
) We may not infer from the time-difference alone that the evolution of HCN is a post-mortem phenomenon , since it may be due to " lag " in the production and diffusion of HCN , and in the reaction of HOIST with picric acid .
But a leaf which , after a minute 's exposure to CHCI3 vapour , has lost its electrical excitability , and which begins to give signs of HOIST 10 minutes later , and goes on giving off HOIST for hours and days is assuredly dead .
The HCN is then , in the main , a product of post-mortem action in a leaf that was killed during the first minute .
The following figures will be sufficient to illustrate the course of this postmortem fermentation , which , like other chemical actions , takes place more rapidly at higher than at lower temperatures:\#151 ; * Waller , ' Lectures on the Signs of Life , ' 1903 , p. 87 ( S 55 ) , p. 94 ( S 59 ) , p. 109 ( S 65 ) .

Quantitative Estimation of Hydrocyanic Acid in the Elood and Tissues of Animals , and of Man , after Death by Hydrocyanic Acid Poisoning .
Estimations were made by distilling the blood or minced tissue , mixed with water acidified by tartaric acid , into a solution of sodium picrate .
They have been made with the blood and other tissues of animals that had received , by intravenous injection or by injection into the stomach , amounts of hydrocyanic acid , or of potassium or sodium cyanide , much above and rather below the reputed minimum lethal dose ; also with the blood and tissues of animals that had died by inhalation of HChT , in whose blood therefore the actual amounts of HCN inhaled had been automatically limited by the arrest of respiration .
As will be seen from the following summary of experiments , the method lends itself to the quantitative determination post mortem of very minute amounts of hydrocyanic acid .
It is applicable up to ( if not beyond ) 48 hours post mortem ( Experiment 17 ) .
And , as shown in the tabular digest giving millionths ingested per gramme of body weight and millionths found per gramme of tissue , it brings into evidence that the organs in which HCN is found to be most abundant ( and for which , presumably , its affinity is relatively great ) are the heart and the brain .
As shown in Experiment 3 , it passes in the blood itself from the plasma to the corpuscles .
The method is simple and expeditious .
Each distillation requires about half-an-hour , and , as shown by fig. 1 , an hour 's digestion at 40 ' is sufficient to bring out the full ( 98 to 99 per cent. ) depth of tint in the distillate .

This table , in which the numbers express millionths of a gramme per gramme ( or milligrammes per kilogramme ) injected and extracted , shows very clearly that hydrocyanic acid goes to some organs to the heart and to the brain ) rather than to others ( i.e. the muscles ) .
This is particularly evident where the quantity of poison injected has been very small , i.e. , in Experiments 11 , 12 , and 15 .
