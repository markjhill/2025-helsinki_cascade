" On the action of light upon the colour of the River Sponge .
" By John Hog , M.A. , F.L.S. , C.P.S. , &amp; c , Fellow of St. Peter 's College , Cambridge .
Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , F.R.S. The author found that the green colour of the Spongilla fluviatilis , or river sponge , is acquired solely through the agency of light , and is lost when the sponge is removed from its influence .
As this does not appear to be the case with Actinise , the Hydra viridis , or any other Polype , the author is disposed to consider this production as being nearer allied to the Algae or Fungi , than to any tribe belonging to the animal kingdom .
