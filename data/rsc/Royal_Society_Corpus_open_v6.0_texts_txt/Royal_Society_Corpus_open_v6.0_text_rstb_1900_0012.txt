It has been shown by several previous observers ( Holmgren , Dewar and M'Kendrick , Kuhne and Steiner ) that the excised eyeball gives an electrical current , which undergoes variations at illumination , and that these variations of current are due solely to changes occurring in the retina .
All the observers above named describe the variation to be positive at the commencement and at the end of illumination .
Holmgren makes no distinct statement r 2 14.11.1900 DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , with regard to the state during illumination .
Dewar and M'Kendrick seem to imply that the state during illumination is negative .
Kuhne and Steiner distinctly assert that the state is positive during illumination , and that variations of the type described by Dewar and M'Kendrick are characteristic of an injured , fatigued , or dying eyeball .
Kuhne and Steiner observe further that the variation during illumination is quite independent of the direction of the current of rest .
With regard to the time elapsing between illumination and electrical response , Dewar and M'Kendrick observed that it was less than -^th second ; Fuchs , by means of the rheotome , that it was '0004 to '006 second .
Dewar and M'Kendrick state further that fatigue and recovery occur during illumination and darkness ; that coloured lights act in the order\#151 ; yellow , green , red , blue ; that with geometric increase of light-intensity there is an arithmetic increase of deflection ; and that the effect on one eye may be traced to the opposite optic lobe .
II .
Plan of Experiment .
My purpose was to re-examine more closely , and with the help of photographic records , the phenomena as presented by the frog 's eyeball , which Kuhne and Steiner ( with whom I agree ) consider to be the most normal object upon which to study retinal effects .
The effects manifested by the posterior half of the eyeball or by the isolated retina are , I find , precisely what is obtained on the injured eyeball , and I therefore consider as typical the effect obtained on the uninjured eyeball .
Moreover the latter has in my hands proved to , be far more sensitive and far more enduring than previous accounts had led me to expect\#151 ; e.g. , a " good " eye will give a large electrical response to illumination by a flash of moonlight lasting y^th second , and will respond distinctly to exposure to light reflected from a white card 10 feet distant lighted by a standard candle 10 feet from the card , while the period during which response may be witnessed extends to more than 48 hours .
That heat-rays do not contribute to the effect is at once shown by means of an alum cell or a black-hot poker .
And the " physiological " nature of the electrical response is proved by the fact that it is subject to the influences of anaesthetics and of raised or lowered temperature .
The eyeball is carefully excised , pressure of the globe being particularly avoided , and placed between the soft clay ends of an ordinary pair of unpolarisable electrodes .
A black box with a hole and tube opposite the eye , a candle in a spring stand , wires through the box to a galvanometer , and a sensitive plate to record the movements of the galvanometric spot complete the apparatus .
The connections between eyeball and galvanometer are always such that the nerve stump is to the N. terminal and the cornea to the S. terminal .
Normal current in the eyeball is thus always upwards from nerve to cornea , northwards through the EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
galvanometer .
Deflections in this upward direction in the eyeball are given as upward movement in the photograms , and are termed " positive .
" Deflections downwards are termed " negative .
" " Up " and " down " on the record signify thus current " up " and " down " through the eyeball , " up " from choroidal to vitreous surface of the retina , " down " from vitreous to choroidal surface .
The galvanometer , which is nearly , but not quite , dead-beat , is usually adjusted by a shunt to give a deflection across the plate with a standard current from v'lt through eyeball , electrodes , and galvanometer .
Its sensitiveness , unshunted , was approximately 15 millims. deflection for 1 TO-9 ampere on photograms , and 30 millims. on a transparent scale used to take readings .
I also used for recording purposes where less sensitiveness was sufficient a fully dead-beat instrument giving on the photographic plate a deflection of 1 millim. for 1T0~9 ampere .
Fig. 1 .
Normal , response Diagram to show direction of normal current and direction of normal response .
The recording plate was let down by clockwork at speeds varying with particular requirements between 5 millims. per minute to 15 millims. per second .
Intermediate speeds frequently used were 25 and 150 millims. per minute .
Excitation was made by brief or prolonged exposure to the light of a standard candle , sliding along a scale 20 feet long , fixed to a shelf in a darkened room .
The exposure shutter was an ordinary Thornton-Pickard camera shutter released by air-pressure .
To signal the instant of flash or the duration of exposure , the releasing bellows ( a small bicycle-pump ) was connected by T-piece with the releasing nipple , and with a second nipple that signalled the releasing stroke upon the travelling plate .
In the slower records this complication was , however , omitted , and the signal was made by hand .
Units of excitation marked along the candle scale were taken in hundredths of a foot-candle , viz. , the light of a standard candle at a distance of 1 foot .
Thus at 10 feet distance the stimulus was 1 unit , at 20 feet '25 unit , at 2 feet 25 units , \amp ; c.# The eyeball rests upon one electrode with the cornea upwards .
Light reaches it * * I have since adopted the metre-candle as unit to facilitate calculation .
1 metre-candle equals 0929 foot-candle , or approximately xqth .

1 have also occasionally tested the effects and the after-effects of electrical excitation , viz. , of induction shocks and of condenser discharges .
In the latter case it was of course necessary to exactly compensate through the galvanometer any current that might be present , and to arrange the circuit in a special manner , described below ( p. 155 ) .

Results .
The results of the present investigation confirm and extend the results of previous observers , and are summarised under the following heads :\#151 ; S 1 .
A Fresh Normal Eyeball , set up as figured , manifests Positive Current , which gradually declines to Zero , and becomes Reversed .
This normal current ( current of darkness ) is due partly to current of injury , of which the electromotive spot is the cut end of the optic nerve , partly to the retina itself , which has necessarily been to some extent aroused by the disturbance of removing the eyeball .
As will be shown , any and every disturbance of the retina arouses positive current .
The normal current , which is the sum of these two components , subsides with such rapidity that the zero-point is reached in 15 minutes or less ; e.g. , in one case where 1 measured and timed the fall , it fell from -f-'005 volt to zero in the first 15 minutes , and in the next 15 minutes reached a value of \#151 ; .002 volt .
Not infrequently , when an eyeball has been most carefully removed and kept for a few minutes in the dark , the normal current is negative from the outset of observation .
The fall of a subsiding current , whether diminishing from -f to 0 or increasing from 0 towards \#151 ; , is delayed by light and accelerated by darkness Fig. 2 .

The absolute value of its E.M.F. is too variable to be of much significance : +'006 , -f-'004 , -}-'012 , -}-'005 , -T " 0006 , *006 , '003 , \#151 ; '004 , \#151 ; '001 are values recorded in notes of my earlier experiments , when I measured the current by compensation at the outset .
I have seen it reach to the value of \#151 ; '012 after the reversal .
S 2 .
On Exposure to Light the Current , whether Upward or , undergoes an Upward Variation .
The statements contained in SS 1 and 2 have been previously made in other words by Kuhne and Steiner , the second being designated by them as the " law of constant alteration of tension , " and expressed as follows : " Reversed direction of the current of darkness is without influence upon the magnitude and character of the photo-electrical variations which reverse their signs .
" The main effect during illumination is a positive effect , by upward current through the retina , whether the current of rest be at the time upward or downward .
An upward variation of a downward current has been described as being a negative variation of a current of injury : it is therefore desirable to clearly understand that the main electrical effect of illumination of a fresh eyeball is always directed through the retina from rod and cone layer to nerve fibre layer ( represented by an arrow from fundus to cornea ) .
The direction of deflection with illumination , when watched on the galvanometer scale , usually appears to be positive at the commencement of illumination and positive at the end of illumination .
It has been variously described as being positive or as being negative during illumination .
Thus Dewar and M'Kendriok# say : " The action of light on the eye of a frog may be briefly stated as follows : When diffuse light is allowed to impinge on the eye of the frog after it has arrived at a tolerably stable condition , the natural electromotive force is in the first place increased , then diminished ; during the continuance of light it is still slowly diminished to a point where it remains tolerably constant , and on the removal of light there is a sudden increase of the electromotive power nearly up to its original position .
" Kuhne and Steinerf consider this course of events to be characteristic of abnormal eyeballs , and state that the initial augmentation of current suffers no diminution during illumination lasting for some minutes .
All my observations and records confirm this view , and show that the effect of exposure to light are as described by Kuhne and Steiner .
The puzzling feature that we should have at commencement and at end of illumination , i.e. , with the .
advent of light and with the advent of darkness , a deflection of the same sign , is to some extent cleared up by photographic records , which show that the final * Dewar and M'Kendrick , 'Trans .

DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , deflection is a subordinate feature of the main change , and justify the simple statement that there is positive ( upward ) current during illumination and no such current during darkness .
Figs. 3 and 11 typically illustrate this fundamental fact .
The accessory to the fact , i.e. , the terminal positive deflection , will he best considered later , vide infra , p. 140 .

Illumination for 1 minute ; obscurity for 2 minutes .
Any disturbance of the retina\#151 ; whether by its normal stimulant , light , or by mechanical pressure , or by electrical stimulation , arouses a more or less considerable and more or less enduring positive current .
The original positive current of a freshly excised eyeball has two factors : electromotivity of the cut end of the optic nerve and electromotivity of the disturbed retina , Fall of current by subsidence of such disturbance is therefore delayed by light , or having fallen is made to rise again by light , or by tetanisation , or by mechanical pressure .
The general rise of base line in fig. 3 illustrates this gradually rising after-effect accompanying the succession of positive effects directly caused by illumination .
The electromotive force of the response to light varies usually between '0001 and .0010 volt .
The following values are taken from my note-book :\#151 ; + -00013 , -f -0002 , -f -0001 , rising to -f '00015 , + -0005 , + -0003 , -f -0013 , + '0003 volt .
For the third stage ( videinfra ) I find the values\#151 ; - -0002 , \#151 ; '00005 , \#151 ; *0001 , \#151 ; '0003 volt .
These values refer to responses obtained by exposure for 1 minute to the light of a standard candle at 2 feet ( =25 units ) .

The Magnitude of Response increases the Duration of Illumination .
With the strength of light as before ( 25 units ) , the response to a brief exposure by means of a flash shutter ( timed at y^gth second ) , the deflection is generally one-tenth to one-quarter of that provoked by exposure for a period of 1 minute\#151 ; a time that is sufficient to bring out the maximum effect .

The two starred pairs were observed with eyes of the second stage infra ) .
I have learned to associate a relatively large effect of brief illumination with a relatively conspicuous break deflection at the end of prolonged illumination .
A conspicuous break effect is characteristic of what will be described below as the second stage .
The point is illustrated in fig. 12 .

The Magnitude of Response increases the Strength of Illumination .
This relation has been commented upon by all previous observers .
Deavar and M'Kendrick in particular , regard the data they observed as being in conformity with Fechner 's logarithmic law .
They give , e.g. , the effects of a given light at 1 , 4 , and 8 feet from the eyeball strengths as 64 , 4 , and 1)\#151 ; f at make J+ 8 +5 +1 1 at break 1+1.2 +5 +5 .
For moderate strengths of illumination ( i. between 1 and 100 units by a standard candle 10 to 1 foot from the eyeball ) , I find that the regular result of experiment is an increasing deflection with increase of light , the rate of increasing effect diminishing with the increasing stimulus .
The curve plotted from the data ( stimulation along the X axis , deflections along the Y axis ) comes out concave towards the abscissa , and not unlike an ordinary logarithmic curve .
Beyond a certain maximum effect , the response , even to increasing stimuli , exhibits no further increase , or it may be an actual decrease , presumably by reason of fatigue .
For weak illumination ( i.e. , below 1 unit , by a candle more than 10 feet distant from the eye ) the curve , plotted in the same manner , generally comes out as convex towards the abscissa .
The entire curve of response from minimal to maximal is thus an S-shaped curve , rising by increments at first increasing then diminishing .
It is in all cases advisable to take the mean value of a double series of observations in the scale of increasing and of diminishing intensity of stimulation .
These several points are illustrated in the following observations\#151 ; the first giving a simple series of readings of responses to stimulation in the ascending scale of intensity ; the second a more carefully taken series up and down a scale of units .
The latter are photograpically recorded in figs. 4 and 5 , on inspection of which it may be EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .

S 5 .
Fatigue .
Fatigue\#151 ; i.e. , a diminution in power consequent upon previous action\#151 ; is apparent in all experiments where the response to light is observed for any length of time .
But the amount of fatigue brought into evidence by illumination is much less than might have been expected .
The retina , although to some extent liable to be fatigued by experimental illumination , is much less fatigued than is ordinary muscle by electrical tetanisation .
And whereas it is an easy matter to completely exhaust a muscle by repeated tetanisation , the retina cannot be exhausted by repeated illumination at EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
least , within the range of intensity that 1 have employed .
Even with electrical tetanisation\#151 ; by which , as will be shown in S 12 , true retinal response is elicited , the signs of fatigue are no more pronounced than with luminous stimulation .
On the other hand , the recovery from fatigue is prompt and complete .
Thus in an experiment made to test this point , the following values were observed ( illumination at 25 units):\#151 ; Normal response ... ... ... ... ... . .

A character that is in all probability due to the efficiency of restorative change by which expenditure of substance is made good .

In general , the retina of a " poor ' frog gives the best marked decline in series of normal positive responses .
Nevertheless the response of the third stage ( vide infra ) has , so far as I have seen , proved to be remarkably persistent .
And sometimes , particularly with brief stimulation ( for 6 seconds at 1 minute intervals ) , an increasing deflection has come under observation , DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , giving a series withi " staircase " increase , like that obtained on cardiac and other muscle and on nerve .
But whereas in the latter case we may feel assurance that the effect is veritably the result of the stimulation , in the case of the retina this certainty is obscured by the fact that spontaneous gradual increase and diminution of response are apt to be present , in consequence , I believe , of the state of eyeball as regards the internal production of carbonic acid .
For this reason I have attached little importance to the detailed examination of fatigue effects and of staircase phenomenon ; a general view of the facts , as they have come under observation , maybe gathered from the following summary table , and from the records given in figs. 3 , 3a , 0 , 7 , and 8 .

Experiments 5 and 8 ( figs. 3 and 8 ) exhibit hardly any " fatigue .
" Experiments 2 , 3 , and 7 ( fig. 8 ) are instances in which " fatigue " is most apparent .
But it is possible that even in these cases there may have been a natural decline more pronounced than usual .
Similar considerations apply to the mammalian eye , where the positive response rapidly diminishes , while the later negative response persists of undiminishing magnitude ( videinfra , fig. 37 ) .

Coloured Light .
As previously shown by Holmgren and by Dewar and M'Kendrick , chromatic light of different regions of the spectrum , and white light filtered through different coloured media , give , cceterisparibus , unequal electrical responses of the retina .
Holmgren found the effects to be the greatest from mid-spectral colours , yellow and green , and least from colours at the two ends of the spectrum , red and blue .
Dewar and M'Kendrick in their first publication give the relative efficacy as being : red = 10 ; yellow = 10 ; green = 8 ; blue = 4 .
In a subsequent publication they give the relative efficacy of colours as being governed by luminosity .
Partly for its own sake , partly in order to see whether any fundamental antagonism or even difference could be detected between the fatiguing ( katabolic ) colours , red and yellow , and the restful ( anabolic ) colours , green and blue , I made a series of experiments with candle-light filtered through coloured glasses , chosen of such nature as to be as nearly as possible complementary , i.e. , to cut out all candle-light when taken in superposed pairs , red + green ; yellow -j- blue .
The relative order of efficacy at 25 units came out\#151 ; Red ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... -{- 4 Blue ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..+ 9 Green ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..+12 Yellow ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .+16 " White " ( candle ) ... ... ... ... ... ... +33 I next made a series of trials to see whether the joint effect of two complementary ( or opposed ) colours is greater or smaller than their separate effects , as illustrated by the following experiment:\#151 ; Candle at 20 feet .

Effect of Temperature .
Like previous observers , I find that the normal response at first increases with rising temperature and then disappears .
To which 1 have only to add that the abolition may be only temporary if the temperature has not been raised too high for too long a period .
For example , in an experiment directed to this point , with the temperature Fig. 9 .

The Three Stages .
With lapse of time , or immediately in consequence of partial injury ( i.e. , of a more or less violent disturbance ) , the character of the response alters its type .
Conformably with the classification of nerve-effects in three stages , 1 distinguish for the eyeball ( i.e. , the retina ) three states or stages\#151 ; ( l ) fresh , ( 2 ) transitional , ( 3 ) stale .
And whereas in the case of nerve aroused to action by electrical stimulation the distinguishing feature of the first state is a negative response , and in the third state a positive response , in the case of the retina aroused to action by * A , D.

An eyeball that does not give a variation of this type has probably been unduly compressed or otherwise injured in the process of excision .
Second Stage ( Transitional).\#151 ; Several varieties of " Transitional " responses present themselves , which shade into each other , and are obviously connecting forms between the first and the third types , ( a ) The earliest transitional form exhibits at make of light a positive current rapidly declining during exposure , and at break of light a large positive effect , followed by gradual subsidence to the normal .
( Vide fig. 16 .
) ( b ) At a more advanced stage of alteration the make effect is positive , but the electrical state during exposure is normal or negative .
figs. 12 , 1 and 1 Third Stage ( Stale).\#151 ; The final response to light is a pure negative response , the negative current ( downwards ) being established at make of light , enduring throughout exposure and ceasing with break of light .
( Vide figs. 13 , 35 , 36 , and 37 .
) S ( J. Double Nature the Response .
The entire series of effects is clearly compatible with the hypothesis that illumination arouses in the retina two opposite effects\#151 ; -positive and negative , and that the former dies out more rapidly than the latter .
This view is confirmed by the closer consideration ( l ) of the terminal positive deflection at break of light , and ( 2 ) of the time lost between illumination and response at make of light .
( 1 .
) The positive movement at break of light might be due to the sudden increase of a plus state , or to the sudden decrease of a minus state .
Or if two opposite states cease simultaneously but with unequal rapidity , it might be due to the greater sharpness of cessation of the negative state .
The careful inspection of a large number of photographic records has led me to adopt this last explanation , by reason of the fact that I find the return from positive to normal to be always less rapid than the return from negative to normal .
This reflection led me to examine more closely into the state of matters at the make of light .
If , namely , two opposite states are simultaneously aroused , but with * A. D. W. , ' Phil. Trans. , ' B , 1897 , pp. 23 and 48 .

Response of second stage .
As a matter of fact , it frequently does so during what 1 have termed the second stage .
That it does not do so in the first stage depends upon the fact , ascertained by inspection of records , that the establishment of positive and negative state presents no such difference of speed as their subsidence .
The negative state is indeed established more rapidly than the positive state , but the difference is not sufficient to affect a galvanometer that shows quite distinctly the difference in their rate of subsidence .
If , however\#151 ; and the case presents itself frequently in the second stage \#151 ; a sufficiently well-marked difference should exist , then we shall have a short negative swing preceding the main positive effect .
The relations just considered are represented in the diagram ( fig. 18 ) , in which the time relations of positive and Fig. 18 .

negative effects are represented by lines above and below zero , while the broken line represents their resultant .
Figs. 19 , 15 , 17 and 23 to are reproductions of instances in which the struggle between -f- and \#151 ; , at make of light , is evident .
Lost Time.\#151 ; Quite early in this investigation , observing on the galvanometer scale the effect of a flash of light upon eyeballs of the second stage , I was surprised to notice the extraordinary length of time elapsing between flash and deflection , extraordinary in relation to the values given by previous observers , viz. , less than -y^th second ( Dewar and M'Kendrick ) , less than y^th second ( S. Fuchs ) .
The times under my observation could be noted by stop-watch , and were 3 to 5 , and in one case as high as 7 seconds .
Such an interval is altogether in excess of any possible physiological lost time , and highly suggestive of a period of hesitation , during which two opposed currents were developed from the retina at nearly equal rates .
Graphically recorded , this false period of latency or " period of hesitation ; ; is remarkably distinct , altogether deceptive and unintelligible otherwise than on the theory of opposition which was first suggested by the regular terminal and confirmed by the occasional initial minus .
Fig. 20 is a well-marked instance of it , exhibiting little or no visible sign of predominance in either direction during a period of hesitation lasting 5 seconds .

The method I adopted , although amply sufficing for my present purpose , viz. , to show the extraordinary length of the period of hesitation , was obviously unadapted to a determination of a true latent period of retinal response by reason of the inertia of the magnet itself , and 1 accordingly did not attempt to use it for the latter Pig .

At most I have ventured to compare by this means the lost times of make and of break of light , and have found that whereas in the first stage no gross difference is to be detected , in the second stage the lost time of make considerably exceeds the lost time of break\#151 ; by a gross difference that is to be measured in seconds , and that I have spoken of as the period of hesitation .

Action of Carbonic Acid .
Kuhne noticed that the frog 's eyeball gave little or no response to light half to one hour after excision , but that it became active three or four hours later.# He attributed this temporary abolition to local asphyxia .
I have shown that as regards nerve the primary effects of C02 are to diminish the positive response and to increase the negative response . !
' In view of these facts 1 have made a few experiments to see whether the presumably negative-cum-positive response of the retina could be modified in the sense of a favouring of negative and disfavouring of positive .
I had previously seen in some experiments made for another purpose that the retinal response ( positive ) was abolished by C02 , by Et20 , and by CHC13 , but had not examined closely the action of C02 upon the retina as I had that of nerve .
I cannot say that I have ever seen the eyeball effect precisely as described by Kuhne .
I have never at any period during the first few hours after excision failed to obtain the response to light .
The response has at first diminished with lapse of time , and subsequently increased .
Sometimes it has started small and has subsequently become considerable .
The event apparently depends upon the state of the eyeball at the time of excision .
Like Kuhne I find that carbonic acid can abolish the response , but I also find that its marked effect upon the retina as upon nerve is to give rise to subsequent augmentation of the response .
An eyeball placed on the electrodes may happen to be in a state of depression or of excitation by C02 and give a series of diminishing or increasing responses .

response .
A rhythmical series of moderately brief stimuli exhibits generally little or no diminution , but it may be reinforced , and then give evidence of fatigue or reduced and then exhibit staircase increase .
One remarkable point of contrast between nerve and retina as regards the action ol C02 is the following : In the case of nerve the primary effect of C02 is to augment the negative response of fresh nerve and to diminish the positive response of stale nerve , and in the latter case the typical and striking effect is a reversal of response by C02 from positive to negative.* In the case of the retina the primary effect of C02 is to augment the positive response of a fresh retina , and to diminish the negative response of a stale retina .
Hitherto , however , I have not witnessed a conversion of retinal \#151 ; to retinal -j- analogous with the conversion of nerve 4* to nerve \#151 ; .
Another difference between nerve and retina as regards the action of C02 is obviously dependent upon a difference in the physical conditions of the two experiments .
It is relatively easier to obtain the primary augmentation of response in the case of the retina and the full depressant effect in the case of the nerve .
Primary augmentation is an effect of little C03 , the full depressant effect is produced by much C02 , and it is obviously easier to get the full effect upon the naked nerve of small mass than in a retina deeply imbedded in the eyeball .
The full effect is accordingly more easily obtained on a fundus than on the intact eyeball , and still more easily obtained on an isolated retina than on the fundus .
The regular effect of carbon dioxide upon nerve in the third stage is to diminish the positive response .
I therefore expected that the negative response of retina in the third stage would be found to be diminished by CO\#163 ; .
And this was found to be the case in the few trials I have made of the point .
Moreover , a very constant feature in all the photographic records that I possess of the action of C02 upon the positive deflection is the suppression of the terminal positive kick , which I attribute to the sudden cessation of a masked negative deflection .
( fig. 27 .
) S 11 .
Effects after I have in a previous paper offered evidence that tetanised nerve exhibits signs of metabolism , and that such signs are throughout similar to the signs characteristic of the action of carbon dioxide .
Guided by the results obtained on nerve by prolonged tetanisation , I proceeded to test the effect of prolonged tetanisation upon the retinal response to light , in the expectation that a retina provoked to activity in this manner should exhibit signs of increased molecular mobility .
And in point of fact such signs appear in the case of the retina in even more striking degree than in that of nerve .
Moreover they offer a distinct advantage in * Lor .

The typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards nerve is an augmentation of the negative response to electrical stimulation .
The typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards the retina is an augmentation of the positive response to luminous stimulation .
The experiment is extremely simple , and I have not yet seen it fail .
With connections as in fig. 33 , the response to light is observed ( or recorded ) , then Fig. 33 .
G\lt ; a , uv\lt ; a , nometer .
Diagram of connections .
the eyeball is tetanised by alternating make and break induction-currents sent through the eyeball in both pairs of directions , the galvanometer being cut out of circuit at plug 5 .
At the end of a minute , more or less , the galvanometer is unplugged , current aroused by the disturbance of tetanisation is compensated , and as soon as the spot is steady , the response to light is again observed .
The augmentation , which may amount to X 2 or X 3 , lasts for a considerable time\#151 ; half an hour or an hour or more\#151 ; the effect being indeed even more marked and striking than in the case of nerve .
The retina is quite surprisingly resistant , even to strong electrical currents , far in excess of such as are sufficient to diminish or permanently abolish the negative response of nerve .
The physical conditions appear to be more favourable in the case of embedded retina than in that of naked nerve to the manifestation of effects caused by internal products of activity .
In my hands the strongest currents have failed to permanently abolish the retinal response to light , which has at most been temporarily diminished even by currents with which I sought to effect its abolition .

Two periods of tetanisation , Ti and T2 , each lasting 1 minute .
After the first tetanisation the positive response is considerably augmented , and falls during illumination .
The terminal positive deflection at break of light is abolished .
After the second tetanisation the positive response is further augmented .
Augmentation of the positive response to light is the principal and typical aftereffect of tetanisation of the retina .
Many points of inquiry arise from this principal fact .
What are the effects upon the response to light during tetanisation ?
What are the effects during and after tetanisation upon a retinal response of the third stage ?
Is the alteration due to an augmentation of electromotive force or to a diminution of resistance , or to both factors concurrently ?
I have to some extent investigated all these several points , but in so doing have become involved in a group of considerations that are , in my opinion , important to further study of the electrical activity of the retina , but that cannot be fully disengaged from their non-physiological concomitants without considerable care and labour .
The case stands thus :\#151 ; In addition to the alterations of response to light , there are produced in the living eyeball in consequence of electrical excitation\#151 ; ( 1 ) An DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , alteration of the normal current in a positive direction , i.e. , in the same direction as its exciting current ; and ( 2 ) an alteration in a negative direction , in the opposite direction to its exciting current .
The first of these currents is physiological and occurs only on the living eye , the second is physical and occurs with or against the first on the living eye , and alone on the dead eye ; it is the ordinary counter-current of electrolytic polarisation .
Tetanisation by alternating makes and breaks is a particularly complicated case , inasmuch as we have unequally exciting currents that elicit unequal polarisation currents .
Once outside the clear case of a large positive effect or after-effect caused by both directions of tetanisation , matters become exceedingly complicated .
We shall find it necessary for further intelligence of the facts to study the effects of single induction shocks and of single condenser discharges .
We shall also do well to avoid for the present further complication by considering the effects upon retinal responses of other than the first stage .
For these reasons I shall at present limit myself to the statement that the normal living eyeball during the first few hours after excision is predisposed towards the manifestation of positive current when excited by tetanising currents of any direction .
With regard to the subsidiary question put at the outset of this paragraph , the preliminary and qualitative answers are that the augmented positive response to light is in chief part due to augmented electromotive force , in small part due to diminution of resistance .
As regards the negative response to light of the third stage , I have observed it to be increased and to be diminished in consequence of tetanisation , diminution being more easily and augmentation less easily obtained of the negative than of the positive response .
The effect during tetanisation upon positive response of the first stage will be described in the next paragraph .
As regards the points of the present paragraph I repeat as definitely acquired :\#151 ; 1 .
That subsequent to tetanisation the positive response to light is augmented .
2 .
That the eyeball during the first few hours after excision gives after tetanisation of any direction a large after-effect , causing the spot to fly off the scale in the positive direction .
Its ordinary designation in my laboratory is the " retinal blaze , " and it can be quite easily distinguished from 3 .
An after effect in the direction of the break-shock , witnessed on the dead and moribund eyeball , reversed by reversal of tetanisation , due to superiority of polarisation by make induction shocks over polarisation by break induction shocks.# The after-effects of tetanisation as regards retinae in the third and second stages are , by reason of this last complication , reserved for future consideration .

S 12 .
Effects during In the course of preliminary trials of the after-effects of tetanisation , it was evident that the positive retinal after-effect was the prolongation of a positive effect occurring during the passage of the tetanising currents .
The practical difficulty in the way of a close examination of the effects produced during tetanisation consists in the necessity of conjoining in one circuit the eyeball , inductorium , and galvanometer ( fig. 33 , hy removal of plugs 2 , 4 , and 5 ) , so that any inequalities of interruptor give an unsteady spot ; and in most cases the currents have to be taken of such strength that the galvanometer is influenced by the first make and last break of each series of currents .
Nevertheless , with a regular interruptor and by gradual approximation of the secondary to the primary coil after the current has been started , it is generally possible to get positive response to both pairs of direction of the series of alternating currents .
I have never witnessed a terminal positive deflection at the end of tetanisation analogous with the terminal effect at the end of illumination , although of course with fairly strong currents with break in the positive direction a false positive kick is elicited .
By reason of the deflection in the direction of the break current , S11 ) , due to predominant polarisation by make , it is preferable to use the coil with Helmholtz side wire .
With unmodified induction shocks , the direction should be taken make -\-----break \#151 ; \#151 ; , in which case a positive deflection \#151 ; \gt ; during tetanisation , i.e. , in the direction of make , is a true retinal response that overcomes the physical effect in the direction of break .
With the direction make \#151 ; \#166 ; *\#151 ; , break -J----------- we obtain , it is true , a large positive deflection , composed in the case of a living eyeball of retinal response and of physical polarisation in the same direction , but also obtainable on the dead eyeball by reason of polarisation alone .
A dead eyeball during tetanisation gives deflection in the direction of break ; reversed direction of tetanisation gives therefore reversed direction of deflection .
A normal living eyeball , in spite of this effect , gives positive deflection to both pairs of direction of tetanisation .
Intermediate and often complicated effects present themselves in the case of moribund eyeballs , and I have therefore confined my observations to the clear case of positive response to both directions of tetanisation .
The chief point of interest in connection with this true positive response to tetanisation is the following : Comparing the fatigue effects of retina and of muscle ( vide supra , S 5 ) , it is perhaps not strictly allowable to take effects of electrical excitation in the case of muscle and effects of luminous excitation in the case of retina .
Nevertheless I regard the comparison as a legitimate confrontation of two definite physiological processes\#151 ; one in muscle aroused from nerve via the end-organ of nerve in muscle , the other in the retina directly excited by its natural physiological excitant light .
The apparent fatigue in muscle excited DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , through its nerve is in reality , as I have urged elsewhere , * fatigue of the motor-end plate .
The fatigue of muscle directly excited electrically is not , however , markedly different as regards its rate of development from the fatigue of muscle excited by electrical stimulation .
The fatigue in either case is the expression of physiological change .
The fatigue of the retina by light is equally certainly the expression of a physiological change .
And now I find that fatigue of the retina by tetanisation runs a nearly parallel course with fatigue of the retina by luminous stimulation .
This last comparison justifies then a study of fatigue of the retina by tetanisation , which has as its closest counterpart fatigue of muscle by tetanisation .
And from the whole of the preceding argument it follows that we may legitimately compare , on the one hand , the apparent fatigue of muscle , whether directly tetanised or physiologically excited through its nerve , and , on the other hand , fatigue of the retina directly tetanised or physiologically excited .

In any case , however , and quite apart from any comparison with signs of expenditure in other tissue , the bare fact as regards the retina considered alone preserves all its interest , viz. , that tetanisation like light provokes positive response , and that the two kinds of response wear out in a parallel manner .
I should add that the parallelism is not always absolute , that sometimes I have found large response to light with small response to tetanisation , and at other times a reversed relation .
These exceptions do not , however , disturb the evidential value of instances in which parallelism has been clear .
They have probably had their origin in polarisation , which had more or less added to or subtracted from the physiological response .

Up to this point I have described the retinal responses to electrical excitations .
We have next to consider the influence of tetanisation upon the retinal response to illumination .
The results of this kind of experiment quite clearly demonstrate the " mobilisation " of retinal matter by tetanisation , and are obviously free from complication or fallacy .
With eyeball , galvanometer , and secondary coil in series ( fig. 33 , p. 148 , keyboard unplugged at 2 , 4 , and 5 ) the effects of light are observed ( or recorded ) before , during , and after the passage of tetanising currents .
The latter arouse in the retina a large and steady positive current .
Illumination of the retina during this condition gives a largely augmented positive response .
Subsequently to tetanisation the response to light remains considerably augmented as a rule , or , if the tetanisation has been long and strong , and the eye poor , it is temporarily diminished .

( Note.\#151 ; The record incidentally illustrates a feature that I have not yet investigated .
The standard deflection of TTrV(j volt at outset of experiment = 17 , at end of experiment = 27-5 ; this implies , if referred to diminution of resistance alone , an alteration of more than 50 per cent. The total resistance in circuit is approximately 25,000 , of which the eyeball constitutes less than one-tenth .
The alteration cannot therefore be referred to altered resistance .
It is probably due to an electromotive effect in the same direction as the standardising current .

After-effects of Single Induction Shocks .
Connections are established as shown in fig. 33 ( see back , p. 148 ) .
The galvanometer spot is brought exactly upon its zero mark by adjusting the compensator current , so that plugging and unplugging at 5 cause no deflection .
A single induction shock is sent through the eyeball while the galvanometer is plugged out of circuit , and immediately afterwards the galvanometer is unplugged .
With a dead eyeball the deflection on unplugging the galvanometer , after a strong induction current , is of contrary direction to the direction of exciting current , indicating an ordinary polarisation counter-current .
But with a living normal eyeball similarly treated the deflection is positive ( i.e. , from fundus to cornea ) whatever the direction of the exciting current .
An induction current sent through an eye , whether living or dead , in the downward or negative direction causes counter-current in the opposite ( upward ) direction , and there is in this reaction no absolute token by which to distinguish between polarisation and physiological response .
But whereas an induction current through a dead eye in the upward direction causes a downward counter-current , it causes an upward after-current in the same ( upward or positive ) direction in a normal living eye .
In this case there is after-effect in the positive direction , i.e. , a retinal discharge in the same direction as the exciting current .
With a normal fresh eyeball giving the regular positive response to illumination this retinal discharge is in the positive or upward direction , whether the exciting current be directed upwards or downwards .
This is the principal and most certainly demonstrable fact .
At later stages and with moribund eye-balls the effects become variable .
We'may then witness retinal discharge upward in response to upward excitation , and downward in response to downward excitation , and finally 1 have once or twice obtained a downward retinal discharge in response to both directions of excitation .
But I have bestowed little attention as yet upon these varieties , and I do not associate them with the three types of response to light .
EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
They are in any case less striking and invariable than the normal positive response which I have described as the principal effect , and which is of such regularity , magnitude , and duration as to suggest comparison with the discharge of an electrical organ .
I designate it as the " retinal blaze " or the " retinal discharge , " and find that the normal retinal discharge in response to an induction current is positive .

After-effects of Condenser Discharges .
Precisely similar after-effects are produced by condenser discharges .
Positiv e oi upward retinal response is provoked in a normal living eyeball by condenser discharges , directed either upwards or downwards .
Polarisation currents of contrary direction to exciting discharges are alone elicited in the case of a dead eyeball , the experiment is most simply realised by connecting electrodes from a condenser with the keyboard of fig. 33 .
The condenser , battery , and Morse key are set up to deliver x 2 DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , discharge alone into the key-board circuit , the plugs of which are manipulated so as to excite the retina with the galvanometer cut out of the circuit , and subsequently complete the circuit of compensator , retina , and galvanometer to witness the retinal discharge that has been provoked by a previous condenser discharge .
The chief case is of course positive retinal current consequent upon positive condenser current .
Previous to each test any current in circuit must be exactly neutralised by compensation , so as to permit the galvanometer to be plugged and unplugged without disturbance .
It is the long duration of retinal response that renders the experiment practicable in this manner ; as nearly as possible I preserved a constant interval of 2 seconds between excitation of the eyeball and unplugging of the galvanometer .
I have taken some measurements on this plan of procedure which , however , by reason of the interval of 2 seconds between excitation and observation , cannot have brought into evidence either a maximal value of response or a minimum value of stimulus .
Nevertheless , such measurements give a preliminary idea of the very considerable duration and magnitude of retinal response .
They have moreover permitted me to recognise on the retina what I had assumed , but not proved , to be the case in the electrical stimulation of nerve.* My assumption was to the effect that energy , not quantity , is the important factor in electrical stimulation .
I have now made the following experiment upon the retina\#151 ; delivering to it two series of stimuli by discharges through the eyeball as first described:\#151 ; ( A ) of arithmetically increasing quantity and energy ; and ( B ) of the same arithmetically increasing quantity , but with geometrically increasing energy .
The first series of stimuli is supplied from a condenser of 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 micro-farads charged at the constant pressure of 1 Leclanche cell .
The second series of stimuli by a condenser of 2 micro-farads charged at the rising scale of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 Leclanches .

A better method of studying the positive effect of induction currents and of condenser discharges is , however , that which I first adopted to demonstrate the unequal polarisation counter-currents of make and break induced currents sent through nerve , # hut which is generally applicable to any case where we desire to bring into evidence the electrical state immediately after a single short electrical stimulus .
The eyeball is placed in the x arm of a Wheatstone bridge .
The balancing resistance , It , is adjusted as if for a measurement of resistance , until the exciting induction shock or condenser discharge gives little or no deflection of the galvanometer .
The adjustment is roughly made with weak currents , and more and more exactly with stronger and stronger currents .
And as the latter are increased , there is no difficulty in distinguishing a small sharp " inequality kick " from a comparatively large and prolonged deflection by a polarisation current or by a retinal discharge .
The varying magnitudes and time-relations of the three kinds of change are such that all three may at certain current-strengths he made apparent .
The inequality kick by the stimulating current is sharp , and can be taken as small as we wish , and in any desired direction , by slight variations in " too much " and " too little " at the balancing resistance .
A considerable advantage of this method is that it permits us to dispense with compensation .
In my first trials of the method I used carbon resistances to form the bridge , for fear of self-induction .
But I find that the Post-Office pattern of bridge answers very well for the purpose , being ( at least in the two instruments I possess ) apparently free from self-induction .
Polarisation counter-currents in a normal living eyeball are masked by the true * A. D. W. , ' Proc. Physiol. Soc. , ' November 12 , 1898 .

retinal current in response to stimulation .
With very strong stimuli , or with progressive death of the eyeball , polarisation currents may make their appearance .
Of the polarisation current and the retinal discharge that may then he provoked by a given stimulus , the former is more evanescent than the latter , and makes its appearance first , so that we may then witness a double deflection\#151 ; a first brief movement contrary to the direction of stimulation , a second prolonged movement in the direction of retinal discharge .
Another advantage of this method is that we are able at the same time to take observations of resistance under various circumstances , and to various forms of current .
Without having systematically examined into this matter , I have incidentally observed that the apparent resistance ( eyeball -f- electrodes ) is higher to a make than to the corresponding break shock , 19300 versus 18000 w ) , and that it is diminished by tetanisation .
The diminution ( .
, 18500 versus 18000 co ) is , however , insufficient to account for the augmented effect of light during and after tetanisation ( vide supra , p. 148 ) .
S 15 .
Effect of Massage .
At an early stage of this investigation , and frequently during its course , I sought to obtain experimental control over the retinal response to light , and especially to find means of unmasking the negative effect which I recognised to he latent in the apparent positive response .
I tried various drugs and reagents without success .
1 tried rise of temperature , and found that a positive response was either abolished permanently , or if temporarily abolished , that it reappeared of similar character .
I tried tetanisation , and found that the positive response was thereby augmented .
Finally , I tried massage , and found in this simple and apparently rough proceeding an unfailing means of effecting the desired change .
A fresh eyeball giving the typical positive response to light , if removed from the electrodes , gently rolled and pressed between the finger and thumb , and replaced upon the electrodes , will give a pure negative effect .
Positive response of the first EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
stage has been abolished ; negative response of the third stage has been established , or rather , unmasked .
The result , as far as I have yet seen , is invariably the same , and on one occasion I carried it out without a failure upon a succession of six fresh eyeballs , the regular effect of massage being a large and gradually diminishing positive current due to disturbance of the retina , with a pure negative variation on exjjosure to light .
If an eyeball be massaged after its normal current has become negative , the latter is Fig. 35 .

The horizontal lines in both these records denote a scale in y y \lt ; jy yths of a volt ; i.e. , the resistance of the eyeball has been much diminished by massage .
greatly diminished or reversed , i.e. , the retina is always aroused in the direction of a positive current by massage as by tetanisation .
The resistance of an eyeball after massage is always much diminished .
Much stress may not be laid upon this diminution of resistance , since the eyeball has been removed from and replaced upon the electrodes .
Nevertheless , the alteration is so marked and unfailing , that it can hardly he an accident of irregular contact .
I regard it as being due to the same cause as the diminution of resistance by tetanisation , viz. , to a dissociation of retinal matter .
It is possible , hut difficult , to massage the eyeball " too much , " and to completely abolish not only the positive , hut also the negative , response .
It is difficult , but possible , to massage the eyeball too little , and to imperfectly convert the positive into a negative response .
It is very easy to convert a positive into a negative by moderately rough manipulation .

Response of the Mammalian Retina .
Holmgren* found the response of the mammalian eyeball ( rabbit , dog , cat ) to be negative at the commencement of illumination , and positive at the end of illumination , whereas in the frog 's eyeball he had found the response to he jDositive at beginning and end of illumination .

EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
in all cases the response is positive on impact and positive on removal .
Kuhne and Steiner^ confirm Holmgren 's statement that the response of the frog 's eye is positive , and of mammalian eyes negative ; but , commenting upon the improbability of any fundamental difference of character in the retinal excitation aroused in the two cases , are of opinion that the simple negative response of a mammalian eye signifies that the organ is moribund .
The few observations I have made upon mammalian eyes ( cat ) quite bear out this view , and at the same time reconcile the apparent discrepancies in the statements quoted above .
I find that the response of a fresh eye ( cat ) , carefully removed from the orbit with least possible compression , is positive , and that this positive response rapidly disappears , and gives way to a negative response that is comparatively prominent and enduring .
The case of the cat 's eye is thus similar to that of the frog , i.e. , the response , at first positive , is at last negative .
The endurance of the mammalian retina is considerably greater than might have been expected , although less than that of a frog 's retina .
Fig. 37 ( 1724 ) gives the series of responses to light , obtained upwards of 9 hours after excision .
The same eyeball exhibited a trace of response ( negative ) 24 hours after excision .
The absolute value of the electromotive force of response is considerably lower on the mammalian eye than on the frog 's eye .
I have not seen it exceed *0001 volt in the former , whereas in the latter I have frequently found it to be above *0010 volt .
I attribute the difference to the greater size of the mammalian eyeball , and consequent shunting of the galvanometer .
IV .
Conclusions .
As regards the facts themselves , the principal conclusions are set forth in the paragraph headings which precede , and which may be recapitulated as follows ; \#151 ; A fresh normal eyeball manifests positive current , which gradually declines to zero , and becomes reversed ( p. 126 ) .
On exposure to light the normal current , whether positive or negative , undergoes a positive variation ( p. 127 ) .
The magnitude of the response to light increases with the duration ot illumination ( p. 129 ) .
The magnitude of the response to light increases with the strength of illumination ( p. 130 ) .
Fatigue\#151 ; i.e. , diminution of response by reason of previous activity\#151 ; is less pronounced in the case of the retina than in that of muscle .
It is manifested in nearly the same degree to stimulation by light , and to stimulation by tetanising currents ( pp. 132 and 151 ) .
VOL. CXCIII.\#151 ; B. * Kuhne and Steiner , ' I. Netzhaut , ' p. 357 , Y DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG'S EYE , Coloured lights act in the same direction , and in accordance with their luminosity .
No electrical evidence is obtained of antagonistic influence ( p. 136 ) .
The response is temporarily abolished at moderately high temperature , and permanently abolished by freezing ( p. 137 ) .
The response is temporarily abolished by anaesthetics ( p. 138 ) .
With lapse of time\#151 ; or immediately in consequence of partial injury , the character of the response to light alters its type .
Three stages are to be recognised in accordance with the state of the retina , as ( a ) fresh ; transitional ; ( c ) stale ( p. 140 ) .
In the first stage the response is positive .
In the second stage the response is mixed .
In the third stage the response is negative .
The interval of time between stimulus and response is much in excess of a physiological latent period .
In the second stage this " period of hesitation " may amount to 5 seconds ( p. 143 ) .
Under the influence of carbonic acid the response to light undergoes diminution or abolition followed by secondary augmentation ( p. 146 ) .
Subsequent to tetanisation in either direction the normal current becomes strongly positive ( or less negative ) .
This positive change gradually subsides ( p. 147 ) .
The positive response to light subsequent to such tetanisation is much augmented ( p. 147 ) .
During tetanisation of moderate strength and of whatever direction the normal current becomes positive ( or less negative ) .
This positive change gradually subsides ( p. 151 ) .
Strong single induction shocks of whatever direction arouse prolonged positive after-effects , that gradually subside ( p. 154 ) .
Single condenser discharges ( 2 to 10 M.F. , 1 to 7 volts ) , of whatever direction , arouse prolonged positive after-effects ( p. 155 ) .
In consequence of gentle massage of the eyeball , the normal current becomes strongly positive ( or less negative ) .
This positive change gradually subsides ( p. 158 ) .
In consequence of gentle massage of the eyeball , the positive response gives place to a negative response ( p. 158 ) .
The response of mammalian ( cat 's ) retina to light is similar in type with that oi frog 's retina\#151 ; viz. , positive at first , subsequently negative ( p. 159 ) .
The positive response to light , the positive effect of tetanisation , and the positive after-effect of condenser discharges are suppressed by anaesthetics ( ether and chloroform ) and by rise of temperature ( to 40-45 ' ) .
The suppression may be permanent or temporary .
An anaesthetised like a dead eyeball tested by single currents manifests only polarisation effects negative in direction to the exciting currents .
Tetanisation then gives only polarisation effect in the direction of the break shocks , negative to the direction of the make shocks .
EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY .
Hi 3 As regards inferences from the facts , and the theoretical signification of the latter , I am very unwilling to commit myself too absolutely to any theoretical conclusions .
I believe it to be proved by these observations that the retina is the seat of a double electrical movement , a simultaneous positive and negative efiect , but whether this double efiect is the expression of duplex change in one substance , or of two changes in two different components , cannot be strictly demonstrated , and must remain matter of opinion .
I am of the opinion that we have to do with a duplex change , constructive and disruptive , in one substance .
The further question as to the correspondence of the two hypothetical movements with the two obvious electrical movements appears to me to be an open question .
Kuhne and Steiner , without committing themselves very absolutely , indicate as their opinion that a positive electrical effect is the token of regeneration , and a negative electrical efiect the token of decomposition .
I have no serious objection to this view , nevertheless I hesitate to adopt it , by reason of the effects of carbon dioxide and of tetanisation upon the electrical signs .
These , as far as I have yet seen , are in the sense of an analogy between positive variations in retina with negative variations in nerve , and between negative effects in retina with positive effects in nerve .
Positive and negative are , however , purely relative and conventional qualifications , of no essential significance .
