371 coloured the liquid , it was submitted to distillation .
Only a small portion came over below 40 ' ; the thermometer rose rapidly to 180 ' , and nearly the whole of the bromine-compound distilled at 184 ' to 188 ' .
This substance is amylene bromide , C5 H10 Br2 ; Wurtz gives the boiling-point of this body at about 180 ' .
The portion therefore boiling at 35 ' is mainly amylene .
Exactly similar results were obtained from the portion boiling at 65 ' to 70 ' .
This , from its boiling-point , may be either C6 H12 or C6 H14 , or a mixture of both .
Bromine disappears instantly on adding it to the carefully cooled liquid , and on distillation by far the greater portion is found to have combined with the halogen .
The bromide thus obtained distils with slight decomposition about 195 ' .
Pelouze and Cahours found that hexylene bromide , C6 H12Br2 , boiled at 192 ' to 198 ' .
We are at present engaged in the further investigation of this subject , and hope shortly to lay our results before the Royal Society .

Communicated by Professor Roscoe P.R.S. Received February 6 , 1871 .
It has been shown by the late Dr. A. Matthiessen , in conjunction with the writer * , that when codeia is heated with a large excess of strong hydrochloric acid the following reactions successively take place :\#151 ; Codeia .

It appeared of interest to examine the action of hydrobromic acid under similar circumstances , and for this purpose Messrs. Macfarlane , of Edinburgh , with their wonted liberality , put a considerable quantity of pure codeia at the writer 's disposal .
The aqueous hydrobromic acid employed was obtained by the action of II2 S on Br in presence of water , and subsequent rectification over pulverised KBr ; it was free from S04 H2 and other sulphur compounds , had a sp. gr. of about 1*5 , and contained about 48 per cent , of H Br .
When codeia is heated with from three to six times its weight of this acid , either on a water-bath or to gentle ebullition over a flame , the liquid , which at first produces no precipitate with solution of carbonate of soda , gradually darkens in colour , and acquires the property of yielding a dense white precipitate with this reagent .

Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the [ Mar. 9 , bromide is evolved daring the first stages of this change , but subsequently this body is produced in some little quantity .
The precipitate thrown down by carbonate of soda before this further change ensues , appears to consist of a variable mixture of at least three substances , two of which are readily soluble in ether , while the third is but sparingly soluble in that menstruum ; all are bases , the one insoluble in ether , and one of those soluble containing bromine : the one apparently first formed is produced by a reaction precisely analogous to that whereby chloro-codide is generated , viz.\#151 ; Codeia .
Bromocodide .

and is therefore termed bromocodide ; this base appears to be acted on further with great ease , giving rise ultimately to the other two , the first of which has the constitution of codeia less one equivalent of oxygen , or C H21 N02 , and is therefore provisionally named Deoxycodeia ; whilst the second has the composition of four molecules of codeia coalesced together , one of the 84 H atoms in the product being replaced by Br ; it is therefore provisionally termed Bromotetracodeia , the simplest mode of representing the simultaneous formation of these two bases being as follows:\#151 ; Bromocodide .

Deoxycodeia .
Bromotetracodeia .
C18 H20 Br N02 + 4C18 H21 N03=C18 H21 N02+C72 H83 Br Nd 012 .
Owing to the ease with which bromocodide is altered , it is a matter of some difficulty to obtain it in even an approximately pure condition , as the complete separation of deoxycodeia appears impracticable when this base has once been produced .
The product of the action of three parts 48 per cent , acid on one part codeia on the water-bath for from one to two hours is precipitated by excess of sodium carbonate and the precipitate collected on filters ; unaltered codeia is for the most part separated thus , being contained in the filtrate .
Extraction of the mass with ether and agitation of the ethereal solution with HBr furnishes crude bromocodide hydrobromate , which may be purified by a repetition of the process , fractional precipitation being resorted to to get rid of traces of colouring-matters : the purified hydrobromate thus obtained was a viscid colourless liquid which utterly refused to crystallize , and dried up to a gum-like mass over S04 H2 .
Dried at 100 ' , the powdered gum gave these numbers *:\#151 ; 0*3500 grm. gave 0*6340 C02 and 0'1580 H20 .
0*230 grm , boiled with N03II and AgN03 gave 0*1900 AgBr .

443 100*00 The slight excess of carbon and deficiency in bromine thus found are doubtless due to the presence of a little deoxycodeia , the hydrobromate of which requires 59*34 per cent , carbon and 21*98 per cent. Br .
Another specimen of bromocodide hydrobromate , prepared as above from the product of three hours ' digestion at 100 ' of one part codeia and three parts 48 per cent. HBr , yielded numbers indicating 51*6 per cent , carbon , 5*3 and 33*4 per cent. Br ; whilst a repetition of the purification process scarcely altered the numbers .
Owing to the great difficulty in preparing the pure salt in quantity , no attempt to isolate and analyze the base itself was made , the more so that the precipitate thrown down by carbonate of soda from the pure hydrobromate appeared to tally in every respect with the chlorocodide formerly examined ; their qualitative reactions , too , are identical .
The crude bromocodide hydrobromate obtained after five or six hours ' digestion of codeia with from three to five times its weight of 48 per cent. HBr deposited , on standing for some days , crystals not readily soluble in cold water ; recrystallized several times from boiling water , minute snow-white crystals were ultimately obtained ; these slightly darkened on drying over S04 H2 , and more so at 100 ' and gave the following numbers on analysis :\#151 ; .

21*59 CI9 H21N02 HBr Dr. C. R. A. Wright on the [ Mar. 9 , The yield of this base from the codeia used being but small ( about 4 per cent. ) , no attempt was made to isolate the base itself ; carbonate of soda throws down from the hydrobromate solution a white precipitate which is soluble in alcohol , ether , benzol , and chloroform ; by exposure to air it rapidly becomes coloured , and finally acquires a very dark green tint .
Its qualitative reactions are identical with those of apomorphia ; the colour-reactions of the two with Fe2Cl6 , N03 H , and S04 H2+K2 Cr207 being indistinguishable when examined side by side .
Its physiological effects , however , are different ; three-tenths of a grain of the hydrobromate administered by the mouth to a dog producing no appreciable effect , whilst a much less dose of apomorphia produces speedy vomiting .
The third base is conveniently obtained , as hydrobromate , by treating codeia with three times its weight of 48 per cent. H Br for two hours on the water-bath , precipitating the product ( diluted with water ) by excess of carbonate of soda , collecting on filters , and well draining from the mother-liquors , and finally extracting with ether until scarcely anything more is taken up ; care must be taken to have as little watery fluid as possible present , otherwise the insoluble substance forms a sort of lather , on agitation from which the ether will not separate .
The insoluble substance is then dissolved in the least possible quantity of weak hydrobromic acid and fractionally precipitated by cautious addition of stronger acid ; the second precipitate is dissolved up in water , in which it is readily soluble , and a few drops of carbonate-of-soda solution added .
The filtrate from this yields , with strong H Br , nearly white flakes , which are wholly void of crystalline character under the microscope .
These remain solid at 100 ' if previously completely dried over S04 H2 ; but if warmed while moist , become a more or less coloured tar .
Dried at 100 ' , the following numbers were obtained : \#151 ; 0'3440 grm. gave 0*6810 C02and 0'1740 II20 .

336 ' 23*67 072H83BrN4O12+O9 1419 100*00 It hence appears that the free base rapidly absorbs oxygen .
In confirmation of this , 0*11 grm. of the hydrobromate treated with caustic potash and injected by a pipette into 15 cubic centims. of air over mercury absorbed 0*9 cubic centim. in the .
course of an hour , or 6 per cent , of the total volume of the air ; the salts , however , when dry , may be kept without alteration , and only slowly darken by exposure to air when moist .
This welding together of four molecules is not wholly without parallel in the history of the opium alkaloids ; and their derivatives thus opianic acid heated * furnishes a body containing four times as much carbon as the original acid ; thus 4C,0 H,0 0 , =H , O+C,0 H " 0 " .
The qualitative reactions of bromotetracodeia appear to be identical with those of bromo- and chlorocodide .
The base itself , when freshly precipi-pitated , is slightly soluble in water , being thrown down again by addition of strong brine ; in ether and benzol it is almost insoluble , and in alcohol but sparingly soluble .
When crude bromotetracodeia , got by extraction with ether of the mixture of bases thrown down by carbonate of soda , is dissolved in weak hydrochloric acid , and precipitated twice or thrice by excess of stronger acid , nearly white flakes are ultimately obtained , resembling in all their physical properties the bromohydrobromate of tetracodeia .
These flakes , however , contain no bromine , the absence of this element being ascertained by the negative results obtained on examining with chlorine-water and ether the acidified solutions of the lime-salts got by combustion with quicklime , and of the sodium-salts got by boiling with N03 H and AgNOa , and fusing with carbonate of soda the silver-salts thus got .
Dried over S04 H2 and finally at 100 ' , this body gave numbers indicating a base of constitution * Matthiessen and Wright , Proc. Roy .
