Observations of the [ Sept. 27 , The ( fig. 1 ) shows the chief parts of ) apparatus and their relations to one another .
The ice is shown in section , with the tripod and apparatus erected on it .
A weight , consisting of a box filled with stones , rests on the sea bottom .
A piece of iron tubing is let through the ice vertically and fastened .
It is filled with paraffin oil , the object of which is to prevent the wire frozen in , an idea used with success by the fficers of the " " Discoverv.\ldquo ; A wire is taken from the weight on the sea bottom , passed through the oil-filled iron tube , over the pulley , and fixed to the end of the baml ) ] ever E , where it is kept FIG. 1 .

The long lever works on a spindle at , and its short end I is connected by a cross-piece with the pen of the barograph .
The details of this part are too small to be shown in this diagram , and will be illustrated in another figure .
From this diagram there are omitted several parts , such as the guides which prevent the long lever from .
during a blizzard , which are not essential to the understanding of the instrument .
The barograph was of necessity covered by a box to keep out the snow .
The lever entered through a slit in the end of the box , and an ement of canvas kept the snow out .
The box containing I 1910 .
] British Expedition , 190 the barograph was raised on a little mound of snow , in order to the lever equal play above and below , or in other words , to allow of the mean seillevel recorded about half-way up the drum .
Of course the mean level had to be asceltained by a little observation .
The second is plan on a ' scale of the part of the apparatus .
The circle A is the drum of the raph ; is the pen making the tracing on the is the axle on which the lever bearing the pen works .
This is continued beyond the axle to a distance rather greater than that of the part bearing the pen .
This end of the level is made much heavier than the other .
The bamboo lcver , of which only a small is shown , is borne on axle , which is in line with the axle in the of course quite unconnected ith it , outside the glass box of the .
Attached to the end of the bamboo is a stout wire , bent round so that it passes under the eud 1 ) of the pen lever , which rests upon it by its own weight , rises and falls with it , but , being quite free fronn it , is 1lot affected by any vibration of the ) under the influence of the wind .
The bnrograph pen has , of course , been uncoupled from the aneroid capsules , which are not indicated in the plan .
Dr. Mackay , with much assistance from Prof. David , had the set up , all but the part , by June .
In order to utilise the facilities we now had for noting the changes of level , the recording instrument to be finished , ) devised a simple arrangement for the amount of the tide .
It was simply inclined plane on which a paper marked with lines an inch apart pinned .
On this there slid a heavy block of wood which was ched to the end of the wire over the pnlley .
A lead pencil inserted a hole in the block of wood , which was kept in position by two uides .

Observations of the [ Sept. 27 , This erement is shown in fig. 3 , which is drawn in perspective .
The pulley A is suspended from the tripod , B. The wire is attached to the wood block , which slides on the inclined board between the guides , F. The pbncil is fixed so as to project a little below the block of wood ; .
is the line traced by the pencil .
This simple device was not intended to give anything but a straight line but it was hoped by frequent inspections to ascertain tlJe turn of the-tide , and Dr. Mackay kept one night , and the gauge at intervals of about an hour .
to a general slackness of the parts of the instrument the line traced was not a straight line , but a zigzag one , which proved of much greater interest .
The pencil in descending did not follow the same course as it made going up , but swerved a little , and thus we the first indications of what we believe to be seiches , at any rate of regular oscillations of much shorter intervals than those of the tides .
The tracing obtained thus accidentally was too vague to enable us to count with certainty the number of periods per hour , but at any rate it demonstrated oscillations of a period of a few minutes and an amplitude of a few inches .
A number of records were taken in this rough manner till July 3 , when the wire was found to be broken .
A new situation was then selected for the tide-gauge , nearer the house , about 100 yards from shore , where the depth was 13 fathoms .
The ice being now of considerable thicknes@ , it was with no little labour that Dr. Mackay , with the help of Mr. Marston , got a new hole made to put the weight down .

By July the completed at the place , this tinle with the attachnlent .
A preliminary record got from July to 11 , the instrument then stopped for readjustment .
On July 14 it was stat led , and ran ithout mishap till nearly the end of Octol ) Prof. David usually the papers eekly .
It was impossible to do this in the field , as it required bare The raph 1 therefore disconnected and carried to the house , where a new paper ) put on and ink put in the pen .
The whole did not take more than half an hour .
The scale on which the curve traced was about one-nineteenth of end of the lever feet and the short end inches .
The alue of the factor of reduction of amplitude has therefore been taken to be 7/ 132 or One of the first for a complete week was analysed .
The curve appeared a simple one with maximum , but a slight of the minima indicated that other elements were present .

This have been because the free edge of the crack not room to sink to the full exteJlt of the but on botton ] , and the ice then to the level part .
Towards the end of Octobcl the tripod down dtll i a and the wire was snapped .
The ice was by this ti1ne so thick that it was found iolpraccicable to cut another hole to put a weight ( so the observations were discontinued .

sufficiently small to permit us safely to the correction in strictness required for the conversion of arcs to chords , and the arcs have been accepted as giving the changes of water level with sufficient accuracy , The tidal record extended from July 14 to October , 1908 , but the sheet which bore the record from October 12 to 18 is missing , and the record actually treated ends with October 11 .
It was possible by means of a few interpolations to obtain an unbroken record from .
astronomical time of July 14 to 23 .
of October 11 .
About an hour was generally lost once a week , while the paper was being changed : but it was always easy to complete the curve over this short interval by a pencil line , and this was regarded as equivalent to the actual curve .
On September 13 the pen failed to mark , but the curves on the 12th and 14th were unusually regular in character , so that a good interpolation the 13th was easily obtained .

and 23 The errors of the clock do not seem to have been great to demand attention , and in fact , they are not always noted on the rams .
The clock was kept to apparent time , and was reset as the equation of tinle changed sensibly .
the scheme of reduction assumes that mean time has been used .
This error may be taken into account with sufficient by certain changes in the true longitude of the place of observation , which was E. The observations were broken into three groups of a month each , for which the epochs were : ( 1 ) , July 14 ; ( 2 ) , August 13 ; ( 3 ) , September12 , To allow for the equation of time the longitude for the first month was taken as 6 .
of time or 1o 30 ' further east than in reality ; in the second month the longitude was arded as correct , and in the third it was shifted 10 to the west .
The correction for the last month is less satisfactory than for the other two , because at that time of year the equation of time is rapidly , and differs considerably at the beginning and end of the month .
The unit adopted the height was 1/ 10 of an inch of the scale on the drum .
Since 1 inch on the drum corresponds to inches of water , the heights as derived from the harmonic analysis of the readings were converted to inches on multiplication by 1910 .
] , 1907 .
For the tides the observations were also as apperGainingl to a period of three months , without regard to the equation of time ; a similar treatment was also extended to the tides , K2 , , and as will be explained more fully hereafter .
The reductions were made , under my supelvision , by .
F. Finch with apparatu in the first instance the three months were discussed independently .
The semidiurnal tides were derived from months of 30 days , and the diurnal tides from months of 27 days .
In this treatment it is necessary to assume that the phase of the tide is the same as that of and that the amplitude of K2 is 3/ 11ths of that of .
Similarly , we must assume identity of phases for and , and that the amplitude of is of that of The following are the results:\mdash ; July 1Sept .

30- In these results there appears to be some evidence of a the season advances , such as was noted in case of the ionS made by the " " Discovery\ldquo ; in , and I shall retul'n later to subject .
But in the case of the tides , this easily arise from an erroneous assumption as to the heights and phases of and relatively to those of and respectively .
It is therefore advisablo to discuss these tides without making the assuml ) tions which necessary when each month is treated independently of the others .

On solving the dinrnal group of equations by least I find inches , inch , .
The ratio of to is , instead of the 3 assumed from theoretical considerations in the separate treatment of the months , but the phases are virtually identical .
The similar treatment of the semi-diurnal group gives inch , inch , The ratio of to is , instead of , as assumed from theory .
It thus appears that the theoretical hypotheses considerably in and results probably more in accordance with the truth will be obtained from the several months if we assume With these assumptions the three months now give\mdash ; 2 .

\mdash ; \mdash ; The appearance of ressive s change in this of tides has now almost disappeared , although the nlonth is slightly discordant from the other } It is interesting to note that , in the result of the treatment by least squares , ( for ) is practically identical with ( for P ) , but ) there considerable between and ( for ) .
The difference between the phase of hich we may tnke as by and that of riven by is very their difference of speeds is not reat .
Itence we should expect that a small difference of speed in a tide old 1 sensible erence in phase .
If phase varies sinlply as difference of speed , shall have the results : Speed of speed of per hour ; ) ) Speed of speed of per Sir G. Darwin .
Tidal Observations of the [ Sept. 27 , Hence we ought to find , As a fact , we find , and thus the direction of the diffel.ence of phases is such as was to be expected , although the amount is not satisfactory .
With tides of such small amplitude , however , and with only three months on which to rely , the amount of agreement is all that is to be expected .
The results of the analysis for the tides M2 and , when the months are taken independently , are above .
If , however , we neglect the equation of time , the whole period of three months may be treated as a single group of observations .
In this way I obtain for inches , If we take the three values of each of the quantities from our previous results , and form means of these functions , we obtain inches , The latter method has the that it takes the equation of time into account ; the former is somewhat more likely to eliminate casual inequalities .
We may safely .
take ) inches , , as very near the truth .
Similarly the whole series when treated for the tide gives inches , But the means of the three values of , give the somewhat discordant esult inches , I should have expected the two uations to be closer together , as was case with , and I think we must accept inches , as as nearly accurate as is possible from our data .
In the reduction of the ' Discovery\ldquo ; obsel.vations it was known that there had frequently been a small change of the zero point in consequence of the shift the ship , and I did not think it was worth while to attempt 1910 .

to combine the several nlonths by least squares so as to separate the tides , from K2 , and from P. I llow think that it was a pity that the attempt was not made to separate them , and therefore I have bnck to the old work and discussed the numbers by least squares with the results iven below .
In the course of this revision it appeared that there had been a small mistake in the value assigned to for each month , which , however , made little change in the values vned to the tide , and did nothing to remove the considerable discrepancies between the results from each of the 12 months .

In discussing the : \ldquo ; tides , I was led to suspect that thele semi-diurnal lines to the northward , but that the node for nearer than ) .
The fall in the amplitutlo of anrl possibly the amplitude has to increase previously to its decrease to the zero value at node .
The ratio of to for " " Nimrod\ldquo ; is , and for ) " " the former value is more nearly normal thau the latter .

) oj the [ Sept. 27 , The sums of the of , are respectively inches for Nimrod\ldquo ; and for " " Discovery The smns for are inches for : ' Nimrod\ldquo ; and inches for Discovery Thus for " " Nimrod\ldquo ; the greatest diurnal tides are times as great as the greatest semi-diurnal tides , while for " " Discovery\ldquo ; the greatest diurnal tides are times as as the reatest semi-diurnal tides .
This emphasises the importance of the semi-diurnal tides as we penetrate to the south .
It should be remarked that the difference of phase of from that of in the new reduction for " " Discovery\ldquo ; is not in accordance with the theoretieal considerations adduced in support of the corresponding difference for " " Nimrod However , too much stress should not be placed on results crived from these very small tidal oscillations .
On the whole , I conclude that we now know the tidal constants at this part the Antarctic Ocean with as much accuracy as is desirable , and I reler the reader to the discussion the " " Discovery\ldquo ; observations for the conclusions which may be drawn from the values found .
In discussing the " " DiscoveT)\ldquo ; obseryations , I saw reason to suspect a lemarkable seasonal , in the amplitude and phase of the tide ; it is therefore to see whether these new observations tend to confirm conclusion .
The results in my previous aper were discussed by means of curves , but I will now merely examine the matter numerically .
The results for each month which has been reduced , , 12 fcr Discovery\ldquo ; and 3 for Nimrod may be held to appertain to the middle ( of the month under consideration , that is to say 15 days after the correepoch .

Such changes are not , ever , large , when we consider that the range from high to low water is only about 5 inches .

Observations of the [ Sept. 27 , : each paper and the next .
of daily mean sea-levels was accordingly plotted , as on a reduced scale in the firm line of fig. 4 .
I was surprised to see a somewhat regular rise and fall of the water with a period of about three days , for nearly five weeks on end .
Although the rise and fall was interrupted , this seemed to be a fact worth looking into .
A line drawn so as to bisect the zigzags clearly undergoes changes considerable amount , for which it is only possible to guess the causes .
Distant barometric and distant gales may be responsible for most of the effect .
There are also probably annual and semi-annual meteorological tides , fortnightly and monthly astronomical tides , and some small inequality with a period of a fortnight due to the residual effects of the tides of short period .
But these obviously could not produce the shorter zigzags , so that we may consider these as being embroidered , to use M. Forel 's phrase , on a slowly variable curve .
Local barometric must affect the mean sea-level , and pressure lbove the mean will correspond with depressed sea-level , at the rate of about inches of water to one of mercury , and .
Mr. James Murray has given me the mean barometric heights both in a tabular and in a graphical form .
The means of pressure are given in civil t.ime , while those of sea-level were computed according to astronomical time .
I therefore made a estimate from the curve of the mean pressure according to the latter time .
The mean pressure for the 90 days of observation was then found , and a correction was applied to the sea-levels at the rate of 14 inches of water to one of mercury above or below the estimated mean .
A rather high value for ths correction is taken , because it seemed desirable to give the barometric changes every possible chance of mnulling the sea changes ; and further , because , by the use of the factor 19 ( instead of ) , the zigzags had been very slightly gerated .
In any case , the correction is quite exact enough for such a rough allowance for barometric pressure as is possible .
The corrected mean sea-levels are shown in the dotted curve of fig. It will be seen that the zigzags are ensibly diminished , but not annulled , that in one or two places a new maximum or minimum has been introduced .
We may conjecture that distant barometric changes and distant ales n have annulled some maxima and minima which vould otherwise have been visible .
For servations of this uncertain kind mathematical treatment for the detection of partially veiled periodicity seems inappropriate .
I have therefore only examined zigzag for maxima and minima and have noted these incidences in the following table .

Taking both estinlates as of equal we a mean interval of days , or allowing for possible masked nlaxima or minima , as explained nbove , of days .
I think then that there is some evidence of the existence of an oscillation with period of about three days .
In a paper in the 'Philosophical azine ' Tanuary , , lIessrs .
Honda , Terada , and Isitani discuss " " of Oceanic Tides\ldquo ; or sea-seiches .
These seiches occur in , and they find that the pel.iod depends on the size and depth of the bay .
In some bays the period is fairly constant , but in others it changes " " continuously and through certain They that for a bay of and depth the main period is iven by the , where is ravity .
The period as so computed is snbject to a correction due to the opening into the sea , but only now want a very estimate of the period , correction be ected .
The formula is the sam as that for the period of the unin odal seiche in a lake of length .
The authors in fact regard the cnd of the as lesenlbling the end of a lake , while the seaward is equivalent to the middle of the lake .
Accordingly the second half of the lake , whichvould stretch out into the sea , is suppressed .
The formuhx gives results in accordance with the seiches observed in many } ) anese bays , and they remal'k that bays are sometimes disturbed by seiches of shorter pel.iod , which they transverse seiches from side to side of the bay , just if it an enclosed basin .
In none of the exalnples given by these authors has the seiche a period at all comparable with of which we have reason to suspect the existence in the Antarctic Sea , that aft'ords no reason for to apply the theory to such prolonged oscillations .
In most inland .
lakes the seiches.have periods of 10 minutes to one or two hours , yet in Lake Erie the seiche is found to have a period of hours , while in the Lakes of A 20 Sir G. Darwin .
Tidal Observations of the * and Huron conjointly a seiche of 45 hours is suspected .
* Thus we have justification the application of the th eory to oscillations of very long period .
In the case of the Antarctic Sea , if there is a great bay running far back into the Antarctic continent behind the ice barrier , its length and depth are quite unknown .
Hence there are elements of great uncertainty in the application of the theory .
It seems likely , at any rate , that the bay extends for a considerable distance , and speculations have even been made as to whether there may not be an arm of the sea to the Weddell Sea almost dialnetrically a whakwas supposed to be a continent .
It , perhaps , be thought that the thick ice of the barrier would serve to damp out cillations of sea-level ; but , unless , indeed , the sea is solid to the bottom , I conceive that the ice would behave like an elastic skin , ind would hardly exercise any damping effect on oscillations with a period of more than an hour or two .
It seems almost impossible that the remarkable changes of sea-level which are obseryed should arise from errors of observation , and if they exist at Backdoor , the sea the barrier must necessarily also partake of the motion .
If the sea rises and falls .
the barrier itself , must moye with it ; and it may be suspected that it is subject to a true tidal lise and fall .
If we accept the existence of a sea-seiche with a period of three days , the formula gives indication as to the length and ) of the bay behind the barrier .
We cannot assume the sea to be very shallow , because if it were so it would ineyitably be frozen solid to the bottom .
Moreover , shallow sea would certainly be broken up by shoals , so that it could not oscillate as a single ystem .
A little consideration shows that to produce a seiche of three days the bay must be of enormous length , and for the reasons assigned it would be useless to assume it to be very shallow .
The few soundings near the barrier give depths of between 200 and 300 fathoms , and perhaps a somewhat smaller depth might suffice to allow of the required seiche .
I propose to guess the length of the bay and to find what depth of sea is required to produce a seiche of three-day period .
I guess then that the bay behind the barrier stretches past the South Pole and a little to the east of it as far as latitude .
Such an inlet would have a length of to of latitude .
It seems likely that if it is really an arul of the sea th.ough to Weddell 's Sea , with a constriction about the place where we place the end of the bay , the seiche would be much the same .

Thus a sea of from].00 to l50 fathoms in such an immense bay as has been conjectured would oscillate a pel'iod of three , and ) obssl'ved results are seen to be consistent with the existence of a deep inlet , almost or quite cutting the Antarctic continent in two .
Such a conclusion is interesting , but it would llot be to attribute to it a of probability , because there are elements of uncertainty on every side .
In view of the interest of our result it has seemed well to reverG to the observations made by Captain Scott 's expedition , notwithstanding the known uncertainty in the zero of the .
I therefore examined days of the " " \ldquo ; record , , 113 days of 1902 and 62 days of 1903 .
correction has been applied for barometic pressure , and thus periodic inequalities have doubtless sometimes been masked by contem } ) oraneous changes of pressure , and by the shift of zero .
I should expect to find rather a ) ortion of long intervals between consecutive maxima and minima than in the imrod \ldquo ; results as reduced for pressure .
I found , in fact , on analysing the in the way already plained th amongst the periods as deduced from maxima , there were : 2 of , lof , 10 of 5 , lof and amongst the periods , as deduced from minima , there were\mdash ; lof , lof 5 , lof Taking maxima and minima together there were 83 periods to 323 days , thus giving a mean period of days .
But if we postulate that periods from 7 days to days were leally double periods with masked maxima or minima , and that the LXXXIV.\mdash ; A. 2 Observations of the British 9-day period is really triple , we get 105 periods for 323 days , with a mean of days .
These results are generally confirmatory of the preceding ones , but seem to indicate a slightly longer period .
In this rough examination there is undoubtedly a danger of finding a false periodicity under the influence of unconscious bias .
I thought it advisable therefore to examine other tidal records , for it } be possible to perceive periodicity even in cases where there was but small likelihood of its real existence .
Colonel Burrard then kindly sent me tables of daily mean sea-levels for the year 1880 from May 1 to June 30 and from October 1 to ember 3 for Aden , Karachi , Madras and Port Blair , Andaman Islands .
These old observations were chosen because it had been usual at that time to have each daily mean " " cleared\ldquo ; of the residual effects of the tides of short period , and thus one slight source of error was obviated .
I also oceeded in the case of Aden to deduct the tides of long period , but as this correction clearly made no difference in the kind of inequality I was looking for , I did not carry out that laborious task in the other cases .
The tabulated numbers were then plotted out in a number of curves .
An inative investigator possibly fancy he could detect signs of periodicity with a period of two or three days at Aden and at Port Blair , but as the range from crest to hollow was not more than inch , it seems safer to say that no periodicity could be traced .
In the curve for Madras there are considerable , but it seemed impossible even to imagine any periodicity .
At Karachi there does seem to bc an inequality with a period of two to three days and a of two or three inches .
A succession of waves with three to five crests one after the other is observable at several parts of the curve .
It seems quite likely that sea-seiches may exist in the Indian Ocean , and Karachi would be well placed for observing them .
These Indian results were not corrected for barometric pressure , and it may be worth while hereafter to submit them to a more systematic examination .
For the present , however , I am satisfied with the c , onclusion that periodicity is not to be seen in all cases , and that the oscillations of mean sea-level in the Antarctic Sea are many times as great as those in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal .
Thus it seems unlikely that imagination is responsible for the existence of the Antarctic sea-seiches , and we may ope that the investigations of Captain Scott 's second expedition will throw some further light on the subject , and possibly also on the existence of a deep bay behind the barrier .
