Object and Method of the Experiments .
In a former paper* an account was given of the way in which the photoelectric activity of zinc diminishes when the metal is exposed to light from a Nernst lamp .
It was shown that the photo-electric activity at a time t from the commencement of an experiment could be expressed by the formula I = Kic-A\gt ; J + K2\#171 ; -A2i .
In a typical experiment with a polished zinc plate the first exponential term fell to half value in 4*9 minutes , the second in 94 minutes , the constants of change being \\ \#151 ; 0*141 and \2 = 0*00737 ; Ki and K2 were of the same order of magnitude .
In an experiment with amalgated zinc the first term fell to half value in 4*2 minutes , corresponding to \i = 0*164 , while the second , term fell to half value in 167 minutes , corresponding to X2 = 0*00414 ; the value of Ki was about six times K2 .
The experiments described in the present paper were carried out to determine whether the results were similar when using a source of light giving far more ultra-violet radiation than the Nernst lamp .
A mercury-vapour lamp of fused quartz by W. C. Heraeus , supplied with current by a battery of 50 accumulators , was employed.f Photometric measurements with lamps of this kind have been made by R. Kuch and T. Retschinsky in the laboratory of the makers .

[ December 23.\#151 ; Dr. T. M. Lowry has kindly photographed the spectrum of my lamp , using lenses and prism of quartz .
With a short exposure a well-marked line spectrum was obtained , extending to about 2400 A.U. ] The emission in considerable quantity of waves of still shorter wavelength is shown by the production of large amounts of ozone , rendering it necessary to place the lamp outside the room in which work is being carried on .
Lenard5)- has shown that the ozonising action is due to very short waves , having a wave-length less than 2000 A.U. Regener^ : has shown that there is also a deozonising action for certain waves , whose wavelength falls between 3000 A.U. ( absorption by glass ) and 1850 A.U. ( absorption by quartz ) .
As regards the radiation from the Nernst lamp , I am informed by Mr. W. A. Scoble , who has photographed the spectrum , that in no case was any effect produced beyond wave-length 2100 A.U. , and the results were comparatively faint from at least 2500 A.U. By far the greatest photographic effect was obtained in the visible violet and blue .
The method of experimenting was similar to that described in the previous paper , but the testing cell , consisting of the zinc plate and a positively charged sheet of wire gauze , was in the open air instead of being-enclosed in a brass case .
An electrometer of the Dolezalek type , giving about 500 divisions per volt , was used to measure the leak across the gap between the gauze and the zinc plate .
As the leak in some of these experiments was much larger than in those made with the Nernst lamp as a source of light , a parallel plate air condenser of adjustable capacity was constructed and connected with the electrometer so as to secure a convenient rate of deflexion of the needle .
The capacity of the electrometer and its connections was about 100 electrostatic units ; by means of the condenser the capacity of the system could be increased up to about 1000 units .
The mercury lamp was started 20 minutes before the commencement of a series of observations , so that it might have time to assume a steady state .
Readings of the current and voltage for the lamp were taken at intervals during the experiments , but the variations observed were inconsiderable .
( See , however , S 4 .
) Observations of the rate of leak were commenced one minute after the preparation of the plate and were continued at intervals of two minutes .

Results of Experiments with Polished Zinc .
The experiments with polished zinc showed that the fatigue took place in exactly the same manner when the plate was illuminated by the mercury vapour lamp as when a Nernst lamp was used as a source of light .
A typical experiment is represented by the lower curve in fig. 1 , which is plotted on semi-logarithmic paper .
The curve can be represented by the sum of two exponential terms , the first term* falling to half value in eight 10 20 50 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Time in Minutes .

] division per second corresponded to 0'20 x 10~12 ampere , so that if the .
current is in amperes , Ki = 6 x 10"12 ampere , K2 = 8 x 10"12 ampere .
The current is about twice as large as that in the experiment of August 7 , 1905 , described in the former paper .
The greater activity of the mercury vapour lamp as compared with the Nernst lamp is nearly compensated for by the increased distance ( 120 cm .
) from the source of light .
In another experiment the zinc plate was only 63 cm .
from the mercury lamp .
In this case the fatigue was slightly more rapid , the first exponential term falling to half value in 6*8 minutes , the second in 76 minutes .
In scale divisions per second Ki = 26 and K2 = 47 , but as a capacity of about 400 electrostatic units was employed with the electrometer , the current was much greater than in the former experiment , Ki = 26 x 10"12 ampere , K2 = 47 x 10"12 ampere .

Results of Experiments Amalgamated Zinc .
A typical fatigue curve for amalgamated zinc is shown in the diagram .
It is seen at once that this is similar in character to the curve for the polished metal .
In the present case we find that the first term falls to half value in 3'2 minutes , the second in 96 minutes , giving \\ \#151 ; 0'217 and X2 = 0'00722 .
The value of Ki is 47 x 10"12 ampere , and of K2 is 57 x 10"12 ampere .
Comparing these results with those obtained previously , when a Nernst lamp was employed instead of the mercury lamp , we notice that the second term changes a good deal more rapidly in this case , and that Ki and K2 are now of the same order of magnitude .
The slower rate of fatigue with the Nernst lamp may , perhaps , be attributed to the action of the waves of greater wave-length , described in the former paper .
This suggestion receives support from experiments made with the plate illuminated by the two sources of light at the same time .
In these the fatigue took place more slowly than with the mercury lamp alone .

Minor Variations in the Observations .
A close examination of the original curves here reproduced suggests the presence of small undulations superposed on the smooth exponential curves .
These variations have a period of about 10 minutes .
Similar periodic changes in the rate of decay were observed in curves obtained when using a Nernst lamp as the source of light ( see figs. 3 and 4 of the former paper ) .
It does not appear probable that the fatigue really proceeds through a series of small maximum and minimum values , though such periodic changes are not unknown .
Eor example , Ostwald has shown that the change involved in the VOL. LXXXII.\#151 ; A. N The Photo-electric Fatigue of Zinc .
solution of certain varieties of chromium in dilute hydrochloric and sulphuric acids is oscillatory in character.* The explanation of the small variations observed in my experiments is probably to be found in the character of the source of light .
In both theNernst lamp and the mercury vapour lamp we may suppose that continual adjustment is taking place as regards the resistance and the potential difference between the terminals , causing a more or less regular fluctuation in the intensity of the emitted light .

Conclusion .
The photo-electric activity of a zinc plate decays in such a way that it can be represented as the sum of two exponential ternls .
The constants of change are but little altered by considerable variations in the character and intensity of the illumination employed , though the value of the photo-electric current is changed considerably .
The rate at which the surface is altered is not greatly affected by using a mercury vapour lamp in place of a ISTernst lamp .
Experiments with other metals are still in progress .
In conclusion , I wish to express my thanks to Prof. H. A. Wilson for advice during the course of the work .
