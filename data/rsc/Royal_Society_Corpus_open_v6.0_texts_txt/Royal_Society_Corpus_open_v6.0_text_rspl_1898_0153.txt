Major Ronald Ross , I.M.S. , after demonstrating and explaining to me his method of dissecting the mosquito , showed me in prepared specimens the pigmented bodies met with in the stomach walls of mosquitoes fed on birds infected with Proteosoma , and also the changes which these bodies undergo day by day .
Finally he demonstrated to me the " germinal threads " in cysts in the stomach wall , in the fluids of the body , and in the cells of the veneno-salivary glands .

On my arrival there were in the laboratory , in test-tubes , several series of mosquitoes which had fed on birds infected with Proteosoma on the nights of November 30 , December 10 , December 12 , December 15 , and December 20 .
