" An Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Sound .
" By E. J. Stone , M.A. , E.R.S. , Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope .
Received August 21 , 1871 .
( Abstract .
) A galvanic current passes from the batteries at the Royal Observatory , Cape Town , at 1 o'clock , and discharges a gun at the Castle , and through relays drops a time-ball at Port Elizabeth .
It appeared to the author that a valuable determination of the velocity of sound might be obtained by measuring upon the chronograph of the Observatory the interval between the time of the sound reaching some point near the gun and that of its arrival at the Observatory .
As there is only a single wire between the Observatory and Cape Town , some little difficulty was experienced in making the necessary arrangements , without any interference with the 1 o'clock current to Port Elizabeth ; but this difficulty was overcome by a plan which the author describes , and which was brought into successful operation on Eeb .
27 , 1871 .
The experiments could not have been carried out , on account of the encroachment they would have made on the time of the Observatory staff , had it not been for the assistance of J. Den , Esq. , the acting manager of the Cape Telegraph Company , to whom the author is indebted for the preparation of a good earth-connexion near the gun , for permission to Mr. Kirby , a gentleman attached to the telegraph office , to assist in the experiments , and for a general superintendence of the arrangements at Cape Town .
The observed times of hearing the sound were recorded on the chronograph by two observers , situated one ( Mr. Kirby ) at a distance of 641 feet from the gun , the other ( Mr. Mann ) at the Observatory , at a distance of 15,449 feet from the gun .
The former distance was sufficient to allow the connexion of the main wire to be broken at the telegraph office after the gun had been fired , but before the sound reached the first observer .
As there were no reciprocal signals , a correction was made by calculation for the effect of the wind , its velocity being measured by a set of Robin1871 .
] On a supposed Alteration of Aberration of Light Sc.35 son 's cups .
The personal equation , under the circumstances of the observations , was found as follows:\#151 ; A gun was fired at such a distance from the Observatory as to be heard with about the same degree of distinctness as the time-gun at the Castle .
This distance was found to be 1483 feet .
The registrations on the chronograph were made by Mr. Kirby at the distance of 162 feet from the gun , and Mr. Mann at the Observatory .
For this comparatively small distance , the time of transit calculated from the velocity deduced from the time taken to travel over the larger distance may be deemed exact .
The observed time for the smaller difference of distance was found to be too great by 0S,09 , which correction has been applied to all the observations .
It depends more on want of sensibility in picking up and recognizing faint sounds than upon mere habit of making contacts .
When the observers were interchanged , the observed interval of time appeared still too large , but in this case by 0S02 .
It is clear that such personal equations are not eliminated by an interchange of observers , nor by return signals .
In the reduction of the equations , the coefficient of elasticity of air under a constant volume ( that is to say , the ratio of the increment of pressure for an increment 1 ' F. of temperature to the pressure at 32 ' F. ) was regarded as an unknown quantity as well as V , the velocity of sound at 32 ' F. The reduction of the equations furnished by the observations , which were 38 in number , gave Y=1090,6 feet per second , a=0-0019 , Regnault 's value of a being 0'0020 .
There appeared to be but little difference between the residual errors as dependent on the motion of the air .
The author grouped the residuals into two classes , according to the dampness of the air ; but there appeared to be no appreciable difference in the velocity as dependent upon dampness .

Received November 17 , 1871 .
A discussion has taken place on the Continent , conducted partly in the * Astronomische Nachrichten , ' partly in independent pamphlets , on the change of direction which a ray of light will receive ( as inferred from the Undulatory Theory of Light ) when it traverses a refracting medium which has a motion of translation .
The subject to which attention is particularly called is the effect that will be produced on the apparent amount of that
