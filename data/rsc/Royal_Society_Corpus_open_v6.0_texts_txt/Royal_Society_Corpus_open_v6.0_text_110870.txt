" Remarks having reference to the Earthquake felt in Demlerara on the morning of the 30th of August 1844 .
" By Daniel Blair , Esq. , Colonial Surgeon of British Guiana .
Communicated by the Right Honourable Lord Stanley .
The earthquake here described commenced at twenty-seven minutes past three o'clock , a.m. on the 30th of August , and continued during two or three minutes .
It appeared to be composed of two waves or pulsations quickly succeeding each other , and producing gyratory movements of the earth .
Though the alarm it occasioned was very great , no serious damage seems to have resulted from it .
