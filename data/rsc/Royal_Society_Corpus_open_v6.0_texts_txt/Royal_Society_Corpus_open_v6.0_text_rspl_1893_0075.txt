The limb bones , however , appear to the present writer to be slightly more robust than those of the Fallow Deer of corresponding size ; and the antlers conclusively prove that most of the remains , at any rate , do not belong to this species .
The antlers may be assigned with certainty to the small variety of Cervus which now lives in Northern Africa , and is known as the Barbary Deer ( of Gray ) ; the Maltese fossils , however , indicate an animal of smaller dimensions than its existing representative and its contemporaneous ally discovered in the caverns of Gibraltar .

Communicated by Lord Kelvin , P.R.S. Received February 10 , \#151 ; Read March 2 , 1893 .
This investigation was begun under the instructions of Lord Kelvin about a year ago , and has been continued since the beginning of last year in conjunction with another on thermal conductivity , for which a grant of \#163 ; 50 was made from the Government Research Fund .
The chief object of the investigation was to obtain quantitative results of the variations of specific resistances of metals due to stretching , twisting , drawing through holes in a steel plate , hammering , heating , and combinations of these , while in some of these cases the alteration of density was also measured .
The most exhaustive results that have been hitherto given in this direction are those of Lord Kelvin , published in vol. 2 of his ' Re284 Messrs. J. H. Gray and J. B. Henderson .
print of Mathematical and Physical Papers ' ; of Dr. A. Matthiessen , F.R.S. , published in the ' British Association Reports ' for 1862 , 1863 , 1864 , and 1865 ; and those of Mr. Herbert Tomlinson , F.R.S. , given in several papers communicated to the Royal Society in 1877 and subsequent years .
The paper of the last , dealing most particularly with the present investigation , is contained in the ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1883 , pp. 1\#151 ; 72 , " On the Influence of Stress and Strain on the Action of Physical Forces .
" As this work was done at two different periods of time , it has been found convenient to divide the paper into two parts .
Part I , which .contains the results of change of density due to the different kinds of treatment , was done previous to last July .
Part II contains the results of alteration of resistance due to stretching , the preliminary work and trial methods , which occupied a very considerable time , having been done in conjunction with the work of Part I. Part I. By James H. Gray .
Density .
As , in every case , the alterations were expected to be small , great care bad to be taken to have all the apparatus as sensitive as possible .
A very delicate Oertling balance was used , capable of weighing accurately to within milligramme , and all the usual precautions observed .
jEffect of Stretching .
A well-annealed wire of practically pure copper , electrical conductivity 98 per cent. , diameter 2 mm. , was stretched by weights till it broke .
The wire was securely fixed to a strong hook near the ceiling of the laboratory , and two ink marks made , one near the top end , the other near the bottom end .
Behind these marks were fixed .|-mm .
scales , which enabled the stretching to be recorded .
After the wire had been stretched by a weight , a length of about 8 inches was cut off .
In this manner successive weights were applied , pieces of the wire being cut off each time , till it broke .
Even when so great lengths as 8 inches were taken however , it- was found very difficult to weigh very accurately in water , and this , along with possible differences , due to the manner in which the several tests were made , may account for the fact that the intermediate values of the densities varied in different series .
The original and final densities of the wire could always be determined very accurately , as much greater lengths of the wire could be used .
The numbers below give the values , which were found to be very constant in all the specimens tested .
Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance .
285 Original density before stretching = 8'8612 Density after stretching almost to breaking = 8'8187 This shows a decrease in density of fully ^ per cent. , and is somewhat greater than what Mr. Tomlinson obtained for the copper which he tested , his result being ^ per cent. In the present tests , the stretching obtained was usually about 25 or 26 per cent , before breaking .
Diagram 1 is a stress-strain curve of the copper wire used , the abscissae denoting percentage strain , the ordinates the stress in kilogrammes per square centimetre of the original section of the wire .
This curve is given to show the nature of the wire .
Lead Wire.\#151 ; A similar series of tests was made on a length of lead wire , diameter 0'8 mm. , the stretching being carried on till the wire broke .
This point was reached after a stretching of 3'6 per cent. The values for the original and final densities are as follows:\#151 ; Messrs. J. H. Gray and J. B. Henderson .

Copper Wire.\#151 ; A length of the same copper wire as was used before , diameter 2 mm. , was drawn , without any special care , through twenty holes of uniformly diminishing diameters , the density being measured after drawing through every third hole .
Table I gives the results obtained .
It will be seen that , whereas in stretching the density was diminished , in drawing it is considerably increased .
There would seem to be a maximum after drawing through twelve holes , but as the wire became very difficult to draw by this time , and broke after being put through six more holes , the subsequent decrease in density may have been due to flaws in the metal , caused by the rough treatment which it had received .
The ultimate diameter was 1*3 mm. Table 1 .

While this weight was on , 300 complete turns were made in the wire , the density being measured after 200 turns , and again after 300 turns .
It was found that the wire had stretched by about 23 per cent , after being thus treated .
The density , as will be seen , increased very slightly\#151 ; about ^ per cent. Density before twisting = 8'850 " after 200 turns = 8'887 " " 300 " = 8-896 A twist of 300 turns in a length of 130 cm .

A preliminary trial was made on the effect of heating .
The wire which had been used in the experiments just described was raised to a white heat by an electric current , to find out if by this means the density could be brought back to its original value which it had before being twisted .
The heating , however , did not seem to alter the density appreciably , the difference not being more than or \#166 ; xt per cent. Effect of Hammering .

Part II .
By James H. Gray and James B. Henderson .
Tests on Change of Electrical Resistance .
Several methods were tried with more or less success at the beginning of the work of Part I. Great difficulty was at first experienced with thermo-electric currents and the self-induction of some of the coils used .
Ultimately , the zero method about to be described was perfected , and was used in the work of Part II , giving great satisfaction .
Before describing this method , we wish to refer particularly to the two definitions of specific resistance at present employed .
The unit most generally understood in English treatises is the resistance in ohms of a cube of the metal of unit section and unit length .
From this definition we have , for the resistance It , of a length Z , of a homogeneous conductor of uniform section a\gt ; \#187 ; It \#151 ; where ov is the specific resistance so defined .
\lt ; r\#174 ; may be called the " volume specific resistance , " in contradistinction to the " weight specific resistance " which is defined from the following .
We have .p _ l _ l2 _ 17 Xu \#151 ; ( Tq\#151 ; \#151 ; \#151 ; \amp ; up ^ u ) Uvp W where \lt ; rvp \#151 ; w being the weight of the length Z of the wire .
From this , awe is seen to be the resistance of a length of the wire numerically equal to p and section unity , or of a length unity and section equal to l/ p. Since the section is uniform , Ijw , or the length per unit of weight , is constant .
Let it be represented by X. Then we have It = cw\l .
The advantages of using this latter equation over the one involving the " volume specific resistance " are very many , either when it is required to know the whole resistance of a wire , having given awy X , and Z , or when it is required to know \lt ; rw , having given B\gt ; , X and Z. It is quite usual in commercial circles to speak of a wire of , say , number 14 gauge , weighing 127 grains to the foot , that is , about 27 grammes to the metre .
The only measurement to be taken then is the length , if the specific resistance be given in weight units , and the measurement of the length can be made with the greatest accuracy .
Even if the weight per unit of length be not given , it can also be determined most accurately without any difficulty .
If , however , the specific resistance be given in volume units , the Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance .
289 section of the wire must be measured , and this is a very difficult thing to do , even in the case of moderately thick wires , when accuracy is required , since an error in the measurement of the diameter is more than doubled in the value of the section .
Everyone who has tried to measure accurately the diameters of wires is well aware of the great difficulty in doing so .
Even although the one measurement were quite accurate , the diameter at the place measured would , in all probability , not be the average diameter of the wire .
This can , of course , be corrected by taking measurements at a number of places , and taking the average , but the process is very tedious , and , when done , is not thoroughly trustworthy , for it is so easy to make errors in using the ordinary micrometer gauge .
If the section be determined by the longer method from a measurement of the density , it is , of course , more accurately obtained , but , even then , the weighing in water of small lengths of wire is an uncertain thing ; whereas , for the length per unit of weight , the weighing has only to be made in air , and therefore the error due to weighing in water is avoided .
Clearly , then , the " weight specific resistance " gives much more accurate results for the total resistance of a wire than the " volume specific resistance , " particularly in the case of practical work , where very little care is taken in measuring the diameter .
Certainly , it would have been incomparably more difficult , and would have taken a much longer time to obtain the results given in this paper , had the " volume specific resistance " been used .
As will be shown further on , it is not necessary , for mere comparison of two specific resistances , even to measure the length per unit of weight .
Dr. A. Matthiessen , F.R.S. , in his paper " On the Specific Resistance of Metals in terms of the British Association Unit ( 1864 ) of Electric Resistance , \amp ; c. " ( ' Phil. Mag. , ' May , 1865 ) , says :\#151 ; " We employed the length weight in preference to the length section , knowing that the weight of a wire may be much more accurately determined than its section , whether deduced directly from the measurements of the diameter , or indirectly from the specific gravity , the determination of the latter introducing an error .
Of course , in endeavouring to reproduce resistances , it is wise to avoid the use of unnecessary values ; and it is just as well , and certainly a much more accurate method , to determine a resistance in length weight than in length section .
" The term " specific resistance " was introduced by Weber , but by it he meant the weight unit , and always used it unless when otherwise stated .
Lord Kelvin points this out in his paper on " Measurement of Electromotive Forces in Absolute Measure " ( vol. 1 , * Math , and Phys. Papers ' ) , and throughout three papers relating to the present investigation , on " Electromagnetic Qualities of Metals , " " Analytical 290 Messrs. J. H. Gray and J. B. Henderson .
and Synthetical Attempts to ascertain the cause of the Differences of Electrical Conductivity discovered in Wires of nearly Pure Copper , " and " On the Electric Conductivity of Commercial Copper of various kinds , " printed in his collected papers , the " weight specific resistance " is always used .
Several of the most eminent authorities have from time to time signified their disapproval of the volume unit , but it still continues to be most generally used .
Why this is so does not seem clear , for surely a much more definite idea of a metal is obtained when its density is taken into account as in the weight unit ; and if , for certain purposes , the volume unit may be convenient , this can easily be found from a knowledge of the density .
It has been conclusively established , first by Lord Kelvin , and afterwards by several investigators , that the volume specific resistance always increases with the decrease of density , and therefore the weight resistance , since if includes the density , will not change so much .
The weight unit is not , however , quite constant , as the results of this investigation show , but the changes , at least for copper , iron , and steel , are very small .
As a matter of fact , for these metals the volume specific resistance does not change very much either , as the density is practically constant for any mechanical treatment .
The method used for the test of change of specific resistance was a slight modification of that known as Thomson 's ( Lord Kelvin ) Double Bridge Method ( " New Electrodynamic Balance for Resistance of Short Bars or Wires , " ' Phil. Mag. , ' 4th Series , vol. 24 , 1862 , p. 149 ) .
Diagram 2 is a sketch of the arrangements .
A length of wire , PCDB , of about 10 metres , was fixed about its middle point round two strong bolts , C and D , which were fixed firmly near the ceiling in a pillar of the physical laboratory .
At the points P , Q , R , the ends of 150 ohms resistances , rlt r2 , r3 , were neatly soldered , the other ends of these resistances from Q and R being brought to one terminal , H , of a Thomson 's mirror galvanometer G , of resistance 5380 ohms , the end of the resistance from P being connected to the other terminal K of the galvanometer .
From K another 150 ohms resistance , r4 , was carried to a sliding contact , B. The four resistances of 150 ohms each were inserted so that practically all the current from the battery L would flow in the circuit PCDB , and thus any movement of B will not sensibly disturb the distribution in this circuit .
As will be at once seen , if the resistance of the wire PQ is equal to that of BR , there will be no deflection in the galvanometer .
The wire PQ was left unaltered , and served as a standard of comparison for BR , which was subjected to successive stretchings by means of weights , W. Half-millimetre scales , S , S , fixed immediately behind the points R and B , enabled the readings of length , BR , to be accurately taken .
Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance .
Diagram 2 .
C D The order of an experiment was as followsThe test wire BR was first of all made as straight as possible by means of a small weight .
The sliding contact B was then moved about till there was no deflection in the galvanometer .
Readings were taken at the points B , R , and also at a pointer , M , fixed on the wire near the top of the bottom scale S. A weight of 7 lbs. was then added to the small weight , and a balance again taken .
The additional weight was then taken off , and a balance found .
In this way , successive additions of 7 lbs. were made , and balance readings taken each time till the wire broke .
The distance between the wires was about 10 cm .
, and the length between B and R from 400 to 450 cm .
The galvanometer was made so sensitive that a movement of B of \#163 ; mm. could be distinctly detected , so that a change of \#163 ; in 4000 , that is , 1/ 160 per cent , was measurable , and allowing for small errors in Messrs. J. H. Gray and J. B. Henderson .
reading the knife-edge of B , the result could be easily obtained correct to ^ per cent. The method being a zero one , the galvanometer could be made almost unstable , and , as there are over 23,000 turns on the coil , the arrangement was exceedingly sensitive .
The maximum current used was 05 ampere , and , in the case of iron and steel wire , not more than 0'25 ampere .
The four resistances rx , r2 , r3 , and r4 , of 150 ohms each , were carefully wround anti-inductively side by side on a piece of slate , and covered with cotton tape , to ensure their being at the same temperature .
The whole system of wires was so arranged as not to influence the galvanometer .
The distance between the standard and test wire being so small , the temperatures of both were the same , and the sliding contact , at the point where it had to be touched by the hand , was protected by a piece of vulcanite from being heated .
With these precautions , no inconvenience was experienced from thermo-electric currents .
Calculation of Results .
Prom the method of calculation it will be seen that it was only necessary to measure lengths in order to obtain results of the variations of the weight specific resistance , and to determine densities in addition , when the volume resistance was also required .
The measurement of so great lengths as 400 cm .
could be made very accurately , and , therefore , very little error was introduced .
In nocase was it necessary to measure the section in connexion with the resistance .
Let l = original length of the test wire which would give a balance with the standard , l ' = the length which would give a balance after applying weight to it , L = the original length between R and M before applying weight , w = the section before applying weight , L ' , w the corresponding values after applying weight , av \#151 ; volume specific resistance , ( 7W = weight specific resistance , R = resistance between the points P and Q on the standard .

The results obtained quite agreed with what Lord Kelvin first , and Mr. Tomlinson afterwards , , found , that the mechanical treatment did not materially affect the specific resistance .

The calculations from these readings give the temporary alteraEffects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical Resistance .
295 tion of specific resistance due to the strain caused by the weight , and the permanent alteration due to the weight having been applied for about ten minutes , and then taken off .
This series was continued by making successive additions of 14 lbs. till the wire broke , which it did when a little more than 200 lbs. had been added .
The results obtained for one of four series are given in the table , p. 293 .
This series was chosen because more intermediate readings had been taken than in the other three .
All four agreed at the common points within the limits of accuracy of the method .
The headings of the columns sufficiently explain what the numbers mean .
Column 4 shows that application of weight up to 84 lbs. had the effect of slightly improving the permanent electrical quality of the steel .
When more than 84 lbs. were applied the conductivity was found to diminish again .
The results in column 2 are shown plotted on the curves in Diagram 3 .
Columns 2 and 3 are almost identical , as shown by column 4 , which is the ratio of the two .
The numbers in column 4 are , within the accuracy of the method , practically unity , showing that there has been no permanent alteration of specific resistance .
With regard to the points a , a in each curve , which are out to the amount of 5 in 10,000 , it must be remarked that these were the beginning of the second day 's experiments .
It was impossible to carry out a whole series of tests in one day , and , therefore , the wire was left over night with a weight of 14 lbs. on it .
The temporary alteration of specific resistance in the case of steel is considerably higher than the temporary or permanent alteration for copper or iron , as will be seen from the results given for these metals .
Tests of Copper Wire .
A very large number of tests were made on the effect of stretching on the specific resistance of copper wire .
The wire was the same material as that used for tests of density , but of slightly smaller diameter .
The following table gives the results of one set:\#151 ; ( 1 .

X 296 Messrs. J. H. Gray and J. B. Henderson .
In this table the percentage stretchings are given instead of the weights producing the stretching , as , copper being so soft , the effect of the weights depends altogether on the times during which they were applied , and as these were very variable , a record of the weights would be of no value .
For example , if a weight were put on , and allowed to hang for three minutes , then taken off , and a balance immediately found , and if the same weight be again put on , left for another three minutes , and a balance again found , it would be considerably different from before , showing that the wire had received an additional stretching .
For this reason it is advisable to give the percentage stretching produced .
In the case of steel wire it was quite different , as , throughout all the series , till ' the wire was just about to break , the elastic limit was not exceeded , so that the wire attained its ultimate stretching as soon as the weight was applied .
With regard to this table , the results given are one set out of a great many which agreed very closely , per cent , being the greatest variations for corresponding stretchings ; this set was chosen as having one peculiarity very well marked .
This is with reference to the high value 1'01083 , that is , an increase of 1 per cent , for a stretching of 22'3 per cent. The wire was almost at breaking point , and , on being examined , the surface was found to contain numerous cracks , many of which were so large that they could be easily felt by the fingers .
These cracks were no doubt caused by the rapidity of stretching , as in other series in which the stretching was conducted more slowly they were not so apparent , and the change of specific resistance was not so great .
It was found quite impossible to smooth out all the little deviations from perfect straightness in the copper wire .
Although the first 14 lbs. were sufficient to keep it fairly straight , there were still little irregularities which could be seen with the eye .
Not till about 56 lbs. were applied were these quite removed , and by that time there was also considerable stretching .
The result was to make the apparent initial length shorter than it really was , and therefore the specific resistance seemed to diminish at first with the addition of weight .
After the irregularities were taken out by stretching the length appeared to become greater , while the resistance did not increase , the result being that the specific resistance would seem to have diminished .
This showed itself to a greater or less degree in all the series , according to the condition of the wire as to straightness .
The values 0'99969 , 0'99985 are clearly due to this .
It might , therefore , have been more accurate to give the results , taking as the initial reading the lengths after the irregularities had been removed ; but this would only very slightly alter the values , in fact by ^ per cent. Leaving out the value of the alteration just before breaking , we find in all our trials that the greatest increase of weight specific Effects of Mechanical Stress on Electrical 297 resistance is not more than O'7 per cent. This corroborates , for copper , very well what Lord Kelvin found in his first experiments on this subject .
Since the density of the wire diminishes by 03 per cent. , the increase of volume specific resistance is about 09 per cent. , a result somewhat higher than Mr. Tomlinson 's for the copper which he used , as he got 06 per cent , for the maximum value .
We assume that the latter investigator means " volume specific resistance " by the term " specific resistance " ; otherwise our results would agree more nearly with his .
In any case , it seems quite certain that , in copper , the greatest alteration that can be produced by any mechanical treatment is not more than would be produced by a rise of temperature of 3 ' Centigrade .
For additional tests of copper , see end of paper .
Tests of Soft Iron The wire , 08 mm. here used was exceedingly soft , and gave very satisfactory results .
This metal is intermediate in properties between copper and steel .
Whereas in copper the permanent alteration and stretching begin almost simultaneously with the application of weight , and in steel the alteration is almost altogether temporary , that is , only lasts while the weight is on the wire , in soft iron wire there is both a temporary and permanent alteration .
The same length of wire was taken as for copper and steel , and weights added by 7 lbs. each time , tests being made after each addition .
A comparison was made of the ratio of the weight specific resistance with weight on to that before any weight was applied .
This gives column 3 in the following table , and shows the ratio due to the sum of the temporary and permanent alterations .

The results are given in column 4 of the table .
Column 5 , which is obtained by dividing the results of column 3 by the corresponding numbers in column 4 , gives therefore the permanent alteration due to stretching .
In this table both the weights and the percentage stretchings are given , as it was found that with iron the difficulty experienced with copper of continuous stretching did not occur .
In order to test if there was any more permanent stretching after the wire had been allowed to rest for a week , another series of tests was made on the same wire at the end of the week , readings being taken on the application of every 7 lbs. as before .
The results showed that the temporary alteration remained the same as before , being for 49 lbs. 1 002234 , which , as will be seen by subtracting column 4 from column 2 to get the temporary alteration , the result being for 49 lbs. T00232 , shows that the permanent alteration is practically constant after the first series of stretchings .
Ho tests have been made of alloys as yet , as it was thought more important to give as much time as possible to obtaining trustworthy results for pure metals .
The conclusions that have been arrived at from this investigation are 'that no. mechanical treatment , such as stretching , drawing through holes in a steel plate , twisting , hammering , or combinations of these , all of which were tried , had any appreciable effect on the electrical properties of copper , iron , or steel .
The effect of annealing was also tried on a copper wire which had already been very much stretched .
The wire was carefully heated to redness by means of a lamp all along its length , and a test then made .
This was not found to bring its resistance back to its original value however .
As contrasted with the small effect that mechanical treatment has on the electrical properties of metals , it is interesting to notice the great influence even a trace of impurity in the metal has .
For this purpose we include a table taken from Lord Kelvin 's paper on " Analytical and Synthetical Attempts to ascertain the cause of the Differences of Electrical Conductivity discovered in Wires ot nearly Pure Copper " ( vol. 2 , ' Math , and Phys. Papers ' ) .
This table ( p. 299 ) gives an analysis , made by Professor Hofmann for Lord Kelvin , of several specimens of copper , and also their conducting powers .
From this table we see that an impurity of \#166 ; S\#166 ; per cent , lowers the conducting power by as much as per cent. , and that the conducting power rapidly becomes enormously lower for increase in the impurities , 1/ 24 per cent , of the latter bringing down by 40 per cent , of its value when pure . .

Renewed Test on Copper Wire made after the Paper was written .
This series was made in order to find if , after the wire had been \#166 ; stretched almost to breaking and allowed to stand , there would be airy more permanent alteration of specific resistance due to renewed , application of weight .
First of all , a series of stretchings was given to the wire , as in the former tests of the same wire .
Column 2 of the following Table A was thus obtained , and will be found to agree very well with column 2 given under " Tests of Copper Wire " in the former series .
This wire was then tested by applying successive weights , the readings being taken with weight on and also after the weight had been taken off .
Columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of Table B give the results of these tests .
Column ( 2 ) shows the ratio of the weight specific resistance with the weight on to that before the weights were applied for the second series .
Column ( 3 ) gives the ratio with weight off to that before the weights were applied .
Column ( 2 ) therefore shows the permanent and temporary alteration , and ( 3 ) shows the permanent alteration .
There was , however , still a slight permanent stretching , which accounts for the small increases shown in Column ( 3 ) .
The results showed that when there was no permanent stretching application of weight only caused temporary alteration of weight specific resistance .
The numbers in columns f % ) of Tables A and B when plotted on curved paper , with ( for A ) percentage stretchings as ordinates , and weight specific resistances as abscissae , and ( for B ) weights applied as ordinates , give practically straight lines .
This shows that the permanent alteration of specific resistance is directly proportional to the stretching , and the temporary alteration is directly proportional to the weight applied .
