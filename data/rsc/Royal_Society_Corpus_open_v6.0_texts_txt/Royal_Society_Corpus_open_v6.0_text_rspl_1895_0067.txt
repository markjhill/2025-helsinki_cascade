143 But , in the case of the Angiospermic anthers , we conclude , on comparative grounds , that progressive septation has taken place ; this would indirectly support the view that the sorus of Dancea is also a result of progressive septation .
Obviously such a series of stages as that presented by Dancea may be read either way , and it would be possible to urge that in them we have evidence , not of progressive septation , but of fusion of loculi .
This question must be considered on grounds of general probability .
Without at the moment declaring a final opinion ( though I think the probability is largely in favour of a view of progressive septation ) , this point , at least , seems clear : that in Dancea the identity of the sporangium or loculus is not strictly defined .
1 o arrive at this point is , in my opinion , a matter of some importance ; the study of the sporangium in Pteridophyta has long been based upon the examination of the highly specialised and strictly constructed sporangium of the Leptosporangiatse .
The conclusion is , however , becoming obvious that such strictness of construction and regularity of segmentation is exceptional , and that in the Eusporangiatse such strictness is not the rule .
Other Marattiacere , and especially have also been examined , and they are all found to conform to one fundamental type , though differing in detail ; it appears that , as regards the sorus , Dancea is the least specialised , and Angiopteris the most specialised , of the living genera , and that they form a very natural series .
Such a series in plants of so antique a stock deserves the most careful comparative study , and the results should carry unusual weight .

On Weight of a Cubic [ Dec. 5 , + 027 gram , and as the water used was not sufficiently pure ( having a density of about 1'0005 ) , the above-named result is to be considered as of small accuracy and doubtless much in excess of its real weight .
Nevertheless , from these determinations , assuming the density of the water used by Shuckburgh* to be as above mentioned , one may conclude that the probable weight is 100006 + 014 grams , which comes very near to the real weight of the cubic decimetre , the small difference arising in all probability from the insufficient accuracy of the temperature measurements near 62 ' F. , at which the weighings were made .
It is well known that at the institution of the metrical system at the end of the eighteenth century , the weight of the kilogram was declared to be equal in vacuo to the weight of a cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density .
For this purpose M. Lefevre-Gineau made an exhaustive investigation , upon which M. Tralles made a report on the 31st May , 1779 ( le 11 an 7 ) , first published in 'Base du Systeme Metrique , ' Tom. Ill , pp. 558\#151 ; 580 , in the year 1810 ; the original observations of Lefevre-Gineau are , however , still unknown .
From the data given in Mr. Tralles ' report M. Broch found in 1873f , after making the necessary corrections , that the probable weight deducible from the data of the experiments lies between the limits from 999*913 to 999-947 + 0 020 grams .
I have myself made a new reduction !
of the data given by Tralles and Gineau , the result being 999*966+ 0*03 grams .
But to this result also we cannot attribute any particular importance , principally for the three following reasons :\#151 ; 1 .
The original observations of Lefevre-Gineau are unknown .
2 .
The cylinder employed by Lefevre-Gineau in the numerous ( altogether forty-eight ) weighings at + 0'*3 C. had a special small tube providing a communication between the inner part of the cylinder and the outer air ; there existed consequently on the inner walls of the cylinder a condensation of aqueous vapour .
3 .
No particular indications are given as to the methods of purifying the water in which the weighings were made , but considering the fact that water once distilled without special precautions ( as an experiment shows ) very often has a specific gravity up to 10002 , taking that of pure water as unity , we may admit that the true weight will be smaller than that obtained from Lefevre-Gineau 's investigations .
From the above-mentioned determinations we must conclude that the weight of a cubic decimetre of water in vacuo at 4 ' C. is not greater than 999 96 grams , and hardly smaller than 999*76 grams .

145 those of M. Kupffer and Mr. Chaney have been carried out under all possible conditions necessary for obtaining reliable results , those conditions being as follows:\#151 ; Direct comparisons of the weights and measures used with the primary standards of weight and measure , accurate corrections of the thermometers , and particularly care in obtaining entirely pure water , which before the experiment was boiled so as to remove the dissolved air.* I therefore consider these determinations , introducing into them all corrections in a manner corresponding to our present experience , upon which I consider it here necessary to make the following statements .
I have assumed:\#151 ; 1 .
One metre = 39-3700+ 0-0001 English inches , as it follows from the combined reliable comparisons of Kater , Clark , and Tittmann .
It may be remembered that the Russian inch , according to the law , is equal to the English inch , and that 1 cubic inch appears to be equal to 16-38716 c.c. or 0 01638716 cubic decimetre .
2 .
One pound avoirdupois = 453'59243 grams , as we see by the recent comparisons of Mr. Chaney ; therefore 1 grain = 0-0647989 gram .
3 .
One Russian pound = 409-5120 + 0-0005 grams , as appears from the fact that Kupffer gives 409-51156 + 0-00072 , and the preliminary weighings made at the Central Chamber of Weights and Measures in 1894 give 40951236+ 0*00022 grams .
Therefore 1 doli ( a Russian pound contains 96 zolotniks a 96 dolias ) = 0"0444349 gram .
4 .
For pure water ( freed from dissolved air ) I assumed that the change of the specific gravity ( at 4 ' C. = 1 ) as depending upon the temperature t ' C. is represented by the following equation :\#151 ; S , ( *-4)2_______ 1-9 ( 941+ \#163 ; ) ( 703-5\#151 ; \#163 ; ) ( I ) as derived by mef from the whole of the best determinations between \#151 ; 10 ' and +200 ' , made up to the year 1891 , verified mercurial thermometers being used , as employed by Mr. Kupffer and Mr. Chaney .
Here I consider it necessary to mention that at ordinary temperatures mercurial thermometers always give higher readings ( 0 than ihose of the hydrogen thermometer ( denoting its temperature by T ) ; the difference t\#151 ; T is very various , being at 20 ' from * Through the dissolved air the density of water decreases in its millionth parts , as I have shown in my paper , " Investigations on the Specific Gravity of Aqueous Solutions , " 1887 , p. 383 .
Maly and Marek ( 'Wiedemann 's Ann. , ' 1891 , vol. 44 , p. 172 ) actually found this , having shown that the relative density of water containing air at 0 ' C. = 0'9999975 , at 10 ' C. = 0 9999968 , at 20 ' C. = 0 9999996 and at 30 ' C. = 1 .

Expressing the temperature on the hydrogen thermometer scale as T and using the latest determinations of Messrs.

The weight of a litre of dry air , freed from carbonic acid at 0 ' and a pressure of 760 mm. , according to my deductions " ) " from the corrected data of Messrs. Regnault , v. Jolly , Leduc , and Lord Rayleigh , is equal to e0 = g0-131844 + 0*0001 gram , where g is the force of gravity in metres ( accepted 9*8126 for London , 9*8100 for Paris , and 9*8188 for St. Petersburg ) .

exceed more than decimilligrams of the weight of a cubic decimetre of water .
A detailed description of a great series of the determinations made by Kupffer we find in vol. 2 of his memoir , ' Travaux de la Commission pour fixer les Mesures et les Poids de l'Empire de Russie ' ( St. Petersbourg , 1841 ) .
Kupffer used two brass cylinders , the volume of which from a number of measurements as a mean was found to be at t = 13\#163 ; ' R = 62 ' F. = 16S ' C. , For the small cylinder , Vx = 24-17753 cubic inches ( Joe .
p. 133 ) .
" large " V2 = 49-89931 " ( cit. , p. 250 ) ) The coefficient of expansion of the brass used was not actually determined by Kupffer , and for the reduction of the volumes at temperatures near 16f ' C. 1 have , therefore , used the results of Fizeau .
From the coefficient of linear expansions ( in degrees Celsius ) we find for the volumes , vt = v0(1+0-00005337 t+0-00000003^ ) , ... ... ... ... ... ...

" large " V2( \#151 ; 49-89931 + 0-003391 ( t\#151 ; 13^ ) .
For the determinations of the diameters and heights of the small cylinders we rarely find a maximum difference between the separate measurements amounting to 0"00014 inch .
From the mean results of a large number of measurements , we must assume that the error in volume determination was not greater than +0"00168 cubic inch , or less than the 1/ 14391 part of the total volume , which for a cubic decimetre corresponds to 0"069 gram .
In the measurements of the large cylinder having a diameter of about 4 inches , a greater accuracy has been obtained , so that the average error of the linear measurements was smaller than 000005 inch ; therefore the error in volume was smaller than 0"000190 cubic inch , corresponding to a relative error of less than 1/ 26263 , or for 1 cubic decimetre less than 0"038 gram .
We must therefore expect a greater accuracy from the determinations by means of the large cylinder than from those where the small cylinder was used .
Although I have made in similar detail a new reduction of all Kupffer 's data , in the further discussion I shall take into considera148 Prof. D. Mendeleeff .
On Weight of a Cubic [ Dec. 5 , tion only the data obtained by means of the large cylinder , especially as in all instances relating to the weighings they are much more reliable and symmetrical , that is to say , the changes of weight follow uniformly with the changes of temperature .
With the large cylinder ( as with the small ) Kupffer made many series of alternate weighings in air and water .
He first used ordinary once distilled water , and afterwards water which was especially prepared for him by the well-known chemists , Hess and Fritzsche .
According to all test proofs this water appeared to be pure , and before the experiment it was boiled to remove the dissolved air .
Orly data given for pure water are of the greatest importance .
From the data obtained with the water first used we can only conclude that its density in relation to that of pure water appeared to be P000128 , if we judge from the corrected weighings of the large cylinder .
We expect therefore to find that the weight of a cubit ; decimetre , using ordinary once distilled water , may give an increase amounting to decigrams .
The weight of the large cylinder in air was determined by thirty-five weighings , distributed in six series , the mean results of which are : Number of weighings .

air = 04501 A , the volume of the cylinder = 49-898 cubic inches , and the volume of the weights = 8T56 cubic inches ( sp. gr. = 8"51 , therefore volume of 3134 A weights = 1 cubic inch ) , we have for the weight of the cylinder in vacuo , P2 = 25579*5725 A* As the arbitrary unit of weight A , as we shall see later on , weighs very nearly the same as a dolia of a pound , that is to say about 44*4 millirgams , and as the error of Kupffer 's weighings is not less than Ov milligram , w'e can assume the error in P2 to be +0'012 A , and in the mean result an even smaller error will be obtained .
Having finished all his weighings , Kupffer ( loc. cit. , p. 342 ) determined the relation of the weight of the arbitrary units A , by means of which the weighings were made , to the weight of a standard Russian pound , and after application of all necessary corrections , he came to the conclusion that A was a little heavier than a dolia of true weight , namely , A = P00000933 dolia .
Therefore P2 = 25579"81 dolias .
Kupffer made twenty-seven weighings of the large cylinder in water , which , although distilled , subsequently appeared to be not quite pure .
All these weighings I have re-computed , f but I give here only the final result , showing that at 13^ ' R. , the wreight of the displaced water ( reduced to weighings in vacuo ) is equal to 18382'00 dolias , which is evidently more than the weight ( 18379*19 dolias ) of the same volume of quite pure water prepared by Hess and Fritzsche .
After having obtained this water , Kupffer made in it twenty new full weighings of the same cylinder , arranging them in five series of four weighings each , the mean result of which we give here , not in the order of the weighings as made , but in the order of the observed temperatures of the water , so that the change of the relation between the weight and the temperature ( t ) and the symmetry of the obtained results may be apparent .

] Decimetre of Water at its Maximum Density .
The weight ( in vacuo ) of the water at 13^ ' R. being = 18379T9 dolias , and the volume at the same temperature = 49*89931 cubic inches , then the weight of a cubic inch = 368*3255 dolias ( Kupffer found 368*341 dolias and accepted 368*361 dolias ) = 16*366507 grams at 13^ ' R. Therefore , according to the above-mentioned relation between inches and the metre , the probable weight , in , of a cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density is equal to:\#151 ; 16*366507 0*998890.0*01638716 999*8495 grams .
This value is not only more reliable than those of Shuckburgh and Lefevre-Gineau , because really pure water was here used for the first time and all means employed for obtaining a correct result , but this value is also more probable than all the other results obtained by Kupffer.* It corresponds to pure well-boiled water and to the largest of the cylinders employed by him ; so that all the data here show a more evident uniformity than in the other Kupffer determinations .
This result , from observations made forty-five years ago by the Russian metrologist , obtains special importance in consequence of the publication in 1892 in the ' Phil. Trans. ' ( vol. 183 , pp. 331\#151 ; 354 ) of investigations on the weight of a cubic inch of water , made in the year 1888 by the contemporary English metrologist , Mr. H. J. Chaney , because the latter not only took care to obtain quite pure water ( and by boiling removed the dissolved air ) , not only employed apparatus and methods carefully tested , but also took a cylinder and a sphere of considerably larger dimensions than the largest used by Kupffer .
f By its especially large dimensions ( about Kupffer , the most probable value of P , the result being identical with the P above found ; but I consider it more regular to proceed in the way I have accepted , because in the same all entering values , especially S\lt ; , have a real meaning , and because I have also used this method in the discussion of Mr. Chaney 's observations .

After having received from Mr. Chaney some additional data relating to these measurements , I have made a full computation , and found for the cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density , the weight 999*374 grams .
To this value I cannot attribute any importance , as the volume of Q. is very small , only 23*04 cubic inches , and as quartz very slowdy assumes the temperature of the surrounding medium .

As the air bubbles diminish the weight of C in water , that is to say apparently increase the weight of the water , one must believe that only in two weighings ( marked with an asterisk ) , Nos. 1 and 3 , no bubbles , or very few , were shown , and I therefore take for the computation these two weighings only .
According to them , the mean weight of water at 58-4 ' F. is P88.4 =\#166 ; 144704-05 grains ; but as the volume of C ( according to IV ) at this temperature V58.4 = 572-744125 , we have for the weight of a cubic inch of water at 58'4 ' F. = 252-6504 grains .
The specific gravity of water at this temperaiure being equal to 0'999201 , it follows that the weight , vacuo , of a cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density ( 4 ' C. ) is equal to 999'8414 grams .
This result , being so close to that ( 999'8495 grams ) deduced from the best observations of Kupffer , shows at once that the method selected by us gives useful results .
It is confirmed by determinations made by Mr. Chaney by means of a brass sphere S , having a diameter of about 6 inches .
The volume of the same V62 at 62 ' F. = 112-669406 cubic inches , and according to formula III , Vt = V62[l +0-00003018 ( t\#151 ; 62 ) +0-000000009 62)2 ] .
Five very closely accordant weighings of S in air gave a mean weight of 28409 913 grains , at the mean temperature t = 59"21 ' F. , H0 = 30-27 " ; therefore the weight of 1 cubic inch of air = 03123 grain , and the weight of S , vacuo , = 28440*778 grains .

As this result is close to the two preceding , we may take a general mean from the three , giving to each of them a weight proportional to the product of the number of weighings and the volume of displaced water , that is to say , proportional to the mass of weighed water Number of weighings , n.

] The Measurement of High Potential Although the probable error of this result barely reaches the milligrams , it will be most correct to assume that the true value lies between the limits from 999"85 to 999"82 grams , because the method of hydrostatical weighings hitherto used does not guarantee complete absence of air bubbles , but the coincidence between the results of Kupffei and Chaney gives assurance that the probable weight is not larger than 999 85 grams , but possibly a little smaller , about 999-84 Accepting the above-mentioned value , 999'847 , we have : \#151 ; Temperature on the hydrogen thermometer scale .

( Abstract .
) In Part I the question of the measurement of high potential difference in terms of the absolute electromagnetic unit is considered , more especially with reference to the calibration of electrostatic voltmeters .
* In this no account is taken of the compressibility of water , that is to say , it is supposed that the water is under a pressure of 1 atmosphere ; but as from this at t ' C. ( from 0 ' to 30 ' ) the volume decreases approximately by 50 \#151 ; 0 '22t millionths parts , we have in real vacuo , at 0 ' , the weight of a cubic decimetre equal to 999 666 grams , at 20 ' about 998 036 .
Therefore , the weight of a cubic decimetre of water reaches 1000 grams under a pressure of 4 atmospheres , but in vacuo at all temperatures the weight of water is less than a kilogram .
