) Nitric Oxide .
Dufet only records two determinations of the index of nitric oxide : that of Dulong , who found 1*000302 for white light , and that of Mascart , * who gives , for sodium light , 1*0002975 , taking air as 1*0002928 .
The latter states that the gas he used contained about 10 per cent , of gas not absorbable by ferrous sulphate , for which allowance was made ; but the analysis was not very accurate .
As the index is abnormally high , and methods of purifying gases have improved since 1877 , it seemed desirable to repeat th6 determination .
A specimen of the gas was kindly lent us by Miss I. Homfray .
It was prepared by the method of Van Deventer* !
* and purified by fractionation at low temperatures .
The mean of eight experiments which did not differ by 1 per cent , was , for sodium light , fi = 1*0002939 .
Taking the index of oxygen as 1*0002702 , and that of nitrogen as 1*0002973 , the additive value for NO would be 1*0002837 .
Hence the index is abnorally large , though not quite so much so as previous determinations had made it .
This peculiarity it shares with all other nitrogen compounds whose gaseous index has been determined .
Sulphur Dioxide .
The principal determinations of the index of gaseous sulphur dioxide have been:\#151 ; * lAn'dti'Ec ' Normale sup./ vol. 6 , p. 1 1877 .

The explanation of these discrepancies is that the object of the experimenters appears to have been to arrive at the index of the gas at 0 ' C. and 760 mm. , and their observations were made at different temperatures and pressures , and reduced by different coefficients .
Thus Dulong worked with low pressures , probably not exceeding 340 mm. , and does not appear to have made any corrections for deviations from the laws of Boyle and Gay-Lussac .
Ketteler calculated his results by two methods : with and without allowance for deviation from Boyle 's law .
In both cases he used a temperature coefficient of 1 + 0*00411\lt ; .
By the second method he obtained the number 686 , which is quoted by Dufet.* By the first he arrived at 675-94 .
His maximum pressure was 1100 mm. Mascart , in 1874 , used a temperature coefficient of l + 0'0047l\#163 ; and a pressure coefficient of 1 + 0-025p .
His pressures amounted to eight atmospheres .
In 1877 he employed 1 + 0*00460\#163 ; and 1 + 0 025 He worked at a mean pressure of 1050 mm. Walker uses a pressure coefficient of l + 0-000398p and a temperature coefficient of 1 + t(0'00416 + 0*00002 ) .
His mean pressure was about 650 mm. On the present occasion an attempt was made to measure the index in relation to the density of the gas , so as to show the retardatiou caused by the same number of molecules per unit volume as exist in hydrogen at normal temperature and pressure .
The gas used was obtained from a siphon , and dried by P2O5 .
Very low pressures were used , the greatest being under 200 mm. A density bulb was put in connection with the refractometer tube and immersed in the same* water bath .
In each experiment the quantity of SO2 present was estimated by the observation of pressure and temperature and by the density of the gas .

We have been unable to trace the source of error , but , from the fact that it affects both methods , it is probably to be ascribed to a clerical error in recording the data .
The agreement between the two methods is satisfactory .
In order to compare this result with those of previous experimenters , it is necessary to multiply their figures by the ratio of the theoretic density of SO2 to the experimental value .
Taking 6 = 16 , S \#177 ; = 32*056 , and the weight of a litre of oxygen as 1T0523 gr. , we find the theoretic density to be 2*2123 ( air = 1 ) ; and Leduc* has found experimentally the value 2*2639 .
The ratio of these numbers is 0*97722 .

But we Arid ourselves in agreement with the determinations of the other two observers , and conclude that they are nearest to the truth .
Sulphur Trioxide .
The compound was prepared by passing dry S02 and 02 over platinised asbestos , and was then introduced into small capillary tubes in suitable quantities and sealed off in vacuo .
The method used was to place the sealed capillary in the quartz refractometer tube and , when this had been evacuated and sealed off , to break the capillary tube with a jerk .
The refractometer tube was then alternately cooled with liquid air and heated in the furnace .
The weight of S03 was calculated from the difference between the original tube filled with the solid and the glass fragments collected after the experiment .
The figures were checked by titration of the S03 , and by precipitation with barium chloride .

2 736 729 \#151 ; 3 737 748 727 We believe the method of weighing by difference to give the most accurate results , and we therefore adopt 737 as the most probable value for the index .
But the difficulties of the experiment render this figure not altogether beyond doubt .
The refractivities of these sulphur compounds are very interesting , owing to the fact that they depart widely from the additive values .
The refractive index of gaseous sulphur ( S2 ) , for X = 5893 , has been recently found by the authors to be T001111 .
That of oxygen ( 02 ) may be taken as 1-000270 .
Hence the refractivity of sulphur dioxide , by the additive rule , would be 555 + 270 = 825 , whereas experiment shows it to be 661 , a decrease of nearly 20 per cent. Similarly , the refractivity of SO3 , by the additive rule , is 960 , but by experiment 737 , a decrease of 23*2 per cent. The interest of these curious figures is enhanced by similar results for other sulphur compounds .
The refractivity of gaseous sulphuric acid has not yet been measured , but that of the liquid has been observed by 410 Refractive Indices of Gaseous Nitric , etc. Baden-Powell , Gladstone , and Nasini .
The figures of the latter , * which are the most recent , are as follows :\#151 ; Compound .

Calculated thus , and with a correction for the water present , the index of gaseous H2SO4 is 1*000933 .
The additive value for the index is 1*001234 .
Hence the decrease on combination is 24f per cent. With these may be compared the values of the refractive indices of the hexafluorides of sulphur , selenium , and tellurium , determined by us with Dr. E. B. R. Prideaux.f Kefractivi ties .
