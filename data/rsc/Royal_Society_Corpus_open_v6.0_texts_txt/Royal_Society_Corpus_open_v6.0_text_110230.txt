] The invariable pendulum , No. 12 , with which the experiments recorded in this paper were made , was vibrated in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in July 1828 ; in the Royal Observatory at Altona in September and October of the same year ; and again at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in August 1829 .
The mean of the results obtained at Greenwich in July 1828 and in August 1829 , give the rate of this pendulum at Greenwich to be compared with its rate obtained at Altona .
The details of all these series of observations are given in a tabulated form .
