Presents .
In the last part of the paper the medical aspects of this research are discussed .
It is suggested that emotional syncope is due to paralysis of the splanchnic area , and a case is quoted where compression of the abdomen immediately removed the syncopal condition .
The same treatment , or that of elevation of the abdomen , is suggested for conditions of shock , chloroform collapse , and after severe haemorrhage .
Finally , a parallel is drawn between some of the results of this research in reference to monkeys and those obtained by Dr. George Oliver on man , by measuring the diameter of the radial artery with his ingenious instrument , the arteriometer .
The Chairman announced that a paper on a newly-discovered gas having been promised by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay , this paper would on January 31 be taken as a subject for discussion under a Resolution of Council passed last session , whereby in each year certain Ordinary Meetings were to be " devoted each to the hearing and consideration of some one important communication , or to the discussion of some important topic .

X. The Widening of Iron Lines and of Unknown Lines in relation to the Sun-spot Period .
It is now twenty-eight years since I discovered that the lines seen in sun-spots were subject to widening , * and that different lines were widened at different times .
It was not , however , till 1879 that I was enabled to commence daily routine work of such a nature that all observations were comparable inter se .
This desideratum was secured by limiting attention to the twelve lines most widened between P and D. In 1886f I gave an account of some of the early results obtained by this research .
I have recently commenced the complete discussion of the whole series of observations to the present year .
This discussion , involving 21,000 lines widened during the period in question , has necessitated three special researches : the first , dealing with the lines with which , contemporaneously , coincidences have been found in the laboratory ; the second , dealing with those the origin of which is so far unknown ; and the third , with the distribution of both sets of lines in spots in relation to the sun-spot period .
To make the work as definite as possible , I am , in the first instance , confining the inquiry concerning the known lines to lines of iron based upon the examination of the pure electrolytic iron referred to in a previous communication .
J The following statistics will show the relation of these iron lines to the Fraunhofer lines in the region P\#151 ; D over which the spot work extends .
In the table , " terrestrial line .
" means a line which has been photographically recorded by myself or my assistants in the spectrum of some metal or another during the past twenty-four * ' Roy .
