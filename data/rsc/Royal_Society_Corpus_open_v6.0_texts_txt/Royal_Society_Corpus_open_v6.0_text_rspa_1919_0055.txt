PART I. In a previous paper*by the author it was pointed out that for small adsorptions the adsorption isotherm could be represented by the simple relation where is the amount absorbed and is the equilibrium concentration outside the adsorbent .
The present paper embodies an attempt to evaluate in the case of gases , and to connect it theoretically with other physical properties .
In addition an adsorption formula is developed which applies to gases up to moderate adsorptions , that is up to 30 per cent. of the saturation value .
We will first examine the case of a gas at low concentrations .
We will assume that upon the surface of the adsorbent there is a certain volume , determined , presumably , by the range of molecular action , which is occupied by the adsorbate .
Then , for the change of energy involved in the adsorption at constant temperature of 1 .
molecule of the gas by an infinite amount of adsorbent we can write down three expressions .
The first of these is that obtained from thermodynamical reasoning by the author , and we write the change of as , ( 1 ) where and A second and well-known expression may be obtained from the kinetic theory of gasesS and may be written * Roy .

The Adsorption of where is the molecular volume of the adsorbate .
This equation cannot be applied to the case of a liquid and its vapour , which is presumably due to the fact that the expression should really be written as where and are the number of impacts per second per unit area by the molecules in the two phases .
is not proportional to the concentration unless is great .
If the adsorption volume is of thickness comparable with the diameter of the molecule of the adsorbate , then the centre of the molecule oscillating in a thin lamina only moves a distance normal to the surface and not .
Hence if is the area of the adsorbent we see that is proportional to and not , and hence we write our second equation as , ( 2 ) where .
The third expression is derived from the ordinary theory of attraction .
Suppose the law of attraction of the adsorbent for the gas is given by the expression where is a universal constant and are specific factors of attraction*for the gas and adsorbent respectively , and is the distance measured from some point in the adsorbent to the centre of attraction of the molecule of the gas .
Then if is the mean value of .
for an adsorbed molecule , there being no change in the mean kinetic energy , .
( 3 ) We may equate any two the expressions obtained above .
Thus from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we have ; whence * Since the factor is proportional to the square root of the cohesion , we write ( See Part III of this research .
) Gases at Low and therefore constanC constant .
( 4 ) where the constant is some function of but is independent of T. Again from ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we have .
It is evident from these equations that if we assume ?
to be of the temperature , then is also independent of , and we may write , ( b ) where A and are independent of the temperature but are functions of For convenience of calculation it is better to write the above expression in the form .
( 7 ) This is evidently the equation for the adsorption esosteres\mdash ; lines of constant Even if and A are not independent of if we expand the right-hand side of ( 7 ) in powers of we get , ( 8 ) neglecting powers of beyond the first for moderate adsorptions .
This new expression ( 8 ) is evidently the equation for the adsorption the relation between and ( or ) at constant temperature .
It is now necessary to examine to what extent equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) represent the results of observation , and thus to find how far the assumptions made in the simple theory are justified by experiment .
For this purpose we will lo.ok at some adsorption isosteres and isotherms , and find ( i ) how far A and are independent of temperature ; ( u ) to what extent powers of beyond the first may be neglected in ( 8 ) .

It is as a rule difficult to obtain observations of an adsorption isostere over a very wide stretch of temperature .

The method of interpolation is not that suggested by the equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) above , and hence there is introduced a small unknown error .
Wherever possible the author has evaluated by from observations at low temperatures the saturation adsorption which is denoted by in the Tables .

Gases at Low an The close agreement of the theoretical formula with experiment is shown by the very numerous observations of Chappuis*contained in Table These are probably the most accurate existing data at any one temperature .
They illustrate also the systematic increasing deviation between the calculated and observed values when the adsorption becomes great .
The ence otherwise appears to be within the limits of error of observation of the pressure and is nowhere large , save initially , and here an error of only cm .

The Adsorption of Table continued .
In view of the use that the author has made the equation ( 8 ) in extrapolating to the value of at zero concentration , discussed at length in Part III , it is of interest to examine the complete curve .
This is presented in fig. 3 , which is based upon the author 's on sulphur dioxide at-10o C. , that is , 16 C. below its critical point .
It will be seen that there are three portions\mdash ; A to to to D\mdash ; any one of which might be approximately represented by a straight line .
In the case of gases below their critical temperature the portiou AB becomes very steep , and extrapolation to A is difficult .
This is shown by ammonia in the case of the observations of Titoff and of Richar even above the critical temperature , and hence in these cases the equation ( 8 ) cannot be used for extrapolation .
In the other cases examined , mainly gases above their critical temperature , the portion A to is very nearly rectilineaL and extrapolation is consequently justifiable for observations up to 30 per cent. of the saturation adsorption , and is exemplified in the case of ethylene fig. 4 , in Part III .

1 .
The theoretical form of the adsorption isostere is deduced and found to be where and A are functions of only .
2 .
The agreement with observation for gases above or near the critical temperature is satisfactory .
3 .
The theoretical form of the adsorption isotherm is deduced and found to be where and are functions of the temperature only .
4 .
The agreement with observation up to moderate adsorptions of gases above their critical temperature is satisfactory .
