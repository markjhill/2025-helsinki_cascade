311 They hold that the successive restorations of colour are due to fresh supplies of chromogen being produced by the plant under the influence of the hot water , and that each fresh amount is then oxidised to anthocyanin .
We suggest that these phenomena are explained by the fact that though a certain amount of pigment diffuses out into the water , a large proportion of that which was originally present is retained by the coagulated proteins of the petals , of course in the colourless state .
It is the successive liberation of fractions of this retained pigment that accounts for the fresh production of colour in hot water , and not a new formation of chromogen .
On the Heat Production Associated with Muscular By R. T. Glazebkook , M.A. , F.R.S. , and D. W. Dye , B.Sc. ( Received December 1 , 1913 , \#151 ; Read January 22 , 1914 .
) On reading Prof. Macdonald 's paper it appeared that it might be interesting to see if his results connecting the heat production and muscular work could be expressed graphically or by means of some simple formula .
The tables in his paper give the heat production in calories per hour of a number of individuals \yhen doing a carefully measured amount of mechanical work on a kind of treadmill or cycle .
This amount of work is kept constant for each group of observations in the paper .
Table I gives his average results .

H0 is clearly the heat produced when the mechanical work done is zero , and arises from the motion of the limbs and the processes occurring in the body .
The fourth column of the table gives the results calculated from the formula .
But this is only an average result .
It was clear from Prof. Macdonald 's figures that the relation depended on the person doing the work , and we proceeded to plot the corresponding curves for the various individuals .

very large in each case for a given individual , the relation between heat and work is satisfied by a linear equation and can be expressed by the above formula , with the difference , however , that H0 and A depend on the individual and are not the same for all the persons tested .

The quantity A , measures the slope of the curve .
The next step was to investigate the relation , if any , between the quantities Ho and Xand the weight of the man denoted by M and measured in kilogrammes .
On plotting the values of A against the mass in kilogrammes as is done in fig. 3 , we found that the points again lay very well on a straight line and that the equation to this line was given by \ = 0-08 + 0-003 M. ( 3 ) Fig. 3.\#151 ; Relation between mass M and X ( slope of lines in fig. 2 ) .

) ( Abstract .
) In the absence of any detailed knowledge of the geology of the Wyre Forest Coalfield , the area may be temporarily sub-divided into four regions .
Fossil floras are described from three of these : from the horizon of the Sweet Coals in the Highley area in the north , from the unproductive beds of the Dowles Valley in the centre , and from the horizon of the Sulphur Coals of the Southern or Mamble area .
On the evidence of the plants the Sweet Coal Series is shown to belong to the Middle Coal Measures , while the Sulphur Coal Series , overlying the Sweet Coals unconformably , belongs to a higher horizon , the Transition Coal Measures .
The Dowles Valley unproductive measures are shown to be Middle Coal Measures , which are there over 1000 feet in
