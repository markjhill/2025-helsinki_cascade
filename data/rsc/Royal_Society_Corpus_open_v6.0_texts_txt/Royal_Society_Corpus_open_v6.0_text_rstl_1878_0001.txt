I have discussed McCLINTOCK'S observations on the Tides of Port Kennedy , using only the Heights and Tim\amp ; of High and Low Water , as I wished to follow the same method in comparing all the Tidal observations in the Arctic Seas .
Although I adopted this method for the purpose of comparison , I was well aware that I had not exhausted all the information at my disposal , for McCLINTOCK'S observations were made hourly during 23 days , and I used of these observations only those in the neighbourhood of H.W. and L.W. of Diurnal and Semidinrnal Tides .
I shall now discuss the observations , with the aid of FOURIER'S Theorem , so that all the observations made at every hour of each day shall enter into the constants determined for that day .
If denote the height of the tide , observed at every hour of the day , we have by FOURIER'S Theorem .
