300 On the Value of the Secular Acceleration of the Mean Longitude of the Moon .
By E. Nevill , F.R.S. ( Received October 29 , 1918 .
) It is known that Hansen employed 12T8 " for the value of the secular acceleration of the mean longitude of the Moon , instead of the value 618 " deduced from theory , for the reason that the results of his theoretical development could not be brought by any smaller value into accord with the observations of the early solar eclipses and the later Greenwich observations .
Later research has shown that these early solar eclipses can be as well represented by the theoretical value of the secular acceleration as by the empirical value employed by Hansen in his tables , and the present note will suffice to show that the more modern observations can also be represented by the theoretical value of the secular acceleration , thus serving to reconcile theory and observation .
The basis of these results is the complete reduction of the entire available series of lunar observations made since 1620 , the details of which have been awaiting publication since 1902 , and which has been utilised for obtaining a comparison between the observed values and the results of the theoretical investigation of the terms of long period on the motion of the Moon .
The mean of the observed errors of the tabular place of the Moon for each year does not adequately show the true mean error in mean longitude , for it must be corrected for the effects of the outstanding errors in the tabular coefficients of shorter period .
If Su = the observed mean error in longitude , St = the error in the tabular values of the motion in mean longitude , Ps = the error in the tabular value of the coefficient of the parallactic inequality , A " Ac = the errors in the tabular values of the coefficients of the sine and cosine of the mean anoma , Ms , Mc = the errors in the tabular values of the coefficients of the sine and cosine of the annual equation , S = the difference between the tabular and observed values of the semi diameter of the Moon , I = the increment in the true semi diameter of the Moon due to the effects of irradiation , Secular Acceleration of the Mean Longitude of the Moon .

In this manner there are eliminated from the values of the errors in longitude , not only the effects of the errors in the tabular coefficients of the mean anomaly and annual equation , but of every term , known or unknown , which have arguments differing from them by quantities having a period of some dozen or more years , which includes every term due to the perturbations of the planets save those of long period in the mean longitude .
By these means there were deduced the true yearly values of the error in mean longitude , values which may differ by some seconds of arc from the mean of the observed errors in longitude of the tables .
It is these values which are given in the following Table as the " Error of Hansen 's tabular mean longitude , " and denoted by H:\#151 ; Year .

It remains to compare these values with the changed tabular values of the error in mean longitude formed by replacing Hansen 's adopted values of the motion in mean longitude and its secular acceleration by the use of the theoretical value of the secular acceleration and mean motion in longitude as changed in consequence of the alteration in the value of the secular acceleration .
These changed values are given under the heading Ha in each case for the mean of five-year groups of observed values , in order to economise space .
It is obvious that these residuals .
Ha , between the corrected tables and observation , do not admit of any further alteration in either the value of the secular acceleration or the motion in mean longitude or its theoretical acceleration .
They establish clearly that there is no discordance between the theoretical and observed values of the secular acceleration in the motion of the Moon in mean longitude , and that in consequence there is no evidence of tidal retardation in the rotation of the Earth .
Given an ocean covering the whole surface of the Earth , where it would be possible to have a tidal current travelling round and round its circumference , then a tidal retardation in the rotation of the Earth would be conceivable , though even then it would appear that its amount must be very small .
But under the real condition of the surface , the existence of the great barriers to such a motion formed by the two Americas , and again by Eastern Asia and Australia , would prevent any such current and enormously diminish any possible effect .
More , could any such effect arise .
Except near the boundaries of the continents , does the tidal action of the Moon change the position of any particle of the water of the oceans by more than a very slow vibratory motion , incapable of causing any sensible tidal friction ?
Hence it would appear that , had there been any evidence of a tidal retardation in the rotation of the Earth , its origin could only be looked for in the existence of tides in the solid body of the Earth , and could any tides of such character be other than very minute and capable of producing only insensible effects ?
The large outstanding periodical errors are due to Hansen 's erroneous values of the terms of very long period , and disappear as soon as these are replaced by their correct values .
