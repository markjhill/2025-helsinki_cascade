( Abstract .
) The object of this investigation was to obtain a method for determining thermal conductivities of metals , which would not require either elaborate preparations or large quantities of the substances to be tested , and by means of which a test could be made in a few hours .
The method about to be described was suggested by Lord Kelvin thirty years ago , and is the experimental realisation of the theoretical conditions implied in the fundamental formula .

The apparatus was made so as to be suitable to test the metals m the form of wires of circular section .
The diameters found most convenient were [ from 2 to 4 mm. , the lengths from 4 to 8 cm .
One end of a given length of the wire is kept at a constant known temperature .
The rise of temperature of the other end of the wire is noted every minute , and , if proper precautions be taken to prevent loss by radiation from the sides , the data are obtained for calculating the thermal conductivity .
The wire to be tested is soldered at one end into the bottom of a copper box , 16 cm .
long , 6 cm .
wide , and 7 cm .
deep .
The bottom of the box is made of copper 3 mm. thick , the sides of thin sheet copper .
In the box , immediately above the hole , into which the wire is soldered , there is a large block of copper , in which a hole has been i. made sufficiently large to admit a small thermometer .
The box is filled with water and supported at its middle by being fitted into an asbestos-lined wooden screen , 24x24 cm .
The water is heated by a Bunsen burner placed on the other side of the screen 200 Mr. J. H. Gray .

JSTo heat can therefore be communicated directly to the wire from the lamp .
In the bottom of the box above the lamp a number of thick copper pins is fixed , so as to catch and distribute the heat .
3 mm. length of the other end of the wire is soldered into a solid copper ball , diameter 5-5 cm .
In the ball a hole 3 cm .
deep is made , so as to admit the bulb and part of the stem of a small and very sensitive thermometer .
This thermometer is graduated from 5 ' C. to 20 ' C. , and can be easily read to within one-fortieth of one degree .
The bulb is surrounded by water .
To prevent radiation from the surface of the wire , a tube of circular section , diameter 1 cm .
, made of several layers of thin paper , surrounds the wire all along its length .
The air inside this tube soon takes up the temperature of the part of the wire with which it is in contact , and so practically eliminates radiation .
A rough calculation gives for the maximum value of the loss due to radiation , 5'5 per cent , when the surface of the wire is exposed to the air , the length being 4 cm .
Unless the paper tube is effective , the error due to radiation ought to be greater , the greater the length .
Exhaustive trials , however , proved that different lengths gave practically the same value for the conductivity .
The other possible errors , besides radiation , to be tested for are : \#151 ; ( 1 ) The thermometer in the hot water may not indicate the temperature of the end of the wire .
( 2 ) The solder may cause some error .
( 3 ) The thermometer in the ball may not indicate the average temperature .
( 4 ) There may be a lag in the thermometer .
( 5 ) The temperature of the ball may not be the same throughout , and the thermometer may not indicate the temperature of the wire where it enters the ball .
All these errors are practically tested by using different lengths or diameters of the wire , and the results obtained in the present investigation indicate that the errors have been eliminated .
To test whether the thermometer in the hot water indicated the temperature at the end of the wire , a thermo-electric junction , made of very thin platinoid and copper wires , was soldered to the wire just where it entered the box .
The other junction was tied to a thermometer and immersed in water , which was heated till there was no deflection in the sensitive mirror galvanometer which was used .
The temperature indicated by the thermometer was then found to be the same as that of the thermometer in the hot water .
An approximate calculation for the other end of the wire shows that the temperature of that end is somewhat lower than that of the ball , the greatest difference being T5 per cent. This difference was 1894 .

\#171 ; In order to make a complete test of a metal it is only necessary to take a wire of 5 or 6 cm .
length and solder it firmly , the one end into the bottom of the heating box , the other into the calorimeter ball .
The water in the heating box is kept boiling briskly , and readings are taken every half minute from the thermometer in the ball .
These readings are then put upon a curve as ordinates , with the time in minutes as abscissae .
From this curve the rise of temperature per unit time can then be accurately read off , and , the thermal capacity of the ball being already determined , the flow of heat per unit time is obtained .
In order to eliminate radiation from the surface of the calorimeter ball , the latter is , at the beginning of the experiment , cooled to about 6 ' or 7 ' C. below the temperature of the air , or rather of the water-jacket .
which surrounds the ball .
Let a be the quantity of heat that passes from the surface of the ball , when the latter is 0 ' above or below the temperature of the water-jacket ; QL the quantity of heat that flows into the ball at the temperature 6 ' above that of the water-jacket ; Q2 the quantity that flows in when the ball is 0 ' below that of the jacket ; T the temperature of the hot end of the wire .
Then if k is the mean conductivity , Qi \#151 ; *(T \#151 ; + \#151 ; at , Q2 \#151 ; K ( T \#151 ; -f- + 2 ( Qi +Q2 ) = : k ( T\#151 ; If , therefore , the rise in temperature per half minute at 0 ' above that of the water-jacket be taken from the curve and added to the rise for 0 ' below the temperature of the jacket , the quantity ^(Qi + Qa ) is obtained , and is the flow of heat when the temperatures of the ends of the wire are TJ and t ' 0 .
, the radiation from the ball being thus eliminated .
If ten or fifteen of these values be taken from the curve and the mean found , a very accurate result is obtained .
It is thus immaterial whether the surface of the ball changes between each test , as long as it remains constant during the test .
The metal which was chiefly used for the exhaustive tests of the method was copper wire , of diameter 0-21 cm .
, density 8'85 , volume specific ( electrical ) resistance at about 13 ' C. 1834 in absolute units .
The number obtained for the absolute value of the thermal conduc-tivity was 0'88838 C.G.S. units , which was the mean of the values for different lengths of from 4 to 7 cm .
, the greatest variation being a little over 1 per cent. 202 Thermal Conductivity of Metals .
[ June 14 The greatest value obtained for copper was 0'9594 C.G-.S .
units which was for wire obtained from Messrs. Glover and Sons .
The specific ( electrical ) resistance was found to be 1730 .
It must be noted that these values are the means of the conductivities corresponding to the temperatures at the ends of the wire .
When compared with the values obtained by other experimenters , the results of the latter must be taken for the mean of 97 ' C. and 10 ' C. that is 53 ' C. For this temperature Angstrom gives 0'9208 .
Several qualities of copper were tested , as well as pure gold , silver , and platinum , kindly lent for the investigation by Messrs. Johnson , Matthey , and Co.

The results did not , however , prove that the ratios were always the same , although in some cases they agreed very closely .

] While , however , these numbers agree very closely , other wii'es were tested in which the numbers varied considerably .
It is intended to go on with tests of alloys , such as platinoid and German silver ; also , by using liquids other than water , to obtain , values of the variation of conductivity with temperature .
