( Abstract .
) The observations discussed in this paper were taken at the Colaba Ob-i servatory during the years 1867 to 1870 , and consist of observations of j Dip , Declination , and Horizontal Intensity .
The principal results deduced j by the author from these observations are shown in the following statement:\#151 ; Magnetic element .
Epoch .
Value at epoch .
Value at common epoch , January 1st , 1869 .
Secular change .
Per annum .
Semiannual inequality .
Excess of April to September over mean of year .
Calculated probable error of a single weekly determination .

Total Force In column 2 is entered the mean epoch to which the mean value of each element , entered in column 3 , corresponds .
The absolute observations were taken at a height of 38 feet above the ground ; and by comparing them with observations taken with differential instruments at a height of 6 feet above the ground , they are shown to in-I dicate distinctly a diminution of terrestrial magnetic action with increase of height , with respect both to secular variation of Declination and Hori-j zontal Force , and to diurnal inequality of Horizontal Force .
