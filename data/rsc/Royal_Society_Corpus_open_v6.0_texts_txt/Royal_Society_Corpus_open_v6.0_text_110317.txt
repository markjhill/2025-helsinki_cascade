The substance called the false tongue , which is thrown out from the mouth of the foal , either at the period of birth , or shortly before it , and to which various whimsical uses and virtues have been assigned , is conceived by the author to be requisite in this animal for the action ofsucking , in consequence of its not respiring through the mouth , but altogether through the nasal passages : an instinctive feeling prompting it to supply the loss of that substance by sucking the teat of the mother .
Dr. Prout , who analysed a portion of this substance at the request of the author , finds it to be composed principally of coagulated albumen slightly modified .
The author regards it as a secretion from the tongue of the foal .
