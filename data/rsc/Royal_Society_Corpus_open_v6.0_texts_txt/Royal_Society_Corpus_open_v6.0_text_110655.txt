" Additional Experiments on the formation of Alkaline and Earthy Bodies by chemical action when carbonic acid is present.* ' By Robert Rigg , Esq. , F.R.S. The author gives a detailed account of several experiments in which sugar , water , and yeast only were employed , and from which he deduces the conclusion that alkaline and earthy matters are form ?
ed by chemical action .
In one set of experiments , some of which were made in silver , others in china , and others in glass apparatus , after the vinous fermentation had gone on during five days , the quantity of ashes obtained was , in the silver apparatus eighteen , in the china nineteen , and in the glass fifteen times greater than the previous quantity .
A further examination of these ashes showed that they consisted of potass , soda , lime , and a residue not acted upon by muriatic acid .
The author states that , however irreconcilable to our present chemical knowledge this important conclusion may at first sight appear , yet when it is taken in connexion with the decomposition of other vegetable matter , and with the phenomena which accompany the growth of plants , it may not excite surprise ; and may be regarded as in harmony with the phenomena of natural science .
He concludes by offering suggestions towards extending the inquiry into the subject of the formation of bones of animals by the action of the powers inherent in their organization .
