( Abstract .
) Platinum plates immersed in sulphuric acid and water , as in a decomposition-cell , require a potential of about 1*7 Daniell 's cell to decompose the water ; with potentials of less amount the platinum plates can be ' charged and discharged like condensers .
They have enormous electrostatic capacity .
Mercurial surfaces equally admit of polarization with hydrogen .
A surface of mercury in dilute sulphuric acid , when made negative to the water by means of a powerful battery , flattens out .
If the mercury be replaced by an amalgam of proper consistency , the flattening out is increased ; the reversal of the current restores the amalgam to its original dimensions .
By reversing the process , electric currents can be obtained from mechanical force .
A large vessel on a board has within it two shallow funnels , which are connected by means of glass tubes with similar vessels outside of the large one .
Pure mercury is poured into the funnels until they and the outside vessels are one-third filled .
By tilting the board , mercury runs into the one funnel and out of the other , and thus the surface in the one is made to increase while that in the other decreases .
Dilute sulphuric acid is poured into the larger vessel so as to cover the two funnels ; the latter are connected together through a galvanometer .
If the mercury be pure and free from polarization , the tilting of the board produces no electric current .
On polarizing one of the surfaces with hydrogen by a battery , it gives rise to a current through the galvanometer , and thus shares the polarization over the two surfaces .
If the battery be removed , on augmenting the one surface and diminishing the other , a current of electricity is seen to pass through the galvanometer .
A convenient method of showing this experiment on a large scale is to procure a gutta-percha trough 4 inches deep and 4 by 2 inches broad .
A partition of the same material 2 inches high divides the lower half into two separate chambers : these are partly filled with mercury ; amalgamated platinum plates , hung from a balance-lever , dip into the mercury .
On depressing one set of plates the others are elevated , and thus the mercurial surface exposed to the fluid is alternately augmented and diminished to a large amount .
Twelve of these arranged in series give a current of rather more potential than one cell of DanielFs battery when the mercury is polarized with hydrogen .
The addition of a minute fragment of zinc to the mercury maintains the polarization for a very long time , and the power is considerably increased thereby .
When a large surface of mercury ( 25 circular inches ) has been polarized with a power of half a Daniell 's cell and is rapidly reduced to the diameter of inch , by letting the mercury flow out 244 Mr. C. F. Varley o Polarization of [ Jan. 12 , of the funnel , some bubbles of hydrogen gas appear just as the last of the mercury is running out , the decrease of surface evidently augmenting the potential sufficiently to decompose the water : floating a small piece of platinum on the mercury renders this phenomenon much more distinct .
All attempts to polarize the mercury with oxygen have failed to give a current .
By depolarizing the mercury with a battery until no current is generated by varying the dimensions of the exposed mercury surface , a metallic surface neutral to the fluid is obtained .
The second part of the paper refers to the electrostatic capacity of platinum plates in dilute acid and water .
In order to determine this point , it is necessary to use sensitive , rapidly oscillating , reflecting galvanometers of very small resistance .
The author has succeeded in measuring the charge which a square inch of platinum exposed to another square inch of platinum surface receives from potentials varying from 0-02 of a Daniell 's cell up to 1*6 Daniell 's cell .
From a potential of 0*02 to 0 08 the capacity remains sensibly constant ; that is , the discharge from the plates varies directly as the potential .
When the potential increases beyond 0'08 , the charge which the plates receive increases in a greater ratio , the capacity being 3*3 ( in one experiment ) and 3'1 ( in another experiment ) times as great with a potential of 1*6 as it was with the potential of 0*1 .
There is great difficulty attending accurate determination of the latter amounts ; but the author expects that this increase of capacity will be found to vary as the square root of the potential .
The capacity of the platinum plates with varying powers is shown in the accompanying Tables .
The author thinks these experiments tend to show that the fluid does not actually touch the platinum plate , but is separated from it by a film , which film , if a pure gas , must be less than the 1,000,000,000 Par^ an lnc^* when very small potentials are used .
This distance decreases as the potential rises .
Inasmuch as two surfaces equally electrified with the opposite electricities attract each other with a power varying inversely as the square of the distance , the experiment would seem to indicate that at very small distances the platinum repels the water with a power varying inversely as the cube of the distance .
The phenomena of electrification render accurate determinations of the capacity extremely difficult .
The fact of the phenomena of electrification being present , leads the author to think that the separating film ( if such a film exists ) is not a pure gas , but has five or more times as much electrostatic capacity as pure gas .
A useful inference drawn from the above experiments is the impossibility of working through any considerable length of uninsulated wire in the ocean .
The French Atlantic cable from Brest to St. Pierre works , upon the average , tea words per minute ; the author calculates that a solid conductor of the same weight per mile as that used between the above stations must be reduced to a length of less than 1100 yards in order that the rate of signalling through it shall be not slower than through 2500 miles of 1871 .
