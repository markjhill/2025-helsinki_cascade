On a Case of nervous Affection cured by Pressure of the Carotids ; with some physiological Remarks .

] In the year 1788 Dr. Parry published , in the Memoirs of the Medical Society of London , an account of many symptoms , such as headache , vertigo , mania , dyspnoea , convulsions , and others usually denominated nervous , that had been removed by pressure on the carotid arteries , which the author conceives to have operated by diminishing a too violent impulse of blood into the vessels of the brain , and thereby obviating excessive irritation .
From various cases which have occurred to Dr. Parry since that period , he selects one which appears to him to afford a singular illustration of the principle .
It is that of a lady , who , after having been exposed to severe cold for some time , was seized with numbness of the left side , succeeded by tingling of the left hand , and deafness of the left ear , succeeded by excessive sensibility to sound .
These were followed by a feeling of contraction or stiffness of various muscles of that side , and subsequently flutterings and twitchings of the flexor muscles of the fore-arm and of the deltoid ; not , however , so as to move her arm or hand .
The rate of these vibrations was usually about 80 in a minute ; but were much increased from any slight cause of general irritation .
Upon examination of the carotids , they seemed to be somewhat dilated , for about half an inch in length ; but in other parts they were not larger than natural .
The involuntary motions , which in this lady were confined to the left side , were not in any degree affected by pressure of the carotids on that side ; but when the right carotid was strongly compressed , all the vibrations were uniformly stopped ; which , says the author , hardly could occur but from removal of undue pressure of the brain , and consequent excessive irritation .
