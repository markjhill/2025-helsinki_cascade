Dear Sir , I Communicate to you the following paragraph from a letter written to me by the Rev. William Borlase , L L. D. and F. R. S. of Ludgvan , near Pensance , in Cornwall , and bearing date November 23 last past .
As it is a paragraph relative to the native tin found in Cornwall , which I had the honour to communicate to the Royal Society on the 6th of March last , and is ordered to be printed ; permit me to beg of you to read it at the meeting to-morrow , that , if judged worthy by the Committee of papers , it may be printed with the former paper as a part of it .

EXTRACT .
Mr. Henry Rosewarne , of Truro , says , that when he sent the first specimen ( presented to the Royal Society by me William Borlase , and now lodged in their Museum ) he mentioned as a proof of its being native tin , that between the ore and the tin there was a mixture of quartz : but , upon a nearer examination and some trials with aqua fortis , he and another person found it was not quartz .
At last , on melting a piece , he perceived no small quantity of arsenic to be mixed with it , and therefore suspected that the white parts which had passed for quartz were nothing but arsenic .
Accordingly he scraped off a little of it and put it on a red hot iron , where it immediately caught fire , and evaporated into smoke , leaving behind it the most poisonous stench they ever smelt .
This confirmed some , who had hitherto doubted , in the most firm belief that it really was native tin and genuine , it being impossible for tin to be melted and the arsenic left untouched .
