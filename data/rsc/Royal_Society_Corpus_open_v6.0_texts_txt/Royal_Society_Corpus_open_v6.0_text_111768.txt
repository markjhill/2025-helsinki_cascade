II " On the Value of Steam in the Decomposition of neutral Fatty Bodies .
" By GEORGE WILSON , Esq. Communicated by WARREN DE LA RUE , Esq. Received November 30 , 1854 .
In the course of a long series of experiments conducted on a large scale , the author has observed that the so-called neutral fatty bodies may be resolved , without danger of injurious decomposition , into glycerine and fatty acids , provided the still is maintained at a uniform high temperature , and that a continuous current of steam is admitted into it .
The temperature required to effect the splitting of the fats into their proximate elements varies with the nature of the body itself , but all hitherto tried may be resolved into glycerine and fatty acid at a temperature of 560 ?
Fahr. , many at much below that temperature .
At a further period it is the author 's intention to lay before the Society a detailed account of his experiments , with the confirmatory analyses , but in the mean time he states that palm oil , cocoanut oil , fish oil , animal tallow , Bornean vegetable tallow , " Japan vegetable wax " ( more properly tallow ) , and several others have yielded satisfactory results , the fatty acid and glycerine distilling over together , but no longer in combination , and separating in the receiving vessel .
