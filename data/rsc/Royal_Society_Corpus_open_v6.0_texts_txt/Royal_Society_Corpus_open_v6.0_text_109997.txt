Extract of a Letterfrom Captain Basil Hall , R.N. F.R.S. to William HydeWollaston , M.D. V.P.R.S. containing Observations of a Comet seen at Valparaiso .
Read January 10 , 1822 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1822 , p. 46 .
] The comet described in Captain Hall 's letter was visible for 33 days in the months of April and May , 1821 .
During the first week its nucleus was bright and distinct ; but being then in the interior of the country , he did not commence observing it till the 8th of April , when its nucleus had become so indistinct as to render its measurement by the micrometer uncertain .
On its first appearance , the comet appeared of a dull white , and its tail presented a dark streak between its sides , giving it the appearance of being split .
On the second evening the tail subtended an angle of 70 , reaching to p Ceti ; on the seventh the nucleus was less bright , and the tail shorter , arising , probably , from the increased distance of the comet .
The tail was at first nearly at right angles to the horizon , but each succeeding night it inclined more to the south .
Tables of the observations and some sketches of the appearance of this comet accompany Captain Hall 's communication .
