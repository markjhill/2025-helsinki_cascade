" A brief Account of the Thesaurus Siluricus , ' with a few facts and inferences .
" By J. J. BIGSBY , M.D. Communicated by Sir R. I. MURCHISON , Bart. Received January 28 , 1867 .
I have been led to attempt the preparation of a general view of Silurian life , as far as now known , by my own frequent want of such a record or muster-roll of the constituent members of this great initiatory division of palaeozoic zoology , -a task which has been made pleasant by some personal knowledge of two countries rich in the earlier formations .
I have been further encouraged by the great accumulations of the last few years , through the establishment in North America and elsewhere of numerous colleges , each of them having become the centre of more or less field-work .
Far more aid still has been derived from many public surveys on a tolerably liberal scale .
Nor can we forget the highly meritorious and successful labours which have been , and still are , carried on by private individuals in almost every part of Europe and North America .
As this undertaking required an exactitude and a critical skill in determining species and genera according to late improvements in classification , much beyond an ordinary acquaintance with Silurian life , after my materials were put together , I obtained the very valuable aid of Mr. J. W. Salter , late Palmontologist at the London Museum of Practical Geology .
I was then , through the kindness of Sir Roderick I. Murchison , Bart. , ,allowed to submit my manuscript to Robert Etheridge , Esq. , F.R.S.E. , 372 [ Feb. 21 the present Palceontologist to the Institution over which Sir Roderick presides .
To the careful superintendence of these two eminent naturalists I am indebted for corrections and suggestions of the greatest importance , and particularly as relates to Britain and to Europe generally .
My matter has been principally found in the voluminous and truly priceless writings of Murchison , Sedgwick , Barrande , Sowerby , DeVernenil , James Hall , McCoy , Salter , Billings , Angelin , Eichwald , Shumard , and Davidson--together with those of other authors , some of whom are scarcely of inferior merit* .
I have been favoured with many unpublished contributions from my friends Mr. Billings ( the learned Paleeontologist of the Canadian Survey ) and Principal Dawson , F.R.S. , of McGill College , Montreal , also , through the kindness of Mr. Salter , from the Himalayas ( Colonel Strachey , R.E. ) , from West Tasmania ( Dr. Milligan ) , from South Wales ( Henry Hicks , Esq. ) , and from the late Mr. Wyatt-Edgell .
I propose to give to this effort the name of " Thesaurus Siluricus .
" Besides its use for general reference in the closet and in the quarry , the ' Thesaurus ' provides a high station from which the student may obtain a broad survey of the Silurian populations of the whole earth .
It will assist in tracing the extent , shape , and varying depths of areas , in discovering regional affinities , differences , and those great zoological severances which we call breaks .
By its aid we may compare horizons remote from each other , and , moreover , note the frequent changes of many kinds which take place while the epoch is working out its long history .
It .
will place under our examination numberless communities of life , their constituents , habits , rise , and decline .
The 'Thesaurus ' points to the universality ( as defined ) at times proximate everywhere , brings into prominence the riches , magnitude , and wide diffusion of the Primordial stage ; illustrates the power of locality over life , and opens out the wonderful march of geographic dispersion through obstacles innumerable .
For a long period naturalists have been arranging the life of the globe into species , genera , orders , &amp;c. , with a view to the establishment of types as standards of comparison .
It is from such data , well considered and generally acknowledged , that this ' Thesaurus ' has been compiled .
As long as an individual mollusk remains unregistered it is deprived of its full usefulness ; but even then it may reveal an important fact--as the trilobite speaks of the Palaeozoic period , and a nummulite of the Tertiary .
Until some such record as the present is available , the labours of many living investigators ( whose names rise to the lips spontaneously ) will rest comparatively fruitless .
It has hitherto not been possible to consider widely scattered existences in an aggregate form .
Facts ( many ) have been stored up separately ; but generalized truths have been rarely attained .
This has not yet been done in a satisfactory manner , not even by Bronn or Goldfuss for any one epoch , and scarcely for the cretaceous period by the American geologist Mr. Gabb , although he has done well .
This 'Thesaurus ' contains 7553 species , and therefore gives abundant scope for profitable study ; but probably it does not give the tithe of the whole Silurian life yet lying buried in the wilds of the Arctic Circle , of -Iudson 's Bay , Labrador , the two Americas , Scandinavia , Australia , India , &amp;c. &amp;c. The more accessible countries frequently , to this day , yield new forms , although the search for them is capriciously and idly conducted , and is dependent often on the accident of a new public work or the presence of a competent observer .
Many undescribed species are lying in local museums , still more in the great collection at Prague in the possession of a high Ecclesiastic in that city .
Owing to the enlightened perseverance of M. Barrande , a few small parishes close to Prague have yielded nearly one-third of the whole earth 's Silurian remains within present knowledge ; and the greater part of these are not met with elsewhere .
How wonderfully rich must be the universal Silurian fauna !
What a splendid promise to the future explorer !
The 'Thesaurus ' is in the form of a Table .
After mentioning the genus ( taken alphabetically ) , its author , and the date of its establishment , the species are successively named , and treated of under four or more heads , along one and the same ruled line .
First comes the part of the stage in which it occurs , then , in a given order , its author and locality , or localities , in the column indicative of its proper stage .
More information is thus conveyed , it is believed , than by any other form of Table .
The summary which is appended to each order shows some of the organic relations of the Silurian system in Europe and in America to each other ; it shows , too , how very little we know as yet of this epoch in Asia and Africa ; and , among other things , it tells us the numerical strength of the genera .
Permit me now to lay before the Society a few facts drawn from the mere surface of the ' Thesaurus , ' and only in the way of summary or brief remark , in order to suit the purpose of this evening .
Much more than this the careful registration of more than 50,000 facts has prevented me from doing .
The Table A ( page 375 ) gives the numerical amount of the Silurian flora and fauna as known in the years 1856 and 1866 respectively .

Universality .
In the spirit of the following definition , it would appear that the Silurian system is universal--that is , it overspreads the whble earth more or less completely , and that its component parts were laid down in a proximate time , -statements approved by M. Barrande , Bull .
n. s. xii .
361 .
Definition:-"A formation may be considered to be universal when it occupies large and small areas in very many parts of the earth , often 'remote from and even antipodal to each other , when it is always of like stratigraphical relations , is composed of like materials , and contains numerous genera in common , together with some representative and some identical species .
" In support of our application of this definition to the Silurian system , the 'Thesaurus ' exhibits the widest possible distribution of its fauna-a fauna , it must be remembered , which is pure from admixture with that of any other epoch which might possibly have been progressing at the same time .
The 'Thesaurns ' contains many examples of the same species being in twenty to twenty-five different countries , large and far apart the same creature or creatures marking the route from land to land .
Table B , drawn up under the inspection of Mr. Salter , presents 195 species common to regions very remote from each other , some of them being antipodal-a fact which tells the more forcibly from the tenacity with which a large part of Silurian life clings to locality as well as to horizon .
179 species are common to Europe and America .
Sixty Silurian genera have been brought from South Australia by Mr. Selwyn , the chief Geological Surveyor of that colony ; and Professor McCoy has met with in that country a Siphonotreta , a Phacops , and eighteen species of Graptolites absolutely identical with those of North America andc of Europe .
The Professor loudly expresses his surprise and delight .
According to M. Barrande , Orthoceras bullatum ( Sowerby ) is at MIelbourne ( Australia ) and in Ireland , Bohemia , Germany , and Russia .
Conocoryphe depressa is both in Wales and Texas , one of the American States .
Western Tasmania , the *Morris , Catal. p. 362 .
Himalayas , Russia , North and South America , and many other regions offer ample fossil evidence of the general presence of the constituents of this period .

65 195 The Silurian beds , it must be borne in mind , are usually visible in mere shreds and remainders , met with in any one place only as a stage or a part of a stage , the other portion being covered for perhaps thousands of square miles by more recent deposits , or removed by denudation ; or it may be that certain stages have never existed , as we see in Arctic America with respect to the Lower Stage ; while in the South , as in Sardinia , France , and Spain , it is the Upper Stage that is wanting , or very nearly so .
But the visible geographical spread of these strata is often very great , So extensive are the Silurian areas of North America ( 2000 miles across ) that it only needs a short and easy step to induce a belief in a former universal prevalence and domination of this system .
Sufficient territory resting on Silurian rocks has been spared from oscillatory action to enable us to trace it in one or other of its parts over a large part of the earth .
Wie follow it circuitously from England to Australia , or to America the interspaces being filled up either by sea , by newer rocks , or by kindred palmozoic strata , which themselves irresistibly bespeak its frequent continuous existence near at hand .
This is only a fragment of the argument in favour of the doctrine of Universality of epochs , as just defined .
Locality .
The 'Thesaurus ' brings conspicuously into view the great influence of ocality on the nature and amount of life , in the same way as we observe at the present time .
As each region yields up its fauna to the collector , much of that fauna is found to be new , the bond of connexion with other Silurian districts being in great measure generic .
The physical conditions of sea and land being necessarily local , produced as they are from time to time by agencies limited in space , the dwellers among these conditions must in a certain measure be local too , and typical-subject at any moment to removal .
The first occupants of any spot who shall point out ?
The maximum of life , meaning by that expression the largest combination of abundance , variety , and rank , is local .
It may take place at the beginning of a stage , or of an epoch , in the middle , or at the end , being governed principally by the nature of the sediment .
The rich Primordial beds of Western Newfoundland and of Quebec , the crowded Pleta beds of Russia and of Esthonia , the Trenton Limestone of America , the Mid-Silurian rocks of Bohemia* ( E. e. 1 , 2 ) , some of those of Wales , the Lower I-Ielderberg group of New York , are conspicuous examples of this .
Parts of the Llandovery stage of Wales and of New York ( U. S. A. ) present a great dearth of life , and for a well-known reason .
How barren are the vast accumulations of Lower Silurian in Bolivia , as at present believed !
The Potsdam Sandstone of the valleys of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi shows no signs of life for hundreds ( and perhaps thousands ) of square miles , save in small oases peopled chiefly by Lingulse in incalculable millions of individuals .
Nearly equal areas of Central North-east America ( N. latitudes 50 ?
-32 ?
) and Europe may have received about the same attention ; but the latter , so far , has proved the richer by above a thousand species , as we see in the subjoined Table C. TABLE C.-Known species of America and Europe compared .

34 964 931 3145 4325 The Cephalopoda , Crustacea , Brachiopoda , and Annelida of Europe appear to largely exceed in number of species those of North America , while in nine Orders ( see Table C ) the two hemispheres hold nearly equal quantities .
America greatly surpasses Europe in the number of its Crinoids , and to a smaller extent in Plantse and Gasteropoda .
I am not prepared with any inference from these facts .
We know that the mineral constitution , and the past externalI influences in these several parts of the earth are different-not that the first is as influential as has been supposed .
Many species are marked as undefined in the ' Thesaurus , ' because they are often only known by simple fragments .
About a thousand species have never been seen but in one locality .
At least 200 Cyrtocerata are huddled together in the two contiguous parishes of Lockhov and Kozorz , near Prague , and , with other mollusks there , are unknown elsewhere .
Other instances of this might be cited .
The two Silurian districts of Sardinia , with not a few fossils in common with Spain , although tolerably well examined by La Marmora and MBeneghini , have not hitherto produced a Trilobite ; nor has Spain given up a Pentamerus , as far as can be learnt .
Out of our sixty species of AsapAus only one is known in Bohemia .
Silurian fish are only mentioned as existing in Britain , Bohemia , and Russia ; but doubtless they are in other Silurian areas .
The Trilobite genus Diielocephahls of D. D. Owen contains thirty species .
Only three are found in two places .
Twelve species are near Quebec , and there only .
Nine others are Minnesotan , on the Upper Mississippi ; while the States of Texas and Vermont , on Lake Champlain , have each one , and Wales three-all distinct species .
Western Newfoundland , although primordial , is thought to be without this remarkable genus .
Each of the twenty-seven known species of the Heteropod Maclurea is confined to one spot ; twenty are American ; and of these , eleven are confined to Newfoundland West .
Of the forty-five species of the genus Trochoceras ( Cephalopoda ) , fortythree are restricted to the vicinity of Prague ; and of these twenty-seven inhabited the very small space of 4-6 square miles , in company with many other mollusks .
The Brachiopoda of Bohemia are mostly in the Fauna F , and in the two small districts of Konieprus and Mnienian .
Out of 270 species of Orthis only two are believed to be in Nova Scotia , and of the 109 species of the Gasteropod Murchisonia , again , two , but not one of the elsewhere most abundant genus Pleurotomaria .
On the other hand , Nova Scotia holds onerhalf of all our Cleidophora ; and Tasmania is singularly rich in Palhearca , while the Point Levi shales are crowded with the Graptolite family , of extreme beauty , and rarely found in other countries .
We further observe that , as it is with the horizontal disposition of Silurian life , so it is with the vertical : only twelve per cent. leave their native horizon , as we shall see .
hese few facts have been selected from many , to show the strong tendency to localization inherent in the Silurian fauna .
Primordial Stage .
The ' Thesaurus ' amply manifests the great extent of this stage , and the high significance of its teachings ; but we shall here only speak of a few leading facts relating to Canada , extracted from the 'Thesaurus ' itself .
While waiting for the results of field-work now in progress , Mr. Billings has treated this subject with his usual great ability in the first volume of the work entitled ' The Palaeozoic Fossils of Canada .
' The Primordial stage of Barranlde ( Taconic of Emmons ) is truly Silurian , and forms the base of that epoch .
In the valley of the St. Lawrence it may average 8600 feet in thickness .
Resting horizontally in America on the inclined Laurentian rocks , the lower break is complete in every respect ; while the upper break is very nearly so , although purely organic .
It divides naturally into Lower and Upper Primordial , -Potsdam sandstone constituting the former , and calciferous sandstone , with the enigmatical Quebec group , the latter , with a few layers of chazy limestone superadded .
The whole flora and fauna of the Primordial stage , American and European , amount to 919 species , while those of the St. Lawrence Valley alone are 560 .
The western , therefore , seems to be the richer of the two hemispheres ; and this comes out still more distinctly in stating the fact that the Primordial genera at present known in America are 134 , and those of all Europe 83 .
Table D ( below ) has been constructed from the ' Thesaurus .
' It exhibits numerically the zoological contents and the zoological relations of the several parts of the Primordial stage ; and we see that the differences are great .

22 11 28 2645 3 ... ... 6 ... 7953 176ll11 o 6C Great interest attaches to every part of this stage , but especially to the Quebec group and its ill-understood connexion with the immediately contiguous strata .
An intimate acquaintance with this group near Quebec leads me to believe that there , at least , it is a displaced , crumpled , and fractured mass of schist , with thin beds of limestone and calcareous conglomerate interleaved , the last crowded with molluscan and crustacean life .
It is above the Potsdam Sandstone , and on or near the horizon of Calciferous sandstone and the lower layers of Chazy Limestone ( Logan and Billings , Report , 1863 ) .
Into these ( with a distinct tendency still higher ) in other parts of North America , the Quebec group probably becomes fised , and assumes their horizontal position , mineral character , and many of their organic contents .
The fauna of the Quebec group , consisting of 327 species at Point Levi ( Quebec ) and in Western Newfoundland , is peculiar , and , of course , is only found there , with the exception of thirteen species found elsewhere in Calciferous sandstone , and eight in Chazy Limestone .
They are one-sixteenth of the whole , and are as follows : Calciferous Sandstone:-Lingulc Mantelli , Z. acuminata , L. Irene , Camreralla calcifera , IIelicotoma gorgonia , H. uniangulata , II .
perstriata , Pleurotomaria calcifera , P. postzmnia , LHolopcea dilucula ?
, Ecculionphalus Cancadensis , 3lurchisonia Anna , Piloceras Canadense ( Billings ) .
Chazy Limestone:-Eculiom3phalus Atlanticus , Maclurea Atlantica , Stromatopora compacta ( running into B+ BL ) , Clinacogr aptus antennarius , Ptilodictya fenestrata ?
, Leperditia amygdalina , Camerella varians , Cheirurus prolifcus ( Billings ) .
" This group contains , besides the thirteen species just enumerated , 174 allied to those of the Calciferous Sandstone of Central North America , or more or less westward of Montreal .
It is this which connects it closely with the sandstone .
However , 140 remain typical .
The fossils of Chazy Limestone met with in the Quebec group only belong to a few of the basement beds of the former , because these almost immediately , upwards , [ change into a compact mass of crushed Crinoids , Cephalopoda , Gasteropoda , &amp;c. ( 143 species)-all quite new , and alien from the life below .
The Calciferous Sandstone , always truly primordial , has in the Canadas and the United States of America 375 species , overspreading vast areas .
They may be separated into three sets:1 .
Thirteen enter the Quebec group .
2 .
One hundred and seventy-four are the allies of that group .
3 .
One hundred and eighty-eight are foreign to it , and for the most part typical .
Like its two sister groups , the Calciferous Sandstone is shown , in the middle line of Table D , to display a remarkable tendency to abound in complex and powerful existences , and to paucity in the simple species , in. .
These numbers aee for tl ?

_ , 00 II r o. i dividuals , nevertheless , being prodigiously numerous .
Trilobites are here very few .
Potsdam Sandstone is rich " in Trilobites , Brachiopoda , and Fucoids , but in every other form is very poor ; and yet it possesses a Cystid .
In the Primordial group , therefore , we find numerous representatives of nearly every marine Invertebrate ; and we have a startling example of the sudden development in very early times of the highest types of molluscan life , Nautili , Lituites , Trilobites , Protichnites , &amp;c. , dwelling , even then , in well adjusted communities .
Most of these facts are taken from the ' Thesaurus ; ' but this interesting portion of the 'Thesaurus ' itself is the gift of Barrande , Emmons , Hall , Logan , and Billings * , and is the fruit of their unwearied study in the city , and of their toil in the field .
Recurrence .
A few words on the subject of recurrence , or the vertical range of Silurian life .
What can be more unexpected , or more wonderful , than the upward passage by a filial succession , through stages and epochs , of a mollusk during centuries inconceivably numerous !
What an almost interminable series of posterities must have followed the first ancestor !
The doctrine of limited duration in species must have its exceptions .
The 'Thesaurus ' enumerates 803 recurrents , or 12 per cent. of the whole known life of the epoch-a very notable proportion , -still leaving 6200 species faithful to one horizon .
The synoptical Table E , compiled from the 'Thesaurus , ' exhibits many details , and may be trusted approximately , although about 400 species have been passed by for want of sufficient information .
It numbers sepa .
rately the species typical of one horizon , and the species frequenting more than one horizon ( being recurrent ) .
It also introduces some of the greater genera , such as Orthis , Murchisonia , &amp;c. The species are arranged under the heads " Primordial , " Lower , " " Middle , " and " Upper Silurian ; " and in the case of the recurrents the number of horizons occupied by them is shown by the figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .
Thus we find that 69 Lower Silurian Trilobites occupy two horizons , 15 three , and 2 five horizons .
The percentage is stated in the last column , next to that containing the total recurrence of each order .
The Primordial stage only gives 27 per cent. of recurrency .
The Lower Silurian ... ... . .
16 , , The Middle ... ... ... ... 20 , The Upper ... ... ... ... 8 , , The orders vary greatly in respect to recurrency .
There is none among fossil fish .
In Cystidea it is only 3 per cent. , in Gomphoceras 5 per cent. , and is greatest in Strophomena , 31 per cent. Although a considerable number of inferences have been prepared , I shall only venture now to introduce a few .
1 .
Recurrence is universal , both as to time and place .
2 .
Recurrences seem to be most numerous in the lower stages of the epoch ; but further research may teach otherwise .
3 .
Species do not often change their horizon , not even when placed in countries far apart .
4 .
The same species may be typical of a single horizon in one country and recurrent in another .
5 .
Recurrency shows that a mollusk is not necessarily confined to any one community , but may find a home and flourish in several successively .
t6 .
The number of recurrents measures the amount of change in conditions .
7 .
Communities , genera , and species disappear sporadically , except in the rare case of a catastrophe .
8 .
Recurrency is a measure of viability .
Extra-epochal Recurrence .
Few things demonstrate more plainly the sterner discipline now prevailing than the reduction by Mr. Salter to 133 of the 439 palEeozoic species which I had tabulated as extra-epochal , although they had the sanction of the best palaeontologists of the last fifteen or twenty years .
My Table , as originally made out , deals with the five palaeozoic epochs , but in this place only with the forty-two Silurian species which leave for the higher periods .
To these , recently , several interesting additions have been made .
I. These recurrents are mostly distinct from the intra-epochal , owing to their first appearance being in the Upper Silurian stage .
II .
With the exception of Chonetes sarcinulata , they all stop within the Devonian Period .
III .
The greater part of these recurrents are of low rank ; 20 are Brachiopoda ; 11 Zoophytes , 1 an Amorphozoa ; 7 are Gasteropoda ; 3 Cepllalopoda ; and 1 Trilobite .
Ml/ anon deform and Orthis rugosa , Lower Silurian fossils , reappear in Devonian , but not in Upper Silurian , where they are " presumably " -to use an expression of Mr. Etheridge .
IV .
These species are very migratory-few being found in two epochs in the same country , but in different countries .
V. Opportunities of escape into a new epoch have been common ; but the ways and means are frequently concealed by denudations , &amp;c. VI .
Acclimatization must have been necessary .
VII .
The length of individual life in proportion to specific extraepochal life is almost as a unit to infinity .

Geographical Distribution of Silurian Life .
The 'Thesaurus ' tends to show that North America , east of the Riocky Mountains , may probably be divided into two areas , the one to the north of 57 ?
( or of Lake Superior ) being chiefly Upper Silurian , resting on crystalline rocks , the one to the south of that line , down to the Gulf of Mexico , on the contrary , being fully developed in some part of this great space .
It exhibits the regrettable fact that Asia , Africa , and Australia , taken together , have hitherto yielded only 200 species of Silurian remains ; but this arises from the absence of exploration .
I have not yet had opportunity to bring together , harmonize , and compare the Silurian life of the several countries of Europe .
The accomplishment of such a task might produce some definite truths , and many more probabilities .
Either this vast region would prove to be one great Silurian area , with barriers here and there , and with certain channels of communication , and to be the result of many operations throughout a long interval of time ; or it might turn out that the Silurian deposits and their fossils occupy three separate areas:-(1 ) the Britanno-Scandinavian , which has all the three stages , and the Primordial ; ( 2 ) the Bohemian , at present of peculiar interest ; and ( 3 ) the middle and southern area , found in France , Spain , and Sardinia , almost wholly Lower and Mid-Silurian .
Under this head of geographical distribution we have to deal with some curious phenomena-such as concern birthplace or first appearance , generic and specific , the duration of life , tolerance of conditions , mineral habitats .
Migration possesses great interest , with its marks , causes , and modes , with its power , direction , and rate of progress , &amp;c. The transport or removal of dead organic matter from place to place , the " remaniement " of French geologists , is an important agency under several aspects , especially in the formation of extensive sheets of rock .
It now has become proper to bring to a close these few observations , or rather this enumeration of heads of Natural-History subjects , by express ing a confident hope that this compilation will find many and well qualified interpreters , and will be useful to geologists in general .
