" Description of a self-registering Thermometer and Barometer invented by the late James Coggan , Esq. , and bequeathed by him to the Royal Society .
" By Roderick Impey Murchison , Esq. , F.R.S. , V.P.G.S. , &amp;c. The self-registering thermometer usedby Mr. Coggan is of Six 's construction , and consists of a siphon tube , open at one extremity , and operating by the expansion and contraction of a large body of spirit pressing on a column of mercury in the lower bend of the tube .
On the other side of the wooden frame to which this thermometer is fixed , a siphon barometer is attached ; and both these instruments are made to act on iron-floats suspended by a thread , and counterpoised over a pulley .
Transverse wires are affixed to these threads , and are forced against a sheet of ruled paper on a frame , which from its connexion with a clock is advanced a certain space each day , by a spring hammer forming part of the striking machinery of the clock .
