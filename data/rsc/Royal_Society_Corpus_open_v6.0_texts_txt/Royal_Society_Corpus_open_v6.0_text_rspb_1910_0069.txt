) Part I.\#151 ; On the Action of Salts in Heterogeneous Systems , and on the Nature of the A. General Theory and Results .
During the course of some investigations on the action of formaldehyde on the proteins , the-observation was made that this aldehyde , when added to an aqueous solution of Witte 's peptone , produces a precipitate , and that the reaction could be either partially or completely inhibited by the presence of neutral salts .
This phenomenon was also noticed some years ago by T. Sollman , * ' who offered no satisfactory explanation of the facts .
The more recent investigations of Sorensenf have shown that when formaldehyde reacts with amino-acids a methyleneimino-derivative is produced , which is readily hydrolysed in the presence of water , yielding the original amino-acid ' ' and formaldehyde .
The reaction is therefore a reversible one , and can be represented by the general equation ( NH2)RCOOH + HCHO ^ ( CH : N)R*COOH + H20 .
The amino-acid is only completely converted into the methyleneimino-derivative-in the presence of a large excess of formaldehyde , and the methyleneimino-acid thus produced is , in contrast to the amino-acid from which it was formed , so strongly acid that it can be titrated with caustic alkalis in the presence of phenolphthalein as indicator .

97 ; extension and application of those which had been obtained some years before by Schiff.* It was noticed that when formaldehyde was added to Witte 's peptone , and the reaction mixture was then titrated by the Sorensen method , the same amount of alkali was required for neutralisation both in the presence and absence of salts , i.e. whether the precipitate was formed or not .
In both cases , therefore , the formaldehyde had entered into reaction with the amino-groups in the peptone .
A clue to the nature of the phenomenon was afforded , however , by Schiff 's observation that asparagine , when treated with formaldehyde , yields a methyleneimino-derivative , which readily undergoes polymerisation or condensation in which more than one molecule takes part , with the formation of a complex insoluble compound.]- It was therefore conceivable that certain constituents of Witte 's peptone react in a similar way , and the experiments recorded in the succeeding communication indicate that the precipitate is formed from the most complex polypeptide constituents of the peptone .
If these be sufficiently complex as to be of colloidal nature , and to yield a solution which acts as a heterogeneous system , it is conceivable that adsorption of salts takes place on the surface of the colloidal molecules , and \#166 ; thus , by a kind of sterical inhibition , prevents the reaction of the large molecules with one another , to form , in the case under consideration , highly complex polymers.* The inhibitory action of salts on the polymerisation or condensation of the methyleneimino compounds was studied quantitatively in some detail ( see succeeding paper ) , and found to agree very closely ( with certain exceptions , which can be readily explained ) with their inhibitory action on the formation of the zinc protein compounds which are produced when zinc sulphate is added in small quantities to protein solutions .
S During the course of these investigations it was also noticed that a marked parallelism existed between the inhibitory action of salts on the formation * Liebig 's ' Annalen , ' 1901 , vol. 319 , p. 287 .

S The conditions of the reaction between zinc sulphate and protein solutions are somewhat complex and have been studied by Pauli ( Hofmeister 's ' Beitrage sir Physiol , u. Pathol .
Chem. , ' 1905 , vol. 6 , p. 233 ) .
He found that when egg-white solution of a given strength was mixed with zinc sulphate solution of varying concentrations , two maxima of precipitation occurred .
The amount of precipitate gradually increased when the concentration of the zinc salt rose from O'OOl to 0'05 normal .
As the concentration increased beyond this point , the amount of precipitate formed gradually diminished until a concentration corresponding to that of a normal solution was attained .
At this point 98 Dr. S. B. Schryver .
Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , of the precipitate produced when formaldehyde is added to Witte 's peptone and their capacity for dissolving the globulins , and this analogy suggested an explanation of the chemical character of this class of proteins , and of the fact that they are soluble in certain salt solutions , and insoluble in water .
From general considerations of the chemical characters of proteins and their hydrolysis products , it is conceivable that substances of this class can be either basic or acid in their nature , or that they can be truly amphoteric , and combine both acid and basic properties .
As members of the basic class , which yield on hydrolysis chiefly diamino-derivatives , the protamines may be cited as examples .
Other proteins of distinctly acid character are also known , in which class caseinogen and other phosphoproteins may be included , although such substances belong , strictly speaking perhaps , to the class of conjugated proteins .
The investigations of Hardy on serum globulin , * and of Osborne on edestin , f have shown that the globulins have both acid and basic functions .
If it be assumed that globulins contain both basic and acid groups in the molecule , and so situated stereochemically that internal neutralisation between these groups cannot take place , then it is possible that two molecules can enter into reaction with one another forming a complex according to the scheme\#151 ; * no precipitate whatever was produced , and no further precipitation occurred until the concentration of the zinc salt was twice normal .
The precipitate formed at the lower limits differed from that formed at the upper limits in that the former was irreversible ( i , e , did not redissolve on diluting or concentrating the solution ) , whereas the latter was reversible .
The precipitate formed at the lower limits is that of the zinc salt of the protein , whereas that formed at the upper limits is the ordinary protein precipitation by salts .
The following is suggested as a possible explanation of this action of zinc salts on proteins .
If the carboxyl groups.in the protein molecule are situated so far apart that the salt of the dyad metal cannot be formed by replacement of the hydrogen from two carboxyl groups of the same protein molecule , the zinc salt must be formed by the replacement from carboxyl groups from two molecules of protein , and be of the type Zn ( Alb)g .
This would be a larger aggregate than the original protein molecules .
If the zinc salt could be adsorbed , as well as enter into chemical reaction in the way described , it is conceivable the adsorbed molecules would surround the protein molecules and inhibit the chemical reaction in which two molecules ' of protein and one of zinc salt take part .
The phenomenon of the inhibition of the formation of zinc protein derivatives by excess of zinc sulphate is , if the explanation suggested above is correct , analogous to the inhibition of formation of complex methyleneimino-peptones , with the difference that the adsorbed salt , in addition to its inhibitory action , can also take part in the chemical reaction by means of which the formation of larger aggregates is brought about .
Other similar irregular groups ( M unregelmassige lleiclien " ) of colloidal reactions have been described by Neisser and , Friedmann ( 'Miinchener Med. Wochenschr .

If either the acid or basic functions , or both , be sufficiently well marked , the product formed by the combination of two molecules will be stable , and will undergo but little hydrolysis in the presence of water ( i.e.the reaction in the above equation will proceed nearly to completion in the direction indicated by the arrow pointing to the right ) .
The nature of the globulins can be explained by assuming that the undissolved globulin is a complex of this type , which in the presence of water undergoes but little hydrolytic dissociation .
That a certain amount of hydrolysis does take place , however , is indicated by Hardy 's observation that after repeated washing of serum globulin by water , the washings have always a higher electrical conductivity than the wash water .
If salts be added to the water and adsorption on the surface of the dissociated globulin takes place so that it is stereochemically inhibited by the adsorbed salt molecules from forming aggregates by salt formation with other molecules , then the equilibrium between the solid undissociated globulin and water will be disturbed ; the more rapidly the salt molecules are adsorbed , the further will reaction proceed in the direction of the arrow pointing to the left in the above equation , and the more the globulin will appear to be dissolved ( or to speak perhaps more correctly , to be disaggregated ) .
In offering this explanation as to the nature of the globulins one assumption has been made , viz. that in aggregation under " chemical stimulus " ( i.e. salt formation ) the molecule reaches such large dimensions that it is no longer capable of forming even colloidal solutions , but becomes insoluble .
This assumption is supported , however , by certain experimental facts demonstrated by Hardy in the case of serum globulin and by Osborne in the case of edestin.* In their determinations of the solubility of globulins in acids and bases , it was found that the same solvent capacity was possessed by equimolar and not by normal solutions ( i.e. HC1 = H2SO4 = H3PO4 ; NaOH = Ba ( OH)2 ) .
This fact can be explained by assuming that in the case of the polybasic acids only the acid salts of the type ( Gl ' VHSO4 are soluble , and the neutral salts of the type ( Gl ' 12SO4 are insoluble ; similarly , salts of the type f Gl " UBa are also insoluble .

Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , latter cases it may be assumed that the molecule has reached such large dimensions that no kind of solution can take place .
The correctness of the conceptions advanced above as to the nature of the formaldehyde-peptone reaction , and of the globulins , receives support in the results obtained in a general study of the action of salts in heterogeneous systems , in which an attempt was made to correlate their action in such systems with the physical properties of their solutions .
The well-known deduction made by Willard Gibbs from thermodynamical considerations , that substances which reduce the surface tensions of solutions tend to accumulate at the surface , which was expressed by the formula _- _ R dcr U ~ CT dc ( where R is the ordinary gas constant , T the absolute temperature , u the excess of molecules accumulating at the surface , c the concentration and \lt ; 7 the surface tension ) has been repeatedly applied in late years to the study of adsorption , notably by Donnan , and by Freundlich , and the above formula has at the suggestion of the former been quite recently submitted to experimental verification by Lewis.* From these considerations it might be deduced that the amount of adsorption taking place from salt solutions would be a function of the surface tension of these solutions , the greater adsorption taking place from those solutions possessing a low surface tension .
If the suggestions advanced above as to the nature of the formaldehyde-peptone reaction and of the globulins are correct , it should follow that the inhibitory action of salts on the precipitate formation in the former system , and their solvent ( or disaggregating ) capacity in the latter , are functions of their surface tension .
This hypothesis has been submitted to experimental test , and the results obtained are given in detail below .
It was found that in salts of the same series , the lower the surface tension , the greater was the solvent capacity for globulins , and the greater the inhibitory action on the formation of the insoluble methyleneimino-peptone derivative .
This general result , however , was found , as already stated , only when salts of the same series were compared .
The inorganic sodium salts , for example , were found as a general rule to have greater disaggregating capacities than the organic sodium salts having the same surface tension .
Sodium salicylate , furthermore , had a far greater disaggregating capacity than sodium benzoate , a salt with very nearly the same surface tension .
Sodium formate occupied a position intermediate * ' Phil. Mag./ 1908 [ 6 ] , vol. 15 , p. 499 , and 1909 [ 6 ] , vol. 17 , p. 466 , and 'Zeitsch .

101 between the organic and inorganic salts .
From these results it appeared as if some property of salt solutions other than their surface tension was concerned in their disaggregating capacity , and the clue as to this property was afforded by certain generalisations on the rate of action in heterogeneous systems , first put forward by Noyes and Whitney , * to explain the rate of solutions of solids in liquids , and subsequently extended to a more general form by Nernst.f These generalisations can be extended to the adsorption , phenomena under consideration in the present communication .
If an action takes place in a heterogeneous system , its principal seat will be at the limiting surfaces of the phases .
In the case of the solution of a solid substance in water or of a solid base in an acid , the solvent action may be assumed to take place within an infinitely short interval of time .
At any particular moment during the course of action , the solid phase will be surrounded by a layer of liquid of different composition to that of the remainder of the liquid phase .
To establish equilibrium , molecules will passthrough this layer ( the diffusion phase ) , and the rate of action will be a function of the rate at which diffusion will take place .
The constant Are representing the reaction rate , may be represented by the equation _ Area of surface x coefficient of diffusion Thickness of the diffusion layer Now the coefficient of diffusion , and probably also the thickness of the diffusion layer , will depend upon another physical constant of the liquid phase , viz. , the viscosity\#151 ; the more viscous this phase , the more slowly the reaction will take place , other conditions being comparable .
These considerations will apply to the globulin system .
Excess of globulin in the presence of salt solutions , if the hypothesis as to its nature be correct , forms a triphasic system containing the associated solid globulin aggregates ( external phase ) , the dissociated globulin molecules in colloidal solution ( internal phase ) , and the salt solution ( dispersion medium ) .
At the surface of the solid globulin the chief seat of action will be found , and fall three phases will co-exist .
Equilibrium will depend upon ( a ) the adsorption of the salt molecules by the dissociated globulin , ( 6 ) the rate of diffusion of these globulin molecules ( with or without adsorbed salt molecules ) from the solid globulin surface outwards , ( c ) the rate of diffusion of salt molecules inwards towards the same surface to establish equilibrium in the liquid phase , which has been altered in this position by adsorption of the salt from solution .
The amount of adsorption is , as already stated , a function * ' Zeitsch .

Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , of the surface tension and concentration.* If , now , the rate of diffusion of the dissociated globulin molecules outwards from the limiting surface , and of the salt molecules inwards towards the same surface , be slow , the concentration of the globulin molecules at this point will be relatively high compared with that of the salt molecules , and a relatively small amount of adsorption will take place .
As a consequence the dissociated molecules will tend to reaggregate to form the solid globulin .
The reverse will hold if diffusion be rapid .
If the conditions be such that a large amount of adsorption takes place , the solid globulin will completely disaggregate and a diphasic system will be formed ; on dilution the amount of salt adsorbed will be diminished and reaggregation will take place .
From these considerations it will follow that the disaggregating action of salt solutions on the globulins is a function of two physical constants of the solutions , viz. the viscosities and the surface tensions .
The higher the surface tensions and the viscosities , the smaller the disaggregating capacity .
Quite similar considerations apply to the inhibitory action of salt solutions on the polymerisation or condensation of the methyleneimino-peptones .
Here , again , three phases can co-exist , viz. , the poly-product , t the simple methyleneimino-compound in colloidal solution , and the salt solution .
If adsorption be sufficiently complete , the poly-product will not be formed , and the system will be diphasic .
There is , however , a distinction between the system and the globulin system , which is probably more apparent than real .
The precipitate formed by the addition of formaldehyde to Wittes peptone becomes , after a very short interval , insoluble , i.e. it will not dissolve in those salt solutions which inhibit its formation ; it is , however , soluble in such solutions immediately after it is formed .
Possibly a further chemical action , such as dehydration or scission of formaldehyde , takes place after polymerisation , with the formation of a product which can no longer be depolymerised or re-converted into the simple methyleneimino-product by water .
The formation of such a product will tend to alter the equilibrium .
It may be recalled that serum globulin also becomes insoluble in salt solutions after standing under water for some time , and possibly also undergoes a secondary chemical change of similar nature .
These conclusions have been confirmed by the quantitative investigation of the action of a series of salts on both the systems discussed above .
The inorganic sodium salts\#151 ; chloride , bromide and nitrate , iodide and sulpho cyanide , mentioned in the order of decreasing surface tension\#151 ; have a gradually increasing capacity for disaggregating globulins .

103 were obtained with the sodium organic salts\#151 ; lactate , acetate , monochlor-acetate , dichloracetate , trichloracetate , benzoate .
It was found , however , that sodium iodide had a much greater disaggregating capacity than , for example , sodium monochloracetate , from which it differed very slightly in the surface tension as measured against air .
The inorganic salt solutions , however , are considerably less viscous than those of the organic salts , and hence their disaggregating capacities are greater than those of the latter with the same surface tension .
Sodium formate occupies an intermediate position .
Its surface tension is somewhat less than that of sodium chloride , and its viscosity is appreciably greater ; the latter constant is , however , smaller than those of the other organic salts .
Sodium benzoate solution has nearly the same surface tension as that of the salicylate ; it disaggregates less , owing to its considerably higher viscosity .
In addition to the passive action in altering the physical properties of solutions , salts may also exert a disaggregating capacity in a more active manlier .
Hardy* and Mellanbyf have shown that the salts of dyad metals ( alkaline earths ) have a greater solvent action on serum globulin than those of the monad metals ; furthermore , salts of dibasic acids dissolve this substance more readily than those of monobasic acids .
This action is probably due to the direct attraction of the salt molecules by the proteins , owing possibly to the difference of electric charge .
These results have been corroborated .
A similar action in the case of edestin is less marked.* The salts of the dibasic organic acids have $ comparatively small solvent action on edestin ; it is , however , greater than that of the salts of monobasic acids with solutions of high surface tension and viscosities .
Analogies to these actions have been discovered in the investigation of salt action in other systems about to be described .
If the conceptions advanced above are correct they should apply also to systems other than those containing proteins .
The experimental results which confirm them are given in a third communication .
The first of the simpler systems investigated was that containing phenol in the presence of salt solutions .
As Rothmund has shown , S if a mixture of the diphasic system phenol and water be heated , the phenol phase gradually takes up more water , and the aqueous phase takes up more phenol , until a point is reached at which the two phases assume the same chemical com- * * * S * ' Journ.

Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , position , and the system becomes monophasic .
This point is known as the " critical solution temperature .
" As it has been suggested that solutions of proteins and other hydrophil colloids are diphasic systems analogous to that of phenol and water , in which the amount of water in one of the phases can vary within wide limits , the investigation of the action of salts on this system was of some interest .
It was found that the addition of salts which lower the surface tension decreased the critical temperature of phenol and water .
The critical solution temperatures , it is true , do not follow the surface tensions with strict accuracy ; it must be remembered , however , that these constants have been measured at ordinary atmospheric temperatures only , whereas the critical solution points are relatively high .
Nevertheless , the concordance is sufficiently striking .
The viscosity in this case plays but little part , as there is passage of molecules to and fro from both systems .
Furthermore , at higher temperatures , the difference of viscosity in different solutions tends to rapidly diminish .
The last , series of systems investigated were those of crystalline substances in the presence of salt solutions .
The action of salts in these cases was found to be analogous in nearly every respect to their action in systems containing proteins .
The salt solutions with low surface tensions possessed a greater disaggregating capacity than those of the same series with higher surface tensions .
The viscosity of the solutions also played the same part .
In these systems , also , reaction mu/ st be considered as taking place at the surface of the two phases .
Equilibrium will be attained when disaggregation takes place at the same rate as reaggregation .
The lower the surface tension of the solution , the greater the tendency to disaggregate , and the less the tendency to reaggregate ; the equilibrium point will be attained with a higher concentration of substance in salt solutions of low surface tension than in those of high surface tension .
The more viscous the solution , the sooner will this equilibrium point be attained at the surface of the two phases ( ix .
the smaller the quantity of solid substance which will have been dissolved ) , owing to the difficulty of the dissolved substances in diffusing from the solid phase .
These results were arrived at by determining the solubility of the five following substances in the same salt solutions as were employed in the investigations on protein systems\#151 ; leucine , phenylalanine , caffeine , para-toluidine , and benzamide .
The solution capacities of the inorganic salts and organic salts followed in the same order as their disaggregating action on the globulins .
Salt solutions with low surface tension , such as sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate , dissolved appreciably more than those of high surface 1910 .

105 tensions .
In the latter , the solubility of crystalline substances was generally less than that of water ; in the former it was generally greater .
These results are especially marked in the case of caffeine .
The solution capacities of the salts do not all follow in absolutely the same order in the case of all salts .
The rate of diffusion and the surface tension at the junction of the phases could not be directly measured , and in some instances the former exerted a greater effect than the latter .
Hence , in some cases , sodium formate has a greater solution capacity than sodium chloride , in others less .
If , however , the salts be arranged in series , viz. , the inorganic salts , with solutions of low viscosity , the organic salts , with solutions of high viscosity , with sodium formate forming an intermediate class by itself , it will be invariably found that the dissolving capacity of sale solutions of the same series bears a direct relationship to the surface tension .
It was also thought possible that the state of hydration of the salts in solution might exert some influence , in that , owing to combination of salt with water , less water in a normal solution would be available to act as solvent .
W. Bilz* and H. C. Jonesf have suggested that the abnormally great depression of freezing point of water produced by solutions of salts was due to the formation of hydrates in solution .
The molecular depression of the freezing point of various salts was therefore investigated , and it was found that that of the organic salts was , as a rule , greater than that of the inorganic salts .
Sodium formate , however , depressed the freezing point of water to about the same extent as did sodium chloride .
If the state of hydration played the chief rdle in determining the solubility of a crystalline substance in a salt solution , sodium formate solution should have had about the same solution capacity as sodium bromide and sodium nitrate .
The solution capacity was invariably less , and less also in some cases than that of sodium chloride solution , which has a higher surface tension .
It does not appear , therefore , as if the state of hydration plays a very direct part in determining the solution capacity of a salt solution , although it may play an indirect part , in that a highly hydrated salt may form a more viscous solution than one less hydrated in solution ( compare in tables , viscosities and freezing points of sodium chloride and sodium iodide , sodium chloride and lithium chloride , sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate ) .
In the case of leucine and phenylalanine , both of which contain a carboxyl group , solutions of the salts of polyvalent metals possessed a greater solution capacity than those of the monovalent metals , the chlorides of the triad metal cerium dissolving more of these substances than any other * 6 Zeitsch .

Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , solution investigated .
This solution capacity was much less marked in the cases of caffeine ( which acts only as a base in the presence of strong acids ) and benzamide , and was entirely wanting in the case of the base para-toluidine .
The solutions of salts of polybasic acids possessed , in the case of leucine and phenylalanine , a slightly higher dissolving capacity than did the salts of monobasic acids of corresponding surface tension and viscosity , and in this respect their behaviour was similar to that in the edestin system .
Further investigation on this point is necessary , and also on the electrical charge carried by solid crystals .
Minor differences in the solution capacity of salts of various metals were also noticed which could not be correlated with any physical property .
Thus , for example , lithium salts possessed a slightly greater solvent capacity than did those of sodium and potassium ( especially in the case of caffeine ) .
Furthermore , strontium salts were intermediate in their action between those of calcium and barium , the calcium salts possessing a greater solvent capacity .
These differences were often , however , only faintly marked .
Summary and Conclusions .
I. Complex substances which form colloidal solutions have the capacity of adsorbing other substances from those solutions , which , accumulating on their surface , interfere sterically with their chemical reactions .
For this reason such colloidal substances do not in their reactions obey the ordinary laws of chemical mass action .
II .
This conclusion has been illustrated by a study of the action of formaldehyde on Witte 's peptone .
Pauli 's observations of the formation of protein salts of heavy metals can perhaps be explained in a similar way , III .
The analogy between the action of salt solutions in innibiting chemical reaction of the complex proteins , and of their capacity to dissolve globulins , was noticed ; the greater the inhibitory action , the greater the solvent power .
IV .
These facts suggested an explanation of the chemical character of the globulins .
These proteins are here regarded as substances of both markedly acid and markedly basic character , and capable of forming insoluble aggregates by the combination of the acid group of one molecule with the basic group of another ; such aggregates will undergo a slight but definite hydrolysis in the presence of water , to form simpler dissociated globulin molecules .
In the presence of salts , adsorption will take place on the surface of these simpler molecules , and thus prevent re-aggregation to the solid form and alter the hydrolysis equilibrium .
The greater the adsorption of a salt , the greater , therefore , the solvent or disaggregating capacity of its solution for globulins .
1910 .
] with the State of Aggregation of Matter .
107 Y. The adsorption capacity of salts can be correlated with certain physical properties of their solutions .
The higher the surface tension and the greater the viscosity , the smaller the adsorption and the disaggregating capacity .
These conclusions have been verified experimentally ; the influence of these physical properties on the action of salts can , however , be deduced from theoretical considerations , the influence of surface tension from the general study of adsorption phenomena , and that of viscosity by an extension of Nernst 's generalisations on the rate of action in heterogeneous systems .
VI .
The action of salts on systems other than those containing protein colloids is similar .
Investigations have been made of the action of salts on the critical solution temperature of phenol and water , and on the solubility of the following crystalline substances :\#151 ; d.l. leucine , phenylalanine , caffeine , benzamide , and p. toluidine .
VII .
The critical solution temperature of phenol and salt solutions is a function of the surface tension of the latter .
VIII .
The solubility of crystalline substances in salt solutions depends on the surface tensions and viscosities of the latter .
In these systems the chief seat of action is at the limiting surfaces of the phases .
Equilibrium may be regarded as established at the surfaces when dis-aggregation and re-aggregation are equal .
The concentration at which this condition will exist is a function of the surface tension .
The viscosity of the salt solution will affect the rate at which diffusion from the limiting surface takes place , and consequently the point at which equilibrium conditions are attained .
IX .
The observations of previous observers as to the greater solubility of serum globulin in salts of the polyvalent metals , as compared with those of the univalent metals is confirmed .
Similar phenomena were noticed in the case of leucine and phenylalanine .
These phenomena were less marked in the case of edestin , and of caffeine and benzamide , and were entirely absent in the case of p. toluidine .
It is suggested that they are due to the direct attraction of the salt molecules to the surfaces of the solid or disperse phases , possibly owing to the different electrical charges .
This would alter the relative tensions of solutions at these surfaces as compared with the measurements of their surface tension against air .
The serum globulin is also more soluble in salts of polybasic acids than in salts of monobasic acids .
In the case of edestin and of the amino acids , these substances are perhaps very slightly more soluble in salts of dibasic acids than in those of monobasic acid of similar physical properties.* In other cases these phenomena were absent .
X. No evidence of the direct influence of the state of hydration of * An exact correlation of the solubility capacity with more than one physical constant is not possible with the data available .

The above generalisations as to the action of salts are probably capable of application to other systems .
Considerable controversy has arisen as to the nature of the reaction between toxin and antitoxin .
Arrhenius and his followers maintain , on the one hand , that it is analogous to the reaction between weak acid and weak base ; other investigators hold , on the other hand , that it is of the nature of an adsorption phenomenon .
If either or both of the reacting substances are of colloidal nature , adsorption of substances , from the reaction medium ( serum , etc. ) would take place , and even if the reaction be of chemical nature , deviation from the ordinary laws of chemical mass action should be observed , owing to the sterical inhibition by adsorbed molecules .
The amount of action would depend upon the medium in which it takes place .
Investigations have been already commenced with the object of determining the influence of salts on the toxin-antitoxin reaction , and on .other physiological and pathological phenomena .
B. Experimental.\#151 ; I. The Physical Properties of Salt Solutions .
Throughout this work normal and not molar solutions have been .employed .
The sodium salts have been generally prepared by adding to 2N sodium hydroxide approximately the amount of acid necessary for neutralisation , one drop of a 1-per-cent , phenolphthalein being used as indicator .
Neutralisation was completed by the addition of further quantities of acid in very weak solution , until the pink colour of the phenolphthalein just disappeared .
The solutions after cooling were diluted till the normal concentration was attained .
The solutions of chlorides of metals other than sodium were standardised by silver nitrate , volumetrically in the cases of magnesium and the alkali metals , gravimetrically in the case of the other alkaline earths .
The ..sulphocyanide solution was standardised volumetrically by silver nitrate with the use of iron alum as indicator .
The sodium iodide solution was made up by neutralising 2N sodium .hydroxide with hydriodic acid , which had been freshly distilled over red phosphorus , and was of only very faint yellow colour .
The standard solution Was kept in the dark .

In order to work with small quantities 'of solution , a modification of Bontgen and Schneider 's apparatus was employed , which is figured in the .accompanying sketch .

] A fine-bore capillary tube with opal-glass back graduated in the upper part from 50 to 200 mm. , the lower mark of which is 50 mm. above an etched zero mark , is inserted through a rubber cork with the lower end downwards into a tube of 24 mm. diameter and 20 c.c. capacity , provided with a side-tube at the upper part near the cork , which is connected with an indiarubber ball , and drawn out at the lower end with a fine , almost capillary , tube , provided with a stop-cock B. Through the rubber cork is inserted a small funnel provided with a stop-cock A. The vessel into which the capillary tube is inserted has an etched mark on the outside ; and , by means of a cathetometer , the capillary tube is so adjusted in the cork that its zero point is exactly opposite this etched mark .
The liquid under examination is introduced through A , and by pressure of the rubber ball , and closure of the tap A , is caused to rise in the capillary .
Stopcock A is then opened .
Liquid is let out from the apparatus by stopcock B , or in by stopcock A , until the lower level is exactly at the zero point , which can be VOL. Lxxxm.\#151 ; B. K 110 Dr. S. B. Schryver .
Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , easily recognised owing to the etched mark .
When the liquid has come to rest , the height of the liquid in the capillary tube is read .
The levels can be altered by squeezing the indiarubber ball , or by letting liquid out by tap B. The liquid should be passed through the apparatus and up the capillary tube several times until a constant reading is obtained .
This is especially important in the case of liquids of high surface tension , which do not readily wet the glass .
After using , the apparatus is washed out with water , and then with the fresh liquid of which the physical constant is to be measured .
The little cup at the top of the capillary tube is for the purpose of collecting the wash-water and preventing it from soiling the outside .
Between every two or three determinations , a control measurement with pure water was interpolated , so as to ensure that there was no derangement of the zero point , and no error due to alteration of temperature .
All the solutions employed were made up with water which had been distilled in glass vessels over permanganate , and the apparatus and all the vessels employed had been previously soaked in concentrated sulphuric acid , and subsequently washed with the special distilled water before use .
The readings were made with a magnifying glass .
The surface tension determinations given in the accompanying table were the mean of several closely concordant readings ( in most cases to within OT mm. ) , many of them made after long intervals of time .
As unity was taken water , to 100 c.c. of which one drop of 0-5-per-cent , phenolphthalein in 50 per cent , alcohol had been added.* This addition made only a very minute difference in the reading .
The specific gravities of the solutions were determined gravimetrically in the ordinary way .

Ill Viscosities of Salt Solutions .
The following measurements were made , as a direct comparison of the viscosities of the salts employed in the investigations was required under varying conditions of temperature , etc. The measurements were made at different temperatures also to determine whether any evidence as to the state of hydration of the salts in solution could be obtained .
It was thought that the temperature coefficient would be large in the cases of heavily hydrated salts .
The results indicate , however , that the state of hydration has probably only a minor influence on the viscosity .
The low viscosity of sodium salicylate solution , compared with that of the benzoate , may possibly be due to the higher hydration of the latter ( compare freezing-point determinations below ) .
The results also indicate that sodium iodide and lithium chloride at lower temperatures may be more heavily hydrated than the other halides .
The determinations were made by means of Scarpa 's apparatus , * in which , under a pressure somewhat higher than atmospheric , and indicated by means of a water manometer ( in the results below , a plus pressure of 200 mm. of water was employed ) , a definite volume of liquid is made to pass both upwards and downwards through a capillary tube .
In the results given below , the time required for passage in both directions is given .
If attempts be made to transpose the numbers given below into absolute units by the equation = id , where 77 = viscosity in absolute units , k = apparatus-constant , and t = time of passage through capillary , it was found , using Thorpe and Eodger 's values for water at different temperatures , that k gradually became smaller with increasing temperature of the determination .
This was due to the error arising from the formation of eddy currents , which were distinctly visible in the determinations made with liquids of low viscosity , As the error due to this factor is greater the lower the viscosity of the liquid , the differences between the determinations should be somewhat larger than those indicated in the table .
The error does not detract , therefore , from the comparative value of the results .
The most salient features of the following table are the high viscosities of the organic monobasic sodium salts as compared with the inorganic salts .
Sodium formate occupies an intermediate position with a viscosity lower than the highest inorganic salt viscosity ( sodium iodide , which only has such a relatively high viscosity at quite a low temperature ) but lower than that of any of the other organic salts .
The high viscosity of the benzoate compared with that of the salicylate is also to be noted .
No other features of the table call for special comment .

The great difference between the molecular depressions in the freezing point of benzoate and salicylate solutions may be noted .
This may indicate differences in the state of hydration in solution , and thus differences in the viscosities ; the degree of hydration may , therefore , possibly influence the disaggregating powers in an indirect way .

The Solubility of the Globulins .
Serum Globulin .

The results here appended amplify those of the observers just mentioned , in that they demonstrate the influence of surface tension and viscosity on the solvent property .
The solvent ( or disaggregating capacity ) was determined by titrating 10 c.c. of a given suspension of the globulin with decinormal solution of the salt until the same solution grade was attained .
The titration was carried out in a darkened room in a flat-sided trough , at the back of which was placed a constant source of light ( electric lamp ) , the rays of which passed through a paper containing printed matter , held directly against the side of the trough nearest the light .
The solution grade point arbitrarily chosen was that at which the printed matter was just legible through the liquid .
The serum globulin was prepared in the ordinary way from horse serum .
In Series I the globulin was purified by solution in ammonia , and precipitation from this solution by dilute acetic acid .
In Series II the sample was simply washed and the washings centrifuged off .

Edestin .

between the chloride , bromide , and nitrate and iodide are similar to the actions in the case of serum globulin .
The results of Osborne and Harris have been extended by determining the solubility of edestin in a series of organic salts , and the results are indicated in the accompanying Table V. The edestin was prepared from hemp seed in the same way as that employed by Osborne and Harris , the final recrystallisation from sodium chloride having been carried put , after neutralisation of the solution , by allowing the latter to cool in an atmosphere free from carbon dioxide .
The experiments were carried out at ordinary room temperature in the same way as that described in Osborne and Harris ' paper .
Suspensions of 1 gramme in 10 c.c. of solution or of 2 c.c. in 20 c.c. solution were shaken for some time .
When accurate quantitative determinations were made , the mixture was centrifuged , and the nitrogen determined in the supernatant liquid , which was pipetted off .
It was noticed that certain limits of concentration were reached between which the solubility of the edestin rapidly increased ( compare the curves in Osborne and Harris ' paper ) .
At these limits the edestin became gelatinous on the addition of the salt solution .
For these reasons the great differences of the solution capacities of the different salts could be readily demonstrated without the necessity of carrying out nitrogen estimations ; in fact , when the edestin became gelatinous , accurate determinations of solubility were difficult .

Furthermore , 116 Dr. S. B. Schryver .
Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , the influence of the valency of the metals is less marked .
Interpolating from the curves of Osborne and Harris , it will be found that a 5-per-cent , solution of edestin can be formed under the conditions of experiment employed when the concentration is 5/ 6 normal .
A similar strength edestin solution in sodium chloride is formed in the concentration of 13/ 20 normal .
Bromide forms a 5-per-cent , solution in 9/ 20 normal ( solubility capacity nearly equivalent to that of dichloracetate ) , whereas sodium iodide can form a solution of this strength in | normal concentration , and has a solvent power equivalent approximately to those of the benzoate and salicylate .
The higher solvent capacities of the solutions of inorganic salts are again well marked .
Part II.\#151 ; On the Action of Formaldehyde on Witte 's Peptone .
This portion of the communication contains the experimental details concerning the reaction of formaldelyde on Witte 's peptone , the theory of which has been already discussed in some detail in the first part .
The .
fraction which yields the precipitate with formaldelyde is that containing the more complex polypeptides , as the two following series of experiments show :\#151 ; Series I.\#151 ; Fifty grammes of Witte 's peptone were extracted , first with 600 c.c. of cold 80-per-cent , alcohol , and then with 400 c.c. .
The alcoholic extract obtained was evaporated in vacuo , and the last traces of alcohol were driven off from the residue by taking it up in water and evaporating the solution thus obtained on a water bath .
This formed Fraction I ( .
part soluble in 80-per-cent , alcohol ) .
The part of the peptone insoluble in 80-per-cent , alcohol was then extracted with 60-per-cent , alcohol , and the extract treated in a similar way to the 80-per-cent , alcoholic extract ; this formed Fraction II .
Fraction III was the part insoluble in 60-per-cent , alcohol .
Each of the fractions was then made up to a definite volume in water , and the nitrogen in each was estimated .
Portions were then taken from each fraction , and diluted so that solutions containing the same amount of nitrogen were obtained ; 100 c.c. of each solution contained 0'2156 gramme nitrogen ; 40 c.c. of these solutions were taken and to each was added 20 c.c. of 40-per-cent , formaldelyde .
After standing , the precipitate was filtered off and nitrogen was estimated in aliquot parts of the filtrate .
In Fraction I the percentage of nitrogen precipitated was 8'3 .

Another fraction with the same nitrogen content was prepared from a solution of peptone which had been dialysed for three or four days against running water .
Of this preparation , 23'3 per cent , was precipitable by formaldehyde .
Series II.\#151 ; Fifty grammes of Witte 's peptone were extracted successively with two portions of 500 c.c. hot 70-per-cent , alcohol .
The insoluble portion ( Fraction III ) was then washed with cold 70-per-cent , alcohol , and finally with absolute alcohol , and then dried on a water bath .
It weighed , when dry , 13'5 grammes .
From the hot aqueous alcohol a second fraction ( Fraction II ) separated on cooling ; this was washed with 70-per-cent , alcohol , then with absolute alcohol and then dried .
Fraction I was the portion soluble in 70-per-cent , alcohol .
These were also dissolved up , and solutions made containing the same amount of nitrogen ( 0'8848 gramme per 100 c.c. ) .
To determine the complexity , 10 c.c. of each fraction was treated with 5 c.c. formaldehyde and then titrated with FT/ 10 sodium hydroxide by Sorensen 's method .
The following were the quantities of alkali necessary to neutralise to phenolphthalein:\#151 ; Fraction I ... ... ... ... ... 8*9 c.c. " II ... ... ... ... ... ... 7-0 " HI ... ... ... ... . .

Inhibitory Action of Salts .
If minute quantities of caustic alkali be added to the peptone solution , no precipitate will form on the addition of formaldehyde .
The formation takes 118 Dr. S. B. Schryver .
Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , place , however , after the addition of acids ; this addition must not , however , exceed that necessary to produce a turbidity in the peptone solution ( precipitation of nucleo-protein ) .
The precipitation is also inhibited by the sodium salts of weak acids .
This is due to the fact that the solution , after the addition of aldehydes , contains acids of the type CH : N-RCOOH , which are sufficiently strong to decompose the sodium salts of weak acids .
For this reason , salts of weak acids , such as sodium acetate and sodium propionate , do not fall in the same relative position with regard to their inhibitory action as would be expected from the theory connecting viscosity and surface tension with this function .
This fact may serve to explain other minor deviations shown in the accompanying table .
In these experiments , of which the results are here recorded , 5 c.c. of a Witte peptone solution were diluted to 10 c.c. with varying quantities of normal solutions of different salts , so that a series of solutions of 2^ per cent , peptone in concentrations varying from N/ 10 to N/ 2 of the different salts was obtained .
To each dilution was added 2'5 c.c. of a 35-per-cent , formaldehyde solution .
The degree of precipitate formation at varying intervals was then noted .

119 The general parallelism between these actions and that of the solvent action on serum globulin is manifest , although there are in case of weaker acids noticeable deviations , for the reasons already described .
The salts of polyvalent metals have also a slightly stronger inhibitory action than those of the univalent metals , and this is indicated in the following tables .
The experiments here recorded were carried out by adding 10 c.c. of the normal salt solution to 10 c.c. of 5-per-cent , peptone solution , and then precipitating by 4 c.c. of 40-per-cent , aldehyde solution .
After standing for a day the precipitate was filtered off , and the nitrogen was estimated in aliquot parts of the filtrate .
The total nitrogen was estimated also in a corresponding portion in which no precipitation took place , and in a portion in which 10 c.c. of peptone was diluted with 10 c.c. of water instead of salt solution .

The theory and discussion of the results recorded in this part have been already dealt with in some detail in Part I. Critical Solution Temperature of Phenol and Salt Solutions .
The compositions of the two phases , phenol and water , were investigated in detail many years ago by Rothmund.* It may be recalled that if a mixture of the two substances be heated , the phenol phase becomes richer in water , and the aqueous phase richer in phenol until a point is reached when the system becomes monophasic .
The temperature at which this will happen will depend upon the readiness with which disaggregation takes place , and should consequently be a function of the surface tension at the limiting surfaces of * * Zeitsch .

The lower the surface tension of the salt solution therefore , the lower should be the critical solution temperature .
This hypothesis is fully borne out by the results recorded in the accompanying table .
Fifteen grammes of crystalline phenol were mixed with 25 c.c. of N/ 10 salt solutions in a wide-mouthed test-tube provided with a stirrer , and with a thermometer inserted into the mixture .
This was inserted into a litre beaker containing water , which was also provided with a stirrer , and which was slowly heated on a sand bath ; both the mixture in the test-tube and the water were con- , tinually stirred the whole time .
As critical solution temperature is arbitrarily chosen that point at which the phenol-salt solution mixture is converted from an opaque to an opalescent fluid , a process which takes place within the interval of one-tenth of a degree .
On further heating the opalescent fluid gradually becomes clear ; on cooling again , with continual stirring , opalescence and final opacity reappear , and the point at which the opalescent fluid becomes opaque is only a fraction of a degree lower than the point observed when the change took place in the reverse direction .
With normal solutions of the salts of lower surface tensions , such as sodium trichloracetate , the system is monophasic even at quite low temperatures ( 4 ' C. ) .

The benzamide , caffeine , and p-toluidine were Kahlbaum 's preparations .
The phenylalanine was prepared synthetically by the method of E. Fischer.* The d.l. leucine was prepared directly from commercial isoamyl alcohol .
From the latter , isovaleraldehyde was prepared by the method of Bouveault and Rouszetf by dropping the alcohol into a warmed bichromate mixture * ' Ber .

121 and allowing the aldehyde to distil off as soon as it is formed .
The latter , after separating from the aqueous layer , was dried over fused sodium acetate , and then fractionated with a Young rod and disc still-head and the fraction boiling below 120 ' was separately collected .
This was converted into the bisulphite compound , which was washed with ether , and air-dried , decomposed with a small excess of bicarbonate and the aldehyde then distilled oft .
To the aldehyde was then added , little by little , and with constant cooling , half the volume of ordinary concentrated ammonia , and the mixture , after standing a day , completely solidified .
The valeraldehyde ammonia compound was then washed with ether , and air-dried .
The compound from 300 grammes aldehyde was then treated in three portions with 300 c.c. water , and to the suspension was added 150 c.c. anhydrous hydrocyanic acid , diluted to 270 c.c. with water .
The cyanammonia compound was then hydrolysed , and the remainder of the preparation completed by the method of E. Fischer.* From 300 grammes of aldehyde were obtained 200 grammes of twice recrystallised pure inactive leucine .
The determinations of solubility were carried out by mixing 1 gramme ( or more if 1 gramme were insufficient for complete saturation ) of the crystalline substance with 30 c.c. of .
the salt solution in short wide-mouthed test-tubes , which were then tightly corked , and clamped on to a rotating axis in a thermostat , and thus , by means of a motor , kept in a state of constant motion , generally for a period of 36 hours .
At the end of this time the liquid was filtered from the undissolved solid by means of a water pump through a perforated platinum plate covered with asbestos , into a flask with a narrow neck graduated in tenths of a cubic centimetre between 20 and 30 c.c. , which was carefully calibrated before use , and which was provided with a side-tube near the mouth of the flask , turned upwards so as to connect with the water-pump for suction .
The whole apparatus was immersed in the thermostat during filtration , and the amount of liquid filtered was directly read .
The nitrogen was determined in this liquid by means of Kjeldahl 's method , except in the case of the nitrates and sulphocyanides .
In both these cases the leucine and phenylalanine were estimated by Sorensen 's formaldehyde titration method , and in determinations of the solubility of other substances in sulphocyanide the undissolved crystallised substance left on the filter-plate was dissolved in some organic solvent , and the nitrogen determined in this solution after filtering through blotting-paper .
In the latter case there is a slight error , owing to the fact that it is impossible to wash the crystals .
The Kjeldahl method of estimation was , in the case of * ' Ber .

Some Investigations Dealing [ Aug. 12 , phenylalanine and leucine , preferred to the Sorensen method , as the end point of titration is a certain pink colour , and not the first appearance of pink .
Nevertheless , a series of solubility determinations carried out by this method in the case of leucine agreed well with the results obtained by the Kjeldahl method .
The ammonia was distilled off through hard-glass well-cooled condensers , to avoid the action of the hot liquid on the glass .
Sodium alizarine sulphonate was the indicator used for titration , and the ammonia present in the various reagents as an impurity was estimated and the necessary corrections made .
It was only found in the sulphuric acid and lithium chloride , and the correction in each case was only a fraction of a cubic centimetre .
