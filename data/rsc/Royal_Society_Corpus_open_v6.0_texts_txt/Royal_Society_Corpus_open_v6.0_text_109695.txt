On the Effect of westerly Winds in raising the Level of the British Channel .
In a Letter to the Richt Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K.B. P.R.S. By James Rennell , Esq. F.R.S. Read June 22 , 1809 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1809 , p. 400 .
] The recent loss of the Britannia East Indiaman having appeared to the author intimately connected with those observations which he formerly communicated to the Society concerning a current that occasionally prevails to the westward of Scilly , he has thought the circumstances deserving of particular inquiry , as it may be of use to record them as a warning against dangers which may probably be avoided .
During the prevalence of westerly winds , it is well known that they occasion the height of the tides to be greater in the southern parts of Great Britain , even as much as ten feet , in violent storms from that quarter ; and it has also been remarked , that the flood-tide runs an hour or more longer than at common times ; or , in other words , that a current overcomes the ebb-tide .
And since the direction of this current must be influenced by the form of the adjacent shores , it is evident that the shore in the neighbourhood of Boulogne , which tends very directly northward , will cause a northerly current through the Straits of Dover .
It appears to have been under these circumstances , that the Britannia was lost .
Having been driven up the Straits by a violent gale from the south-west in thick weather , which prevented a view of the lights , the pilot was left entirely to the reckoning and the lead : but as he was not aware of the unusual current that prevailed , he was driven unexpectedly on the back , or eastern side of the Goodwin Sands .
