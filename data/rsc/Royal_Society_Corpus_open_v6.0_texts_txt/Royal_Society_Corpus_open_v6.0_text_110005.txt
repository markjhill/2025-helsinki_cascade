] The observations detailed in this paper are comprised in two series .
By the result of the first , the pendulum of experiment , which was constructed upon the same principles as that used by Captain Kater , and described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 , was found to make 86166,108 vibrations in twenty-four hours , and by the result of the second series , 86166,048 , the mean being 86166,078 ; so that the result of each series differs from the mean only-ri-4-th of a beat in twenty-four hours .
The length of the seconds pendulum at Madras , deduced as the mean of these two series of observations , is 39-026302 inches of Sir George Shuckburgh 's scale , at the temperature of 70 ?
in vacuo , and at the level of the sea .
By comparing this with the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in London , we obtain - ?
.v as the ellipticity of the earth , which is very nearly the mean deduced from the observations of Cap. tain Kater in England , and those of the French mathematicians ,
