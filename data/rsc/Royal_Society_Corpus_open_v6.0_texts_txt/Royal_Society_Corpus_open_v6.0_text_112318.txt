( Abstract .
) In my second Memoir " On the Calculus of Symbols , " I worked out the general case of multiplication according to one of the two systems of combination of non-commutative symbols previously given .
In the present paper I propose to investigate the general case of multiplication according to the other system .
I commence with the Binomial Theorem , to which the second system gives rise .
In my previous researches I obtained the general term of the binomial theorem when the symbols combine according to the first system by equating symbolical coefficients ; here , on the other hand , I consider the nature of the combinations which arise from the symbolical multiplication , and obtain the general term by summation .
I next proceed to the multiplication of binomial factors .
Here the general term is obtained by considering the alteration of weight undergone by certain symbols in the process of multiplication .
The multinomial theorem according to the second system is next considered and its general term calculated .
I conclude the memoir with some applications of the calculus of symbols to successive differentiation .
This paper completes the investigation of symbolical multiplication and division according to the two systems of combination , the general case of division having been worked out by Mr. Spottiswoode in a very beautiful memoir recently published in the Philosophical Transactions .
