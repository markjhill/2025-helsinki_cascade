On Effects of Strain The lines of the stars of intermediate temperature , like Cygni , have long been recognised by the Harvard observers as well as by myself as presenting great difficulties .
In 1893 I wrote as follows* :\#151 ; " With the exception of the K line , the lines of hydrogen and the high temperature line of Mg at A4481 , all the lines may be said to be at present of unknown origin .
Some of the lines fall near lines of iron , but the absence of the strongest lines indicates that the close coincidences are probably accidental .
" In the Harvard ' Spectra of Bright Stars ' 1897 , p. 5 , the following words occur , relating to the same stars :\#151 ; " This system of lines should perhaps be regarded as forming a separate class , as in the case of the Orion lines , and should not be described as ' metallic , ' as has just been done in the absence of any more distinctive name .
" From the fact that these unknown lines have now been traced to a " proto-metallic " origin , as effectively as the unknown lines of the hottest stars have been traced to helium and asterium , we may expect that the consequences of this determination in relation to stellar classification and other connected matters , will be very far reaching .
At present I am using this new spectrum consisting of enhanced lines as an explorer , in relation to some further details of stellar classification having special reference to stars of Groups III and IV in which bright as well as dark lines occur .

Seebeckf discovered the great effect that hardness , or softness , or crystalline structure , has on the thermo-electric properties of metals .
Magnus made a number of experiments by winding a hard drawn wire on a reel .
Parts of this wire were softened and annealed .
When heat was applied to the parts of the wire which were between unannealed and annealed , a thermo-electric current was obtained .
In this way Magnus found that the current passed from soft to hard through the hot junction for silver , steel , cadmium , copper , gold , and platinum ; and that it passed from hard to soft through the hot junction for German silver , zinc , tin , and iron .

He showed that for iron and copper permanent longitudinal extension gave the same effect as permanent lateral contraction ; and that this effect for both was opposite to that experienced by them when under a stress which caused a temporary strain .
Thus for a copper wire under a longitudinal stress the current was from the strained copper to the free copper across the hot junction , and the magnitude of the current increased with the increase of the longitudinal stress .
If the stress were removed and the wire left with a permanent strain , the current was now from the free copper to the strained copper through the hot junction .
Similar results were got with iron , only the direction of the current Avas in each case opposite to the direction of the current in the corresponding case for copper .
The highest temperature used in these experiments was about 100 ' C. 4 .
A summary of Lord Kelvin 's results is given on pages 296 and 297 of vol. 2 of his ' Mathematical and Physical Papers .

2 C 324 Dr. M. Maclean .
On Effects of Strain view when I started these experiments .
The arrangement is shown diagrammatically below .
One junction of the wires was kept in a Mirror Galvanometer Screen glycerine bath which could be heated by a Bunsen burner .
This junction was tied by a fine copper wire to the bulb of a thermometer T. The other ends of the wires were joined to short copper wires which served as terminals of the low resistance galvanometer used in the experiments .
These junctions were wrapped in paraffin paper or cotton wool which contained the bulb of a thermometer T , reading half degrees from 0'C .
to 25 ' C. A paper screen S was hanging vertically between the Bunsen burner and the thermometer T ' and the galvanometer to prevent any heat from the flame reaching the rest of the circuit by radiation .
These precautions were taken to make certain that all junctions , except the hot junction , would be at the same temperature .
6 .
The constant of the galvanometer was determined by joining a Daniell cell in circuit with the galvanometer and with a resistance erf over 30,000 ohms .
The electromotive force of the Daniell cell was compared with a standard Clark cell by means of a quadrant electrometer .
In this way the current through the galvanometer per division deflection on the scale was determined .
The sensitiveness , in preliminary experiments , was 0-612 mikroampere per division .
But by different arrangements of the controlling magnets , the sensitiveness of the galvanometer as now used is 0-09 mikroampere per division .
The resistance of the galvanometer , at 15 ' C.\#151 ; the average temperature of the laboratory during the experiments\#151 ; is T5 ohms .
Thus the electroon the Thermo-electric Qualities of Metals .
motive force at the terminals of the galvanometer as now used is 0-135 mikrovolt per division .
7 .
A considerable lag was found in the thermometer readings , and the following method was adopted to get rid of this effect .
The hot junction was heated very slowly through a small range ( 5 C. or 10 C. ) and then the Bunsen burner was drawn slightly aside so as to give approximately as much heat to the vessel which contained the glycerine as it lost by radiation .
The thermometer , T , and the spot of light on the scale were simultaneously observed , and when both were seen to be steady , the readings were noted .
The circuit was then immediately broken and readings taken of the galvanometer zero* and the thermometer T ' .
Very often the glycerine was allowed to cool slowly , and by means of a small Bunsen flame the temperature was kept steady for a short time and readings taken .
If the same precautions were taken as are described in the previous paragraph , the same deflections from zero were got for the same difference of temperature between the hot and cold junctions .
8 .
The metals so far tried are :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Copper wire from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey .
This was pure electrotype copper wire with no impurity detected except an unweighable trace of iron .
( 2 ) Copper wire , ordinary commercial , from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey .
This was analysed !
in the chemical laboratory of the University , and was found to contain :\#151 ; * It waa found necessary to take the zero immediately after each reading as the zero was by no means constant .
It was thought at first that the change of zero was mainly due to the suspending fibre of the mirror in the galvanometer , but a new plug and fibre did not lessen the variations of the zero during an experiment .
It is most likely due to the general laboratory experiments going on simultaneously , which involve the moving of apparatus and the walking about of students with knives and keys in their pockets in the near vicinity of the galvanometer .
For example , my own pocket knife at the distance of the scale from the galvanometer ( a metre ) gives a deflection of 10 scale divisions .
The galvanometer is at a distance of 1174 metres from the dynamo used in the electric light installation of the Physical Laboratory , the two being separated by a stone wall .
The stopping or the starting of the dynamo altered the metallic zero of the galvanometer by 100 divisions .
The constant of the galvanometer was tested both when the dynamo was running and when the dynamo was not running .
Practically it was the same on both occasions .
Nearly all the experiments were done when the dynamo was running .

The size of the wire used , except for ( 5 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) above , was about No. 18 standard gauge .
A piece of the wire was taken and drawn through a draw plate till it was reduced to about No. 24 standard gauge .
This process of wire drawing subjects the wire to longitudinal extension and to lateral compression .
Lord Kelvin in his experiments ( ' Mathematical and Physical Papers , ' vol. 2 and section 3 above ) showed that thermo-electric differences were in the same direction for longitudinal extension and transverse compression .
For drawn and undrawn wires the direction of the current through the hot junction is from undrawn to drawn for copper , reostene , and lead , and from drawn to undrawn for platinoid , German silver , and manganin .
The magnitude of the current per degree difference of temperature is given in the following table .

The resistances of all the undrawn wires were carefully determined by the usual bridge method .
The specific gravities and cross sections of both the undrawn and drawn wires were also determined by weighing known lengths in air and in water .
The values are given in the following table .
It will be noted that the specific gravity of drawn copper , of drawn commercial lead , of drawn platinoid , and of drawn manganin , is greater* than for the corresponding undrawn wires ; that the specific gravity of undrawn and drawn German silver wire is the same ; and that the specific gravity of drawn reostene wire and of drawn pure lead wire is less than that of the undrawn .

The resistances of the drawn copper and manganin wires were compared with the resistances of the corresponding undrawn copper and manganin wires by the fall of potential method , and it was found that the resistances of the drawn wires ( for the same length and cross section ) were slightly greater* than that of the undrawn wires .
In calculating the total resistance in the circuit external to the galvanometer , this increase of resistance in the drawn wire is not taken into account .
The circuit consisted of 60 cm .
of the undrawn wire , and 60 cm .
of the drawn wire , together with the low resistance galvanometer .
By multiplying the current per division , given in the table of Section 9 , by the total resistance of the circuit , the thermo-electric difference per degree between drawn and undrawn wires is found .

The effect of hardening by twisting has been partially tried .
Thus two pieces of laboratory copper wire were taken , and one was in successive experiments twisted 1 turn , 3 turns , 5 turns , 7 turns , 8 !
, turns per cm .
The wire with 8| turns per cm .
got quite brittle , and broke when an attempt was made to put more twists into it .
The twisted wire was then heated red hot by an electric current , and allowed to cool .
This partially annealed it .
The results are given in the following table :\#151 ; 330 Effects of Strain on the Thermo-electric Qualities of Metals .

The effects of twist on the drawn copper wire were also tried , and it was found that 1 , 2 , 3 turns per cm .
in the drawn wire slightly diminished the thermo-electric difference obtained between the undrawn wire and the drawn wire ; but that 4 and 5 turns per cm .
in the drawn wire gave the same thermo-electric difference as was found between the undrawn wire and the untwisted drawn wire .
15 .
The drawn and twisted copper wire was annealed by putting a gradually increasing current through it till it got red-hot , and then , without breaking the circuit , the current was gradually reduced till the wire was at the temperature of the laboratory .
Trying it in this condition along with the undrawn and untwisted copper wire , the current through the hot junction was found to be reversed , being from the drawn twisted and annealed wire to the undrawn wire .
The thermo-electric difference was 0-0081 mikrovolt per degree .
16 .
Similar experiments on platinoid wires as those described in Section 14 on copper wires gave similar results .
Thus 1 , 2 , 3 turns per cm .
in the drawn platinoid wire diminished the thermo-electric-difference obtained between the drawn wire and the undrawn wire ; but 4 and 5 turns per cm .
in the drawn wire gave the same thermoelectric difference ( T477 mikrovolts per degree ) as was found between the untwisted drawn wire and the undrawn wire .
17 .
The drawn and twisted platinoid wire was partially annealed , and the thermo-electric difference between it and the undrawn platinoid wire was thereby reduced from T477 mikrovolts per degree to 0"567 mikrovolt per degree .
18 .
A beginning has been made of determining the thermo-electric differences between free wires and wires previously permanently elongated 1 , 2 , 3 , \amp ; c. per cent , by a simple longitudinal stress ; also wires while ( a ) under stress , stretching them within their limits of elasticity ; and ( b ) under stress , stretching them beyond their limits of elasticity .
I hope to be able soon to communicate the results to the Society .
