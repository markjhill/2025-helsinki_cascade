) The object of the present investigation has been to determine the effects of the growth of tumours on the weight of ' the principal organs of the body .
The fundamental conception on which the work is based is that the weights of the different organs of normal animals bear a relatively constant ratio to the total weight of the body .
Such investigations are capable of throwing light on many debatable points of cancer metabolism , and give important indications of promising directions for future more detailed work .
The previous investigations of workers in the Imperial Cancer Research Fund ( Cramer , Haaland , Murray ) , , and recently by Moreschi , in Ehrlich 's Institute , have dealt with this subject from the standpoint of the ratio of tumour-weight to total body-weight and the influence of the former on the latter and on the normal growth of the body .
In the present investigation a closer analysis of the factors is-attempted , in reasonable expectation that under the influence of the physical and chemical changes taking place in the bodies of animals bearing tumours , , definite aberrations from the normal relations may be produced .
From a consideration of these aberrations it may be possible to infer the nature of these changes .
Method .
The following precautions have been taken to avoid the sources of error ' Which would impair the comparability of the numerical data .
Normal and tumour-bearing animals ( tumour-animals ) were chosen which were free from obvious illness , looked healthy and strong even when bearing large tumours .
They were killed by fracture-dislocation of the cervical vertebrae .
Estimations were made on 300 animals .
With Tew exceptions the mice were taken three at a time , the rats singly .
In all cases the comparisons are made with total body-weight less the contents of the alimentary canal .
The abdominal organs were removed in the order\#151 ; spleen , alimentary canal , kidneys , liver .
The thorax was then opened , blood-clots removed , and lungs and heart excised .
The heart was separated from the lungs and the Relative Sizes of the Organs of Rats and etc. 287 blood-clots removed from its cavities .
The unopened alimentary canal was first weighed , then split open throughout its length and washed with 0'75-per-cent .
salt solution till the wash-water remained clear .
It was then dried rapidly between filter-paper .
All the organs were weighed in closed weighing bottles , after which the moisture was driven off in a drying oven kept at 103 ' to 105 ' C. for 40 to 50 hours , and the weight of the dry substance determined .
The tumour weights include the fluid and necrotic parts as well as the growing parenchyma .
Hence , in comparison with the results obtained from normal animals , especial weight must be laid on the ratios of the weights of organs to body-weights minus tumour .
Normal Ratios .
A large number of normal mice belonging to different age-periods were examined .
The variations due to age are most marked when the animals pass from a milk ( sucking ) to a vegetarian ( adult ) diet .
The alimentary canal is relatively twice as heavy in animals a few days after the establishment of vegetarian diet as at nine days ( milk diet ) .
During the remainder of life the ratio remains fairly constant with a slight diminution in old age .
Nearly identical variations are presented by the liver .
Heart and lungs are , on the contrary , relatively larger in sucking mice .
The kidney shows only small variations , whether we compare animals of different ages or individuals of the same age .
The spleen varies enormously , but is relatively smaller in sucking and young animals than in adults .
It follows that comparisons are only allowable between animals of the same age .
Equally extended observations have not been considered necessary in the case of rats , and in these the control observations have been restricted to normal animals of the same weight as the tumour-animals .
Considerations which will be fully dealt with in a later paper led me to undertake experiments in which rats were fed with a uniform diet ( 150 c.c. milk , 350 grammes rice or oatmeal , and 60 grammes bread ) for several weeks or months .
The weight-ratios of some organs were found to be modified by this diet , those of the alimentary canal , heart , and kidneys were relatively smaller , that of the lungs larger , and that of liver unaltered .
A number of tumour-rats were fed on the same diet , and the control estimations are taken from normal rats correspondingly fed .
In the same way the tumour-rats fed on the ordinary laboratory diet are compared with similarly fed normals .
Ratios in Tumour-animals .
Alimentary Canal.\#151 ; The general impression of all the estimations has been that , under the experimental conditions thus far investigated , the relative 288 Dr. F. Medigreceanu .
Relative Sizes of the [ Dec. 21 , weight of the alimentary canal to " body-weight less tumour " falls within or near the normal ratio .
It is remarkable that in most cases ( c/ * the figures for mouse tumours , Table I , and for rat tumours , Table II ) , the relative weight of the alimentary canal diminishes with the size of the tumour , whether the latter is carcinoma or sarcoma , growing rapidly or slowly .
Only in 8 to 10 out of 200 cases , and then especially in animals with small tumours , did the weight ratio of the alimentary canal reach the highest physiological value .
A hypertrophy of this organ-system could not be demonstrated during the several stages of growth studied for the tumours examined .
Liver.\#151 ; The liver , on the contrary , appears hypertrophied in all cases when the ratio to " body-weight less tumour " is taken .
This holds for spontaneous as well as transplanted tumours .
A direct parallel subsists , up to a certain Table I. No. Age .

In a single case , and under exceptional circumstances , an aberrant result was obtained .
A mouse with a tumour five months old , of strain " 37 , " weighed 19'5 grammes , while its tumour weighed 22'5 grammes .
The liver was of normal weight ; it is not possible to exclude the possibility that a stage of hypertrophy had been passed through .
Since this case stands alone , undue weight cannot be laid upon it .
The ratio of liver to " body-weight plus tumour " corresponds in the majority of cases with the normal values .
Frequently , however , one finds , on the one hand , as e.g. with the rat-tumours ( and also Tumour " 39 " ) , that the liver is too large in proportion to " body-weight plus tumour " ; on the 290 Dr. F. Medigreceanu .
Relative Sizes of the [ Dec. 21 , other hand , especially when the tumours are very large , the ratio of liver to " body-weight plus tumour " is smaller than the normal value .
The weight of the tumour usually includes an indeterminate quantity of dead material ( necrosis and fluid ) , as already pointed out , so that more accurate comparisons are made with " body-weight less tumour , " and on this basis the liver is always enlarged .
The constancy of this result makes a more detailed discussion desirable .
It is necessary to be sure that the disturbance of the normal ratio is not only apparent and due neither to mere loss of weight in the other organs , nor to the liver reaching a weight equivalent to what it would have attained in the same animal during the natural augmentation of the body-weight .
The first of these two possibilities is easily excluded .
The liver is heavier than normal , even if the estimated loss in weight be added to the body-weight .
One example may suffice .
The quota contributed by the tumour to the total weight ( body plus tumour ) was calculated in a rat with transplanted sarcoma from daily weighings of the animal , and weekly estimations of the growth of the tumour .
It was found that the maximum body-weight was 132 grammes 12 days before the animal was killed .
The liver weighed 105 grammes at death .
The ratio 105 :132 : : 1:12-5 is higher than the normal 1:19'9 .
The tumour in this case weighed 55-7 grammes , and if we assume that this were merely a part of a normal animal , the total ( rat plus tumour ) reaches 180 grammes .
The contents of the alimentary canal weighed 12'6 , which , deducted from the gross weight , 180 grammes , gives 167'4 grammes , and thus the liver ratio 1 :15'9 is higher than normal .
Loss of body-weight does not introduce a disturbing factor in the majority of the cases examined , since most animals presented the same weight as at the time of inoculation .
In some cases the body-weight had increased , and only in a few cases had it diminished .
The differences in liver-ratio are , however , considerable , so that the second possibility can also be excluded .
A rat was examined 20 days after complete disappearance of a transplanted sarcoma which had reached a size of 10 to 12 grammes .
The liver was found to be enlarged still ( Table II ) .
This case should be compared with the results obtained in pregnant mice in which a hypertrophy of the liver was also noted ( vide Table I ) ; apparently this hypertrophy disappears in a short time after the birth of the young .
There are , however , other differences between the livers of normal and tumour animals , such as the increased percentage of water in the latter ( as high as 4 to 5 per cent , more than in normals ) , which indicate qualitative differences as well .
More detailed investigations are being made to determine when the hypertrophy of the liver commences .
So far the results have been 1909 .
] Organs of Rats and , etc. inconstant .
Distinct hypertrophy was found , in one case with a tumour one-seventh of the body-weight , but the ratio fell within the normal in other cases for tumours of the same size .
Heart.\#151 ; The heart is enlarged both in transplanted and in spontaneous tumours .
In general the enlargement is proportional to the weight of the tumour { cf. Tumours " 63 , " " 50 , " rat-sarcoma , Table II ) .
Exceptions are not infrequent .
Eapidly growing tumours , " J " do not give so marked hypertrophy as those which grow more slowly with a richly developed blood-supply , e.g. " Tumours " 50 " and " 39 .
" The mechanical factors are in all probability mainly responsible .
The pregnant normal animals examined did not present a corresponding enlargement of the heart .
Kidney.\#151 ; The kidneys of tumour mice ( and pregnant mice ) showed only minor variations such as are met with in normal animals .
The transplanted rat sarcoma , on the contrary , induced constantly an increase in the size of these organs .
The enlargement could be recognised with the naked eye in animals with large tumours , and the weights were found to be double the normal expectation in many cases .
This enlargement was directly proportional to the size of the tumours , as in the case of the liver and heart .
The sarcomata of the Mouse " 92 , " " 37 sarcoma , " " 100 sarcoma , " did not produce this change .
Therefore it is not characteristic of the sarcomata .
Microscopical examination of the enlarged kidneys showed hypersemia , with here and there hemorrhages and degenerated cells .
Mitoses seemed to be more frequent in the tubular epithelium than in normal kidneys .
Lung.\#151 ; The results are inconstant .
In one and the same strain normal and enlarged lungs are found and constant alterations are not produced .
Spleen.\#151 ; As in normal animals , the spleen is subject to enormous individual variations in tumour-animals .
Although exceptionally large spleens were found in many cases { e.g. Tumours " 173 , " " B " ) , it is impossible to refer the hypertrophy to the presence of the tumours .
In conclusion , we desire to express our indebtedness to the Executive Committee and Director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund for the facilities afforded for this investigation .
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance and interest of Dr. Bashford and his Assistants , Drs. Murray , Haaland , and Russell , and of Dr. Cramer .
Summary .
Weighing experiments on 200 rats and mice bearing tumours ( 13 transplantable and four spontaneous mouse tumours , 2 transplantable rat tumours ) have shown :\#151 ; 292 Relative Sizes of the Organs of Rats and Mice , etc. ( 1 ) No increase in weight of the alimentary canal as compared with normal ratios .
( 2 ) Hypertrophy of the liver in all cases .
Up to a certain point the hypertrophy is proportional to the weight of the tumour .
( 3 ) Hypertrophy of the heart in most cases .
This also is in general proportion to the size of the tumour .
( 4 ) Kidneys of normal weight except in the case of a transplantable rat sarcoma in which hypertrophy is produced .
( 5 ) Varying ratios for the lungs .
The most important result of the investigation has been the discovery of an enlargement of the liver , in animals bearing carcinomata and sarcomata , whether transplanted or naturally arising .
The nature and causation of this hypertrophy is being further investigated .
It would be natural to seek an explanation in an increased assimilation of food through the alimentary canal .
The results show an absence of a corresponding hypertrophy of the digestive tract for tumour animals .
Histological studies have not , so far , indicated any clear anatomical changes .
In a future paper the hypertrophy of the liver will be considered from the standpoint of the intake and elaboration of food material from the intestinal canal , and of the excretory functions of the liver .
The possibility will be considered of the circulation of abnormal products given off by the tumour , and the possibility that the liver may elaborate abnormal products to meet the special needs of the tumour .
