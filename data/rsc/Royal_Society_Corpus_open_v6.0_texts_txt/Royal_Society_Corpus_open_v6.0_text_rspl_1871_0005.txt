" On a Periodic Change of the Elements of the Force of Terrestrial Magnetism discovered by Professor Hornstein .
" Communicated by the Foreign Secretary .
Received July 1871 .
[ From the Anzeiger der k. Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien for June 15 , 1871 .
] Professor Hornstein , of Prague , has communicated to the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Vienna a paper entitled " On the dependence of the ' Earth 's Magnetism on the Rotation of the Sun .
" He shows that the changes of each of the three elements of the force of terrestrial magnetism ( declination , inclination , and horizontal force ) indicate a period of 26^ days .
The periodic change of declination for Prague ( 1870 ) amounts to 0*705 sin ( j ?
+190 ' 20r ) , where #=0 ' at the commencement of 1870 , and a ?
=360 ' at the commencement of 1871 .
For Vienna the range is a little larger .
The range of inclination is nearly one-third of that of declination , that of the intensity nearly 24 units of the 4th decimal ( the intensity in June 1870 was nearly 2*0485 ) .
Professor Hornstein regards these changes of the earth 's magnetism as the effect of the sun 's rotation , and by a mean of several determinations finds for the duration of the period 26*33 days .
This number may con- , sequently be regarded as the result of the first attempt to determine the synodic period of the sun 's rotation by means of the magnetic needle .
The resulting true periodic time of the sun 's rotation is 24*55 days , almost exactly agreeing with the time of rotation of the sun-spots in the .
sun 's equator deduced from astronomical observations ( according to Sporer 24*541 days ) .

( Abstract .
) The author , after adverting to the process by which in a former paper he had attempted the computation of the Lengths of Waves of Light , for the entire series measured in the Solar Spectrum by Kirchhoff , from a limited number of measured Wave-Lengths , and to the discordances between the results of these computations and the actual measure of numerous wavelengths to which he subsequently had access , calls attention to his remark that means existed for giving accuracy to the whole .
The object of the present paper is so to use these means as to produce a table of corrections [ Nov. 16 , Prof. Cayley on the applicable through the entire range of Kirchhoff 's lines , and actually to apply the corrections to those computed wave-lengths which relate to spectral lines produced by the atmosphere and by many metals . .
# \#169 ; Adopting as foundation the comparisons with Angstrom 's and Ditschei-ner 's measures given in the former paper , and laying these down graphically , the author remarks that in some parts of the spectrum the agreement of the two experimenters is very close , that in some parts they are irreconcilable , and that in one part ( where they agree ) there is a peculiarity which leads to the supposition that some important change was made in Kirchhoff 's adjustments .
He then explains the considerations on which he has drawn a correction-curve , whose ordinates are to give the corrections applicable to his former computed numbers .
A general table of corrections is then given , and this is followed by tables of the Lengths of the Light-Waves for the air and metals as corrected by the quantities deduced from that general table .
The author remarks that he has not yet succeeded in discovering any relation among the wave-lengths for the various lines given by any one metal \amp ; c. which can suggest any mechanical explanation of their origin .

I am indebted to Dr. Zeuthen for the remark that although the " off-points " and " off-planes , " as explained in the memoir , are real singularities , they are not the singularities to which the 0 , 6 ' of the formulae refer .
The most convenient way of correcting this is to retain all the formulae with 0 , 0 ' as they stand , but to write w , for the number of " off-points " and " off-planes " respectively ; viz. we thus have io , off-points , 0 , unexplained singular points , and io ' , off-planes , O ' , unexplained singular planes , the formulae as they stand , taking account of the unexplained singularities 0 and 6 ' , but not taking any account at all of the off-points and off-planes o ' , u ) ' .
The extended formulae in which these are taken into account are :\#151 ; ci(n \#151 ; 2)= k \#151 ; \#151 ; B " p p-J- 2\lt ; r -| -Scj , b(n\#151 ; 2)== p + 2/ 3 + 3y+3* , c(n\#151 ; .
