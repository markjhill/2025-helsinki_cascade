512 On the Spectrum of Elementary Silicon .
By Sir William Crookes , O.M. , P.R.S. ( Received June 16 , \#151 ; Read June 25 , 1914 .
) Few elements have had so much attention directed to their spectra as silicon , and scarcely any element has shown such diverse results between recorded observations of different observers .
Hitherto no observer has recorded a complete table of lines from the shortest ultra-violet to the last pair of lines visible in the red .
The values I now give are the result of observations extending over 11 years , during which time the advent of the colour-sensitive plate has made possible photographic records of lines that are visible .
The accurate tabulation of the wave-lengths of lines in the silicon spectrum is of considerable importance in physical astronomy ; several stars , especially those of the Orion type , have lines corresponding to lines of silicon .
Some years ago whilst studying the lines in a particular part of the silicon spectrum I was surprised to find that lines given by my own spectroscope did not altogether tally with lines in the same part of the spectrum recorded by other observers , some being altogether absent , while the wavelengths of others did not correspond within allowable errors of observation .
The cause of some of these discrepancies was traced to impurities in the samples of silicon used by myself and others .
I endeavoured to clear up these doubtful points by trying to secure elementary silicon in as high a state of purity as possible .
Every sample that could be obtained by purchase was tested and found to be far from pure , although impurities were different in kind as well as quantity .
Many different samples of fused silicon have been used by me in this research .
Most samples were obtained by purchase from dealers in chemicals , rare metals , and their alloys .
I could not find a sample sufficiently free from metallic impurity to show no extraneous lines in the spectrum .
Some samples gave an excess of one set of lines , while others would give a number of lines due to another impurity .
It was evident that all commercial silicons were impure , and the impurities in some samples were different from those in others .
At first I started getting the lines actually due to silicon by enlarging the photographed spectra and then comparing the lines they had in common .
In this way I got at last a tolerably good map of the silicon lines , which map , however , differed seriously from many maps given by other observers .
The Carborundum Company at Niagara Falls have been making large pans , cylinders , and vessels of fused and cast silicon for the use of manuOn the Spectrum of Elementary Silicon .

I wrote to the Niagara firm explaining my difficulties , and asking for silicon of a high degree of purity .
They courteously replied that it was not possible to manufacture silicon in commercial quantities of a higher degree of purity than 98 per cent. , but occasionally they got small specimens occluded in slags assaying 99 per cent , and over .
They sent me three samples having this origin , giving on analysis 99*56 , 99*86 , and 99*98 per cent , of silicon , the impurities being titanium , iron , and aluminium .
These samples have been used in correcting the lines given by other less pure samples , and in clearing up doubtful points where impurity would interfere with certainty of identification .
Fused silicon is an interesting material , and when pure takes a high polish .
Used as electrodes with the high frequency current much trouble is caused owing to a coating of oxide that forms almost at once , the spark becoming much less luminous .
Under these conditions the surface of the electrodes presents a curious pitted appearance , as shown in fig. 1 .
Fig. 1 .
After trying many methods for keeping the spark bright , success was achieved by frequently removing the poles and grinding the surfaces with an emery wheel ; in some cases where an exposure of seven hours was given a second pair of electrodes was employed , changing every 15 minutes , and re-grinding one pair while the others were sparking .

The instrument used for measuring the lines is that described in my paper " On the Ultra-violet Spectrum of Kadium."* In most cases pure iron was used to obtain the standard lines for comparison .
Self-induction was introduced by an adjustable coil interposed in the path of the secondary current so as to suppress most of the air lines .
The standard lines of iron or other metal selected for comparison with the silicon lines were photographed simultaneously on the same film , so that measurements could be taken in the comparator .
From data so obtained the wave-length of each line was calculated by my son\#151 ; Bernard H. Crookes , M.Sc.\#151 ; according to the method given in my paper " On the Ultra-violet Spectrum of Badium."j* Becently an improvement has been made in my spectrograph , due to difficulties met with in photographing some of the very faint lines in the silicon spectrum .
Long exposures were often necessary , in some cases many hours , and it was found that the variation in the temperature of the laboratory caused sufficient shift in the spectrum to make an otherwise sharp line appear blurred .
With my original plan of projecting the two spectra upon the plate in succession by means of stops placed before the slit the temperature variation introduced inaccuracy ; because the standard spectrum of iron or other metal only needed comparatively short exposure , and the room temperature during that period might be different to the mean temperature during the long silicon exposure .
To remove this uncertainty a right-angled quartz reflecting prism is mounted so as to cover the lower half of the slit .
The upper half of the slit receives the direct light from the sparking silicon , whilst the light from the standard metal spark is at the side , and is passed into the lower half of the slit by reflection through the right-angled prism .
In this way both the standard and the silicon spark can be photographed simultaneously .
The difficulty introduced by the varying brightness of the two sparks is avoided by adjustable diaphragms mounted between each spark and the slit ; by adjusting these , the light from the brighter spark is reduced so as to equal the fainter one and make the resulting spectra of the same intensity .
The same end may be gained by giving one-half of the exposure necessary for the brighter spark at the commencement , and one-half at the finish .
For example , in the case of a seven hours ' exposure of silicon , with a vanadium standard that needs only one hour , the exposure is made by starting both sparks simultaneously , and after thirty minutes stopping the vanadium and starting it again after six hours and allowing both to finish together .

, On the Spectrum of Elementary Silicon .
515 In this way any shift of the spectrum due to change of temperature results in an apparent broadening of the lines , and both the standard and the silicon are affected in the same way .
The result on the photographic films is shown by two lines of spectra , running parallel to one another and almost , if not quite , touching .
In the case of silicon , lines are met in the whole length of the spectrum from high in the ultra-violet through the visible part to the red rays , and it happens occasionally that lines are present where an almost blank space occurs in the iron spectrum ; in these cases some other element has to be selected containing spectrum lines in the desired gap .
Some of the standard lines chosen have not been measured as accurately as those of iron ; therefore my measurements based on such lines have not the same degree of accuracy as the lines measured against an iron standard .
In some cases , however , I have been able to re-standardise the lines in the silicon used , by measuring them against iron lines near enough for this purpose , but not near enough to the silicon lines .
There are two lines of silicon in the orange-red portion of the spectrum , extremely faint and hazy in appearance ; to get their image with the most sensitive panchromatic films required an exposure of many hours with the 5-prism quartz train .
I therefore used for these lines an instrument designed some years ago whereby eye observations could be taken and recorded with the 5-prism spectrograph .
The apparatus shown in outline drawing , fig. 2 , takes the place usually occupied by the camera in the 5-prism spectrograph .
It consists essentially of a telescope , AB , furnished with the usual micrometer eyepiece , A , and fine wires .
The object lens , B , is mounted on an accurately cut screw , C , of one hundredth of an inch pitch ; by rotating the screw the lens B is moved sideways so as to traverse the spectrum over the wires in the eyepiece A ; the prolongation of the screw C carries a brass drum , D , one inch in diameter , which has ten needle points equally spaced round it .
A narrow roll of paper , E , is mounted on a spool just above the drum D , and one end of the paper is pressed on its surface by a soft rubber roller , F. Botating the drum D therefore draws the paper off the spool E , and imprints on it ten perforations for each revolution of the drum .
As one revolution of drum carries the object glass one hundredth of an inch sideways across the lines under measurement , and the drum is one inch in diameter , the space between each perforation equals 1/ 1000th of an inch movement of the object glass .
( The actual distance apart of the dots on the paper is 0*3146 of an inch .
) For convenience of calculation one of the needle points is doubled , so as to note each complete revolution .
This device of marking the distances on the paper at the same moment as recording the lines eliminates any uncertainty 516 Sir W. Crookes .
that would otherwise be due to subsequent unequal alteration in the length of the paper .
The paper band , on its way from the spool E to the drum D , passes over Spool of paperChain Rubber Fig. 2 .
a small table , F ; at this point a fine pen , Gr , carried on a slide , can be made to trace a line any desired length across the strip of paper by pressure of the finger upon the lever H. On the Spectrum of Elementary Silicon .
517 The method of measurement is as follows :\#151 ; By rotating the screw , the spectrum is made to traverse the field of view , and when the line to be recorded coincides with the fine wires in the eyepiece , a touch of the finger on the lever , H , draws an ink record across the paper strip .
When all the lines are recorded the paper strip is removed , and the distance between the dots on the paper can be subdivided into 10 parts by means of a transparent scale , by which the distance apart of any of the recorded lines can easily be measured .
From these measurements the wave-lengths of the lines can be calculated in the same way as^ if the measurements were .taken from a photograph .
The distance apart of the sodium lines Di and D2 , recorded on the paper strip , is 23 mm. A good method of correcting these paper records is to take several observations upon each line in succession , moving the line backwards over the fine wire between each record .
In the case of very sharp lines the records practically are in the same place .
In other cases the ink lines may not be exactly superposed , because the lines to be measured are faint and hazy , and differences in position of the records are due to the almost insuperable difficulty of the eye hitting on the exact centre of the nebulosity .
In such cases accuracy is obtained by taking the mean of the adjacent records of the same line .
The first published record of the silicon spectrum is by G. Salet in 1873 , * who gave the wave-lengths of nine lines in the visible part of the spectrum from the orange to violet .
His numbers differ from those of later observers , and as there are more accurate determinations of wave-lengths , I have omitted them as of no present value .
In 1893 and 1898f Rowland published the wave-length of 30 lines occurring in the solar spectrum , ascribed by him to silicon .
In 1900J : Sir Norman Lockyer gave the wave-lengths of 14 lines in the blue part of the spectrum .
He used silicon bromide in a vacuum tube and elementary silicon .
In 1901S Sir Walter Noel Hartley gave the wave-lengths of eight lines photographically recorded in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum .
He obtained them by saturating one of the carbon poles with sodium silicate .

This paper is a revision , as far as the wave-lengths are concerned , of measurements of the lines published by the same observer in 1883 .
Sir W. Crookes .
In 1902* Exner and Haschek published a list of 45 wave-lengths of lines in the silicon spectrum from the extreme ultra-violet to the blue .
In 1903f A. de Gramont , using elementary silicon and sodium silicate on platinum wire , gave a list of silicon lines partly selected for astronomical comparisons .
In 1905f J. Lunt gave a list of nine lines of silicon , in the blue portion of the spectrum .
These were seen in various vacuum tubes .
In the same year E. B. Erost and J. A. Brown , S using elementary silicon and titanium prepared in the electric furnace , made careful measurements of three silicon lines selected as being of especial utility in determinations of the radial velocity of numerous stars .
In 1908|| de Gramont , in conjunction with C. de Watteville , using silicon poles in an atmosphere of hydrogen , published a further list of 23 lines ranging from the extreme ultra-violet to the point in the violet where de Gramont 's earlier list commenced .
In 19111T Eder and Valenta published a list of 28 lines in the silicon spectrum , mostly in the ultra-violet portion and extending down to the blue .
In the Tables which follow I give the wave-lengths of the silicon lines measured by the observers named above .
Earlier spectrum observations were necessarily imperfect , chiefly because of the difficulty in getting elementary silicon even in an approximate state of purity .
Some observers also have limited the range of their observations to a small part of the spectrum , for astronomical and other reasons .
