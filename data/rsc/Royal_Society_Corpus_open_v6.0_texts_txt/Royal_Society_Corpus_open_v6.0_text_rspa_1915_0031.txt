I suggested that snob vortioes were due to tbs conjunction ok tbs inain strearn bowing over the barrier with opposing looal streams oreated b/ looal diberences ok pressure set up in the nsigbbourbood ok tbs barrier b^ tbs oscillating water .
Exception was taken to this explanation , and also , later , to experiments mads with a box partially voversd with tbin gutta peroba diapbragms , kor the purpose ok proving the kormation ok the local dikkerenoes ok pressure alluded to .
lbs oldest ok the present paper is to give an aeoount ok kurtber experiments carried out kor this same purpose , with pressure indicators which are kree krom the objection urged against tbs diapbragms , vir .

DrM-'e-rees 0/ plunger in the direction I'D must indicate a. greater pressure OQ I ' than on L , and in the contrary direction a greater pressure on D than OQ D. 0/ t/ sr-r.^ ^essr-^s ^^ocr^o/ 'S .
IVith these pressure indicators the various dikkerences ok pressure set up in oscillating v^ater can he explored , hut I shall tiers conkne m^selk to those which arise close to a suhmerged obstacle .
Iu my koriuer paper* each halk oscillation , or swing ok tire water iu oue direction , was called a swing .
Ike time during which the water approaches the ineau level position was called the kirst part ok the swing , and that during which it departs krona the level was called the second part ok the swing .
Using the sains tsrins , the suggestions inade on pp. 292-294 as to the dikkerences ok pressure set up h^ the presence ok an ohstacle in oscillating water ina^ he thus expressed : ( 1 ) During the 6rst part ok an^ swing the pressure at an^ point in the lee ok a suhnaerged ohstacle is less than the pressure at an^ point\#151 ; however near it\#151 ; on its suinlnit .
( 2 ) During the second part ok an^ swing the ahove applies still to the upper portion ok the lee side , hut over the lower portion the case is reversed , and the pressure at an^ point there is than the pressure at any point on the summit ok the ohstacle .
In proving these conclusions h^ means ok pressure indicators , the ohstacle used is a hlock ok wood with vertical sides , padded at the ends and underneath to enahle it to he pressed tightly against the sides and hottom ok the tank , and hollowed out in the part where the pressure indicators are placed .
Dig. 2 shows a vertical section in perspective ok the hollow portion ok the hlock and ok the pressure indicators , DD , which are held in position h^ tightly kitting hored corks , D , X. The circular hole 8 , alrout ^ inch in diameter , is the sole means ok communication hetween the water in the cavity and that outside .
Through this hole the pressure ok the water passing over the ohstacle can he communicated to Ih , D ?
, the inner heads ok the plungers ok the pressure indicators , hut no oscillation can he set up in the cavity through so small a hole , and on^ the ver^ small yuantit^ ok water that is displaced h^ the graphite rods in their movements to and kro passes in and out .
( Ireat care has to he taken to rid this ohstacle and pressure indicators ok all air hekore this^ are placed in position , as the smallest air * ^,06 .

Lbe meaning ok an/ movements ok the plungers , when the water is oscillated , is quite clear .
Lbe on/ variable pressures acting on the plungers are the pressure at HI , transmitted tbrougb the water in the cavit/ to Li , L ?
, and the pressures at Li , L ? .
Ik botb plungers are pressed outwards it sbows that the pressure is greater at HI than that either at Li or at Ls ; ik botb are pressed in , the reverse is the case .
Ik one is in and the other out , the pressure at HI is less than the external pressure on the List and greater than that on the second .

In order that the direction ok 6ow ok the water at various points migbt be recorded , the three stream indicators made ok ravelled silk tipped with cork were used .
Lbe one over the obstacle was mounted on a ver/ long beadiess pin so as to beep it well awa/ krom the local disturbances near the obstacle .

lbs distribution ok pressure kormerl^ suggested , and given again on p. 406 , is here also ' instilled .
I'or while the upper plunger still remains kull^ out , the lower is pressed liome , sbowing that during this ssoond part ok a swing , altbougb the pressure on the upper part ok the lee side ok the obstacle remains less tlian that on top , the pressure on its lower part is greater tlian that on top .
Hot on^ tliis , liowever , but the stream indioators point to tbs kaot that while the main stream oontinned to llow krom lekt to right , tbere was a current in tbs opposite direction close to the obstacle ; kor the stream indicator close to the block bas a distinct trend krom right to lekt , altbougb tbs otbsr two are bent right down in the opposite direction .
Here , then , is evidence , not on^ ok the suggested ditkerenoes ok pressure , but also ok the kaot that the obange in the direction ok pressure on the lower part ok the lee side is tbs result ok no general turning movement on the part ok the lower water , but is purely local , and is due to the presence ok the obstacle .

In m^ paper on " lbs Origin and Orowtb ok Hippie-mark " I remarked , " tbs second condition kor tbs kormation ok a ripple vortex is that tbs resultant gravity pressure along the ridge on its lee side sball tend upwards."* ^Vitb the obstacle having perkeotl^ vertical sides with whiob tbs above experiments were made , tbere was , ok course , no vertical component in the pressure ok the water on tbs sides , but tbs direction ok the vertical component ok the pressure ok * ^oo .

I embedded a pressure indicator in a 8o1id obstacle 9.8 sbown in section in LZ .

His rs8ult was the same in eacb ease , and was such a8 was to be expected krom tbs experiments with bori^ontal indicators\#151 ; during tbs Lrst part ok a swing krom Iskt to right the plunger was pressed downwards , during the sseovd part it was raised .
It is vlear that these local dibsrences ok pressure , in water that would otherwise be at rest iu tbs lee ok a barrier , roust eause loeal eurreuts tbere\#151 ; downwards during tbs brst part ok a swing and upwards during the ssooud .
During the brst part ok a swing , tberekore , there is a loeal pressure dikkerence which ereatss the eouditiou necessary to give rise to sueli ^ets as I Lavs observed b^ placing a grain ok permanganate ok potasli ou tbs suiuruit ok an obstacle.* During tbs seeoud part ok tbs swing tbs pressure iudioators sbow that tbere uiust be a looal eurrsut iu the lee ok tbs obstavle , soiuewbere below the surkaos , whieb uioves iu opposition to the roain streani tbv obstaole and Iwo ourrents opposing one another in this wa^ are all that is needed to vauss sueb a vortex as was made maniksst in the lee ok tbs obstacle b^ the grain ok permanganate ok potasb* during the second part ok the swing .
