] The Spectrum of Metallic Manganese .
The spectrum of manganese obtained in various ways has been the subject of much investigation .
Huggins , Thalen , and Lecocq de Bojsbaudran have studied the spark spectra of manganese compounds ; Angstrom , Thalen , Cornu , Lockyer , also Livetng and Dewar , the arc spectrum ; Simmler , yon Lichtenfels , Lecocq de Boisbaudran and Lockyer have investigated the flame spectra , while Marshall Watts has given us most accurate measurements of the wave-lengths of lines and bands observed in the spark and oxyhydrogen flame spectra of spiegel-eisen , manganese dioxide , and other compounds of this metal .
An account of the spectrum of manganese obtained by the oxyhydrogen flame was prepared for insertion in Part I. of this research , but it was omitted for the reason that when investigating the spectrum of the Bessemer flame , I found it necessary to compare the spectrum of elementary manganese under different conditions with that of -its oxide .
Comparative experiments were made with various alloys containing manganese , and with compounds of that substance ignited in the oxyhydrogen flame .
The results showed that the alloys invariably gave a more distinct and extensive series of bands than the compounds containing the same proportion of manganese as the alloys .
Moreover , the bands were always accompanied by lines , and the lines were stronger in the spectra of the alloys than in the compounds .
Hie principal lines were always distinctly visible when the conditions were such that the bands could barely be seen .
For instance , when the spectrum of spiegel-eisen was photographed with a very short exposure , in fact by a mere flash ot light , oi when steel containing a very small amount of manganese was burnt in the oxyhydiogen flnm\lt ; and its spectrum photographed .
The various materials used haw been fen\lt ; \gt ; manganese , containing 80 per cent , of manganese , spiegel-eisen , containing 18 t\lt ; \gt ; per cent. , silico-spiegel , containing 10 per cent , of silicon and 18 to -0 pei coni , of manganese , pig-iron , composition undetermined , and Iurtons tool steel .
15.1.05 Ferromanganese yielded a very fine spectrum after an exposure varying from 15 to 30 minutes , better in fact than any compound of that substance .
It may thus be generally stated that manganese alloys containing iron yield a more distinctive spectrum of manganese than any compound containing the same proportion of that element .
( See the upper spectra on Plate 14 .
) Metallic manganese , deposited on platinum by the electrolysis of a perfectly pure solution of the chloride , was heated in the oxyhydrogen flame for half-an-hour and its spectrum photographed .
Pure manganic oxide was prepared from a solution of potassium permanganate by the action of alcohol and a small quantity of sulphurous acid .
The precipitated oxide , washed and ignited , was heated on a support of kyanite in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe for an hour and 20 minutes .
It will be seen that as there is a considerable difference between 30 and 80 minutes in the exposure , a corresponding difference in the width and intensity of the bands common to the two spectra obtained from the metal and the oxide may be anticipated .
Also bands invisible or barely discernible in the spectrum of the metal with 30 minutes exposure will , it is possible , be clearly defined after an exposure of the oxide for 80 minutes .
The same spectrum as regards its leading features as that yielded by metallic manganese , was obtained by deflagrating a mixture of finely-powdered potassium permanganate and lamp-black .

1037 Manganic Oxide .
The following measurements appear to belong to bands peculiar to the manganic oxide spectrum ; that it to say , on comparing the photographs of the spectra of metallic manganese and manganic oxide , they appear to consist of the same groups of lines and bands with the addition of these which at once strike the eye when the whole spectrum is viewed .
Hence we may conclude that the spectrum obtained by intense ignition of manganic oxide consists of the bands and lines due to the element manganese , with the addition of those bands which are due to the oxide of manganese .

also overlying M , which is not visible , probably on account of the strong group of iron lines at this point .
There is also a weak band beyond N. seen as diffused rays in the Bessemer spectrum , but which appears as two groups of very fine lines in the manganic oxide spectrum .
The following is a list of 87 lines and edges of bands which are common to the spectrum of metallic manganese and that obtained from manganese dioxide .
The spectrum of the metal received only half-an-hours exposure , that of the oxide an hour and twenty minutes .
The bands of the one may be a little wider than those of the other owing to the longer exposure .
The intense ignition of the oxide certainly causes its dissociation .
It will be noticed that many lines have been measured as iron lines by Fievez and Thal^n , Vogel and Thal^n , Kayser and Rung , and by Cornu .
Some of these are unquestionably manganese lines , others may closely approximate , or coincide , in wave-length with iron lines .
It is quite certain , after careful examination , that the photographs of the manganese spectrum , whether obtained from the metal or the pure oxide , contain no iron lines , since all the principal lines of this element are absent .
