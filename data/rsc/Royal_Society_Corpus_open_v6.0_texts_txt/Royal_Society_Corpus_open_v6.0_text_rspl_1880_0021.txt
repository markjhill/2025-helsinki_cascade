" Note on the Determination of Magnetic Inclination in the Azores .
" By T. E. Thorpe , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received November 13 , 1830 .
With the exception of a series of determinations made by the officers of the " Challenger " at Ponta Delgada , St. Michael , in 1873 , no magnetic observations have , so far as I can learn , been made in the Azores since the time , of Captain Vidal 's hydrographic survey in 1843-4 .
A visit to these islands during the past summer has enabled me to offer the small contribution to their magnetic history which forms the subject of the present communication .
Magnetic observations are made with some difficulty in the Azores , on account of the intensely volcanic character of the islands .
Considerable care was however taken in selecting the stations , and there is no reason to suppose that the observations are affected to any great -extent by the nature of the soil or rock immediately beneath the instrument or in proximity to it .
The places chosen were such as will enable subsequent observers to repeat the determinations on the same spots .
* The dip-circle employed was Dover 3 , belonging to the Owens College , Manchester : I had previously used this instrument in the course of my magnetic observations along the fortieth parallel in North America ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 30 , p. 132 ) , and am again indebted to Professor Balfour Stewart for the loan of it .
It was provided with two needles , each 3^ inches long and 0 27 inch in maximum breadth .
The same precautions were taken to preserve the needles from rust as are described in the communication above referred to , and the method of observation was identical with that previously adopted .
In all cases duplicate and independent observations were made with the two needles .

The station was identical with that on which I made the series of determinations of Photo-chemical Intensity , published in the " Philosophical Transactions " for 1870 .
( " On the Relations between the Sun 's Altitude and the Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight in a Cloudless Sky , " Roscoe and Thorpe , " Phil. Trans. , " 1870 , p. 309 .

Hence it is practically in the same parallel as the Azores .
