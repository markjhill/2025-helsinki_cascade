" On the Mummy Cloth of Egypt ; with Observations on the Manufactures of the Ancients .
" By James Thomson , Esq. , F.R.S. Communicated by Dr. Roget , Sec. R.S. By subjecting the threads of various specimens of cloth , enveloping Egyptian mummies , to accurate microscopic examination , which was done at the request of the author by Mr. Bauer , it was ascertained that they were formed exclusively of the fibres of linen , and not of cotton , a &gt; had been supposed ; a conclusion which is corroborated by other considerations stated by the author .
The paper is accompanied by drawings , exhibiting the appearances of the threads both of cotton nnd of linen , when highly magnified ; and concludes with an histo ?
rical disquisition on the cloth manufactures of the ancients , and the mention of experiments from which it is inferred that the principal colouring materials employed in dyeing the yarn were indigo and saftron .
