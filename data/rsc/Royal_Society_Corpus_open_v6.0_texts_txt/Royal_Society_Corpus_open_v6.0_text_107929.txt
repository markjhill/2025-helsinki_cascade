IN the annexed Table are given the results of a series of observations on the vibrations of the magnetic needle , which I undertook last summer , for the purpose of ascertaining whether its intensity is or is not affected by the changes in the earth 's distance from the sun , or by its declination with respect to the plane of his equator ; for , if we refer the nodes of the planetary orbits to this plane , there appears to be so considerable a degree of coincidence in most of them , as would seem to imply the existence of a more definite law than we are accustomed to attach to the abstract principle of gravitation* .
I am not at present prepared to say much respecting this part of my investigation ; but I have obtained results , which appear to be interesting , relative to the variable force of the magnetic attraction , and the action of the aurora borealis on the direction and intensity of the needle .
I have used two needles , one possessing the north , and the other the south polarity in excess .
To effect this , I have employed , in each case , a slip of seasoned oak , split with the grain , and suspended near the centre by unspun silk several inches long .
This slip of wood serves as a support for a magnetic bar or needle , which is firmly riveted to it near one of its poles-say , for example , the north pole ; whilst the south pole is at liberty to yield longitudinally to any contracting or expanding force* .
The magnetic bar is eight inches long , half an inch wide , and one tenth thick : its south pole extends rather more than two inches beyond the centre of suspension of the wooden support , so that there is nearly an equal portion of the southern half of the needle on each side of the centre , the north end being extended as a lever to control , in great measure , the magnetic movements of the needle- .
A counterpoise of lead is placed at the other extremity of the support , sufficient to allow the north pole to dip at an angle of about forty degrees from the horizontal direction .
The foregoing description also applies to the needle in which the south polarity predominates , except that the poles are reversed , the counterpoise being at the depressed end of the support .
The former I shall distinguish as No. 1 , and the latter as No. 2 .
Each is enclosed in a box of slate ; as , if of metal , the action of the needles might have been disturbed : and the boxes are mounted steadily on bricks , in a room appropriated to them .
A slip of glass at one end of each box enables me to observe the vibrations , which are from east to west , like the horizontal needle .
I have observed that the magnetic intensity is subject to frequent slight variations ; but these I have been mostly unable to refer to any obvious cause , except when accompanied by the appearance of the aurora borealis , which evidently affected the needles on many occasions .
Their vibrations , I think , generally became less rapid with a moist atmosphere , and more so when it was very dry ; but I do not speak with full confidence on this point , as I have only recently made any regular hygrometrical observations .
I might , perhaps , also mention changes of the wind , and snow storms , as being sometimes attended with fluctuations in the intensity of the needles .
If the times of their vibration at different periods are compared , differences in their relative intensity will be noticed ; that of No. 2 .
having on the average been diminishing , during the last three months nearly , in a more rapid ratio than No. 1 .
This must , I think , be considered an interesting fact , if confirmed by future observations .
It does not seem easy to account for the discrepancies which not unfrequently occurred in the indications afforded by the two needles at the same time , and I hesitate to adopt any distinct conclusions from this circumstance without further experiments , which I intend to make with horizontal needles on the same principle .
I have endeavoured by various experiments to ascertain whether there is any decided and permanent difference in the directive force of the opposite poles ; -for example , I have alternately neutralized in an equal degree the poles of a needle by means of a sliding axis , and suspended it horizontally by unspun silk , but the two ends vibrated in nearly equal times .
Other needles on the same principle gave corresponding results , or at least the differences were so inconsiderable , and were so nearly compensated on an average of many observations at different times , that I think it may be safely assumed that there is an equality in the yearly mean of the magnetic intensity of the two poles separately considered .
But on the hypothesis of a central magnetic force , ought not the north pole in this latitude to be acted on with much greater energy than the south ?
for if my experiments may be depended upon , the alternative can scarcely be adopted , of supposing that one pole of a needle is necessarily repelled as strongly as the other is attracted , since it appears that their relative intensity is not always the same .
It therefore seems most reasonable to refer the phenomena of the earth 's magnetism to the agency of electrical currents existing under its surface , as well as above it : indeed , I think it is impossible to doubt that the changes in the intensity and direction of the needle , which are often so transitory , must be due to meteorological causes * .
The aurora borealis which has frequently appeared more or less distinctly this winter , generally affected both needles during some part , and only a part , of the time of its being visible .
On the seventh of last month , the aurora was seen from this place t as soon as it became dusk , and was still visible some time after midnight .
It extended from N.N.E. to N.W. or W.N.W. , and at intervals sent up streams of red and white light which occasionally nearly reached the zenith .
These were most striking early in the evening , and more especially about eleven , or a little later , when the coruscations were beautiful .
At 7 P.M.* I found the needles at 0 , but soon after their north ends moved towards the east , and at 8 to 8-2 their easterly variation was 1 ? ?
15 ' .
They began to return westward at 8 , and soon after 10 P.M. were again stationary in the magnetic meridian .
At 11 to 11 P.M. , I found their intensity had diminished .
Many instances are given in the table of the appearance of the aurora in the horizon about the magnetic north , and extending more or less considerably on each side of it .
It was generally of a pale white , and sometimes I could perceive faint streams shooting upwards from the horizoin a very few degrees , but more often I could not .
It will be seen that considerable variations of the needle usually occurred in the course of the same evenings ; and sometirnes these variations took place on evenings when I did not remark any luminous appearance in the northern horizon .
All the variations at night were towards the east t , whether the aurora was actually visible or not ; and hence may we not conclude , taking it for granted that it is an electrical phenomenon , and that it usually mroves from about the north towards the south , that it must be of the nature of positive electricity ?
And , by a parity of reasoning , may wre not assume the existence of an opposite state of electrical action by day , in order to account for the diurnal westerly variation , which is most considerable in the summer in these latitudes , when the aurora prevails about the south pole ?
This idea seems to be strengthened by a fact I have noticed , that the magnetic intensity is usually less considerable in summer before the middle of the day than it is afterwards ; so that the minimum intensity commonly occurs some hours before the maximum temperature .
It is evident that the elevation of the aurora must often be exceedingly great , probably much more than a thousand miles , as it seems to be generally seen from places very distant from each other at the same time , and in nearly the same direction : thus , for example , the observations made on the beautiful aurora of the 7th ultimo from the vicinity of London , and of this place , seem very nearly to accord in almost every respect .
In conclusion , I will venture to express a hope that the subject of terrestrial magnetism may obtain the attention which it appears to deserve , and that experiments may be made at the same time in different countries , in order to develop its more obscure properties .
It will then perhaps be found that its relations to other natural phenomena are as extensive as they are interesting and important .
At any rate , it seems probable that some light might be thrown on the hypothesis of electrical currents under and above the surface of the earth , and their relative influence on the magnetic needle , if observations on its intensity were to be made on small islands , as remote as possible from any large tracts of land , and the results compared with others obtained by the same apparatus , on extensive continents at stations as nearly as may be in the same magnetic parallels : or , instead of employing the same apparatus , several magnetic needles might be forwarded to different places , after having been carefully compared with a standard needle ; and with these , simultaneous observations might be made , not only in the same parallels , but likewise in different parallels of latitude and longitude in both hemispheres .

Note I.-I have added 8f to each of the numbers marked thus t , in consequence of a slight alteration having been made in the dip of needle No. 1 , on the 8th of November , which appeared to add at least eight seconds to the time of its performing 80 vibrations .
2.-The numbers in the above Table marked thus * , are not comprised in the monthly averages , as I thought it best to include in the mean , only one observation for each day , and most of the results so marked are rather anomalous , or were obtained about the time when the needle varied considerably to the eastward .
I may here remark that I had four needles , from which I noted the variations .
3.-There is a considerable difference in the arcs described by the two needles : this I attribute to the circumstance of No. 1 being not so heavy as No. 2 , the latter having of course required a more considerable counterpoise , in order to give an elevation to its south pole equal to the depression of the north pole of No. 1 .

On adding 202 grains to the weight of No I , and retaining it at the same dip , instead of 41 ? ?
15 ' , it described an arc of 50 ?
, after having performed ?
eighty vibrations .
The difference in the times of the two needles , I attribute to No. 2 being more strongly magnetic than No. 1 .
