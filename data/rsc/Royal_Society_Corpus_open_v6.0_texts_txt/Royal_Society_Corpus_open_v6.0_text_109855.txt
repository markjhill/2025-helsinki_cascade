] The author , having never met with any satisfactory explanation of the property which the diamond possesses of cutting glass , has endeavoured , by experiment , to determine the conditions necessary for this effect , and the mode in which it is produced .
The diamonds chosen for this purpose are naturally crystallized , with curved surfaces , so that the edges are also curvilinear .
In order to cut glass , a diamond of this form requires to be so placed that the surface of the glass is a tangent to a curvilinear edge , and equally inclined laterally to the two adjacent surfaces of the diamond .
Under these circumstances the parts of the glass to which the diamond is applied are forced asunder , as by an obtuse wedge , to a most minute distance , without being removed ; so that a superficial and continuous crack is made from one end of the intended cut to the other .
After this , any small force applied to one extremity is sufficient to extend this crack through the whole substance , and successively across the whole breadth of the glass .
For since the strain at each instant in the progress of the crack is confined nearly to a mathematical point at the bottom of the fissure , the effort necessary for carrying it through is proportionally small .
The author found by trial that the cut caused by the mere passage of the diamond need not penetrate so much as.- , +th of an inch .
He found also that other mineral bodies recently ground into the same form are also capable of cutting glass , although they cannot long retain the power , from want of the requisite hardness .
