) The effect of breathing oxygen-rich gas mixtures on men and animals has been frequently investigated .
The papers which we have consulted deal exclusively with methods in which the respiratory exchange was studied , and the general results of the more recent experiments confirm the view that there is little or no difference in metabolism , as indicated by the gaseous exchange , whether ordinary air or gas mixtures rich in oxygen are respired* A contrary opinion has been formed by some observers , such as Rosenthalf and Lukjanow.^ We have been unable to find any paper later thaU the work of P. Bert which deals with the composition of the blood gases during oxygen inhalation .
While engaged on a study of the nitrogen-content of the blood we accumulated a mass of data on the comparative quantities of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood of cats breathing air and high percentages of oxygen .
These results we bring forward in this paper .
The cats were anaesthetised with urethane .
The process for obtaining the samples of blood , the precautions to be taken in the evacuation of the gases by the tapless form of blood pump , were those described at length in -a former paper , S in which the mode of administration of oxygen has also been fully described .
Respiratory tracings were taken in every case , but we do not consider it necessary to reproduce these .
In many of the experiments , but unfortunately not in all , as these were originally made with another object , determinations were made of the haemoglobin content by the Gowers-Haldane haemoglobinometer .
It has been stated by August Krogh that " the haemoglobin of different animals does not necessarily possess the same relative affinity for oxygen and carbonic oxide."jj If this is true , then the haemoglobin of the blood of * ( !

Composition of Blood Gases during Respiration of Oxygen .
57 different animals cannot be identical in all respects .
C. G. Douglas , * using rabbits as the subject of his experiments and the Gowers-Haldane haemo-globinometer to determine the percentage oxygen capacity of blood , considers that a parallel relationship exists between the oxygen capacity of the blood and the depth of its colour as judged by the haemoglobinometer , and it was essential for our purpose to ascertain if this was true for cats .
In the case of cats we have found that there is complete agreement between the actual values for oxygen as determined with our pump and that of the oxygen capacity by the haemoglobinometer .
We used hirudinised blood of cats ; the saturation method , determined vitro at 38 ' C. , has been described in a former paper.f Percentage Oxygen Capacity of Blood , By pump .

This supports the contention of those who believe that no valid argument exists against the view that the haemochromogen moiety of the molecule of haemoglobin is identical in all animals .

On comparing these two tables , it will be seen that the average blood gases in the two series of experiments are in close accord , indeed practically identical .

The haemoglobin values in the several experiments are very variable in cats .
The theoretical oxygen capacity of cats breathing air , ascertained from 10 experiments in which the haemoglobin values were determined , was 17'15 c.c. per 100 c.c. of blood .
Calculating from the average oxygen found , 14-22 , the average percentage saturation of haemoglobin is about 83 .
In the case of animals breathing oxygen , the theoretical oxygen capacity 1912 .
] Blood Gases during the Respiration of Oxygen .
61 calculated from 10 experiments is 16*67 , giving an average percentage saturation of the haemoglobin of 89*62 ; 6*7 per cent , higher than in the case of animals breathing air .
But it is noticeable that the average haemoglobin percentage for cats breathing air is 92*65 , and for 10 cats respiring oxygen it is only 90*05 .
It would seem evident from these experiments that the inhalation of oxygen does not necessarily augment the quantity of oxygen in the blood , nor does it appear to affect the quantity of carbon dioxide .
On reference to Table II it will be seen that the average carbon dioxide-content of arterial blood in 13 experiments was 38*43 c.c.per 100 c.c. of blood , or 70*9 per cent , of the total gas .
With animals in a state of hyperpncea , * this falls to an average of 20*56 c.c. per 100 c.c. of blood , or 58*7 per cent , of the total gas , the oxygen remaining practically the same .
In experiments with hirudinised blood in vitro the carbon dioxide is only 3*83 c.c. per 100 c.c. of blood , or 16*3 per cent , of the total gas .

In Table II the average oxygen-content per 100 grm. of blood in 14 experiments is 14*22 c.c. In the various experiments the values vary considerably , from 10 c.c. to 17 c.c. , and the percentage saturation of haemoglobin is also variable , the average being 83 to 84 per cent. In the cats in a state of hyperpncea the average is 13*5 not very different from many of the values found in quiet respiration .
It would appear from our experiments that the state of hyperpneea affects the carbon dioxide output rather than the oxygen intake .
From the experiments we have already published , it is clear that it takes a considerable time for blood in vitro to become saturated with oxygen at 38 ' C. , when exposed to air .
From these experiments it is a fair conclusion that during its passage through the pulmonary capillaries the blood is rarely fully saturated with oxygen even when oxygen is inhaled .
For an explanation , it is probable * 'Journ .

; The first nine experiments were made some time ago , without the precautions we have insisted upon as being necessary in the use of the blood pump , and the nitrogen values are above the true value .
The last two experiments given in Table III Were carried out with all precautions , the pump washed out with oxygen , and rendered vacuous with liquid air , and it unit be seen that the nitrogen values are 1*07 and 0 96 per cent , of blood respectively ; figures exactly the same as those which we found for the nitrogen-content of cat 's blood.* The oxygen-content of venous blood is seen to vary from 2*63 c.c. to 10*8 c.c. per 100 c.c. of blood .
In Table IV we give the values of venous blood of cats breathing oxygen .
The oxygen figures vary from 3'5 c.c. to 13*49 c.c. per 100 c.c. of blood , and are of much the same order as during the respiration of air .
Conclusions .
The experiments detailed in this papei* would appear to justify the following conclusions:\#151 ; 1 .
The inhalation of oxygen does not materially augment the quantity of this gas in the blood .
2 .
The inhalation of oxygen apparently does not alter the average carbon dioxide content of the blood .
We are carrying out further experiments on the inhalation of oxygen , with a view to testing the validity of the above conclusions .
We take this opportunity of thanking the Committee of the Government Grant of the Royal Society for assistance in partly defraying the expenses connected with this work .
