] On a supposed Alteration of Aberration of Light Sc.35 son 's cups .
The personal equation , under the circumstances of the observations , was found as follows:\#151 ; A gun was fired at such a distance from the Observatory as to be heard with about the same degree of distinctness as the time-gun at the Castle .
This distance was found to be 1483 feet .
The registrations on the chronograph were made by Mr. Kirby at the distance of 162 feet from the gun , and Mr. Mann at the Observatory .
For this comparatively small distance , the time of transit calculated from the velocity deduced from the time taken to travel over the larger distance may be deemed exact .
The observed time for the smaller difference of distance was found to be too great by 0S,09 , which correction has been applied to all the observations .
It depends more on want of sensibility in picking up and recognizing faint sounds than upon mere habit of making contacts .
When the observers were interchanged , the observed interval of time appeared still too large , but in this case by 0S02 .
It is clear that such personal equations are not eliminated by an interchange of observers , nor by return signals .
In the reduction of the equations , the coefficient of elasticity of air under a constant volume ( that is to say , the ratio of the increment of pressure for an increment 1 ' F. of temperature to the pressure at 32 ' F. ) was regarded as an unknown quantity as well as V , the velocity of sound at 32 ' F. The reduction of the equations furnished by the observations , which were 38 in number , gave Y=1090,6 feet per second , a=0-0019 , Regnault 's value of a being 0'0020 .
There appeared to be but little difference between the residual errors as dependent on the motion of the air .
The author grouped the residuals into two classes , according to the dampness of the air ; but there appeared to be no appreciable difference in the velocity as dependent upon dampness .

" On a supposed alteration in the amount of Astronomical Aberration of Light , produced by the passage of the Light through a considerable thickness of Refracting Medium/ ' By George Biddell Airy , C.B. , Astronomer Royal .
Received November 17 , 1871 .
A discussion has taken place on the Continent , conducted partly in the * Astronomische Nachrichten , ' partly in independent pamphlets , on the change of direction which a ray of light will receive ( as inferred from the Undulatory Theory of Light ) when it traverses a refracting medium which has a motion of translation .
The subject to which attention is particularly called is the effect that will be produced on the apparent amount of that 36 The Astronomer Royal on a Alteration [ Nov. 23,1 angular displacement of a star or planet which is caused by the Earth 's 1 motion of translation , and is known as the Aberration of Light .
It has been 1 conceived that there may be a difference in the amounts of this displace-1 ment , as seen with different telescopes , depending on the difference in the J thicknesses of their object-glasses .
The most important of the papers containing this discussion are :\#151 ; that of Professor Klinkerfues , contained in a pamphlet published at Leipzig in 1867 , August ; and those of M. Hoek , one published 1867 , October , in No. 1669 of the * Astronoinische Nach-richten , ' and the other published in 1869 in a communication to the Netherlands Royal Academy of Sciences .
Professor Klinkerfues maintained that , as a necessary result of the Undulatory Theory , the amount of Aberration would be increased , in accordance with a formula which he has given ; and he supported it by the following experiment:\#151 ; In the telescope of a transit-instrument , whose focal length was about 18 inches , was inserted a column of water 8 inches in length , carried in a tube whose ends were closed with glass plates ; and with this instrument he observed the transit of the Sun , and the transits of certain stars whose north-polar distances were nearly the same as that of the Sun , and which passed the meridian nearly at midnight .
In these relative positions , the difference between the Apparent Right Ascension of the Sun and those of the stars is affected by double the coefficient of Aberration ; and the merely astronomical circumstances are extremely favourable for the accurate testing of the theory .
Professor Klinkerfues had computed that the effect of the 8-inch column of water and of a prism in the interior of the telescope would be to increase the coefficient of Aberration by eight seconds of arc .
The observation appeared to show that the Aberration was really increased by 7 " ' 1 .
It does not appear that this observation was repeated .
A result of physical character so important , and resting on the respectable authority of Professor Klinkerfues , merited and indeed required further examination .
Having carefully considered the astronomical means which would be most accurately employed for the experiment , I decided on adopting a vertical telescope , the subject of observation being the meridional zenith distance of y Draconis , the same star by which the existence and laws of Aberration were first established .
The position of this star is at present somewhat more favourable than it was in the time of Bradley , its mean zenith-distance north at the Royal Observatory being about 100 , f and still slowly diminishing .
With the sanction of the Government , therefore , I planned an instrument , of which the essential part is , that the whole tube , from the lower surface of the object-glass to a plane glass closing the lower end of the tube , is filled with water , the length of the column of water being 35'3 inches .
The curvatures of the surfaces of the two lenses constituting the object-glass , adapted , in conjunction with the water , to correct spherical and chromatic aberration , were investigated by myself and verified by my friend Mr. Stone ( now Astronomer at the Cape Observatory ) .
The 187 ] .

micrometer is constructed on a plan arranged by myself , by which the double observation in reversed positions of the instrument can be made with great ease .
The reference to the vertical is given by two spirit-levels , both to be read at every single observation .
The work of construction was entrusted to Mr. James Simms , who carried it out with great ability .
Distilled water was supplied by H. W. Chisholm , Esq. , Warden of Standards .
Had the result of the observations been confined to the determination of an astronomical constant , or the variation of its value for different telescopes , I should not have thought it worthy of communication to the Royal Society .
But it is really a result of great physical importance , not only affecting the computation of the velocity of light , but also influencing the whole treatment of the Undujatory Theory of Light .
In this view I have thought that an informal statement of the conclusions may be acceptable to the Society , reserving for publication in one of the annual Greenwich Volumes the details of the observations .
The instrument was mounted in a small Occasional Observatory first constructed for the transit-instrument of Mr. Struve when he was engaged in determining the longitude of Altona , and now planted on the " South Ground " of the Observatory .
The seasons at which the meridional zenith-distance of y Draconis is most affected by aberration in opposite directions are the Equinoxes .
For understanding the following Table , it is to be remarked that an apparent value of the Geographical Latitude of the Instrument is formed from every observation , by subtracting the Observed Instrumental Zenith-distance North of the Star from the Tabular Declination of the Star given in the 'Nautical Almanac .
' The observed zenith-distance is affected with the True Aberration as seen in the instrument , the tabular declination is affected with the Received Aberration used in the computation of the * Nautical Almanac , ' and the apparent value of the geographical latitude is therefore affected by the difference between the True Aberration as seen in the instrument and the Received Aberration .
If , therefore , under all circumstances , and especially in the comparison of days when the sign of aberration has changed , the apparent value of the geographical latitude is sensibly constant , it proves that the True Aberration is the same as the Received Aberration , or at least that one is not a multiple of the other .
The last column of the Table is given only to show to how large an extent Aberration enters into the star 's Apparent Declination .
Every result for Observed Zenith-distance in the Table is the mean of observations in reversed positions of the instrument .

f 01 J Remarking that the mean results for Geographical Latitude of the Instrument ( determined from observations made when the Aberration of the star had respectively its largest + value and its largest \#151 ; value ) agree within a fraction of a second , I think myself justified in concluding that the hypothesis of Professor Klinkerfues is untenable .
Had it been retained , the Aberrations to be employed in the corrections would have been increased by+15 " and\#151 ; 15 " respectively , and the two mean results would have disagreed by 30 " .
The latitude of the instrument from these observationsisabout 51 ' 28'34"-0 .
The position of the instrument , as measured on the Observatory Map , is 340 feet south of the Transit-circle , a spatial distance corresponding to about 3"*35 .
The latitude of the Transit-circle being taken at 51 ' 28 ' 38"'4 , the geodetic latitude of the instrument is 51 ' 28 ' 35"'05 , an agreement closer than I expected , consideration being given to the form of the ground .
It appears very probable that at the place of the Transitif 1871 .

39 I circle , on the north brow of the hill , the zenithal direction is disturbed to-1 wards the north and the astronomical latitude is too great .
There is only one point in this investigation upon which a doubt can be I suggested as possible , namely the evaluation of the micrometer-scale .
It I was thus conducted:\#151 ; The micrometer-plate contains 26 wires , and the fixed part of the instrument contains 25 crosses , each interval being nearly 256 " .
With this arrangement every wire-interval is measured with great ease , and the whole series of 25 intervals is accurately obtained in terms of the micrometer .
By placing the instrument in a proper position , the same intervals are obtained in time of the star 's transit , which is easily converted into arc .
The comparison of these gives the value of micrometer-divisions which has been employed .
The following verification , of somewhat inferior accuracy , has been made by measures of the instrument .
It appears that the ray of light passes through 0 9 inch of glass , 35*3 inches of water , and 0*8 inch of air , nearly ( the measure of the last being slightly uncertain ) .
Remarking that the dividing surfaces are horizontal and plane , it is easily seen that the micrometer-scale ought to be such as is due to an air-telescope whose length in inches = + -fUj + 0*8 \#151 ; 27*8 inches .
And from this , with observation of transit of the star , it was found that the measure of 25 intervals of wires ought to be 0'8693 inch : as measured with a pair of compasses , it was found sometimes 0'871 , sometimes 0'8/ 5 .
The agreement is fully as close as can be expected from the rudeness of the operation , and shows distinctly that there can be no error of principle in the method of evaluing the micrometer-scale .

( Abstract .
) This paper contains the results of a series of magnetic observations taken in the east of France during the months of August and September 1869 , and is a continuation of the paper on the survey of the west of France , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1870 , p. 33 .
No change was made in the observers , nor in the methods of observation , during the two surveys ; and the only alteration in the instruments was the substitution in 1869 of a Jones theodolite in lieu of the small altazimuth by Cook used in 1868 .
Observations were made at twenty-one stations in the following order:\#151 ; Paris , Rheims , Metz , Strasbourg , Issenheim , Dole , Mont Rolland , Dijon , Lyons , Avignon , Marseilles , Monaco , Montpellier , Grenoble , N. D. de
