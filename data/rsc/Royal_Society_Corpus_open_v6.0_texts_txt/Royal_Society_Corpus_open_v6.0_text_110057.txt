] The object of this communication is to prove that the free acid usually existing in the stomachs of animals is the muriatic acid , and that the salts present are alkaline muriates .
The contents of a rabbit 's stomach were digested in distilled water , and the clear portion of liquid thus obtained divided into four parts .
The first was evaporated to dryness , and the quantity of muriatic acid present in the residuary fixed salts determined by nitrate of silver ; the second was supersaturated with potash , evaporated and decomposed by nitrate of silver as before , by which the total quantity of muriatic acid in the fluid was ascertained ; the third was neutralized by a solution of potash of known strength , and the required quantity accurately noticed .
This gave the proportion of free acid present ; and by adding this to that in union with a fixed alkali , as above determined , and subtracting the sum from the total quantity of muriatic acid present , the proportion of acid in union with ammonia was estimated .
' But as a check to this result , the third neutralized portion was evaporated to dryness , and the muriate of ammonia expelled by heat ; the quantity of muriatic acid left in union with the fixed alkali was then determined as before ; and by subtracting this from the total quantity , the quantity in union with ammonia was determined .
From such experiments the author concludes , that no inconsiderable quantity of unsaturated muriatic acid exists in the stomachs of animals during digestion ; and from the examination of the fluid ejected from the human stomach in a case of dyspepsia , he infers that there also the muriatic acid performs the same office .
