i. On the elasticforce of vapours , with new formula to determine it at any temperature ; and a review of those given by DALTON and BIOT .
THE phenomena attending the conversion of liquids into elastic fluids , were first accurately investigated by Dr. BLACK .
He observed in the rising of vapour , and melting of ice , a beautiful system of relations , connecting and modifying the grandest operations of nature , while they were destined to afford new principles for the advancement of the arts .
If it be the prerogative and characteristic of genius , to discover in the most familiar , or , as some would say , vulgar phenomena , that mystic chain of causation , which had eluded all other eyes , unquestionably , the doctrines of latent heat entitle their author to rank in the first class of philosophers .
Dr. BLACK directed his attention principally to the establishment of the general laws , which he placed on an immovable basis ; leaving to his pupils , the subordinate task of investigating their individual applications .
Hience , the elastic forces of the vapours , arising from different bodies , at different temperatures , seem to have occupied him very little , if at all .
This subject was examined , however , with great ability , ,by two of his most distinguished friendss Professor RoBrsoc and Mr. VWATT .
The investgations of the former were published in the Encyclopaedia Britannlica , article steam ; while we have still to regret our ignorance of those executed by the latter philosopher , with probably a more complete apparatus , and more extensive views .
We are indebted to him , indeed , for some curious observation on the latent heat of steam , at different temperatures , which make us lament more , the want of those on the elastic forces themselves , Mr. DALTON , whose peculiar speculatis on caloric nd meteorology led him to study the formation and variable elasticity of vapour with great attention , has since then favoured the world with many excellent dissertations , and is now reckoned the first authority on the subject .
Mr. DALTON'S experiments on the steam of water were carried no higher than its ordinary boiling point ; but from the observed progression of its elastic force le investigated a formula , ad calculated from it a table for the higher temperatures.* In the second number of the Journal Polytechnique , M BETANCOURT , an eminent Spanish engineer , long resident at Paris , published a set of experiments on the same subject , the results of which differ from those of Mr. DALTON in many particulars , but most remarkably in the higher part of the scale .
Having had my mind often called to this impportant inquiry in the course of my public lectures on the applications of Science to the Arts , an apparatus of a very simple nature occurred t me , about two years ago , by which I hoped to be able to determine , with great precision , the elastic forces of vapours at any temperature , from zero of FAHRENHEIT , to a much higher degree of heat than even BETANCOURT seems to have reached .
The experiments were made soon after that time , but circumstances have till now prevented me from arranging them for publication .
With BETANCOURT'S apparatus I am not acquainted , having seen only the brief table of results , inserted in our systematical works on chemistry .
Professor ROBIsoN 's consisted of a strong boiler or digester , containing the water , and furnished with three small apertures ; the first receiving the bulb of a thermometer , the second covered with a safety valve , and the third having a barometer tube attached .
At first I used a similar construction , but finding it hazardous , and somewhat unmanageable in the high heats , and difficult to render air tight in the lower temperatures , I abandoned it , after some unsatisfactory trials .
At the low degrees of heat , the vacant part of the barometer tube introduces errors , since it has not the temperature of the boiler ; and the bulb of the barometer , used in high heats , occasions a similar fallacy in the determination of the true elasticities .
Still , however , it was ingeniously conceived , and the results furnish good approximations , creditable to the celebrated experimenter.* They agree nearly with those of BETANCOURT , being obtained probably in a similar way .
The method adopted by Mr. DALTON , is recommended by an elegant simplicity .
It is merely a common barometer , into which a little of the vapour-giving liquid is introduced , so as to oisten , and float above the mercury .
The vapour which is generated , depresses more or less the barometric column .
Hence , by subjecting the liquid to successive degrees of temperature , the corresponding depressions of the barometer , or elasticities of the vapour , are obtained .
The only difficulty in this mode of operating , is to bring a considerable length of vertical tube to an uniform temperature .
Mr. DALTON , well aware of this source of error , obviated it in a great measure , by taking a series of different tubes , decreasing in their lengths with the increasing expansions of the vapour , and concomitant descent of the mercurial column , In several experiments conducted on this plan , I found it scarcely possible to obtain results rigidly corresponding with each other , when the column of vapour , exposed in the barometer tube to the influence of surrounding heat , exceeded two inches in length .
M. BIOT , in his system of physics recently published , while he adopts Mr. DALTON'S results as the basis of his reasoning , treats fully of this difficulty , and suggests an ingenious means of avoiding it .
" We have had occasion several times to " remark , " says he , " that the temperature of a mass of liquid " ' which cools in the air , is not entirely the same at the bottom , " as it is at the top of the vessel ; because the colder particles " ' subside into the lower strata , by the excess of their weight .
" Thus the temperature of the column of hot water , which ?
( surrounds the tube in the preceding experiment , cannot " ?
be rigorously uniform throughout its whole height .
We e " may endeavour to render it equal , by agitating and mingling , " the different strata of which it is composed ; but this would 34t { be attended with no little difficulty .
It would be better to " have several thermometers suspended at different heights , in the body of the water , and .
to take the arithmetical mean oftheir indications .
Or otherwise , which would probably " be more exact , we might employ a thermometer having a " cylindrical bulb , equal in length to the column of vapour .
" &lt; It would then be necessary that the column of water should rise sufficiently above this vapour to allow the thermometer bulb to be equally immersed , or we must make on , its indications the small correction mentioned p. 59 , in " order to reduce the temperature of the cylinder of mercury , to the temperature of the reservoir .
The employment of such a thermometer may appear at first sight sufficiently " difficult , since it seems that the length of the cylindrical reservoir must be very considerable , if the elastic force of the vapour be great.* " He then proceeds to show how this difficulty may be obviated ( as indeed it had previously been by Mr. DALTON ) , by taking barometer tubes successively shortened , as the force of the steam is augmented by heat .
He proposes to use four , between the freezing and boiling points of water , each being two decimeters , or nearly 8 inches long , and the thermometer bulb having also that length .
The plan which I imagined , asit completely obviates the source of errors arising from the large and variable space occupied by the vapour , supersedes the necessity of employing M. BOTr 's singular remedy .
It likewise avoids other complications , introduced by the heating and consequent elongation of the mercurial column itself attending all the other methods ; and scarcely capable of being exactly appreciated at high temperatures with the apparatus of Professor BOBISON .
The space over which the vapour extends in my instrument , need never be greater than half an inch of a barometer tube , against the side of which part the oblong bulb of a delicate thermometer rests , so as to indicate the true temperature .
And though the liquid and incumbent vapour are thus always restricted to the summit of the barometer tube , we can , notwithstanding , measure its progressive range of elasticity , from zero of FAHRENHEIT to one hundred , or even two hundred , degrees above the boiling point of water , from an elasticity of 0.07 of an inch , to that capable of sustaing 14 feet , or even 36 of mercury .
Fig. t ( P1 .
XIX .
) represents the construction employed for temperatures under and a little above the boiling point .
Fig. X and 3 are used for higher temperatures ; the last is the more convenient of the two .
Each was suspended from a lofty window ceiling , and placed in a truly vertical position by means of a plumb line .
One simple principle pervades the whole train of experiments ; which is , that the progressive increase of elastic force developed by heat from the liquid , incumbent on the mercury at I Pl I " , is measured by the length of column which must be added over L , the primitive level below , in order to restore the quicksilver to its primitive level above , at I. These two , stations , or points of departure , are nicely defined by a ring of fine platina wire twisted firmly around the tube .
At the commencement of the experiment , after the liquid well freed from air has been let up , the quicksilver is made a tangent to the edge of the upper ring , by cautiously pouring a343 mercury in a slender stream into the open leg of the syphon D. The level ring below is then carefully adjusted .
From the mode of conducting my experiments , there remained always a quantity of liquid in contact with the vapour , a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research .
Suppose the temperature of the water or the oil in A to be 8g ?
F. , as denoted by a delicate thermometer , or by the liquefaction of ice ; communicate heat to the cylinder A , by means of two argand flames , playing gently on its shoulder at each side .
When the thermometer indicates 42 ?
, modify the flames or remove them , so as to maintain an uniform temperature for a few minutes .
A film or line of light will now be perceived between the mercury and the ring at , as is seen under the vernier of a mountain barometer when it is raised a few feet off the ground .
Were the tube at I and L of equal area , or were the relation of the areas experimentally determined , then the rise of the quicksilver above L would be one half , or a known submultiple of the total depression , equivalent to the additional elasticity of the vapour at 40 ?
above that at 32 ? .
Since the depressions , however , for o3 or 4o degrees in this part of the scale are exceedingly small , one half of the quantity can scarcely be ascertained with suitable precision , even after taking the above precautions .
And besides , the other sources of error , or at least embarrassment , from the inequalities of the tube , and from the lengthening space occupied by the vapour , as the temperature ascends , render this method of reduction very ineligible .
By the other plan we avoid all these evils .
For whatever additional elasticity we communicate to the vapour above / , it will be faithfully represented and measured , by the 344 mercurial column which we must add over L , in order to overcome it , and restore the quicksilver under I to its zero or initial level , when the platina ring becomes once more a tangent to the mercury.* At Ea piece of cork is fixed , between the parallel legs of the syphon , to sustain it , and to serve as a point by which the whole is steadily suspended .
For temperatures above the boiling point , the part of the syphon under E is evidently superfluous , merely containing in its two legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury .
Accordingly for high heats , the apparatus fig. 9 , or 3 , is employed , and the same method of procedure is adopted .
The aperture at 0 , fig. 3 , admits the bulb of the thermometer , which rests as usual on P " .
The recurved part of the tube is filled with mercury , and then a little liquid is passed through it to the sealed end .
Heat is now applied by an argand flame to the bottom of C , which is filled with oil or water , and the temperature is kept steadily at 212 ?
for some minutes .
Then a few drops of quicksilver may require to be added to D " till L " and I " be in the same horizontal plane .
The farther conduct of the experiment differs in no respect from what has been already described .
The liquid in C is progressively heated , and at each stage mercury is progressively added over L " to restore the initial level , or volume at I " , by equipoising the progressive elasticity .
The column above L " being measured , represents the succession ofelastic forces .
When this column is wished to extend very high , the vertical tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a long wooden prism .
The height of the cu , tnn in some of my experiments being nearly i2 feet , it became necessayry to employ a ladder to reach its top .
I found it to be convenient in this case , after observing that the column of vapour had attained its primitive magnitude , to note down the temperature with the altitude of IhecoluIn ; then immediately to pourin a measured quantity of mercury nearly equal to three vertical inches , and to wait till the slow progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equilibrio with this new pressure , which at first had pushed the mercury within the platina ring at I " .
When the lower surface of the mercury was again a tangent to this ring , the temperature and altitude were both instantly observed .
This mode of conducting the process will account for the experimental temperatures being very often odd and fractional numbers .
I present them to the public as they were recorded on the instant in that particular repetition of the experiment which I consider most entitled to confidence .
To trim and fashion the results into an orderly looking series , would have been an easy task ; but in my opinion this is a species of deception very injurious to the cause of science , and a deviation from the rigid truth of observation , which ought never to be made for any hypothesis .
We shall afterwards have ample opportunities of exposing the fallacy of such premature geometrical refinements .
The thermometers were constructed by CREIGHTON , with his well known nicety , and the divisions were read off with a lens , so that ~-O of a degree could be distinguished .
After bestowing the utmost pains in repeating the experiments during a period of nearly two months , I found that the only way of removing the little discrepancies , which crept in 34 6 between contiguous measures , was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations and deducing truth from the mean .
It is essential to heat with extreme slowness and circumspection , the vessels , A , B , C. One repetition of the experiment occupies on an average 7 hours .

--r The apparatus employed the peculiar advantage over column is never heated .
It chemical philosophers , that in obtaining these results , has all others , that the mercurial is the concurrent opinion of all caloric travels downwards in liquids with extreme slowness and difficulty .
Indeed , Count RUMFORD 's experiments led him to infer that heat could not descend in fluids at all .
It is evident that in my constructions , figures i , 2 , and 3 , only that small portion of quicksilver , within the vessels A , B , and C , will be affected by the heat , but the measuring column is beyond the reach of its influence .
A surprising accordance will be perceived between my numbers , and those given by Mr. DALTON between S ?
" and le ?
, though mine were obtained with a different modification of apparatus .
Above the boiling point , where the table of Mr. DALTON is deduced from calculation , the accordance soon ceases .
But as my apparatus and mode of using it were precisely the same as in the former part of the range , my results , if entitled to confidence in the one case , must be so in the other .
At 28o ?
BETANCOURT'S number and mine are not much different , the former being lo5 inches , the latter o12 .
Being perfectly convinced , by repeating the experiments in different circumstances , that Mr. DALTON'S ratio of progression , though apparently accommodated to the intervals between 3 ?
and sl ?
, could not serve for the higher ranges , * I endeavoured to discover a simple rule of more general application .
It is above 2 i ?
, indeed , that for the purposes of art , the knowledge of the force of steam is required .
I first tried the differential method , so useful for determining the distant links of a concatenated series .
Without doing much violence to the above numbers , the forces corresponding to ooo ?
, 1200 , o1300 , i4o ?
, and 15oo , may be written in a series of which the 5th order of differences = o. Then if d ' d " d ' " div die , represent the first terms , in the first , second , third , fourth , and fifth order of differences , the ntb term of the series is aI +i~d ' ... .

Dissatisfied , therefore , with this approximation , I prosecuted the inquiry , and had the happiness to discover a very simple and beautiful ratio , which will actually apply through an extensive scale of temperature , and is incomparably easier in practice than the preceding rule .
The elastic force at 2.12=so inches being divided by 1.n8 , will give the force for o1 ?
below ; this quotient divided by 1.24 , will give that for o10 lower ; and so on progressively .
To obtain the forces above 2a1 ?
, we have merely to multiply 30 by the ratio , 1.23 for the force at 222 ?
; this product by 1.22 for that at 232 ?
, and thus for each successive interval of io ?
above the boiling point .
Thus so x 1.83 = F222z .
30 x 12S x 1.22 = F232* , using F to denote the force at any temperature n , according to the notation of LAPLACE .
By departing from the point of 210o F. , we shall obtain results equally accurate , but more convenient for comparison with the experimental table .
The following numbers exhibit the correspondence of this ratio with actual observation , TABLE II Observed elasticity of aqueous vapour compared with the ratios .

h x. ttrV The rule on which the preceding table is formed , may be expressed in a manner better fitted to give directly the elastic force corresponding to any given temperature moderately distant from x212 .
It becomes also more accurate .
Let r=the mean ratio between 2 10o and the given temperature ; n the number of terms ( each of to ?
) distant from aoo ?
; F =the elastic force of steam in inches of mercury .
Then , Log. of F= Log. 28.9 + n. Log. r ; the positive sign being used above , the negative below i o ? .
Or by common arithmetic , multiply or divide 28.9 , according as the temperature is above or below io ?
, by the mean ratio , involved to a power denoted by the number of terms .
The product or quotient is the tension required .

The temperature is 140o .
What is the corresponding elasticity of the vapour from water heated to that point ? ?
140o is 7 terms of 1o ?

; 1.26 is the mean ratio = I-23 +.29 .
and , consequently , r =.26 ; n= 7 .
Log. 28.9 = 1.46ogo Log. i.26 x7= 0.10037 x7 =-0.7059 o.75831 , which is the logarithm of 5732 inches .

About half a degree of FAHRENHEIT misnoted , would give this deviation .
Such a correspondence , therefore , of observation with the calculated results , shows that we have found a rule of perfect accuracy for all purposes of engineering , &amp;c. If I am asked whether this formula coincides at every link with the chain of nature , I freely acknowledge , that I do not imagine it strictly so to do .
But still it affords approximations such , that within moderate limits , I cannot tell whether to place more confidence in them , or in those found by experiment .
It has moreover the rare advantage of being extremely simple , and level to the capacity of all practical men .
In BIOT 's excellent work above quoted , where many of the hitherto vague disquisitions of physical science have been happily brought within the pale of geometry , this celebrated philosopher has deduced , from Mr. DALTON 's experiments on the force of steam , a general formula for determining its elasticity at any temperature .
In investigating this formula , he represents the decrease of the logarithms of the elastic forces by a series of terms of the form an + bn2 + cn3 ; abc being constant coefficients .
Thus , Log. F= Log. 3o 4an b6n2 + cn3 It is unnecessary to employ powers of n higher than the cube , because their coefficients would be insensible , as the calculation will show .
To determine the coefficients ab c , he makes use of the elastic forces , observed at the temperatures on the centigrade scale of 1oo0 , 750 , 5 ?
, and 25 ?
; whence result these conditions , 353 n-o F So.ooinches n -= 5 Fz5 3 11.e5 X= 50 Fso =.50 n 75 F75= 0.910 Substituting these conditions in the above general formula , and bearing in mind that the logarithm of a fraction is equal to the logarithm of the numerator minus the logarithm of the denominator , we have the three following equations of conditions .
-o 4259687 85 .
a+ 625 b +15625 c. 0.9330519 = 50 .
a+ 2500 b+ 125000 c. 1.5180799 = 75 .
a+ 5695 b+ 421875 c. Doubling the first , and subtracting it from the second , a disappears ; trebling it , and subtracting it from the third , a also disappears .
Then dividing each of the resulting equations by the coefficient of b , we have 0.0ooo6489160 =b + 75 c. 0.00006404635b 1oo c. Subtracting the one of these from the other , b will disappear ; and dividing it by the coefficient of c , we shall have c. Next , by substituting the value of c in one of these equations , we get b. Lastly , putting b and c in one of the two first equations , we have a. Thus we find a= o.o0537419550 b0 ooo0006742735 c =+ o.ooooooo0038 Whence the whole formula Log. Fn =Log .
3o + an ' + bn2 + cn3 is completely determined , and may serve for calculating F , , relative to any proposed value of n. 054 If we make , for example , n= ioo , we shall have the elastic force at ioo degrees below the boiling point , or at the tem-perature of melting ice .
We thus obtain Log.* Fn = 1.4771213 2.1778831 =o.7007618 .
Or employing negative indices in order to make use of the ordinary logarithmic tables , Log. F =1 i. 2992382 , whence F. = o. 19917 inches ; and observation gives us o. 200 .
The error is obviously insensible ; and we may adopt , says M. BIOT , our formula as representing the experiments of Mr. DALTON .
To introduce the FAHRENHEIT degrees into the formula , calling themf , and counting from a21 ' , we have =f = n ; and substituting this value of n in the preceding formula , we obtain a= o. 00854121972 b o. oooo020810o c 4 .

From this ample investigation , we may legitimately conclude , that we ought to receive such geometrical representations with great caution .
M. BIOT , indeed , with a candour becoming his genius , admits these formulae to be merely tentative approximations .
The high reputation of this philosopher , and the geometrical skill here displayed , might have led the scientific world to repose confidence in his formula , within the limits of 552 degrees centigrade 10oo FAHR. It was therefore entitled to a deliberate examination .
It is curious to observe that my very simple formula , Log. F= Log. 28.9 + n. Log. r , gives good approximations , through a much more extensive range , than the elaborate formula of the distinguished French geometer .
Even when carried so high as the gsoth degree of FAHR. , we have Log. 28.9 -n .

BIoT 's formula gives a result S1 inches , and Mr. DALTON'S 40 in defect .
Of Professor ROBISON"s higher numbers , it is merely necessary to examine the successive differences for every ieo above 212 ? .
These are 7.2 , 8.9 , lo.2 , 11.9 , 13.5 , 13.8 , 1.8 , and the second differences are -4 1.7 -+ t.3 4 1.7 + 1.6 + 0.3.0o .
Such striking irregularities cannot exist in the progression of nature .
BETANCOURT'S are liable to a similar censure .
We may find indeed small discrepancies in the best observations at such temperatures . ?

Experiments to determine the elastic forces of the vapours of alcohol , ether , oil of turpentine , and petroleum or naphtha .
The determination of the elasticities of these vapours is a very interesting problem in chemical philosophy .
It may possibly unfold the law which connects temperature and elastic energy , and it may furnish likewise some useful applications .
Mr. DALTON has examined the subject with considerable care , My experiments were performed with the apparatus above described , and were verified by frequent repetitions .
The following results were noted down during the progress of the experiments .

rIII Ii Remarks on the preceding table .
The ether of the shops as prepared by the eminent London apothecaries , boils generally at 11i ?
; but when washed with water , or re-distilled , it boils at io4 ?
or o15 ? .
It may by rectification , however , be made to boil at a still lower temperature .
Concerning the boiling point of oil of turpentine , curious ( may we say ridiculous ) discrepancies exist in our systems of chemistry .
Dr. MURRAY , for example , in the table of the scale of temperature at the end of the first volume of his valuable system , last edition , places the boiling point of oil of turpentine at 560 ? .
Mr. DALTON , vol. 1 .
p. p 9 .
of his new system of chemical philosophy , says " several authors have it that oil of turpentine boils at 560 ? .
I do not know how the mistake originated , but it boils below si ?
, like the rest of the essential oils .
" I made with much care several experiments on this point , previous to ascertaining the force of its vapour , and found its boiling point to be about 316 ? .
When recently distilled , however , it will boil at 805 ? .
Did it boil below , or even at 212 ?
, as Mr. DALTON asserts , then , long before the included portion in the above experiments had reached the 3o4th degree , it would have acquired such an elasticity as to support a high column of mercury , instead of being barely in equilibio with the atmospheric pressure .
Plunge a phial half filled with fresh oil of turpentine into a metal cup containing any fixed oil .
Heat the cup gradually .
It will be found that , at the temperature of 316 ?
, the oil remains in steady ebullition , as indicated by a thermometer suspended in the centre of the phial .
Prior to this , even at a36o some small bubbles will be evolved , principally owing to the moisture dispersed in the pores of the oil , from the water originally mixed with the crude turpentine in its distillation .
If the heat be very rapidly thrown in , while the upper surface of the oil of turpentine has the area only of a one or two ounce phial , it is possible to heat it to 360 ?
or g87o , in apparent contradiction to the theory of latent heat ; for when a liquid boils in an open vessel , according to Dr. BLACK , its temperature should remain stationary .
The true cause of this phenomenon is developed towards the conclusion of this memoir .
The specific caloric of the vapour of the volatile oil is so small , compared to that of water , that the heat may readily be quicker introduced than the boiling process can abstract it .
Concerning the boiling point of this oil , I have since inquired of a manufacturer ; and he states its boiling point at 32o ? .
Essential oil of rosemary , when kept for some time , boils at o70 ?
; recent oil at 212 ? .
To assign the cause of this difference , is foreign to our present object .
The vapour of ether follows nearly the same rate of expansion as water , if we start from their respective boiling points .
This was observed also in Mr. DALTON'S experiments ; and from this single analogy , chiefly , he laid down the general law , that the variation in the force of vapour from all liquids " is the same for the same variation of temperature , reckon " ing from vapour of any given force .
" My experiments on oil of turpentine and petroleum show the fallacy of this generalization , if we reckon the common thermometric scale a tolerably correct index of temperature ; but if , with Mr. DALTON , we consider our thermometric scale , 361 as very erroneous , then ether itself is an exception to its own law , to use this paradoxical , though just expression .
In consequence of his peculiar thermometric ideas , Mr. DALTON has abrogated the above law , which he had himself framed ; though it is curious to observe , in some respectable treatises on chemistry , both hypotheses detailed , without indicating their mutual incompatibility .
M. BIOT , likewise , far from imagining that the law had been repealed for 8 or 9 years , proposes to judge by its provisions of the total elastic force of every vapour at 1oo ?
centigrade , to serve as the basis of the determination of their respective specific gravities at that temperature.* My experiments show that from o15 ?
to 167 ?
.5 FAHRENHEIT , ether trebles the tension of its vapour , as water also does from 1ig ?
to 272*.7 ; both containing nearly , but by no means exactly , equal intervals of the FAHRENHEIT graduation .
According to Mr. DALTON'S corrected scale of temperature , we have , 2120 FAH .

Thus we see , that while the interval for trebling the tension of ethereal vapour is 57 ?
, that for aqueous vapour is only 440.4 ; quantities that are to each other nearly as ioo : 8o .
Hence , according to this eminent chemist , ether must take for * ?

I hope presently to be able to adduce satisfactory experimental evidence , that our thermometric indications are not at all so unequable as Mr. DALTON conceives .
Meanwhile , in examining closely the table of the vapour of ether , a beautiful analogy with that of water presented itself .
The series of ratios representing the progression of the latter being lowered a single step , will accurately fit the former .
At 30 inches of elasticity 1.23 was our initial number for aqueous vapour ; for ethereal , it becomes 1.22 ; increasing or diminishing by unity each .

} w Mr_ r~~~~~~~~~~..~ The numbers derived from calculation give a surprising accordance with those observed in the lower range .
In the upper range , the correspondence is as gopd as the delicacy of the experiments at such temperatures could permit us to , expect .
The experiments have been presented without modification .
I must o wn , that when first the above perfect coincidence appeared , it gave me no small pleasure , as it led me to suppose that I had discovered the hidden chain of nature .
In treating of the vapour of alcohol , Mr. DALTON considers it as irregular in the progress of its elastic force by heat , owing to its not being a homogeneous liquid .
He suspects ( that the elastic force in this case is a mixture of aqueousand alcoholic vapour .
" I cannot see the cogency of this argument ; for , if the separate bodies have a regular progression , the mixture ought not surely to be anomalous .
I believe , however , that if the experiments were made with due accuracy , alcohol would be found as methodical in the elastic march of its vapour as other bodies .
The following table will afford satisfactory proofs of the justness of these : views .
For absolute alcohol , the progression is probably as simple as that of the preceding vapours .
But for alcohol , sp. gr. o.8i , which though highly rectified , contains not a little water , we should expect it to result from a composition or modification of ratios .
After some search on this principle , I accordingly found it .
Starting from the boiling point 174 ' , pr for the convenience of comparison with the table , from the decade 170o , we move not by a unit , as before , but by a unit and a tenth ; or the initial ratio 1.e6 is affected at each step or term.of 0 o , with the number + o.o 01 , the signs being employed as in the preceding cases .

The whole of the preceding research is closely interwoven with a question of the first importance in chemical philosophy ; what are the relative portions of temperature denoted by the graduations of our thermometric scale ?
Mr. DALTON regards the progressive elasticities of aqueous and ethereal vapour as affording countenance , if not support , to his thermometric innovations .
He affirms , that if our instrument for measuring heat were accommodated to his doctrine , the quantity of expansionof its mercury is as the square of the temperature from its freezing point ; then " the force of " steam in contact with water increases accurately in geome"trical progression to equal increments of temperature , ' provided these increments are measured by a thermometer ; of water or mercury , the scales of which are divided by " the above mentioned law.'"* Were this position true , it would certainly bring a powerful analogy in aid of his theoretical views .
We are now furnished with dta to verify , or refute it .
The following tables show the correspondence between that principle and experiment .
In the table of aqueous vapour , the first column pre* New System , vol. i , p. 1x .
366 sents his geometrical progression of that vapour , co-ordinate with his equal intervals of real temperature contained in the second .
In the third , are the corresponding points of the common scale , as given by Mr. DALTON .
To these points the elastic forces , as determined by experiment , are placed opposite in the fourth column .
Table second , for vapour of ether , is similarly arranged ; the first three columns being Mr. DALTON'S ; the fourth , the faithful transcript of observation .
" The force of the vapour of sulphuric ether , " says Mr. DALTON , " in contact with liquid ether , is a geometrical pro " gression , having a less ratio than that of water .
" " Ether , " as manufactured in the large way , appears to be a very ' homogeneous liquid .
I have purchased it in London , Edin"burgh , Glasgow , and Manchester , at different times , of ( precisely the same quality in respect to its vapour."* This shows that no exception can be made to my experiments on account of a supposed difference in the quality of the ether .
From the mode of conducting my experiments , there remained always a quantity of liquid ether in contact with the vapour , a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research .
The results were verified by frequent repetitions , and discover , in my opinion , the consistency of truth .

The numbers of the first and fourth column ought evidently to agree , if the theory be just .
Their differences , on the contrary , are prodigiously great .
At 272 ?
of his scale , for example , equal to 296 ?
.2 of ours , the law of progression makes the elastic force of aqueous vapour amount to 158 inches : experiment gives 13 1.7 ; and I am confident , that the latter cannot be in error above an inch or two .
Again at 262 ?
, equivalent to 281 ?
.2 FAHRENHEIT , his theory gives the force of the same vapour at 120 inches ; by observation it is only 103.5 .
Now at this part of the scale , my result is confirmed by the concurrence of those obtained by BETANCOURT and RoBISON .
I consider this demonstration complete .
If we compare these very elasticities of Mr. DALTON , with the table formerly given by the same philosopher , * we shall find Manchester Memoirs , vol. 5 368 discordances which no ingenuity can harmonize .
At that time , 225 ?
of FAHR. = 229 ?
of the new scale , gave a force of vapour equal to 38.3 ; it is now 39.5 .
S52.6 F. = 24 ?
2 D. then coincided with an elasticity of 58.6 inches ; above , it is 69 .
And finally , 281 ?
.2 F. -= 62 ?
D. were opposite to go inches ; they have become here 20o .
And yet no new experiments on the vapour of water have been adduced , to justify such immense alterations .
It may be said , indeed , that these changes arise merely from the substitution of one hypothesis for another ; but the deviations from experiment are even more remarkable , since as 282 ?
new scale , correspond to 3110.5 FAHR. , the difference amounts to 43 inches , being more than one fourth of the total elastic force generated at that high temperature .
When we turn our attention to ether , we find the discrepancies , if possible , less easy to reconcile .
At the temperature of 212 ?
, for example , where the old and new scales meet for the last time , the force of its vapour by the geometrical progression exceeds that found from experiment , by the enormous quantity of 67 inches and a half ; amounting to two fifths of the whole elastic force evolved .
May we venture , then , to conclude , from these multiplied comparisons , that the progressions of elasticity in vapours , taught by Mr. DALTON , are geometrical fictions , intended to quadrate with his notions concerning temperature ; but not consonant with the laws or phenomena of nature ?
Within a moderate compass , indeed , it is not difficult to suit the ratio of elastic force and the thermometric graduation to each other ; but the prosecution of the enquiry into ranges more remote , detects the fallacy of such hypothetical adaptations .
My experiments on the vapours of water , alcohol and ether , seem to show , that the ratio of tension decreases in a certain progression as the temperature augments .
Were the ratios 1.e2 , 1.92 , 1.2 , &amp;c. , which are seen to apply so well to aqueous vapour for a considerable range above 212 ?
, to be adopted as representing the progressive march of nature , it would lead to the absurd conclusion , that at 40o above the boiling point , or 45s ?
F. , the farther influx of caloric would occasion a diminution of elasticity in the steam .
The truth however is , that at the g3sth degree , indications of a divergence begin to appear between the two lines of experiment and calculation , which had run for so long a space nearly parallel .
The curve representing the expansive force of steam , I consider to be logarithmic , in which the ratios , as ordinates , continually diminish , without ever vanishing , or coming to an equality .
The axis is an asymptote to the curve , as in the atmospherical logarithmic .
CHAPTER II .
On thermometric admeasurement , and the doctrine of capacity .
Before inquiring into the relative quantities of heat , contained in different vapours at the same tension , it will be proper to determine the primary and fundamental proposition concerning the measure of temperature .
It is singular , that not one experimental fact has been advanced , capable of settling this question , amid the contending opinions of chemical philosophers .
Mr. DALTON has , in particular , exerted all the resources of his genius and science to destroy our confidence in the thermometric scale ; our sole guide in the vast $7 ?
and intricate province of caloric .
While I hope to be able to fix this now indeterminate point , by a new train of investigations , and consequently to prove the entire fallacy of his doctrine of temperature , the key-stone of his system of heat , I do not mean to affirm the absolute uniformity of expansion in bodies , by equal increments of that power .
I think it indeed highly probable , that every species of matter , both solid and liquid , follows an increasing rate in its enlargement by caloric .
Each portion that enters into a body must weaken the antagonist force , cohesion ; and must therefore render more efficacious the operation of the next portion that is introduced .
Let iooo represent the cohesive attraction at the commencement ; then , after receiving one increment of caloric , it will become iooo = 999 .
Since the next unit of that divellent agent will have to combat only this diminished cohesive force , it will produce an effect greater than the first , in the proportion of loo to 999 ; and so on in continued progression .
That the increasing ratio is , however , greatly less than Mr. DALTON maintains , may , I think , be clearly demonstrated .
According to his table of equal increments of temperature , vol. i. p. 14 , New System , we have the following intervals , corresponding to the five successive intervals of 90g on our scale .
From 32 ?
to 129 ?
to 21s , to 302 ?
, to 392 ?
, to 480 .

, 900 , 9go , go9 .
True intervals by DALTON , 10o ?
.4 77 ?
.6 6.3 ?
9 550.7 50o ?
5 The relative inequality of these intervals is deduced from Mr. DALTON'S law , that " all pure homogeneous liquids , as water and mercury , expand from the point of their congela " ton , or greatest density , a quantity always as the square " of the temperature from that point .
" He regards the law as resulting from the constitution of liquids , and therefore not applicable to solid bodies .
This is indeed implied in its enunciation .
In p. 4 , after assigning reasons , he states , " that for all practical purposes we may adopt the notion of " the equable expansion of solids .
" Now I am prepared to prove , either , that the expansion of solids partakes of the above inequability of liquids , which nobody imagines , and for which no reason , even hypothetical , can be assigned ; or , which is the only alternative , that homogeneous solids , and mercury , proceed almost exactly , pari passu , in their rates of expansion by heat .
The experiments which justify this assertion were made by me about five years ago , and were then exhibited to many of my chemical friends , as also in my public lectures ; but a wish to render the series more complete , has induced me to withhold them from the public eye , till requisite leisure could be afforded for this purpose .
They were performed with a pyrometer of peculiar construction , in an oblong trough filled with melting ice : a strong bar of Swedish iron was placed , from which projected at right angles , four inflexible iron arms , attachable by powerful screws to any part of the bar .
The arms nearest the extremities of the bar , carried each a fine micrometer microscope , made by that admirable artist Mr. TROUGHTON .
The other two arms were incurvated downwards at their extremities , which supported a metallic or other rod .
This was fixed by two pinching screws at one end , but lay loose on a friction roller at the other .
The loose end bore an elevated index .
The curvature of these two arms was such as to allow their extremities , with the attached rod , to be plunged beneath the surface of oil or water , about an inch , contained in a copper trough .
This was placed parallel to the large trough , and a few inches distant from it .
The copper vessel was slowly and equably heated , by a series of argand lamps placed beneath .
One micrometer watched a point projecting from the arm that held the fixed extremity of the rod .
The oil was carefully agitated during the application of the heat ; and the bulbs of three thermometers , mutually comparable , were immersed into it at regular distances .
The micrometers were screened from the influence of the heat .
They rendered the 200O of an inch discernible , and even a smaller quantity , by an experienced eye .
A rod of pure Swedish iron , or of such pure copper as jewellers use for alloying gold , being adjusted to the apparatus , the point on the micrometer scale , that appeared a tangent to the small luminous aperture in the thin index plate of steel , was noted down , when the liquid in the trough was at 32 ? .
The value and truth of the micrometrical indications had been previously ascertained , by viewing through the microscopes a given surface or aperture , moved laterally , so as to make its image successively coincide with the different points of the interior notched scale ; Heat being now applied , the progressive march of the index across the field of view of the micrometer microscope was closely observed , and its position written down at intervals of 10o or go ?
of the FAHR. thermometer .
But as the pyrometrical details will appear in a separate memoir on the expansions of bodies , I shall state here merely what concerns the present subject .
873 If we denominate the absolute elongation of the heated metallic rod from 3to to l ?
$ ?
, io , then its elongation from i 2 ?
to 19O ; from 212o to 302 ; from 830 ?
to 392 ?
; from 3S9 ?
to 48e ?
, was in each successive interval of 9o F , as nearly as possible to also .
The slight irregularities , incident to all delicate experimental investigations , being often in opposite directions , in different repetitions of the same experiment ; or those which manifested themselves in the ascending or elongating range , were neutralized , so to speak , by others of an inverse nature , which appeared in the cooling retrocession .
Here , the movements of the liquid mercury and of the solid rod by heat proceeded , paripassu , through a very great extent of temperature .
Let us now recollect that these 5 increments , which on our thermometer are equivalent to 5x 9o ?
= 450 ?
; and which altogether produce five times the elongation that the first interval occasions , constitute , on Mr. DALTON'S scale , only 3 ?
50 .
If we call the first interval given by this philosopher 1.oo , then the four succeeding intervals contain a range of temperature on his scheme , of only two and a half times the first ; and therefore only two and a half times additional elongation should have been produced , instead of four times , as found by experiment .
" Since for all practical purposes uniform increments of bulk , or expansions of solids by heat , correspond to uniform increments of this power ; " then each of our old successive intervals of 9go may , for all practical purposes , be held to correspond to equal increments of temperature .
Mr. DALTON'S intervals from 3g ?
to 489 ?
FAHR. are as before given , 1o ?
O.4 , ; 77 ?
.6 ; 630.9 ; 55 ?
-7 ; 5o ?
05 = 350.1 .
Now , if we call the first quantity l.oo , it will produce on a O74 metallic rod a corresponding effect in expansion =.0o .
The next interval of Mr. DALTON9S scale ( equal always to go9 FAHR. ) can produce only 4 of the effect of the first , or as 75 to 100 .
The third , fourth , and fifth intervals will give the fractional expansions in reference to the first , of 4 , 6 , and about 4 , or merely a half .
No such diminution of effect was observed in the experiments ; from $39 ?
to 482 ?
F. , the rod elongated as much as from 3S ? ?
1220 , or double the quantity compatible with the DALTONIAN hypothesis .
Thus therefore we have a rigid , and I think unanswerable demonstration of the general correctness of the common scale of temperature , and of the extreme inaccuracy and inapplicability of Mr. DALTON'S geometrical substitute .
Should the preceding statement leave any doubt or obscurity concerning the legitimacy of the inference now drawn , I trust it will be entirely removed , when the details of the experiments are published , with drawings of the apparatus , in my treatise on pyrometry .
Yet though the mercury in the thermometer tube move , paripassu , with a metallic rod , deemed uniform in its expansion , it does not prove perfectly equal uniformity of expansion to belong to the mercury .
It will seem , no doubt , a paradoxical assertion , that of two bodies marching together , hand in hand , one of them may have an equable pace , while that of the other is regularly , but very slowly accelerated .
Yet I think the position just .
It proceeds from a circumstance in the thermometer sufficiently obvious , but which seems to have escaped our systematic writers , I do not rest the pro .
position on any imperfection of workmanship , or supposed irregularity in the expansions of the glass 375 Let us take a thermometer , the calibre of whose stem is perfectly uniform , and whose scale is exactly divided .
Let it have a range from zero to the 656th degree , at which mercury boils , by the accurate experiments of CREGIHTrN .
At 3o , let the mercury stand at the bottom of the ivory scale , where of course the graduations commence .
The bare part of the instrument is consequently the plunging limit , in most chemical researches on the temperature of liquids .
Immerse the bulb in common oil , or oil of vitriol heated to sis ?
; * part of the whole included mercury , will now ascend above that part of the stem plunged in the liquid .
The part actually exposed to the heat , and by whose expansion the column on the scale is supported , is only , f of the initial mass .
Augment the heat of the oil till the instrument indicate $9s ?
; we know that there remains now , under the immediate influence of the heat , f nearly of the original weight of mercury ; and finally , at 572 , only about rest in the immersed part of the stem and bulb .
r or ^ parts may be considered as no longer subjected to the power of caloric .
If the thermometer stem were recurved near the bulb , the mercury in the stem placed horizontally would be cold ; and this proposition would be almost exactly true .
Now , since the calibre and divisions are uniform , the capacity of the tube from the point marked l2i ?
, to that marked 39s ?
; and again from this , to that opposite to 57s ?
, is in each equal to its capacity from 32 ?
to 212 ? .
Hence these three equal capacities are filled by the expansions of the three unequal quantities of mercury 62 , 61 , 60 .
At the highest station , the column of quicksilver equal on the stem to 3x 18o0 , is sustained by the expansion of 6o parts ; at the middle point , 2x 180 ?
is supported by that of 61 ; and at 12 ?
there are 62 parts of mercury to sustain 18o ?
in the tube .
Or , to put it in another form , these three successive spaces on the scale are equal ; the first portion of mercury is protruded into it by the expansion of 69 parts in the bulb ; the second portion by the expansion of 61 ; and the third by that of 6o .
Therefore , if these three thernlometric intervals of 180 , each of which holds an equal measure of mercury , contain also equal increments of temperature , as denoted by the equal increments of a metallic rod ; then , these three equal effects are produced from the unequal quantities of mercury 62 , 61 , 60 .
This liquid , then , must have an increasing rate of expansion , the inverse of these numbers , for every 180 ?
of the scale , or - , - .
, 4i .
That is to say , 60 parts at 572 ?
do the same work by the same power of caloric , as 61 at 392O , and 6s at 212 ? .
I believe this to be the real nature of mercurial expansion , and the true condition of the thermometer ; which is an equable measurer of heat , because the mercury possesses the above increasing rate of expansion .
Were the mercury , on the contrary , absolutely uniform in its augmentations of volume by equal increments of heat , then for an instrument whose bulb alone in practice can be immersed , the three above ranges should have the corresponding parts of the scale shortened in the successive proportions of 62 to 63 ; 6i to 6s ; and 60 to 63 ; quantities taken together nearly equal to 9 ?
, or =3x Ei x 180 _ .
Whatever reception these speculations may experience , they must not be confounded with the experiments on the expansions of metallic rods , and the corollaries , which have a distinct and independent existence . ?
II .
On the doctrines of capacity , as connected with the preceding investigation .
Dr. CRAWFORD and DE Luc , tried to verify the justness of the thermometric indications , by mixing together water at 212 ?
and 32 ?
; when the former found 122 ?
, and the latter 119 ?
, to be the resulting temperature .
DE Luc 's number is 3 ?
below the mean ; Dr. CRAWFORD'S is exact .
This ingenious philosopher afterwards sought to confirm the evidence thus given to the accuracy of the scale , by other experiments , which were however of rather an equivocal import .
Both of the above results have been condemned and rejected by Mr. DALTON : he states the true mean temperature to be not la ?
1 , nor even 19 ?
, but 1 o0 .
For this deviation , the reasons which he assigns appear , independently of all arguments derived from other quarters , to be in themselves inconclusive .
He says , - " the temperature of the above mixture ought to be found above the mean 122 ? .
" " Water of these two tempe .
" ratures ( 382 and 12 " ?
) being mixed , loses about ' of its bulk .
This condensation of its volume* must expel a " quantity of heat , and raise the temperature above the mean .
" p. 7 .
Again , p. 50 , that water increases in its capacity for heat with the increase of temperature , Icon ?
" cider demonstrable from the following arguments .
ist .
A C measure of water at any one temperatt ; re mixed with a measure at any other temperature , the mixture is less tan " two measures .
Now , a condeation of volume is a cerain " ' mark of diminution of capacity and increase oftenperature , i as in the mixture of sulphuric acid and water ; or the efect " of mechanical pressure , as with elastic fluids .
Second , " ' when the same body suddenly changes its capacity by a change of form , it is always from a less to a greater as the " temperature ascends ; for instance , ice , water and vapour .
" Third , Dr. CRAWFORD acknowledges from his own ex " perience , that dilute sulphuric acid , and most other liquids " he tried , he found to increase in their capacity for heat with " the increase of temperature .
Admitting the force of these " arguments , it follows , that when water of 32 ' and 912 ?
are " ' mixed , and give a temperature denoted by.19 ?
of the " common thermometer , we must conclude that the true mean " temperature is somewhere below that degree .
I have already assigned the reason why I place the mean at io .
" Now the only reason I can elsewhere find , is derived from his general law , " 6 that all homogeneous liquids expand , as the square of the temperature , from the point of greatest density or congelation .
" In p. 7 , he ventures to assert nothing more than , ( that it is not improbable that the true mean tempe"rature between 32 ?
and 212 ?
, may be as low as 110o FAH " RENHEIT.o Satisfied from my pyrometrical experiments , that his general hypothesis of the expansion of liquids being as the * For the entire fallacy of this reasoning , see my Essay just quoted ; expansion of volume should by Mr. D. increase capacity and diminish temperature .
The very reverse is shown in that paper .
square of their temperature , is totally inapplicable to mercury , the inference relative to the thermometric mean between 3$o and e2 % ?
cannot be allowed .
But let us examine , on their own merits , the preceding arguments against Dr. CRAWFORD and DE Luc 's verification of the mean temperature between that of freezing and boiling water .
The reasoning derives its sole force from the assumption , that the capacity of water for heat , increases as its temperature is raised .
There is adduced , however , no fact in the least decisive on this main point .
What analogy is there between the entire change of form and constitution suffered by an incondensible liquid , on becoming an elastic vapour , and the progressive heating of the liquid itself ?
Or , although dilute sulphuric acid and other liquids should increase in their specific caloric on being heated , which however has not been satisfactorily demonstrated , are we to assert that water must do so too ?
It is a matter of surprise to me , that a philosopher of Mr. DALTON'S judgement and acuteness should have pressed such inconclusive analogies into his service .
He knew well that water is endowed with some curious peculiarities , when compared with other liquids , or anomalies , as we idly stile them ; for they constitute no anomaly in nature , but wisely fit water for performing the important functions assigned to it in the economy of our globe .
In a series of experiments , carefully conducted on the relative capacities for heat , of water , sulphuric acid , oil of turpentine , and spermaceti oil , published in my Essay on hydrochloric acid and the chlorides ; it seems to be directly demonstrated that the specific heat of water does not increase , but actually diminishes , and that very conspicuously , as its 380 temperature rises .
It is there proved , that from sio ?
to 150o FAHR. the specific heat of oil is to that of water as 697 to 1ooo ; and from 15oo to 90g as 513 to o0oo .
The same proportional difference of relation is exhibited by the other two liquids .
Now , were the phenomenon occasioned by the oil of vitriol , common oil , and oil of turpentine , increasing in their capacities for heat in a still more rapid ratio than water , we should undoubtedly expect , from the innate differences between the specific heats of these three substances , to find that they would move independently on each other , or at different rates .
But their uniform advance together , while water alone varies in this respect , shows distinctly , that in the water resides the cause of the variation .
This reasoning may be illustrated in many ways , but by nothing more clearly than the exploded astronomical system of the diurnal and annual movements of the sun and fixed stars ; in support of which , very extravagant hypotheses had to be contrived .
The single fact of the motion of the earth once admitted , reduced the PTOLEMAIC chaos to order .
If , in like manner , we should suppose an increasing ratio in the specific heat of water , then we must also suppose a much more rapid increase in the ratios of the above three substances , although their individual specific heats are greatly inferior to that of water .
Ought not that body , which has of all others the most decided relation to heat , or highest specific heat , to have also its ratio most decidedly or rapidly augmented ?
In adopting the increasing specific heat of water , we must farther assume , that , however different the initial specific heats of the above three liquids may be , yet , while they possess all the same rate of increase , water alone has a different one ; an inadmissible supposition .
All these difficulties and contradictions are removed at once by the experimental fact , that water is endowed with a decreasing ratio in its capacity for caloric , as its temperature is augmented .
Since finishing the above researches on specific heat , I have been led to examine attentively the systematic accounts of this subject in our chemical treatises ; and I find that BERTHOLLET , with a sagacity peculiar to himself , had anticipated , from the chemical constitution of bodies , such an experimental result as I have recently obtained ; though the statements then prevalent all militated against his views .
c If caloric s obey the usual laws of attraction , when it is in small " quantity , relative to the body to which it is united , it will c enter into more intimate combination ; and hence the elasticity or expansive energy of it , on which temperature " depends , may be overcome , and a larger quantity be required " to produce a given temperature .
Hence , the quantity of c " caloric contained in bodies in the first stage of temperature , may be greater than it will be higher in the scale .
" In the Essay above referred to , I have shown that this circumstance in water , renders it peculiarly qualified for serving as the magazinee and equalizer of t !
e temperature of the globe .
Since at our ordinary atmospherical heats , it possesses the greatest capacity for caloric , small variations in its temprerature give it a great modifying power over the circumambient air .
Although the doctrine of final causes be no safe guide to the discovery of unknown truths , yet wen it concurs with experiment , we may deen it an agreeable confirmation .
This is finely illustrated by Count RUMFORD'S speculations on the maximum density of water being placed several degre-s above its point of congelation ; a fact which does not hold with regard to any other homogeneous liquid .
If the specific heat of water , then , diminish as its temperature advances from the freezing to the boiling point , an interval of lo0 near 320 , will contain more caloric than ten degi ees near l e ?
, and still more than the same intervals near 212e .
On this principle we can readily account for the results obtained by Mr. DALTON , in mixing with water at different temperatures a knowxn prowortion of ice ; though it is remarkable that this able chemist did not see in them any thing inconsistent with his own opposite views upon specific heat .
sc 1760.5 expresses the number of degrees of temperature , " such as are found between 20oo and 2 1i ?
of the old or corn " mon scale , entering into ice of 32 ?
, to convert it into water of 832 ; 150 ?
of the same scale suffice , he says , for the same effect , between 12t ?
and 1o0 ?
: and between 45 ?
and 50 ?
, 1i8 ?
are ?
" adequate to the conversion of the same ice into water .
' These three resulting numbers ( 128 , 150 , 176.5 ) are nearly as 5 , 6 , 7 .
Hence it follows , that as much heat is necessary to raise water g5 in the lower part of the old scale , as is " required to raise it 7 ?
in the higher , and 6 ?
in the middle."* Mr. DALTON , instead of adopting the obvious conclusion , that the capacity of water for heat is greater at lower than it is at higher temiperatures , and that therefore a smaller number of degrees of the former should melt as much ice as a greater number of the latter , ascribes the deviation denoted by these numbers , or their differences , to the gross errors of our thermometric graduation ; which he considers " New System , vol. i p , 5 3 so excessive , as not only to equal , but greatly to overbalance the real increase in the specific heat of water ; which left to its own operation , would have produced opposite experimental results .
That our thermometric scale has no such prodigious deviation from truth , or uniformity of indication , I conceive to be fully established , and therefore the only legitimate inference from these very experiments of Mr. DALTON , is the decreasing capacity of water with the increase of its temperature .
It deserves to be remarked , that my experiments on the relative times of cooling a globe of glass , successively filled with water , oil of vitriol , common oil , &amp;c. give exactly the same results as Mr. DALTON derived from mixtures of 2 ounces of ice and 60 of water .
This concurrence is the more satisfactory , since , when the Essay on hydrochloric acid was written , I had no recollection of Mr. DALTON'S experiments .
I found that from 1o ?
* to 1500 the specific heat of oil bears to that of water the ratio of 597 to 1ooo ; and from 150 ?
to 9g ?
, that of 513 to 1ooo .
Now , at his highest and middle temperatures of 2oo0 and 120o , which come nearest to mine of 180 ?
and 12o ?
, we have by him the ratio of 1760.5 to 15o .
But 597 : 513 : 176 : 150 exactly , which is a very striking coincidence , and affords the happiest confirmation of the accuracy f both sets of experiments , as well as of the just .
ness of the principles on which they were conducted , and on which , particularly , my reductions were founded .
We now see the reason why , when equal weights of water at soa and 212 ?
are mixed , the temperature may be below the mean , as was found by DE Luc .
The capacity at the middle tempe .
rature , is greater than the mean capacity of the two extremes , ( that is of the ingredients mixed , ice , cold and boiling water ) and therefore the thermometric tension will be lessened , and its mercury will descend on the scale.* This diminution of temperature will cause a corresponding diminution of bulk , which affords a complete answer to Mr. DALTON'S first and only plausible argument , formerly quoted against Dr. CRAWFORD'S deductions , and the opinions of DE Luc .
With regard , however , to these experiments , of mixing hot and cold water to find a mean temperature , there are sufficient difficulties to render the result uncertain to 2 or 3 degrees .
Hence , nothing of moment can safely be inferred from them .
Concerning sulphuric acid in its various states of dilution , I beg to refer the reader to my Essay on the subject , where he will find several peculiarities relative to its volume at different acid strengths , that entirely change its relations to caloric .
I have not seen these formerly adverted to by any chemist .
They were evidently unknown to Mr. DALTON .
CHAPTER III .
On the latent heat of dfierent vapours .
What relation is there between the caloric existing in the vapours of different substances , and the temperatures at which they respectively acquire the same elastic force ?
On this subject I am not acquainted with any preceding inquiries , though a question of such interest has probably not escaped examination .
In this research I employed a very simple apparatus ; and with proper management , I believe it capable of giving the absolute quantities of latent heat in different vapours , as exactly as more refined and complicated mechanisms .
At any rate , it will afford comparative results with great precision .
It consisted of a glass retort of very small dimensions , with a short neck inserted into a globular receiver of very thin glass , and about three inches in diameter .
The globe was surrounded with a certain quantity of water at a known temperature , contained in a glass basin .
20o grains of the liquid , whose vapour was to be examined , were introduced itlto the retort , and rapidly distilled into the globe by the heat of an argand lamp .
The temperature of the air was 45 ?
, that of the water in the basin from 42 ?
to 4 ?
, and the rise of temperature , occasioned by the condensation of the vapour , never exceeded that of the atmosphere by 4 degrees .
By these means , as the communication of heat is very slow between bodies which differ little in temperature , I found , that the air could exercise no perceptible influence on the water in the basin during the experiment , which was always completed in 5 or 6 minutes .
A thermometer of great delicacy was continually moved through the water ; and its indications were read off , by the aid of a lens , to small fractions of a degree .
In all the early experiments of Dr. BLACK on the latent heat of common steam , the neglect of the above precautions introduced material errors into the estimate .
Hence that distinguished philosopher found the latent heat of steam to be no more than 800 ?
or 81o ? .
Mr. WATT afterwards deter.86 mined it more nearly from 90o0 to 9500 ; and LAVOISIER and LA PLACE have made it ooo ? .
It is evident that whenever the water , into which the latent heat is evolved by condensation of the vapour , becomes much hotter than the surrounding air , it will be impossible to ascertain how much of the caloric is dissipated ; and consequently , the true quantity contained in the vapour must remain uncertain .
The sources of error in operating with the calorimeter of LAVoISIER and LA PLACE , were first pointed out by Mr. WEDGWOOD , and have been since commented on by Dr. THOMSON , and other good systematists .
It is said to be difficult to obtain precisely uniform quantities of liquified ice in the repetition of the same experiments , with that celebrated apparatus .
From the smallness of the retort in my mode of proceeding , the shortness of the neck , and its thorough insertion into the globe , we prevent condensation by the air in transitu ; while the surface of the globe and the mass of water being great , relative to the quantity of vapour employed , the heat is entirely transferred to the refrigeratory , where it is allowed to remnain , without ; apparent diminution , for a few minutes .
In numerous repetitions of the same experiment , the accordances were excellent .
The following table contains the mean results .
The water in the basin weighed in each case 32340 gr. The globe was held steadily in the centre of the water by a slender ring fixed round its neck .
The distillation was rapidly performed , so that all the condensation took place in the globe .

Hence , when their tension is the same , it appears reasonable to suppose that the product of their densities into their quantities of latent heat will also be the same .
Repulsive energy 389 will be proportional to the quantity of heat , the repulsive power condensed or contained in a given space .
Thus if the space left for its interposition or lodgment be in one vapour a half or a third of the amount of the space in another , we ought to find equal tension produced in the former case , by a half or a third of the latent heat required for the latter .
As the principle , I have reason to suppose , is somewhat new , let us illustrate it by an application to the three vapours in the above list which are most homogeneous , or at any rate best understood ; those of alcohol , ether , and water .
Aqueous vapour of an elastic force balancing the atmospheric pressure has a specific gravity , compared to air , by the accurate experiments of GAY LUSSAC , of 10 to 16 .
For facility of comparison let us call the steam of water unity , or 1.oo ; then the specific gravity of the vapour of pure ether is 4.00 , while the specific gravity of the vapour of absolute alcohol is,.6o .
But the vapour of ether , whose boiling point is not 100oo , but 11 ?
, like the above ether , contains some alcohol ; hence , we must accordingly diminish a little the specific gravity of its vapour .
It will then become instead of 400oo.55 Alcohol of 0.825 sp. gr. contains much water ; specific gravity of its vapour 2.30 That of water as before , unity 1.00 The interstitial spaces in these three vapours will therefore be inversely as these numbers , or for ether ; for alcohol ; for water.,355 230 ' ' 39 ?
Hence of latent heat , existing in ethereal vapour , will occupy a proportional space , be equally condensed or possess the same tension with 2 in alcoholic , and in aqueous 239 loo vapour .
A small modification will no doubt be introduced by the difference of the thermometric tensions , or sensible heats , under the same elastic force .
Common steam , for example , may be considered as deriving its total elastic energy from the latent heat multiplied into the specific gravity + the thermometric tension .
Hence the elastic force of water , or E= -9700 x 1.oo -+ 212 ?
-1,8 Ee =S02x 3.55+ 11 ? ?
1 i84 Eat 4400 x 2.30 + 175 ?
: 1185 Three equations which yield , according to my general proposition , equal quantities ; or of which the differences are inconsiderable , and undeserving of notice .
Neither the specific heats nor specific gravities of the other vapours are ascertained with sufficient precision to enable us to subject them to calculation .

ally diminished .
We may consider them now as in the condition of vapours possessed of greater specific gravities .
Hence , the second portion of heat introduced to give double the 891 elastic force need not be equal to the first , in order to produce the double tension .
This view now given accords with the experiments of Mr. WATT , alluded to in the beginning of this memoir .
He found that " the latent heat of steam is less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a more dense state ; and greater when it is produced under a less pressure or in a less dense state."* BERTHOLLET thinks this fact so unaccountable , that he has been willing to discard it altogether .
Whether the view which I have just opened , of the relation subsisting between the elastic force , density , and latent heat of different vapours , harmonize with chemical phenomena in general , I leave to others to determine .
It certainly agrees with that unaccountable fact .
Whatever be the fate of the investigation of the general law now respectfully offered , the statement of Mr. WATT may be implicitly received under the sanction of his acknowledged sagacity and candour .
CONCLUSION .
To the theory of latent heat , which , like the hydrostatic paradox of Archimedes , might have remained for ages a barren , though beautiful proposition , the fertile genius of that philosopher gave all at once its noblest application , and most beneficial influence on human life , by his new steam engine .
After him , many minds of the first order for science and ingenuity have offered schemes of farther improvement ; but all either frivolous or abortive ; with such prophetic judgment had Mr. WATT anticipated the happiest form and structure of which it was susceptible .
Under this conviction , it is with much deference that I draw the following practical inferences from the last train of experiments .
Since the vapour of alcohol , having the same elastic force as the atmosphere , contains of the latent heat of ordinary steam , and since its elastic force is doubled at the o26th degree ( 6 ?
below the boiling heat of water ) , with perhaps i of additional caloric ; might we not , in particular circumstances , employ this vapour for impelling the piston of a steam engine ?
The condensing apparatus could , I imagine , be so constructed , as to prevent any material loss of the liquid , while more than a quadruple power would be obtained from the same size of cylinder at si ?
, with an expenditure of fuel not amounting to one half of what aqueous vapour consumes ; or the power and fuel would be as 8 to i , calling their relation in ordinary steam i to j. A considerable engine could thus also be brought within a very moderate compass .
Possibly , after a few operations of the air pump , the incondensible gas may be so effectually withdrawn , that we might be permitted to detach this mechanism , which , though essential to common engines , takes away one fourth of their power .
In a distillery in this country , or on a sugar estate in the colonies , a trial of this plan might perhaps be made with advantage .
While exercising its mechanical functions of grinding , mashing or squeezing the canes , it would be converting ordinary into strong spirit for rectification , or for the convenience of carriage .
Might not such an engine be executed on a small scale , for many purposes of domestic drudgery ?
It would unquestionably furnish a beautiful illustration in philosophy , to make one small portion of liquid , by the agency of fire , imitate the ceaseless circulation and restless activity of life .
