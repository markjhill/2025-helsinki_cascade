[ Phil. Trans. 1800 , p. 539.1 The mode of conducting this important survey having been already noticed in the Journals of the Society on various former occasions , it will only be necessary here to state the progress of the operation , which we find has now been carried on over Essex , the western part of Kent , Suffolk , and Hertfordshire , and portions of the counties contiguous to them .
A distinct section contains the calculations of the sides of the principal and secondary triangles extended over the country in the three abovementioned years , together with an account of the measurement of a new base-line on Sedgemoor , and a short historical narrative of each year 's operations .
Another section contains the computed latitudes and longitudes of the places on the western coast intersected in 1795 and 1796 , and also of such others since determined as lie conveniently situated to the newly observed meridians .
Here we find likewise the directions of those meridians ; one on Blackdown in Dorsetshire , another on Butterton Hill in Devonshire , and another on St. Agnes Beacon in Cornwall ; as also the bearings , distances , &amp;c. of the stations and intersected objects from the several ascertained parallels and meridians .
