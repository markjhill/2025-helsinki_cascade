" On the Theory of Elliptic Motion .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received March 9 , 1860 .
The present Note is intended to give an account of the results which , by means of a grant from the Donation Fund of the Royal Society , I have procured to be calculated for me by Messrs. Creedy and Davis , and which are contained in a memoir presented to the Royal Astronomical Society , entitled " Tables of the Developments of Functions in the Theory of Elliptic Motion .
" The notation employed is r , the radius vector ; f , the true anomaly ; a , the mean distance ; e , the excentricity ; g , the mean anomaly ; so that e1qr(e , J ) , and f , elta(e , g ) ( read elliptic quotient radius and elliptic true anomaly ) , are known fuinctions of e , g. Moreover x denotes the periodic part of ?
, and y the equation of the centre or periodic part off ; so that -f=1 + x , and x , y are also known functions of e , g. Formule for the development in multiple cosines or sines up to the terms in e7 of sin wherej is an inideterminate symb)ol , are given by Leverrier in the 'Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris , ' t. i. ( 1855 ) , pp. 346-348 ; and what has beeni done is the deduction from these of the developments in the like form of various functions of the forms xnl COs1j1f 4-m COS if Sill a si5 wherej has given integer values .
It is to be remarked that a cosinie series is in general represented in the form s [ cos]2cos ig , where i extends from o to+ x , and the coefficients [ cos]z satisfy the condition [ cos]i=[cos ] ' , and that a sine series is represented in the form I [ sin ] ' sin ig , where i extends from o to + oo , and the coefficients [ sin]h satisfy the conditioni [ sin ] -i= [ sin ] ' ( this implies [ sin]0=O ) .
In the case of a pair of corresponding funictions , xrn cosjf and x0 ' sinif , or ( - ) cosyf and a sinif , one of them expanded in the form I [ cos ] ' cos ig , and the other in the form I [ sin ] ' sin i4 the sums and differences of the corresponding coefficients [ cos]i , [ sin ] ' ( represented by the itotation [ cOs + sin ] ' , and which are obviously such that [ cos + sin ] -i= [ cos sin ] ' , , [ cos + sin ] = [ cos]0 ) are for many purposes equally useful with the coefficients [ cos ] ' , [ sin ] ' , and they are in the memoir tabulated accordingly ; and the several functions tabulated are as follows : viz. ( x ' , a ? .
