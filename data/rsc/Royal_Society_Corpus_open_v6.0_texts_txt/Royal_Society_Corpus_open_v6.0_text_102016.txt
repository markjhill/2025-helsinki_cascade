An Extract of a Letter from Sir R. Bulkley concerning the Propagation of Elms by Seed .
THIS is to acquaint you that I have discoursed a poor mere Irish Labourer ( who by having worked many years under a Head Gardiner in a Gentleman 's Garden , has got a Genius of Planting ) who has follow 'd the Propagating of Elms by the Seed ( a way , if known , totally neglected among all Planters ) which Seed he finds in the former part of the Year ; and he has raised in small Beds such vast numbers of them , that he sells them of three or four Foot long at Two Shillings a Hundred , and will carry them any where within Five Miles , and plant them into the Bargain .
