Communicated by the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. Peculiar difficulty has hitherto attended the determination of the equation of the curve formed by the perpetual intersection of rays , which , diverging from a luminous point , are reflected by a polished surface of a given curvature .
Curves of this description have been denominated caustics 3 and the method usually employed to discover their polar equations , or the relation between the radius vector of any point of the curve and the tangent at that point , is both long and inelegant , and is considered by the author as involving considerable inaccuracy of reasoning .
He proposes , therefore , tosubstitute a new method of investigation , by taking the polar equation of one of the reflected rays , and differentiating this equation with respect to the arbitrary quantities solely which determine its position , and thus obtaining the polar co-ordinates of the point of intersection of two consecutive lines 3 and finally , by elimination , the equation of the curve in which all such points are found .
He is thus led to results remarkable for their simplicity , elegance , and generality : and he gives particular applications of his method , exemplifying the facility with which it effects the solution of problems extremely difficult of management by the ordinary methods hitherto employed .
His method is also ap ?
plicable to the determination of the equations of the evolutes of curves , and to various other problems of a similar nature .
