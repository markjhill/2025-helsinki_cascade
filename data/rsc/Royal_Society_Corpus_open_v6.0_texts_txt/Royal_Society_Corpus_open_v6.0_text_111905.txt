Isomerism of Diatomic Compounds .
By A. W. HOFMANN , LL. D. , F.R.So Received May 24 , 1861 .
The experiments which Dr. Volhard has described in the previous Note , remind me of some analogous observations which I made some time ago in the case of oxalyl-derivatives .
While engaged in experiments on the separation of the ethyl bases by means of oxalic ether , which I have had the honour of laying before the Royal Society * , I had collected a considerable quantity of diethyloxamate of ethyl , , 15 , NO 3 [ ( C2 02 ) ( C2 H5)2 N ] }0 ( C2 1 , ) I , which is formed by the action of oxalic ether upon diethylamine .
I have studied the deportment of this compound under the influence of several agents .
When digested with alcoholic amronia in sealed tubes , diethyloxamate of ethyl is rapidly converted into a crystalline compound , which on analysis was found to contain C , 1 , N2 02 , , showing that the reaction is accomplished in the form pointed out by theory , ( C2 02 ) " ( C2 -115)2 N } 02 ) ( C2 0C ) ( 2 15 , ) + 113 , N =(C,21 2 N2+ H ยง 10 112 J The new compound then has the composition of diethyloxamide , but it is far from being identical with the splendid body which is formed by the action of oxalic ether on ethylamine .
It differs from the latter in many of its properties , being in fact much more soluble in water , and also by its transformations .
Under the influence of hydrate of potassium the diethyloxamide of Wurtz splits into oxalic acid and ethylamine , C6 H12 N20,2+2KO = K2 C2 04+2C,4 H7N Diethyloxamide .
Ethylamine .
whilst under the same circumstances the new compound furnishes an oxalate together with ammonia and diethylamine , C , H12 N2 02+ 2 KHO =K,2 024+ 3N+ C4 11 , N. New substance , Diethylamine .
It is thus seen that the isomeric diamides in general exhibit the relation which Dr. Volhard has so well developed for the ureas .
The nature of these substances is determined by their genesis , ( 02 02 ) " ( 02 ) 0 ) " 06 112 N2 N0=[(02 H , )H3 N ] 02-2,20== [ ( C,2 )2 H2 N ] 0 211 22O [ ( C2 1)113 N ] j [ H4 N]J which is readily traced in their products of decomposition .
The following formulma might indicate the difference in the construction of the two bodies which form the subject of this Note , ( c2 02 ) " ( 02 ) C , ,N12,0 = ( C2H 1)11 N , ( C 1)2N2 .
( C,2 H , )H JH It is obvious that similar cases of isomerism must obtain among the diamines or diatomic bases .
Thus the formula 016 2 can represent two very similar bases , the constitution of which differs , inasmuch as the one owes its origin to the association of two molecules of ethylamine , while the other arises from the union of one molecule of ammonia and one molecule of diethylamine , the connecting link being in both cases the diatomic ethylene-molecule which replaces the hydrogen , C6t,11N , = ( C211 , ) N2 = ( CH12 N. ( C , H2 , )H The facility with which the ethylated ammonias may be separated by means of oxalate of ethyl , has induced me to study the action of this ether on the diatomic bases .
Ethylene-diamine , when treated with oxalate of ethyl in the presence of alcohol , is converted into a compound crystallizing in long needles , to which analysis assigns the formula C1 1116 N , 0 .
This substance is the ethyl-ether of a diatomic amidic acid , i. e. the oxamethane of ethylene-diamine , CIO 111 N2 0 -[(C22 ) .
( C 2 4 ) " N2O 0* The action of monamines and diamines upon this compound gives rise to the formation of white insoluble bodies , similar to oxamide .
1 have not analysed these substances , the composition of which is sufficiently indicated by the logical development of the theoretical notions acquired in the study of the series of monatomic compounds .
The action of oxalate of ethyl on ethylene-diamine produces , however , in addition , a new class of organic bases of a higher order , containing both ethylene and oxalyl .
The examination of these bases , which are not represented among the monatomic compounds , will be the subject of a later communication .
