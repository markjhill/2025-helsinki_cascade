The next paper was entitled , " On the Tides , " by the same .
This paper contains tables of the results of observations made at Breast , with regard to the principal inequality of the tides , or that which is independent of the parallaxes and declinations of the moon and sun , and depends solely on the moon 's age , that is , on the time of her passage through the plane of the meridian ; from which it appears that the tables of the tides for London are not applicable to Breast , by merely changing the establishment , that is , by adding a con ?
stant quantity , as has been hitherto supposed ; and the same remark applies to any distant parts .
