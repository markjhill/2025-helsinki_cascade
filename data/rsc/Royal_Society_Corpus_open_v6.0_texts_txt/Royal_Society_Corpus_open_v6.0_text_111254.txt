" On the Acidity , Sweetness , and Strength of Wine , Beer and Spirits .
" By H. Bence Jones , M.D. , F.R.S. Received Nov. 17 , 1853 .
( 1 .
) The acidity of the different liquids was determined by means of a standard solution of caustic soda .
The quantity of liquid neutralized was always equal in bulk to 1000 grs. of water at 60 ?
F. The acidity in differentSherries varied from 1'95 grs. to 2*85 grs. of caustic soda .
Madeira , , 2-70 , , 3-60 Port , , 210 , , 2-55 Claret , , 255 , , 3-45 Burgundy , , 255 , 405 , , Champagne , , 240 , , 315 , Rhine wine , 315 , , 3'60 , , Moselle , , 2-85 , , 450 Brandy , 015 , , 0-60 Rum , , 015 , , 0'30 Geneva , 0-07 Whisky , , 0'07 Bitter ale , , 090 , , 165 Porter , , 180 , , 210 , Stout , , 135 , , 225 Cider , , 1'85 , , 3-90 Hence the order in which these wines may be arranged , beginning with the least acid , is Sherry , Port , Champagne , Claret , Madeira , Burgundy , Rhine , Moselle .

) The sugar was determined by means of Soleil 's saccha .
rometer , which at least gives the lowest limit to the amount of sugar .
The sweetness in different-Sherries varied from 4 grs. to 18 grs. in the ounce .
Madeira , , 6 , , 20 , Champagne , , 6 , 28 , Port , , 16 , , 34 M^lmsy , , 56 , , 66 , Tokay , 74 Samos , 88 Paxarette , , 94 , Claret , Burgundy , Rhine , and Moselle contained no sugar .
Hence the order in which these wines may be arranged , beginning with the driest , isClaret : Burgundy Rhine Moselle Sherry Madeira Champagne Port Malmsy Tokay Samos Paxarette .
In a dietetic view , assuming that the sugar becomes acid , then the mean results as to the'acidity of the different fluids examined , beginning with the least acid , isGeneva Whisky Rum Brandy Claret Burgundy Rhine wine Moselle Sherry Madeira Champagne Cider Port Porter Stout Malmsy -Madeira Ale Tokay .

) The alcohol was determined by means of the alcoholometer of M. Geisler of Bonn .
The strength of different samples ofPort varied from 20-7 per cent. to 23-2 per cent. by measure .
Sherry , , 154 , , 24-7 , Madeira , , 190 , , 197 , , Marsala , , 199 , , 211 , , Claret , , 91 , , 111 , , Burgundy , , 101 , , 132 , , Rhinewine , 9'5 , , 130 , , Moselle , , 87 , 94 , Champagne , , 141 , , 148 , , Brandy , , 504 , , 53 , , Rum , , 72-0 , , 77-1 Geneva , , 49*4 , Whisky , , 593 , Cider , , 5.4 , 75 , Bitter ale , , 66 , , 12'3 Porter , , 65 , , 70 , Stout , , 6'5 79 , The Burgundy and Claret have less alcohol than was found by Mr. Brand forty years ago in the wines he examined .
The Sherry is now stronger , the Port is not so strong , the Marsala is weaker , the Rhine wine is the same strength , the Brandy is as strong as formerly ; the Rum is nearly half as strong again ; the Porter is stronger , and the Stout rather stronger than formerly .
Lastly , the specific gravity of each liquid was taken .
As this however chiefly depends on the amount of alcohol and sugar present , and as these were directly determined , the specific gravity may be taken as a distant control on the amountof sugar present .
Thus , in those wines in which the amount of alcohol was the same , the specific gravity was found to vary with the amount of sugar found by the saccharometer .
The results of the analysis of each sample of wine , &amp;c. is given in a series of tables , which do not admit of any abstract .
