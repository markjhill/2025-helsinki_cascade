uAn Experimental Investigation of the Laws of Attrition .

Communicated by J. Joly , F.R.S. Received July 5 , 1895 .
The method of investigation employed in these experiments consists essentially in rubbing two solid surfaces together under specified conditions , and in finding the amount of material removed off the surfaces in this way .
The apparatus consisted in an arrangement by means of which two parallel cylinders of the substances to be experimented with could be rotated , while at the same time pressed together with a known force .
The amount removed was found by weighing the cylinders before and after .
The substances experimented with up to the present are all of a non-metallic character .
The results of the experiments may shortly be summed up as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
The amount removed by attrition under otherwise similar circumstances is proportional to the pressure .
2 .
In each case there is a critical pressure below which two surfaces when rubbed together tend to polish , and to gradually cease losing material .
3 .
The amount removed by attrition from a given substance when rubbed by other kinds of substances harder than itself , depends ( to a first approximation ) only on the properties of the substance itself , and does not increase with the hardness of the other body .
The first of these three permits of an absolute coefficient of attrition , or shortly the attritivity , being defined as the amount removed per unit area , during unit displacement , when two surfaces of the same material undergo relative movement while pressed together with unit pressure .
The Attritometer .
The simplest form an apparatus for making experiments on attrition could take would , apparently , be that of two plane surfaces , which could be made to rub each other while pressed together , but the difficulty of removing the attrited material makes some modification necessary .
The form of apparatus finally adopted consisted essentially of two parallel cylinders , which could be rotated so as to rub each other while pressed together by a known force .
Opportunity is thus afforded during rotation of dusting off any of the adhering material .
This was effected by pads or wisps of cottonwool , held against the cylinders by means of small stiff brushes on which the wool remains caught .
Fig. 1 shows the apparatus diagrammatically in plan .
Dr. F. T. Trouton .
An Experimental [ Nov. 21 , Fig. l. Plan .
The cylinders A and B , which are mounted on steel spindles with coned ends , stand vertically .
One of the spindles , B , the lower in the figure , is mounted on stationary bearings .
The bearings of the other , A , are carried by a framework which swings after the manner of a gate on an axis .
This axis is placed so that the cylinders may come together in a line tangentially to the circle of swing of the framework .
This cylinder will , for shortness , be referred to as the movable cylinder , the other as the fixed .
The force pressing the cylinders together is applied by a cord fastened to the end of the swinging frame , and passing over a pulley to an attached weight , W. The rotation of the cylinders was maintained by chains , and toothed wheels from a driving shaft carrying a pulley , C , which took a leather belt .
It will be seen from the diagram that the driving shaft in the apparatus used worked inside the tube , which served as the pivot or axis for the swinging frame .
It is necessary , in transmitting rotation to the movable cylinder , that care be taken that no force be introduced pressing the cylinders together .
This is effected in the apparatus used by placing rollers , D E , carried by an independent frame near the driving shaft , in such a position as to direct the line of chains through the axis of suspension of the swinging frame .
The rollers are made adjustable , so as to suit different sized cylinders .
The driving power was supplied by an electric motor geared down twice .
The number of rotations was ascertained by a counter attached to the driving shaft .
The mounting of a cylinder , of the substance being dealt with , on its spindle is shown in Fig. 2 .
The diagram explains itself .
The toothed wheel is made to pass on and off the spindle , and is held in place by a removable steel pin .
In order to weigh the cylinder , the toothed wheel is removed .
This is necessary , on account of oil from the chain .
Results of Experiments .
It will be seen , on examining the tables showing the results of experiments made with this apparatus and given at the end of this 1895.1 Investigation of the Laws of Attrition .

paper , that the weight attrited may he considered proportional to the force bringing the cylinders together .
We can thus say that the weight attrited from any given area is proportional to the pressure , although we may not know the value of the pressure itself .
For we can express the weight removed thus , W = K.V.T.JPdA , since the integral is equal to the force in question .
We assume here that the effect is simply proportional to the displacement Vl\ thus neglecting all terms involving higher powers of the velocity.* I have called the value of the constant K , when the two surfaces are of the same material , the coefficient of attrition or the attritivity of the substance .
In this way arbitrariness in definition is avoided , such as would be introduced , say , in assuming all bodies to be attrited with one standard substance\#151 ; by diamond , for instance\#151 ; and we arrive at a so-called absolute unit .
The dimension of attritivity will be seen to be the inverse square of a velocity [ K ] = [ T2 x L"2 ] .
It might be thought that the coefficient here introduced did not refer to anything which could properly be looked upon or advisedly classed as one of the properties of a substance , but its importance may perhaps be better seen further down , where it is shown that with bodies harder than itself the amount attrited from a given substance can practically be considered as depending only on its own value of the coefficient .
Elsewhere ( ' Brit. Assoc. Report , ' Leeds , 1890 ) this coefficient has * In none of the experiments made was any difference observed due to running the apparatus at different rates ; but no great difference in the rates of rotation could he tried owing to the apparatus not working smoothly at higher speeds .

A.n Experimental [ Nov. 21 , been suggested as a measure of the qualities of a substance referred to in a collective way under the general name of hardness .
Any comparative method , such as " Mohr 's Scale , " even though it be pre-eminently suitable for practical purposes , must be considered as objectionable , from a physical point of view .
This will be understood , if it be attempted to define or measure the property in question for any substance , supposing no other kind of matter to exist .
In Table I are given the coefficients of attrition in the case of seven substances .

units , that is to say , they are the weights of material in grams , attrited per square centimeter , during a centimeter displacement under a pressure of one dyne per square centimeter .
To bring these to English measure ( any mass , feet and seconds ) , we need not trouble about the mass , but have only to multiply twice by 3048 , the number of centimeters in a foot , since the dimensions of attrition , it will be remembered , are the same as that of the inverse square of a velocity .

599*0 The quartz cylinders used were cut with the axis parallel to the principal axis of the crystal ; the material looked transparent and clear .
The English plate glass had the usual greenish appearance .
The French plate was white and clear .
The serpentine was the variety known as Galway marble\#151 ; olive-green with whitish streaks .
The marble cylinders were made of white statuary marble , and contained disseminated throughout its mass small and transparent microscopic crystals of a felspar , probably , albite .
The alabaster was whitish , with a slight flesh-coloured tinge ; it was rather inclined to wear into somewhat roundish lumps , due , no doubt , to want of uniformity .
The cylinders of plaster of Paris were cast in moulds , and , after having thoroughly set , were turned up in a lathe .

ders , it acts as a lubricant , and diminishes the amount attrited.* As explained further on , the pressure must exceed a certain minimum value in each case , or polishing will ensue .
In all cases it is the ultimate constant values which are to be taken as the weight of material attrited ; that is to say , the cylinders should be allowed to rub themselves to the proper surface so as to continue giving a constant value before taking a determination .
It is found that there is a surface proper to each pressure .
When the pressure is increased the amount at first removed is less than subsequently ; on changing from a higher to a lower pressure the reverse is generally true.f With the harder substances used , chipping at the edges of the cylinders was sometimes a source of considerable trouble .
It is advantageous to have the edges chamfered off , as this gives a better resistance to crushing .
This tendency to chip puts a limit to the pressure which can be used .
The results given in this paper cannot be considered as the best which can be obtained with the form of apparatus used , for , from the first , the end aimed at was rather to gain a general insight into the phenomenon in question by accumulating a large number of results than to determine accurately the value of the coefficient in individual cases .
The Critical Pressure of Attrition .
In the case of each kind of material the pressure must be above a certain value in order that a constant value be finally reached in the weight of material attrited .
This particular pressure I have called the critical pressure for attrition .
If the pressure be below this the amount attrited gets less and less as time goes on , and ultimately the surface becomes polished on the rubbing being continued long enough .
Before this was understood the results obtained at different pressures were often inconsistent , and a great deal of time was thereby lost .
For consistent results it is , of course , necessary to operate above the critical pressure .
Up to the present I have made no determination of the actual value of the critical pressure for any substance ; but the following table , derived from data incidentally obtained in determining attritivity , gives the approximate relative values in the case of the same substance experimented with .
The critical pressure necessary to ensure that quartz attrite quartz is assumed to be 1000:\#151 ; * In the case of the softer substances experimented with it was found advantageous to have two extra pads or wisps of cotton wool which could be applied by hand so as to remove the very fine dust .
+ Many of the irregularities in the results given arose probably from not attending sufficiently to this precaution .

1 As alluded to before , the form adopted for the material in the apparatus , namely , cylinders , precludes ascertaining the actual values of the pressures .
A method of experiment in which flat surfaces were used would be necessary to do this .
Attrition of UnliJce Substances .
In the following table are given the results of experiments in which unlike substances were caused to attrite each other .
Along the horizontal lines in the table are shown the amounts* attrited by rubbing with a cylinder of the substance given at the left-hand end of the line from each of the substances indicated at the top :\#151 ; Table III , Quartz .

0 0 13 599 These experiments brought to light the unsuspected fact that the quantity rubbed off a given substance does not increase with the hardness of the substance with which it is rubbed , once the latter is equal to that of itself .
In fact , it would look from the table to be rather the other way .
This , however , is probably due to secondary causes .
So that we may state , as a first approximation , that when rubbed by a harder substance the amount attrited is independent of the other substance .

On the other hand , from the general trend of the figures in the table it would seem that , when rubbed by a softer substance , a certain amount is always to be considered lost .
( In the table when 0 appears it means that the amount , if any , is less than experimental errors introduced .
) No attempt has been made to deduce a relation connecting the several quantities here involved , as , unfortunately , the figures themselves cannot be relied on sufficiently to warrant doing so .
Tables of Experiments .
In the following tables the force is given in what are practically arbitrary units .
The numbers themselves are the number of lbs. hung over the pulley in each experiment .
To obtain the force pressing the cylinders together , these must be , in the first place , increased in the ratio of the leverage of the swinging frame .
For the purposes of comparison the weights obtained , which are given in the two parallel columns , have been divided by the number of rotations made by the cylinders in each case and by the number of units of weight acting over the pulley .
In the tables , decimal places have been omitted : these are given beneath each table in the deduced mean .
To bring the result to C.G.S. units'it is necessary to divide by the sum of the mean circumferences of the cylinders , by the number of grams in a lb. , by g , and to multiply by 77/ 69'75 the ratio of the leverage .
From the pivot or axis of the swinging frame to where the cord leading to the weight was attached was 77 cm .
, from the same point to the cylinder was 69'75 .
