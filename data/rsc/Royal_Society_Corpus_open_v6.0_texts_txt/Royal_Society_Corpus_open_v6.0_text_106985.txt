Observations of the diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Needle , in the Island of St. Helena ; with a Continuation of the Observations at Fort Marlborough , in the Island of Sumatra .
By John Macdonald , Esq. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks , Bart. K. B. P. R. S. Read May 24 , 1798 .
SIR , Edinburgh , September 30 , 1797- .
ON my arrival in England , I had the honour of observing to you , that I had taken some observations of the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle , in the island of St. Helena .
I am to apologize to you for having , till this period , omitted furnishing you with these , and with a continuation of those formerly taken in the island of Sumatra .
The meridian was laid off by meansof an apparatus brought from Bencoolen ; and the requisite allowance made for the alteration of the sun 's declination during the operation .
The meridian-plate remains firmly set in a pillar of teak-wood , well fixed , for the use of navigators ; who , by applying a compass-card to it , will find the variation more readily , and correctly , than by amplitude or azimuth .
A short residence at St. Helena , arising from the sudden departure of the-fleet to which the ship I was in , belonged , has prevented the observations from being as numerous as .
I could wish .
Their agreement , however , indicates that fiftyeight observations are sufficient for affording such conclusions as philosophy may draw ; and tends to confirm some inferences stated in a former Paper , containing similar observations taken in the East Indies .
By adding the mean of the morning and afternoon observations , at St. Helena , and taking the half , the , general variation , in the month of November , 1796 , appears to have been S5 48 34/ I west : and , by subtracting the medium diurnal afternoon variation , from the medium diurnal morning , the vibrating variation proves to be 3 ' 55 " .
It appears , that the magnetic needle is stationary from about six o'clock in the evening till six o'clock in the morning ; when it commences moving , and the west variation increases , till it amounts to its maximum , about eight o'clock ; diminishing afterwards , till it becomes stationary .
Here , the same cause seems to operate as at Bencoolen , with a modification of effect , proportioned to the relative situations of the southern magnetic poles , and the places of observation .
At the apartments of the Royal Society , this species of variation is found to increase , from seven o'clock in the morning till two o'clock in the afternoon .
If the variation is east , in the northern hemisphere in the East Indies , I conceive that the diurnal variation will increase towards the afternoon , remain some time stationary , and diminish before the succeeding morning : if the general variation is west , in that quarter , the reverse may be the case .
The quantity of the diurnal variation is greater in Britain than at St. Helena , or at Bencoolen .
This will naturally arise from this country 's being more contiguous to its affecting poles , than those islands situated near the equator .
It were to be wished , that observations were taken in as many situations as possible , similarly situated in the opposite hemispheres , on the lines of no variation .
A greater degree of dip might be found , and conclusions might be deduced , that would tend considerably to illustrate this curious and interesting subject , as yet involved in conjecture and uncertainty .
I frequently , while at &amp; encoolen , observed that the needle did not retain the same level , but was sometimes depressed , and sometimes elevated , six or eight minutes .
I paid little attention to this , ascribing it to a minute alteration in the position of the point of the socket over the pivot .
I observed , sometimes , a similar difference of level in the position of the needle at St. Helena , without being able to account for it .
It may be possible , that the dip of the needle is subject to a diurnal variation in its vertical movement .
I have perused such publications as have appeared on magnetism for some time past : they state no theory of this obscure science , more rational , or satisfactory , than that left us by the celebrated HALLEY .
I have the honour to be , &amp;c. JOHN MACDONALD .
