( Abstract .
) The Transactions of the Royal Society contain the first Life-Table : it was constructed by Halley , who discovered its remarkable properties , and illustrated some of its applications .
With better data improved methods have been found out , and the form has been extended so as to facilitate the solution of various questions .
In deducing the English Life-Tables from the National Returns , I have had occasion to try various methods of construction ; and I now propose to describe briefly the nature of the Life-Table , to lay down a simple method of construction , to describe an extension of its form , and to illustrate this by a new Table representing the vitality of the healthiest part of the population of England .
The Life-Table is an instrument of investigation ; it may be called a biometer , for it gives the exact measure of the duration of life under given circumstances .
Such a Table has to be constructed for each district and for each profession , to determine their degrees of salubrity .
To multiply these constructions , then , it is necessary to lay down rules , which , while they involve a minimum amount of arithmetical labour , will yield results as correct as can be obtained in the present state of our observations .
A Life-Table represents a generation of men passing through time ; and time under this aspect , dating from birth , is called age .
In the first column of a Life-Table age is expressed in years , commencing at 0 ( birth ) , and proceeding to 100 or to 110 years , the extreme limit of observed lifetime .
Annexed is an outline of the two primary series of the Life-Table , representing the surviving at each year of age ( 14 ) , and the first differences representing the dying ( die ) , in annual intervals of age .

It will be observed that , upon the hypothesis that the annual births equal the annual deaths in number , and that the law of mortality remains invariable , the series of the living ( l , ) can be constructed from the series of numbers ( d ) representing the dying , or from the numbers dying at different ages , as returned in the parish registers .
That course was adopted by Halley , and afterwards by Dr. Price , in constructing the Northampton Table .
But the hypothesis of an invariable annual number of births equalling the deaths has never been verified by observation , and consequently tables on the plan of Halley 's are often exceedingly erroneous .
In the healthiest districts of England the births were 29,715 , the deaths 17,469 annually : a Table constructed upon that plan , like Dr. Price 's , makes the mean lifetime-or as it is sometimes called , the expectation of life-for Northampton , 25 years , while the mean lifetime by a correct Northampton Table is 38 years .
It is shown by a diagram that if age ( x ) is represented by the abscissas , the numbers living ( 6 , ) will be represented by the ordinates of a curve .
De Moivre constructed this curve by assuming that the series l is from the age 12 to 86 , in arithmetical progression ; decreasing thus , 74 , 73 , 72 ... 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 .
By another hypothesis , the rate of mortality is assumed to decrease or to increase in geometrical progression at different rates in different periods of life ; and it is found that this hypothesis represents the results deduced from the observed facts approximatively .
As v , the velocity , expresses a ratio , so m , the rate of mortality , is the ratio of the number dying to the number living in a unit of time .
Now if y represent the living at a definite age , and r the rate at which the mortality increases at that point of age , then mrf will be the rate of mortality after the lapse of z units of time .
The decrement of y in an infinitely short time will be dy=ymrZdz .
This was pointed out by Mr. Gompertz , and Mr. Edmonds subsequently extended the theory .
This expression can be integrated , and the final equation of the corrected integral is y=l].O ; where X is put for the common logarithm , and k for its modulus .
Either of the hypotheses gives a close approximation to the exact result , within short intervals of time ; and the results by the two hypotheses agree at the principal ages after 20 , when they can be fairly tested .
Thus , if the rate of mortality in any year of age ( x to x+ 1 ) is m , then 1 +-m : , m : : : 1 1-2 .
22 +l-,1-Mm It is here assumed that mn is known ; and putting p , for 1-2m t IoJ-~ [ + I:m ' we have p , l , l+l ; and have thus the means of passing from the numbers living at the age x to the numbers living at the age x+ 1 .
But upon the other hypothesis , y , being = 1 , then P v=Y =10 OX Upon the two hypotheses , Xp20= -19966528 by the one , and 1T9966527 by the other ; Xp40=19956263 by the one hypothesis , and 1'9956264 by the other .
At 80 there is some divergence .
I have adopted the latter hypothesis generally ; but the other hypothesis is at some of the earlier ages preferred .
I have only adopted these hypotheses within the safe limits of a single year in determining eleven values of Xp , which I have afterwards interpolated by the method of finite differences ; thus assuming that the third difference was constant .
This gives , I conceive , as near an approximation as we can obtain in the present state of the observations .
p , is the first difference of the series X4l ; and consequently it can be constructed by four orders of differences , on the assumption that no error of consequence is caused by assuming that within given limits the fourth difference is constant .

On the opposite page is an extract from the first of the sectional Tables .
The properties of these columns are described , and a collection of useful formulas is added .
The curious and useful properties of the new column y are illustrated .
The mean annual mortality in England was at the rate of 22 in 1000 ; but in eighteen districts the mortality ranged from 28 to 36 in 1000 , and in sixty-four districts the mortality ranged from 15 to 16 and 17 in 1000 ; in the other districts it was at intermediate rates .
The Table has been constructed from sixty-three of the districts in which the mortality did not exceed 17 in 1000 .
Halley first pointed out some of the financial applications of the Life-Table , and the new Table shows that the mean duration of life among large classes of the population exceeds considerably the expectations of life deduced from the ordinary Tables .
The science of public health has been developed since Halley 's day ; and here a new application of the Life-Table is found .
If we ascertain at what rate a generation of men die away under the least unfavourable existing circumstances , we obtain a standard by which the loss of life under other circumstances is measured ; and this I have endeavoured to accomplish in the New Life-Table .
And recollecting that the science of public health was almost inaugurated in England by a former President of this Society , who crowned the sanitary discoveries of Captain Cook , I feel assured that the Society will receive with favour this imperfect attempt to supply sanitary inquirers with a scientific instrument .
