A Letter from Mr. James Yonge , F. R. S. to Dr. Hans Sloane , R. S. Secr. containing the Case of a Woman who had her Menses regularly to 70 Years of Age .
Plymouth , July 17 .
1713 .
SIR , AT Lamerton , fifteen Miles from this Town , died lately a Woman of Eighty six Years old ; who to the Age of seventy had her Menses plentiful and regular .
At that time they ceased , and soon after followed the like Eflux from the Haemorrhoids , which continued till she got on the wrong side of Fourscore .
She was till then healthful and strong , of a vigorous Aspect , smooth , plump , and florid in Countenance , like one not half so Old : Her Appetite was very good ; her Intellects clear and sound ; and her sight so perfect , that she could to the last thread a Needle , and read small Print without Glasses .
When that Flux ceased , she became Gouty ; and about one Year before she died , there arose an Apostumation on one of her Wrists , which opened , and discharged much chalky Matter and some Stones .
The Day she died , she arose out of her Bed ; and after performing some Christian Devotions , expired .
She was never sick before the Hemorrhoidal Flux stopped , except once at Exeter , where she was born , and then lived , she became infected with what they called the Plague : It ended in a critical Abcess in one of the Emunctories ; and which is very strange , during all the time of that Sickness , she nursed a Male Child , who is yet alive , and one of our Faculty ; from whom I have this Relation .
This History will afford occasion to divers Speculations , which I will not attempt to anticipate , but refer them to the Royal Society .
I am , &amp;c. JAMESYONG E.
