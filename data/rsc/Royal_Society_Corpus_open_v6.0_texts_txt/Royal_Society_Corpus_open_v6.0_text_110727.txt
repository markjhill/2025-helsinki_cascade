The principal object of the calculations contained in this paper is to investigate the figure which a fluid , consisting of portions , varying in density according to any given law , would assume , when every particle is acted upon by the attraction of every other , and by a centrifugal force arising from rotatory motion .
That such has been the original condition of the earth has been assumed as the foundation of most of the mathematical calculations connected with this inquiry ; although the hypothesis itself may admit of doubt .
The principal difficulty of this problem consists in the computation of the attraction of a body of any given figure , and composed of strata varying in their densities according to any given law .
In solving it , the author follows the steps of Laplace as far as the point where the equation , known by his name , first appears .
It has , however , since been discovered by Mr. Ivory , that the theorem of Laplace is true only of spheroids of a particular kind , and consequently it is to this kind that Laplace 's solution of the problem isrestricted .
The method given in the present paper is not confined in its operation to any particular class of spheroids ; the coefficients of the series into which the required function is developed being determined absolutely , and without reference to the form of the spheroid to which they are to be applied .
The principal change consists in the different manner of treating the partial differential equation ; and its integration , effected by the author , renders the analysis more direct , the operations more simple , and the theory complete .
