" On the Action of Sulphuric Acid upon Anisic and Salicylic Acids .
" By A. W. HOFMANN , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received June 5 , 1857 .
In a paper read before the Royal Society , we have , Mr. Buckton and myself , directed attention to the general occurrence of the disulpho-acids , of which only few and scattered examples were known at that time .
M. Louis Zervas has since continued the study of this subject in my laboratory , and has arrived at the following results .

Anisic acid , treated with Nordhausen sulphuric acid , at a temperature of 100 % assimilates the elements of 2 equivs. of sulphuric acid , and is converted into a crystalline acid , containing C16 H8 06+ 2IS04= C16 H8 S2 012+ 2aq .
The formula of this acid , which M. Zervas calls sulphanisic acid , was controlled by the analysis of a crystalline lead-salt and a barium compound , which were found to contain respectively Lead-salt ... .
C1 ( H6 Pb2 ) O12 + 2aq .
Barium-salt. .
C16 ( H Ba2 ) 012+ 2aq .
If the mixture of anisic and fuming sulphuric acid be submitted to higher temperatures than that of boiling-water , a lively evolution of carbonic acid takes place , containing , if the temperature be maintained within the proper limits , scarcely a trace of sulphurous acid .
After several hours ' digestion , the solution contains no longer anisic or sulphanisic acid , but a new acid , which has the composition C14 H8 S4 014 .
The formula of this acid , which could not be obtained in a state fit for analysis , was fixed by the analysis of a barium-salt , which was found to contain C14 ( H6 Ba2 ) S4 014+ 2aq .
This acid may be considered as formed by the association of 1 equivalent of anisol ( the product of the action of alkaline earths upon anisic acid at a high temperature ) with 4 equivalents of anhydrous sulphuric acid .
M. Zervas has , in fact , experimentally proved , that his acid may be obtained directly by treating anisol with fuming sulphuric acid , and he accordingly proposes to designate this compound by the name of disulphanisolic acid .
From the preceding experiments it is obvious that the action of sulphuric acid upon organic acids with 6 equivalents of oxygen , is perfectly similar to that which this agent exerts upon acids with 4 equivalents of oxygen .
Acetic acid .
1st Stage. .
C4 40 4+ 2HS04= C44 42 010 + 2HO .
2nd Stage. .
C4 1H4 4+4HS04= C2 H4 S4 012+ 410 + 2CO , .
Anisic acid .
1st Stage C1 Hs O+ 20 HS04= C16 IH S2 012 q+ 2HO .
2nd Stage Clg6 gHs + 4HS04= C14 Hs S4 014+ 4HO + 2C02 .
There can be no doubt that salicylic acid , so closely allied to anisic acid , in fact , its homologue , a step lower in the system , must exhibit a similar deportment .
Mr. Baldwin Duppa has been occupied with this subject in my laboratory , and has already obtained the first term , the sulpho-salicylic acid , C04 6 S2 012 , which forms extremely beautiful compounds .
On submitting salicylic acid to the action of an excess of sulphuric acid , at a temperature of 180 ?
, the same phenomena present themselves which are noticed in the case of salicylic acid , a powerful evolution of carbonic acid ensues , and the solution now contains a new sulphur-acid , which is crystalline .
As yet Mr. Duppa has not succeeded in obtaining this acid in a state of sufficient purity for analysis , but it may be assumed , without much hesitation , that it will be found to be Disulphophenic acid ... . .
