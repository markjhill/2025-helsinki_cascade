188 Note on the Stability of Jacobis Ellipsoid .
By Sir G. H. Darwin , K.C.B. , F.R.S. ( Received February 22 , \#151 ; Read March 11 , 1909 .
) It is known that Maclaurin 's spheroid of rotating liquid becomes unstable when its eccentricity reaches the value sin 54 ' 21 ' 27r/ .
This is a form of bifurcation , and for increasing momentum the stability passes over to Jacobi 's ellipsoid .
It is possible to prove these results by the method applied by me to the discussion of the stability of the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium , * and it is worth while to do so , because we obtain thereby a verification of the complicated analysis used in the previous investigation , and because the series which arise are exactly similar to the former series .
In vol. 3 of my ' Scientific Papers ' I shall give a few details about the present analysis .
It will here suffice to say that it gives the known results correctly , and a good approximation to the form of Jacobi 's ellipsoid .
M. Liapounoff maintains that if , in considering the pear-shaped figure , I had taken more terms into account , the conclusion arrived at would have been reversed .
It is therefore worth while to examine the corresponding series in the present precisely similar problem , in which a few terms are found to give good results .
Although , of course , we cannot thus prove the correctness of my former conclusion , as against M. Liapounoff 's contention , yet I think that this investigation tends to indicate that I was right before .
In the case of Jacobi 's ellipsoid there are two series proceeding pari passed , viz. , those depending on the zonal and on the fourth tesseral harmonics .
The reader is requested to refer to my former papers for the interpretation of the notation .
For these the results are as follows:\#151 ; Zonal Harmonics .

Liapounoff .
It seems to me , then , that this present investigation should lead us to look with doubt on an argument adverse to the former conclusion .
On the Wave-lengths of Lines in the Secondary Spectrum of Hydrogen .
By Herbert Edmeston Watson , B.Sc. ( Lond. ) .
( Communicated by Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received February 12 , \#151 ; Read March 11 , 1909 .
) The spectrum of hydrogen is one which has engaged the attention of numerous observers from the year 1851 onwards .
Historically it is of great interest , firstly owing to the part it played in the controversy between o # Angstrom and Wullner on the plurality of spectra , and secondly , because it was the first spectrum in which a relation between the wave-lengths of the lines composing it was discovered .
It is not proposed to discuss the origin of the two hydrogen spectra in this communication , as it has recently been done in a very complete manner by Dufour ; j* the main points at issue , however , may perhaps be briefly stated .
Wtillner , ^ ; who was the first to make detailed observations of the spectra of hydrogerf under different conditions , described three spectra .
The first consisted of three bright lines , the second of a number of bands , and the third of several bright lines mostly in the green .
This was disputed by * The absolute magnitudes of the numbers in the series compared are very different , but this merely depends on the definitions chosen for the several harmonic functions .
