" Rectification of Logarithmic Errors in the Measurements of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India .
" In a Letter to Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. By Colonel EVEREST , F.R.S. Received December 22 , 1858 .
It will be in your recollection , that some years ago , at the request of the Court of Directors of the East India Company , I compiled from the General Report of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , a work entitled " An Account of the Measurement of two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India , " executed by myself and my assistants , an impression of which ( printed in 1847 ) was presented to the Royal Society .
In reference to the work in question , I now have to mention that in the computation of the meridional triangles ( vide pp. 240 to 248 ) there have been some errors committed in taking out the logarithms of the twelfth triangle ( p. 241 ) and the twentieth triangle ( p. 243 ) ; and as from the nature of that series , the purpose of which is to project the sides of the principal triangles on the meridian , any such error must run through all the computations subsequent to it , I have had the whole series recomputed , and now forward for submission to the Royal Society , a sheet containing a revised synopsis ( vide p. 248 ) , such as it would have been , but for the errors adverted to , to which it is my wish that the utmost publicity should be given .
I must here say , that I owe the detection and correction of the said errors entirely to the industry of Colonel Waugh , F.R.S. , and the able computing establishment at his disposal ; for myself it remains only to urge , that though mistakes of this nature are not creditable , but , on the contrary , much to be regretted , yet it is all but impossible for the chief of two departments , that of Surveyor-General of India , and that of Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , each involving a vast array of business peculiar to itself , to enter into all the minutiae of computation ; I took the precaution to have every portion of the work gone over by two computers acting independently , and it is singular that both should have fallen into the same errors .
As the existence of these errors , in the instance of the northern of the two sections or series A , would naturally lead to the supposition that like errors might lurk in series B ( pp. 46 to 53 ) , an equally rigorous recomputation has been kindly instituted by Colonel Waugh in the latter case ; and as no mistake is found therein , the synopsis B ( p. 53 ) will need no alteration on that account .
I have now to advert to another subject , also relating to the work in question .
In trigonometrical operations , I need hardly mention that the absolute lengths of all linear quantities depend on those of the measured bases reduced to their equivalents at the level of the sea , the reduction on which account may be expressed by , where RB is the measured base , h its mean height above the sea , and R the radius of curvature : now as we do not know a priori the value of A , unless the measurements be actually made on the sea-shore , the only mode of commencing the work of computation is to assume the nearest value we are in possession of , and when the operations are connected with the sea-coasts , to apply a correction for any excess or defect of our assumption .
Damargida , the southernmost point included in my book of 1847 , is an inland station , the height of which is given in the general report of my predecessor , Colonel Lambton , at 2026 feet ; and as all the triangulation to the south of that station had been concluded in 1815 , nearly four years before I joined the department , I had no choice but to refer to that as one of my established data : my computations start from the Sironj base , and on reaching Damargida it appeared that the assumed value of h , which I had used in correcting that base line , was 24 5 feet in excess of what it ought to have been , for which the correction is applied of 2'578 feet to the linear value of the terrestrial arc in synopsis B , and 2-295 in synopsis A. Colonel Lambton 's operations , from which the height of Damargida station is determined , abut on the sea-coast at three different points , viz. Madras on the east coast , Mangalore on the west coast , and Cape Comorin on the southernmost extremity of the Peninsula , and the results thence derived were at that time the most trustworthy data I had access to .
Subsequent to the completion of my computations , the western longitudinal series which connects Damargida with the sea-coast near Bombay , was finished by Captain Jacob , then one of my assistants , and there is a note on that subject at page clxxi .
of my book of 1847 , which is , I presume , quite sufficient to prepare any geodist for the probability of a future correction being needed : as to Captain Jacob 's performance , I may distinctly state that I place the greatest confidence in its accuracy , for he was furnished with an excellent altitude and azimuth instrument by Dollond , which had a good vertical circle , and he was not only a highly-talented mathematician , but a most careful and skilful observer .
Since I left India , in December 1843 , the trigonometrical operations have abutted on the sea-coast at two other places , viz. at Calcutta , by the completion of my north-east longitudinal series , and at Karachi , by Colonel Waugh 's western longitudinal series ; so that now there are several additional data relative to the numerical value of Ih , which it becomes necessary to take into consideration in the determination of the proper corrections to be applied to the measured bases , and the lengths of my two terrestrial arcs , as given in synopses B and A. I have for some time been in correspondence with Colonel Waugh on this subject , and in due time hope to be able to communicate what final conclusion we arrived at ; but , in the meanwhile , as it may be interesting to the Fellows of the Royal Society to know the provisional state of the question , I here subjoin some extracts of his last received communication .
" By the completion of the Calcutta meridional series , as well as the north-east longitudinal series , we obtain a continued chain of triangulation , extending from the sea-level near Calcutta along the Calcutta meridian to the Sonakoda base , thence along the northeast longitudinal series to Dehra Dun , thence down the great arc , and along the Bombay longitudinal series to the sea-level at Bombay .
The result of trigonometrical levelling along this course of 2127 miles , comprising 1171 miles of hills , and 956 miles of plains , becomes verified ; the discrepancy in height being 6 76 feet or 0'003 foot per mile .
" By the completion of the great longitudinal series , we get another continuous chain of triangulation from the sea-level near Calcutta to the same level at Karachi .
This chain embraces the Calcutta meridional series , the north-east longitudinal series , the northern section of the great arc from Debra Dun to Sironj , and the great longitudinal series from Sironj to Karachi .
This series is 2082 miles in length , comprising 1041 miles of plains , ald 1041 miles of hills , and the error by trigonometrical levelling is 16'50 feet , or 0-008 foot per mile .
" When the great Indus series is finished , the sea-level will be brought up to the Chueh base line , and from thence along the northwest Himalayan series to Dehra Dun .
The result of this series will give another verification , which will be especially valuable , as it is intended to level along the flat valley of the Indus by special levelling operations .
It is also proposed to carry special levelling operations from Dehra Dun to Calcutta .
Pending the completion of these undertakings , it has been found necessary to correct provisionally the results given by trigonometrical levelling , in order to disperse the discrepancies above shown , and reduce the results of the three data for sea-level near Calcutta , Bombay , and Karachi .
The results , so reduced , become comparative , inter se , and are required for record on the general maps .
" The upshot of all this is , that Colonel Waugh has provisionally applied the following corrections to the two sections of the great arc , as given in synopsis A , p. 248 , and synopsis B , p. 53 , of my book of 1847 , in lieu of those formerly applied ; and I must say that I think they will be nearer the truth than those given in that book , because the discrepancy specified in the note at the foot of p. clxxi .
, taken into combination with all the results of the general trigonometrical survey since obtained , certainly point to some error in Colonel Lambton 's operations to the south of Damargida .
The two sections , applying Colonel Waugh 's corrections , will stand as follows : SECTION A. Feet .

IIt l I must call attention to the fact , that all the remarks of Colonel Waugh have reference to the operations carried on since 1832 by me , himself , and our assistants , and are quite disconnected from Colonel Lambton 's results to the south of Damargida , which were deduced in the early part of 1815 .
Now , as the two sets of operations unite at Damargida , it would be illogical to correct the southern portion of the Indian arc by one value of h , and the northern portion by another value of h ; for , manifestly , no spot on the earth 's surface can have two distinct heights above the sea differing from each other by 100 feet or so at the same instant .
It is rather a delicate matter for me to speak in terms of comment of the labours of my predecessor , and I had much rather that anybody else should undertake the invidious task ; but thus much is very certain , that the instruments employed prior to 1832 , were not such as we should use with confidence now-a-days , whilst those in use since that period are certainly not surpassed by any in existence .
In 1842 I was sensibly alive to the probable inaccuracy of the operations between Damargida and Cape Comorin , and , as the only effectual remedy , proposed to the Government of India to revise that work with the new instruments ; but the proposal was rejected ; so that instead of forming , as it would and ought to have done , one unbroken series from Cape Comorin to the Himalayan Mountains , the great arc of India now consists of two distinct patches ; one to the south of Damargida for ever uncertain as to its unit of measure , and executed with instruments which we should now pronounce to be crazy and unserviceable ; whilst the other to the north depends on a unit tolerably well defined , and was performed with instruments as perfect as can be desired .
Of course , it is not for me to offer any remarks about the propriety of the decision of the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India in Council , and the Court of Directors of the East India Company , of those days , in a communication of this nature , except that , as far as science is concerned , perhaps it will now and hereafter be lamented that all my arguments for a revision were urged in vain .
It will appear , from what I have above stated , that the question of the amount of correction to be applied to my two sections A and B , is not yet finally settled , and is still uncertain to the extent of about 10 feet ; for which reason I have employed in the synopsis A , now forwarded , the same values as before , correcting only the obvious errors to which I have drawn attention in the second paragraph of this letter ; at the same time I have endeavoured to put within the reach of those who interest themselves in the problem of the figure of our planet , all the data at my command , and if any fresh light should hereafter be thrown on the subject , shall be very happy to communicate it .
GEORGE EVEREST .
