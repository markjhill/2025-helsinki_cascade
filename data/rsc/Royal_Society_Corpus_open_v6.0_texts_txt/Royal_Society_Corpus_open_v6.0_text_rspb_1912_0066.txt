) Penfold has shown ( 1 ) that when Bacillus coli communis ( Escherich ) is plated out on nutrient agar containing 0'5 per cent , sodium chloroacetate , a large number of small colonies and a few large ones are produced .
The cultures obtained from some , but not all , of the large colonies were found to have lost the power of producing gas from glucose when grown in glucose peptone water in a test tube provided with a Durham gas tube .
Under the same conditions these same organisms still produced gas from mannitol , but in diminished proportion .
Several other intestinal organisms have since been found by Harden to behave in a similar manner on chloroacetate agar , whereas ft lactis aerogenes , which produces a different type of decompos ^ sugar , has hitherto proved resistant to this method of selection .
^ to ascertain what other modification the chemical action of th ^ , strain had undergone , comparative quantitative experiments 'ut with the original and the selected organisms .

Chemical Action on [ May 18 , The medium employed in both cases contained 10 grm. peptone and 20 grm. glucose per litre , 10 grm. of chalk being added per litre : The flasks were connected with the gas-collecting apparatus described by Harden , Thompson , and Young ( 2 ) , and the air of the flask replaced by nitrogen before incubation .
The estimations were made as previously described ( 3 ) .
The results of two such experiments are given in the table on p. 415 , the products being expressed both in percentage of the sugar used and as the number of carbon atoms of the glucose molecule to which they correspond .
These results must be regarded as preliminary , but are of sufficient interest to justify some remark at the present stage of the work .
In the first place , it is to be noted that , although the selected organism gave no gas at all when tested by the Durham tube method , it yielded about 12'6 c.c. of hydrogen per gramme of sugar when grown anaerobically in presence of chalk as against 80 6 given by the original organism .
Similarly the amount of gaseous COs formed from the sugar was found to be 10'3 c.c. per gramme , but as this number is the difference of two large volumes ( the total gaseous CO2 -I- CO2 dissolved in the medium*\#151 ; CO2 liberated by the acids formed ) no great accuracy attaches to it .
The reason of this different behaviour is not understood and is at present being investigated .
Apart from this , an examination of the results shows that the main difference between the actions of the two bacteria is to be found in the increased proportion of lactic acid , and the correspondingly diminished proportion of the other products , formed by the selected organism .
Harden ( 3 ) has previously shown that the action of organisms closely allied to B. coli communis is roughly represented by the equation ( X ) 2C6Hi206 + H2O = 2C3H0O3 C2H0O + C2H4O2+2CO2 + 2H2\gt ; which requires the proportions of products shown in the last column of the table .
Actually there is always less CO2 than this produced , and with the strain of normal B. coli communis here employed there is also somewhat more alcohol and acetic acid and less lactic acid formed .
The relations between the products of the selected organism appear , however , to be quite incompatible with this equation .
The explanation which suggests itself is that the products observed as the result of action of the normal organism are formed by three independent enzymes .
One of these converts sugar into lactic acid : ( 2 ) C6H1206 = 2C3H603 .
The other probably produces alcohol , acetic acid , and formic acid , and the last of these is in all probability decomposed by a third enzyme into carbon dioxide and hydrogen : 1912 .
] Glucose of Bacillus coli communis ( JEscherich)417 ( 3 ) C6Hi30\#171 ; + H30 = C3H403+C3H60 + 2HC03H \#151 ; C3H403+C3H60 + 2C03+2H3 .
These enzymes may occur in different proportions in different individual organisms , and the process of selection would then result in the survival of an organism containing a large proportion of the lactic acid enzyme and a small proportion of that producing alcohol , acetic acid , and formic acid .
It may be noted that the selected organism still retains the power of decomposing formic acid into C03 and H3 , and , moreover , its products do not contain more of this acid than those of the normal bacillus .
The absence of gas formation , therefore , is not due to an accumulation of formic acid .
It is thus seen that the change produced in the organism does not really cause its chemical action to approximate to that of , an organism which also yields no gas , but differs from B. coli by producing a large amount of formic acid .
The foregoing numbers are not sufficiently accurate to decide with certainty whether the relative proportions of alcohol , acetic acid , and formic acid produced by the selected organism are the same as those formed by the original bacillus .
Taking the alcohol as standard , the carbon as formic acid ( including gaseous C03 ) should be 0*27 , instead of 0'22 observed , and that as acetic acid 041 instead of 06 .
The deviation in the last case may be due to the difficulty of effecting the quantitative separation of acetic acid from a large proportion of lactic acid .
Further experiments may be expected to throw light on these points .
If , however , the foregoing explanation be found correct , the study of the chemical action of these selected organisms should form a valuable means of investigation into the nature of the various processes of fermentation effected by bacteria , and the subject is being prosecuted from this point \#166 ; of view .
