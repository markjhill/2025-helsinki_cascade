( Abstract .
) In order to investigate the question of the variation of the specific heat of carbon dioxide with temperature , a steam calorimeter was constructed having double walls of thin brass , between which the vapour of a liquid boiling under atmospheric pressure could be circulated .
The vessels used in the experiments were hung in the closed inner chamber .
Into this chamber steam could be admitted after the temperature had become stationary and the same as that of the jacketting vapour .
In this way the initial temperature could be varied .
Experiments at various densities and over four intervals of temperature were carried out .
The densities chosen were 00456 ; 0'0800 ; 01240 ; 0T800 , and 0T973 .
The intervals of temperature over which the gas at each density was investigated were : air temperature to 100 ' ; 35 ' C. ( boiling point of ether ) to 100 ' ; 56 ' ( boiling point of acetone ) to 100 ' , and 78 ' ( boiling point of ethyl alcohol ) to 100 ' .
The results are plotted on 5 equi-density lines , and it was found most intelligible to plot the precipitation due to the calorific capacity of the gas between tiand 100 ' against the initial temperature ti in each case .
If the initial temperatures are measured as abscissae , starting from 0 ' C. at the origin , and the precipitations are set off as ordinates , the 5 equi-density lines so determined slope downwards to the right ( the slope increasing with the density ) , passing , necessarily , through the point 100 ' C. on the axis of temperature in each case .
If the specific heat is invariable these are right lines .
This proves to be sensibly the case for the lines = 00456 and p \#151 ; 00800 ; those of lowest density .
The next line , 0T24 , is nearly rectilinear over the higher ranges , but pursued from right to left it rises markedly at the lower temperatures ; thus indicating that the specific heat at constant volume falls in value with increasing temperature .
The line p = 0T8G0 and the one close above it , p \#151 ; 0T973 , show this variation very markedly .
Their variation below the critical temperature is complicated by the presence of liquid .
The following table contains the principal results .

C = 0*00000182 .
Theoretical considerations led Rankine and others to predict a decrement of the specific heat of a gas at constant volume with rise of temperature .
The characteristic-equation of carbon dioxide does not seem to have been given as yet in a satisfactory form for application to the higher pressures .
Probably on this account only an approximate agreement is found to exist between the numerical amount of the decrement predicted and that observed experimentally at the higher densities .
At the lower densities the sensible absence of variation with tempex-ature over the range of the observations is in perfect agreement with the theoretical numbers .
