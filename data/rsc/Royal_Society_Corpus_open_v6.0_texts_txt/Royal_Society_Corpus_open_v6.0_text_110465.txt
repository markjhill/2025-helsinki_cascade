The following papers were read : " Discussion of Tide-Observations made at Liverpool.** By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treas .
R.S. The author has here presented to the Society , bypermission of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , a discussion by M. Dessiou of about 14,000 tide-observations made at Liverpool , on the plan similar to that adopted with regard to the London Dock observations , The first book contains the moon 's transits , , classified with the moon 's parallax and declination , together with the date and corresponding time and height of high water ; the height of the barometer is also added to the observations of about four years .
The second book contains the same quantities , classified further according to the different calendar months , and for each minute of the moon 's horizontal parallax .
The third book contains a similar classification for the moon 's declination .
The average results are given in tables at the end .
Some remarks are subjoined on the registers of the observations taken at the London and St. Katherine 's Docks ; from which it appears that the tide is about five minutes earlier in the former than in the latter of these two places 3 and that the difference in height is about five feet .
