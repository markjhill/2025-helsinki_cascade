By Professor CAYLEY , F.RIS .
Received May 30 , -Read June 18 , 1868 .
THE present Memoir is supplementary to my " Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces , otherwise Scrolls , " Phil. Trans. vol. cliv .
( 1864 ) , pp. 559-577 , and relates also to the theory of skew surfaces of the fourth order , or quartic scrolls .
It was pointed out to me by Herr SCHWARZ , in a letter dated Halle , June 1 , 1867 , that in the enumeration contained in my Second Memoir I have given only a particular case of the quartic scrolls which have a directrix skew cubic ; viz. my eighth species , S(1 , 32 ) , where there is also a directrix line .
And this led me to observe that I had in like manner mentioned only a particular case of the quartic scrolls with a triple directrix line ; viz. my third species , S(13 , 1 , 4 ) , where there is also a simple directrix line .
The omitted species , say , ninth species , S(13 ) , with a triple directrix line , and tenth species , S(32 ) , with a directrix skew cubic , are considered in the present Memoir ; and in reference to them I develope a theory of the reciprocal relations of these scrolls , which has some very interesting analytical features .
The paragraphs of the present Memoir are numbered consecutively with those of my Second Memoir above referred to .
Quartic Scroll , Ninth Species , S(13 ) , 5with a triple directrix line .
54 .
Consider a line the intersection of two planes , and let the equation of the one plane contain in the order 3 , that of the second plane contain linearly , a variable parameter 0 ; the equations of the two planes may be taken to be ( p , I , r , s~Cd , 1)3= 05 ( to , V3j@ 1)=05 where ( p , q , r , s , u , v ) are any linear functions whatever of the coordinates ( x , y , z , w ) .
Hence eliminating 0 we have as the equation of the scroll generated by the line in question ( p , q , r , sjiv , U)3=0 , viz. this is a quartic scroll having the line u0 , v0 for a triple line ; that is , the line in question is a triple directrix line .
55 .
Taking x=0 , Y=0 for the equations of the directrix line , or writing u= x , vi , and moreover expressing ( p , q , r , s ) as linear functions of the coordinates ( x , Yy , z , w ) , the equation of the scroll takes the form ( *CX..y)1+ ( *3X1 i.Ye )3 W(13X ^ , ,y 43= 0 .
and we may , by changing the values of z and w , make the term in ( x , y ) to be ( *X , y')4+ ( 0X+f3py)(*)X , y)3+(rx+ #)(*'(X , y)3 , where the arbitrary constants a , j3 , y , z may be so determined as to reduce this to a monomial kx4 , kx3y , or kx2y2 .
56 .
The coefficient k may vanish , and the equation of the scroll then is Z(:(X$ , y)3+W(*1tX$ , y)3= 0 , or , what is the same thing , it is ( *3XIX y)3(zj w)=01 viz. the scroll has in this particular case the simple directrix line z=O , w=0 , thus reducing itself to the third species , S(1 , 1 , 4 ) , with a triple directrix line and a single directrix line .
It is proper to exclude this , and consider the ninth species , S(13 ) , as having a triple directrix line , but no simple directrix line .
57 .
The scroll S(13 ) may be considered as a scroll S(m , n , p ) generated by a line which meets each of three given directrices ; viz. these may be taken to be the directrix line , and any two plane sections of the scroll .
The section by any plane is a quartic curve having a triple point at the intersection with the directrix line ; moreover the sections by any two planes meet in four points the intersections of the scroll by the line of intersection of the two planes .
Conversely , taking any line and two quartics related as above ( that is , each quartic has a triple point at its intersection with the line , and the two quartics meet in four points lying in a line ) , the lines which meet the three curves generate a quartic scroll S(13 ) .
This appears from the formula S(m , n , _p)-2qnnp-xrmn-n-yp ( Second Memoir , No. 5 ) ; we have in the present case m=1 n4 , p=4 , M=4 , f3=3 , r==3 , and the order of the scroll is 32412 -12 , -4 , that is , the scroll is a quartic scroll ; there is no difficulty in seeing that through each point of the line there pass three generating lines , but through each point of either of the plane quartics only a single generating line ; that is , that the line is a triple directrix line , but each of the plane quartics a simple directrix curve .
58 .
We may instead of the section by any plane , consider the section by a plane through a generating line , or by a plane through two of the three generating lines which meet at any point of the directrix line ; if ( to consider only the most simple case ) each of the planes be thus a plane through two generating lines , the section by either of these planes is made up of the two generating lines , and of a conic passing through the directrix line ; the directrices are thus the line and two conics each of them meeting the line ; we have therefore in the foregoing formula rnI , n=2 , p=2 , o=O , f=1 , y-1l and the order of the scroll is 8-2-2 , 4 as before .
Quartic Scroll , Tenth Species , ( 32 ) , with a directrix skew cubic met twice by each generating line* .
59 .
Consider a line the intersection of two planes ; and let the equation of each plane contain in the order 2a variable parameter 0 ; the equations of the two planes may be taken to be ( _p , A , r](0 , 1)1=0 , ( _p ' , A ' , ~r'j , 1)2-0 , where ( p , q , r , P ' , I ' , r ' ) are linear functions of the coordinates ( x , y , z , w ) ; hence eliminating 0 , we have as the equation of the scroll generated by the line in question , O =0 , where C is the resultant of the two quadric functions .
The equation may be written 4(_pj'-p'q)(rqr'q ) ( pr ' -p'r)2= 0 ; and the scroll has thus as a nodal ( double ) line the skew cubic determined by the equations , q , r 1=0 .
pS t , r It is easy to see ( and indeed it will be shown presently ) that this curve is met twice by each generating line of the scroll , and that the scroll is consequently a quartic scroll as described above .
60 .
The coordinates ( x , y , z , w ) may be fixed in such manner that the equations of the skew cubic shall be x , y , z =0 , y , Y , zw or , what is the same thing , yw-z =0 , Zy-xW=0Xz-y2=0 ; each of the equations pg-_p'i 0 , rq'-rrq= 0 , pr'-p'r= O is then the equation of a quadric surface passing through the skew cubic , or , what is the same thing , each of the functions p/ f-p'q , rg -r'q , pr ' -p'r is a linear function of yw-z2 , zy-xw , xz-y2 ; and the equation of the scroll is given as a quadric equation in the last-mentioned quantities .
It will be convenient to represent the equation in the form ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -G3yw--z2 , zy-xw , xz-y2)2=O , or , writing for shortness yW-z2 , zy-xw , xz-y 2=p , By r , which letters ( p , q , r ) are used henceforward in this signification only , the equation will be ( II , F , C , B , A-F , -Gyp , q , r)2-0 viz , this is a quadric equation in ( p , q , r ) , with arbitrary coefficients .
61 .
Comparing with the result , Second Memoir , Nos. 47 to 50 , we see that in the particular case where the coefficients ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) satisfy the relation AF+BG+CH=0 , we have the eighth species , ( 1 , 32 ) , with a directrix line and a directrix skew cubic met twice by each generating line .
We exclude this particular case , and in the tenth species consider the relation AF+BG+CH=0 as not satisfied , and therefore the scroll as not having a directrix line .
62 .
I consider how the scroll may be obtained as a scroll S(m2 , n ) generated by a line meeting a curve of the order m twice and a curve of the order ns once .
The first curve will be the skew cubic that is m= 3 ; the second curve may be any plane section of the scroll ; such a section will be a quartic curve having three nodes , one at each intersection of its plane with the skew cubic .
Conversely , if we have a skew cubic , and a plane quartic meeting the skew cubic in three points , each of them a node on the quartic , then the scroll generated by the lines which meet the skew cubic twice and the quartic once will be a quartic scroll .
In fact ( see First Memoir , No. 10 , and Second Memoir , No. 5 ) the order of the scroll is given by the formula S(Qn2 , n)n([m]2+M)-reduction , =16-reduction .
And in the present case the reduction arises ( Second Memoir , No. 4 ) from the cones having their vertices , at the intersections of the skew cubic and the quartic , and passing through the skew cubic .
Each cone is of the order 2 , and.each intersection guab double point on the quartic gives a reduction 2x order of cone , =s4 ; that is , the reduction arising from the three intersections is = 12 ; or the order of the scroll isl6 -12 , =4 .
63 .
We may , instead of the section by a plane in general , consider the section by a plane through a generating line ; the section is here made up of the generating line and of a plane cubic passing through each of the two points of intersection of the generating line with the skew cubic , and having a node at the remaining intersection of its plane with the skew cubic .
Or we may consider the section by a plane through the two generating lines at any point of the skew cubic ; the section is here made up of the two generating lines and of a conic passing through the second intersections of the two generating lines with the skew cubic ; that is , meeting the skew cubic twice .
64 .
Conversely , consider a skew cubic , and a conic meeting it twice .
; the lines which meet the skew cubic twice , and also the conic , generate a quartic scroll ; this appears by the before-mentioned formula S(qn2 n)=n([M]2+ M)-reduction ; viz. we have m= 3 , n =2 , and the order is =8-reduction ; the reduction arises from the cones having their vertices at the intersections of the skew cubic and the conic .
Each cone is of the order 2 , and ( qua simple point on the conic ) each intersection gives a reduction=order of the cone ; that is , the total reduction is =4 , and the order of the scroll is 8-4 , =4 as above .
65 .
But a more elegant mode of generation of the scroll may be obtained by means of the skew cubic alone ; viz , considering the system oflines which are in invol1ution with five given lines , or say simply the lines which belong to an involution* , I say that the locus of a line belonging to the involution , and meeting the skew cubic twice is the quartic scroll , tenth species , S(32 ) .
In the particular case where the line ( instead of belonging to a proper involution ) meets a given line , the locus is a quartic scroll , eighth species , S(1 , 32 ) .
66 .
The analysis is almost identical with that given ( Second Memoir , Nos. 47 to 50 ) in regard to the scroll S(1 , 32 ) Considering a line defined by its " ; six coordinates " ( a , b , c , J g , h ) , the condition which expresses that the line shall belong to an involution is ( A , B , C , F , G , H)(a , b , cf , g , h)=0 where ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) are arbitrary coefficients ; if they are the coordinates of a line , that is , if AF+BG+CJI=O , then the condition expresses that the line ( a , b , cf , g , h ) , instead of belonging to a proper involution , meets the line ( F , G , H , A , B , C ) .
We have to determine the locus of the line ( a , b , c , g , h ) the coordinates whereof satisfy the relation ( A , B , C , F , G , Hla , b , cJ ; g , h)= 0 , and which besides meets the skew cubic yw-z2=O , yz-xw=0 , az-yl2:=O .
The equations of the skew cubic are satisfied by writing therein x~y : z : w=1 : t : t2 : t3 ; and hence taking 0 , 9 for the parameters of the points of intersection of the line ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) with the skew cubic , we have : -1 , 0 , 02 , 03 l P , P2 p3 as the coordinates of two points on the line in question ; whence forming the expressions of the six coordinates of the line , and omitting the common factor p-0 , these are ( a , b , cf g , h)=09 , -(0+9 ) , 1 , 02 0+ '2 9(0+9 ) , 0292 , and hence the condition of involution gives between the parameters 0 , 9 pthe equation ; ( A , B , C , F , G , HXn0 , -.0-95 , 1 , 02+09+92 0P % ( 0+p ) , d2092 ) .
Moreover the coordinates of any point on the line in question are given by X y : Z : w l+m : d+MAP : 102+m'p2 1 : +mp and writing as above _ , r-yw-z2 , yz-xw , xz-y2 , we thence find , omitting the common factor ( 0)2 , : ~r=O@ : -(O+@ ) : 1 , and eliminating Op , O+p , we at once obtain ( A , B , C , F , G , Htpr , qr , r2 , , g22-pr , Eg , r2Y or , what is the same thing , ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -GyCp , , r)2=0 as the equation of the scroll generated by the line in involution which meets the given skew cubic twice .

1 propose to reciprocate in regard to the quadric surface a9+y2+z2 +t2=0 the foregoing scroll ( III F , C , B , A-F,.-Gi , q , r)2= 0 .
If the coordinates ( a , 6 , c , f , g , h ) of a line satisfy the condition of involution ( A , B , C , F , G , H1a , b , cof g , hA)=0 , then the coordinates ( a , b , c ) f , g , A ) of the reciprocal curve will satisfy the condition of involution ( E , G. H A , Be Clta , b , c~f y , A)=0 .
The reciprocal of the before-mentioned skew cubic x. z : w '=1 : t : t2 : t3 is the quartic torse having for its edge of regression the skew cubic 3XZ -Y2=0 , YZ9XW=0 , 3YWZ2=0 ; or , what is the same thing , the skew cubic X : Y : Z : Wz-1 : 3t : 3t2 : t3 ; see my paper " 6 On the Reciprocation of a Quartic Developable , " Quart .
Math. Journ. t. vii .
( 1866 ) pp. 87-92 .
68 .
Hence the reciprocal of the quartic scroll is the scroll generated by a line ( a , b , c , f , g , A ) the coordinates of which satisfy the condition of involution ( F , G , H , A , B , Cja , b , cof , g , l)=0 , and which is moreover the intersection of two osculating planes of the skew cubic X : Y : Z : W 1 : 3t : 3t2 : t3 .
For the point the parameter whereof is t , the equation of the osculating plane is XI Y. Z XW =0 , 1 , 3t , 3t2 , t3 1 , 2t , t2 1t2 or , what is the same thing , the equation is ( t3 , --2 t , t )-l)X , Y , Z , W)=0 Hence for the line which is the intersection of the two osculating planes ( &amp; 5 -02 , 0 , -_13X , YZ5W)O .
( 3 1p2@ _X~ Y. Z. W)=05 forming the expressions of the six coordinates , but omitting the common factor p-O , these are a b , g , h=02+p+p2 , -_0p 1 , Op , Op(d+p ) , O2m ; we have thus between the parameters 0 , ( the relation ( F , G , H , A , B , C3(02+Op+ ?
p2 _0-p , 1 , fli Op(O+p ) , 022)=0 and the equation of the scroll is obtained by eliminating 0 , 4 between this equation and the last-mentioned two equations satisfied by 0 , q respectively .
69 .
We see that 0 , $ are two of the roots of the equation ( X , -_Y .
Z.-_Way , 1)3=0 ; let g be the third root , then we have YzW and thence 0+P=X(Y-eX ) , 0P=X(Z_9Y+eX ) KW ) ( X , Y Z.-Wjag , 1)3 -0 .
Substituting for 0+@ and Op their values in terms of 9 , we find Fgf{Y2 ZX-XY } GgX(Y--gX)+HgX2 +W{(AX+BY+CZ)-~(BX+CY)-+K2CX } =O , or , what is the same thing , g2X(GX-FY+ CW).g{F(Y2-ZX)-GXY+HX2-BXW-CYW } +W(AX+BY+CZ)=O ; from which and the equation ( wheoYl Z.-nWtg , 1)e we have to eliminate ? .

I take any one of these equations , for instance the equation rq( r ) ' or , what is the same thing , qrZ-r2Y+ ( pr-q2)W0 , and I proceed to redtce it so as to obtain the result in a symmetrical form .
For this purpose : I observe that from the values of a , [ 3 , y , 8 , if only AF+BG+CH 0 , we have X : Y7 Z : W= ( wC , B. , -F-aj PI y)5:( C , .

JBqr+ Cr2 +F(q2 _pr)-Gpq+ lp2= 0 , or , what is the same thing , it is ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -Gyp , q , r)2=0 , where I recall that we have p , q , r=IQ -r S , P3.- .

It thus appears that when AF+BG+CCII is not =0 , the reciprocal of the scroll ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -Gyp , q , r)2=0 has an equation of the very same form , ( HI F , C , B , A-F , -Gyp , q , r)2=0 ; . .

I. ) so that in fact the scroll , tenth species , S(32 ) , defined as the scroll generated by a line in involution which passes through two points of a skew cubic , may be reciprocally defined as the scroll generated by a line in involution which lies in two osculating planes of a skew cubic .
73 .
If for ( a( , j , , ) we substitute their values in terms of ( X , Y , Z. W ) , the foregoing equation of the reciprocal scroll is obtained as an equation of the fourth order in the coordinates ( X , Y , Z , W ) , and ( in the first instance ) of the fifth degree in the coefficients ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) .
It is a remarkable circumstance that the whole equation contains the constant factor AF+BG+CIH , so that throwing this out , the reduced equation will be only of the third degree in the coefficients .
74 .
The transformation is a very troublesome one , but I will indicate the steps by which I succeeded in accomplishing it .
Each of the functions ( p , q , r ) is a quadric function of ( X , Y , Z , W ) , say , p=(a , b , c , d g , A 1 , M , n)(X , Y , Z , W)2 , r =(dc,. .

In the case above considered of the tenth species , S(32 ) , for which AF+BG+CH =1=0 , the three forms of the reciprocal equation are of course absolutely equivalent to each other .
The first form has the advantage of putting in evidence the fact that the reciprocal scroll is also of the tenth species ; the other two forms do not , at least obviously , put in evidence any special property of the reciprocal scroll .
Reciprocals of Eighth Species , S(1 , 32 ) , and Ninth Species , S(13 ) .

If AF+BG+CH=0 , then the equation ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -G-p , q , r)2=O is a scroll of the eighth species , S(1 , 34 ) .
The first form of the reciprocal equation becomes identically 0=0 , on account of the evanescent factor AF+BG+CH , but the second and third forms continue to subsist , and either of them may be taken as the equation of the reciprocal scroll .
Taking the third form , and calling to mind the significations of ( a , y , r ) , viz. 1 ( r -1 V-ky=( G , s=(-A , H , -G , AIX , Y , Z , W ) , .

) , ,123 I it is to be observed that ao=0 , =0 , 7y=0 , o=0 are the equations of four planes passing through a common line , viz. the line whose coordinates are ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) , and the equation thus puts in evidence that this line is a triple line on the reciprocal scroll ; that is , the reciprocal scroll is a scroll of the ninth species , 8(13 ) .
Or stating the theorem more completely : For the scroll , eighth species , S(1 , 32 ) , ( H , F , C , B , A--F , -Gyp , q , r)'=0 , generated by a line meeting the line ( F , G , I , A , B , C ) , and the skew cubic p=0 , q= 0 , r=0 twice , the reciprocal scroll is of the ninth species , S(13 ) , X ( a2 + 3C , y2s3 ) +Y ( -a_ +2ay ' 3y ) +Z ( cay-28 + Py2 ) +W( as -3p3y+2y3 ) , having for its triple line the reciprocal line ( A , B , C , F , G , H ) .

It should of course be possible , starting from the equation ( *jX , Y)4+Z(*X , Y)3+W(*'IX , Y)3=0 of a scroll S(13 ) , to obtain the equation of the reciprocal scroll S(1 , 32 ) .
But I content myself with a very particular case .
I consider the equation Y2Z -y3WZ3X= 0 , which belongs to a scroll S(1P ) having the line Y=0 , Z=O0 for its triple line .
To find the equation of the reciprocal scroll , write -Z+ , X= x-0 , 2YZ2-3Y2W -y =0 , 2Y2Z3Z2X+-zX=0 , -Y3 +w , we find without difficulty , reducing by means of the equation of the scroll , 2(w_z2 )= _ 32 { Y4 + 3XZ(XZ Y2 ) } , 2(xwyz)= 3Y2Z2{YZ-3WX } , 2(Xz y2 ) _3Ya{Z4+ 3YW(YW-Z_2 ) } .
Hence writing for a moment Q= { Y4 3XZ(XZY ) } { Z4+ 3YW(YWZ2 ) } YZ .
( YZ3WX)2 , we have YZ4+ 3Y5W(YW -2 ) + 3ZX(X2 ) +9 XYZW(Y-Z YW Z +XYZYW -Y4Z4+6Y3Z3PW_9Y22X2W2 , that is , UQ= YsW(YWZ ) +X6X(XZ-Y2 ) +2Y3Z3XW = -Y2Z2(XZ 2)(YW-Z2 ) --Y2Z2(YW--Z2)(XZ -Y2)+ 2Y3Z3XW =2Y2Z2{ ( XZ Y)(YWZ ) -XYZW } -= 2Y2Z2{Y2Z-YW--Z3X } =0 , by the equation of the scroll ; and we thus see that the equation of the reciprocal scroll is ( yw )( y2 ( yzW ) = 0 , or say q2--pr=0 , viz. it is a scroll S(1 , 32 ) generated by a line meeting the line = 0 , w=O , and the cubic curve p-O , q=O , r=0 twice .
The equation is obviously included in the general equation ( H , F , C , B , A-F , -Gp , q , r)2q 0 , where AF+BG+ CH=O ; viz.writing A=B=C=G=H=O , this becomes F(q2-pr)=O 82 .
Returning to the general case of the scroll , eighth species , S(1 , 32 ) , it is proper to show geometrically how it is that the reciprocal is a scroll , n'inth species , S(13 ) .
Consider in the scroll S(1 , 32 ) any plane through the directrix line ; this contains three generating lines of the scroll , viz. these are the sides of the triangle formed by the three points of intersection of the plane with the skew cubic : hence in the reciprocal figure we have a directrix line such that at each point of it there are three generating lines ; that is , we have a scroll S(13 ) with a triple directrix line .
Conversely , starting with the scroll S(13 ) , each plane through the triple directrix line meets the scroll in this line three times , and in a single generating line ; whence there is in the reciprocal scroll a simple directrix line ; but in order to show that it is a scroll , S(1 , 32 ) , we have yet to show that there is , as a nodal directrix , a skew cubic met twice by each generating line ; this implies that , reciprocally , in the scroll S(13 ) each generating line is the intersection of two osculating planes of a skew cubic ( tangent planes of a quartic torse ) , each such plane containing two generating lines of the scroll-a geometrical property which is far from obvious ; and similarly in the scroll , ninth species , S(32 ) , where the reciprocal scroll is of the same form , the property that each generating line is a line joining two points of a skew cubic leads to the property that each line is also the intersection of two osculating planes of a skew cubic ( or , what is the same thing , two tangent planes of a quartic torse ) .
Addition , May 18 , 1869 .
Since the foregoing Memoir was written I received from Professor CREMONA a letter dated Milan , November 20 , 1868 , in which ( besides the ninth and tenth species considered above ) he refers to two other species of quartic scrolls .
He remarks that there is 125 a bitangent torse which should in the classification be considered along with the nodal curve ; and he enumerates in all 12 species as follows : Deficiency .

I have in the last column added the references to my species 9 and 10 ; Professor CREMONA notices ( what I knew , but did not recollect ) that the species 10 had been considered by M. CHASLES , Comptes Rendus , June 3 , 1861 .
I have not yet examined the two new species mentioned in this enumeration ; viz. these are ( CREMONA 3 ) , say twelfth species , a scroll having a triple line , but a bitangent torse made up of a quadric cone and a line ; and ( CREMONA 4 ) , say eleventh species , a scroll having a nodal conic and line , but for its bitangent torse a triple line : the two species are , it is clear , reciprocal to each other ; although properly treated as distinct , species 11 may be considered as a subform of 8 , and species 12 as a subfornl of 9 .
