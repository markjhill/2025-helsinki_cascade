The following papers were read , viz. : " Additional note to the Eleventh Series of Researches on the Tides .
" By the Rev. William Whewell , B.D. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. As an appendix to his former memoir on tide observations , the author gives in the present paper the results of observations made at Petropaulofsk , in the bay of Avatcha , in Kamtchatka , lat. 53ยง 1 ' N. , long .
158ยง 44 ' E. , by the officers and men of the Seuivine , commanded by the present Russian Admiral Liitke ; and which were conducted with great care and perseverance .
The height of the surface was noted every ten minutes , both day and night , and when near its maximum every two minutes .
It appears from these observations that the high water is affected in its time by a very large diurnal inequality , reaching the enormous amount of above four hours ; while its height is only slightly affected by an inequality of that kind ; the greatest alternate in ?
qualities of height were'something more than a foot .
In the low waters , there appears a much smaller inequality in the times , seldom amounting to more than one hour ; but with regard to height , the diurnal inequality is much larger than that for high water , reaching to three , or even four feet ; and this in a tide of which the whole rise , from the lowest to the highest , rarely exceeds five feet .
The theory of these phenomena is then discussed .
The results of another series of observations made in July 1827 , at the port of Novo-Arkhangelsk , in the island of Sitkhce , in Norfolk Sound ( lat. 57ยง 2 ' N. , long .
135ยง 18 ' W. ) , are also given , and their theory considered .
