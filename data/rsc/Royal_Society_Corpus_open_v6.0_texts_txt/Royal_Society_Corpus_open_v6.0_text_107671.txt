Observatory , Trinity College , Dublin , MY DEAR SIR , October I5 , 182I .
I SEND you the elements of the comet observed at Valparaiso , the observations of which you were so kind as to send to me .
We are indebted to the science of Captain HALL , for adding this comet to our catalogue .
The observations appear to have been as exact as could have been made even in an established observatory , on a comet only visible so near the horizon , and so far from the meridian , and of which the light was probably faint both from its actual distance from us , and its apparent proximity to the sun .
The comet on the 8th of April was distant nearly 1,41 from the earth , the sun 's distance from the earth being unity , and on the gd of May , when last seen , about 2,64 .
This comet is interesting to astronomers on account of its small perihelion distance .
In the Catalogue of M. DELAMBRE , out of 116 comets , the orbits of which have been computed , there are only three that pass nearer the sun .
It is interesting also , from the probability that it is the same comet that was observed in 1593 , which agrees with this in its small perihelion distance and great inclination .
The inclination was computed by LACAILLE to be 88 ?
nearly .
The inclination of this is 106ยง 4 ' .
The perihelion distance of that = , o89 , of this , o093 .
This comet would probably have been a very remarkable one by its appearance , had the earth been in a favourable situation .
It may , at first , cause some surprise , that it escaped the watchful observers of Europe when on the north side of the ecliptic , in February and March last , before it passed its peri .
helion ; but on examination it will be found , that in March it was only a few degrees from the sun , and must have been rendered invisible by the superior lustre thereof .
It passed from the north to the south side of the plane of the earth 's orbit , March 21st , 18h 30m , a few hours after it had passed its perihelion ; and its elongation from the sun then was only about 4 ? .
The observations having been made so long after its passage through perihelion , the smallness of its perihelion distance , and some other circumstances , have involved the computation in difficulties not often met with .
This induces me to request you will lay before the Royal Society , the method by which I proceeded .
The unusual circumstances relative to this comet , will also appear by referring to a passage in the Preface of M. BURCKHARDT'S new table of the Parabolic Movements , &amp;c. in the Conn. des Temps , 1818 .
It relates to the interval of his table from iooo to 1o , ooo days , of which he says , " comme il est probable que cette party no servirajamais dans la pratique , &amp;c. " Now , in the observations after the i8th of April , 51 the anomalies of this comet exceeded that of looo days in the tabular comet .
Besides the elements ( B ) deduced by the method of which the explanation is given , I had previously deduced another set ( A ) by a process less certain in its operations .
The latter set ( A ) however , may be thought not much inferior to the other set ( B ) .

h. m. s , 73 26 I II 32 4 ' 38 17 35 8 Computation of the Elements .
The method used for the first approximation was that of M. LAPLACE.* The observations chosen were those of April 8 , 1l , and 14 .
It considerably diminishes the length of the calculation to use only three observations , where it can be done .
In the present instance it is not likely , had a greater number of observations been used , that the superior accuracy derived would have compensated for the additional trouble .
The result from the three observations , is as exact as would be necessary on common occasions .
Here , on account of the small perihelion distance and small motion of the comet in heliocentric longitude between the first and last observations , the method of M. LAPLACE , t C Determination exact des elemens de l'orbite , &amp;c. &amp;c. " is inapplicable ; the errors of the motion in heliocentric longitude being greater than the motion itself .
The extension however of that method , as indicated by M. DELAMBRE , might succeed in this instance , but the formidable calculations necessary are sufficient to deter one from the attempt .
The method which I gave in Vol. XIII .
p. 189 , of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy , also , in this case , requires to be extended .
It will be necessary to introduce the squares of the variation of the perihelion distance , and of the correction of the time from perihelion .
The manner in which my method is extended to this case will be easily understood from the following detail ; and also the change I have made in deriving on common occasions the final equations , by using a formula for the computation of V , different from that given by M. LAPLACE .
Previously to the computation , re-calculated the observations of April 8 , 11 , 14 , 21 , and May 3 , using the places of the stars as given by M. PIAZzi .
This perhaps was unnecessary .

d'=,4367x ' d"=-,2954 " . .
d " =,2130 x " From these values it is necessary to compute dV , dV .
Let H= 2 sin ( 9--3 ' ) cos C ' cos xr H=2 sin , ( / -- ' " ) cos ' cos cr then equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) become cos V= cos ( 7r--./ )-H ( 1o ) cos V'= cos ( nr-'r")-H ( 11 ) It is obvious from the smallness of 3-- ' and , -3 " , and the magnitude of the errors of U-V and U'-V " that the errors of --/ 3 and )3-- " may bear a considerable proportion to the quantities themselves , or be even greater .
Therefore the coefficients of the differentials dp and dt in dH will be quite incorrect , if the differential of H be computed in the common way .
It is the smallness of 3--3 ' and , '--3 " in this case that renders M. LAPLACE'S method of computing V , V ' inconvenient , in consequence of its being necessary to use the tangent of an angle nearly = go ? .
But the variations of V and V ' may be obtained with sufficient accuracy in the following manner .
By equation ( lo ) we easily deduce an account of the smallness of HH V= T 7+'+ ^7 V=~ r--w t. sin i"sin-('-- ' ) and with sufficient exactness V+dV=r ' dir.-d't 7 2sin " cos W ' cos r(+d --d')^ sin ( Xr-- , ) therefore dV(d / d - ) -t Zr -r -V 2 sin i " cos r ' cos wr ( 3+d---$'-dRP ) dV =-(dS-d}7 +7r-7r -V -sin ( - ) and the same expression serves for dV ' changing r , 3 ' and V into , r'1 , p " and V ' .
Hence , substituting the values of.8 , B ' , 13 , t- , " , " ' " &amp;c. &amp;c. we obtain dV --3 4*+,3446x-4390X+-N ( 268o--,4672x+,2188x ' ) dV-'-703 +,2954X"-4390x+N'(4845--,4672x+ , o065x"7 ) where log N= 5.63801 and log N'=--5.47328 and finally , equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) give N ( 2680--254dt+63l5odp)2-364dt-15o649gdp2428 ( 12 ) N'(4845-3166dt+83572dp )-452dt-22769dp=32l2 ( 13 ) From these equations the values of dp and dt may be derived .
The indirect solution seems to be the shortest , as we know the value of dp within narrow limits .
The first error ofp as deduced from the approximation of LAPLACE , rarely indeed will amount to + , o1 .
1 .
Let us suppose dp=-,005 .
Then equation ( 12 ) gives dt=+4,294 and -1,194 .
The positive value is too great to be admitted , taking t=--1,194 , the result from equation ( 13 ) is o= -468 .
2 .
dp = , ooo dt= + 4,901 and -1,547 , substituting in equation ( 13 ) t =-,547 o =-309 .
dp0= + , oo5 dt + 5,442 and1,838 0= --137 the value of dp therefore exceeds , oo05 .
The last result shows , that with this value of dp , the errors of VU and V'.-U are reduced to comparatively small quantities , and it may be useless in this first process to endeavour to reduce them still more .
Therefore we may now make p= , o865 , oo5 =,9o5 , and t= 19,9x 1,8 1,838 1 8,0738 .
With these values we obtain , having corrected the sun 's places and comet 's observed places for aberration , and made the computations to seven places of figures , I. .

From these new values of dp and dt we very easily get from the above values of dv &amp;c. &amp;c. 0I It S0 / tI 01 'I April 8 13625 33= ' 2 10 13 575 I1 39z=r 21 144 3056= z5 552-=t ' 4343 3=lr ' May 3 148 32 i6="2 33 o20=0 " 39 59 36=vr " V=80 5 ' 24 " V'=12 6 ' 45 The differences between the first values of/ 3 , 3 &amp;c. &amp;c. and these correct values , seem deserving of notice .
It remains to find the place of the node , inclination of the orbit , and the place of perihelion .
For this purpose it is very convenient and sufficiently exact* to compute , in the spherical triangle formed by the sides go--7r , o-r ' and V ' , the angle opposite to go--v " , and also in the spherical triangle formed by go -r , 9go--w and V , the angle opposite to 9o- ' .
These angles are 152 ?
g8 ' 9 " , which gives the inclination 73ยง 1i9 50 " 1 , s 5I 56 , which gives the inclination 73 1 47 Now , if the orbit were an exact parabola , and the observations perfectly accurate , the above quantities ought , in consequence of the exactness that has been used in the computation , to agree to a second .
Hence is seen the unavoidable errors arising from these two causes jointly .
It is probable , that the deviation from a parabola has no sensible effect in the present case .
With the mean value 152ยง 45 3 " we get the place of the node 48ยง 24 ' 41 , and the place of perihelion -=7 29ยง 6 47 " .
There evidently appears an irregularity in the three last right ascensions observed April 29 , May 1 and 3 .
It is possible , that this happened in consequence of the difficulty of observing the comet from its faintness : if so , each of the observations may partake of that irregularity , and the inaccuracy of the observation of May 3 , may have affected the elements .
This might have been avoided , by combining a greater number of observations in correcting the approximate elements , but the advantage would not , probably , have repaid the additional labour .
The remark on these latter observations , must not be understood to imply , in the smallest degree , a defect in observing ; on the contrary , the general exactness of the observations appears highly creditable to the observers , and requires no 61 allowance for the unavoidable difficulties under which they must have observed ... .I ~ v , i-w ... ... .

Note.-The computations relative to the comet observed by Captain HALL , were finished in the middle of October last , and the results immediately sent to London for the purpose of being laid before the Royal Society .
The second part of the Transactions for 1821 , did not reach me till after the communication had been read at the Royal Society .
In that second part , I was much surprised to find the elements of the same comet computed by Mr. RUMKER , from the observations made by Dr. OLBERS , before the passage through perihelion .
Subsequently , the " Conn. des Tems , " for 1824 reached me , which contains Observations made at Paris , and Elements by M. NICOLLET ; also a notice of the comet having been observed in several places of Europe .
It certainly is highly creditable to those observers who discovered , under very difficult circumstances , the comet in its approach to the sun .
By the addition of Captain HALLS observations after the passage through perihelion , we are enabled to obtain very exact elements .
The errors of my Elements , when applied to observations before perihelion , and the errors of Mr. RUMKER'S and of M. NICOLLET'S Elements , when applied to Captain HALL'S observations after perihelion , are considerable : Therefore , I have farther corrected my Elements , by using Dr. OLBERS ' observations of January So , with those of Captain HALL of April 8 , and May 3 .
