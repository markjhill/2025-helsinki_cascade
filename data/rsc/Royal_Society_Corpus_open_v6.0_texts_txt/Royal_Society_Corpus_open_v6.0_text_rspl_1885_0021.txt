The object of this paper is to communicate the results of a study of the action of disinfectant substances which has occupied the leisure of the author for the past eighteen months .
Three series of experiments have been made , viz.:\#151 ; 1 .
On the Bacterium termo .
2 .
On the various micro-organisms in sewage .
3 .
On the disinfection of typhoid excreta .
The term disinfectant as used throughout this paper must be considered as synonymous with " germicide ' !
; to disinfect a thread or a drop of liquid contaminated by bacteria is , according to my view , to kill , and to kill not by a destructive or .
corrosive , but by a true poisonous action , all the micro-organisms , so that the disinfected micro-organisms placed under the most favourable conditions foi growth are incapable of any further development .
1 .
The Disinfection of the Bacterium termo .
A pure cultivation of the Bacterium termo was made in ordinary sterile , solid , nutrient gelatin ; the somewhat fluorescent greenish liquid to which the upper layers of the gelatin were reduced , by the growth and multiplication of the bacterium , was submitted to the various disinfectants in the manner to be described , and then the bacterium was withdrawn as far as possible from the influence of the disinfectant and planted , as it were , in fresh nutrient gelatin .
The methods used in the sterilisation of beakers , test-tubes , \amp ; c. , as well as the preparation of nutrient gelatin , differed in no essential respect from the same methods in general use in biological laboratories , and therefore need not be described .
The B. termo was submitted to the action of the disinfectants by two methods , which may be called the " drop " and " thread method respectively .
The Drop Method.\#151 ; Sterilised pure water was infected with a few c.c. of gelatin liquefied by the bacterium ; measured volumes of this infected water were added to measured volumes of the disinfectant , and the whole allowed to act for twenty-four hours .
A drop of this liquid was then added to from 10\#151 ; 20 grams of the nutrient gelatin , first liquefying it at a very gentle heat .
As the proportion of the weight of the drop to the weight of the nutrient gelatin varied from about 1 : 500 to 1:1000 , the dilution was in most cases sufficient to 260 Mr. A. W. Blithe .
[ Nov. 26 , reduce any antiseptic or inhibitory action of the minute quantity of the chemical agent in the drop itself to a minimum , so as to exercise no appreciable effect .
The Thread Method.\#151 ; In the thread method capillary glass rods were made by drawing out ordinary glass tubing in the blow-pipe flame , these were tipped with sealing-wax , and to the wax a little bit of sterilised cotton wool was made to adhere .
The end of the rod thus prepared was infected with the bacterium by a short immersion in a pure cultivation and was then placed in the disinfectant for twenty-four hours .
The rod on removal was soaked for a little time in sterilised water until all trace of the disinfectant had been removed .
The rod thus charged and purified was next inserted into a mass of solid nutrient gelatin in a test-tube , and put on one side at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere , protected of course from external contamination by a suitable plug of sterilised wool .
Whether the process used was that which I have called the " drop " or the " thread , " in each case " control " experiments were made with threads infected with the bacterium , but which had not been submitted to disinfection .
Alcohol , Ether , 8fc.\#151 ; As it was necessary to dissolve many of the substances experimented upon in weak alcohol , a series of experiments were made to ascertain the influence of alcoholic and other solvents on the life of the bacterium , and the following table gives the result .
Alcohol of 60 per cent , disinfected , but absolute amyl alcohol , pure ether , chloroform , and carbon disulphide merely delayed the growth .

The - sign in the table denotes " no growth , " the + sign means that on the day denoted in the upper column the gelatin began to liquefy , and growth to appear .
.Phenol and Cresol.\#151 ; These experiments were made by the drop method .
Weighed quantities of pure crystalline phenol and of pure liquid cresol* were dissolved in 20 per cent , alcohol in such proportion that the strength was exactly 1 per cent. Water which had been infected with the bacterium was measured from a burette into test-tubes , and definite quantities of the phenol or cresol solutions added ; the volume of the whole being kept at 10 c.c. , e.g. , 3 c.c. of phenol solution , and 7 c.c. of the infected water would equal 0'3 per cent. , 1 c.c. of phenol solution and 9 of the infected water would equal 0T per cent. , and so on At the end of twenty-four hours nutrient gelatin was infected by means of dipping a clean recently ignited platinum wire in the liquid , and then inserting the wire for a second or two in the gelatin , which had been previously liquefied .
The following short table summarises these experiments ; as before , the \#151 ; sign denotes no growth , the + sign denotes the first appearance of evident growth and liquefaction .

[ Nov. 26 , The table gives the results obtained at the ordinary temperature , and also at the temperature of 35*5 ' .
The effect of a temperature of 35'5 ' is remarkable , and goes far to explain the happy effects of the so-called antiseptic or Listerian method of surgery .
The effect of the higher temperature is seen mainly in the longer period of time between the infection and the subsequent growth , e.g. , when the phenol was present in the proportion of OT per cent. , under these conditions the growth was'retarded to the seventh and eighth day , and 0'25 of phenol which did not disinfect with certainty at from 15\#151 ; 16 ' did so at 35'5 ' .
Pyridine Series.\#151 ; Pure samples of pyridine ( C5H5N ) , picoline ( C6H7N ) , lutidine ( C7H9N ) , collidine ( C8HnN ) , parvoline ( C9H13 !
Sr ) , and also acridine ( C13H9N ) , and acridine hydrochlorate were placed at my disposal by Mr. Benjamin Nickels .
Solutions of the bases were made in 20 per cent , alcohol , and the bacterium was experimented upon on the same lines as in the preseries of experiments .
The table gives the general results obtained , and establishes well The Pyridine Bases .

within 1 per cent , the least amount of the disinfectant which has the effect of destroying the germ life .
The order of activity seems to be as follows:\#151 ; Parvoline , acridine , collidine , pyridine , lutidine , picoline .
Here also the effect of the bases at the higher temperature is very evident and marked ; 1-15 per cent , of lutidine at 15-5 ' failed to disinfect , for growth was evident and vigorous by the sixth day ; but 0'5 per cent , acting for twenty-four hours at 35'5 ' disinfected perfectly .
Similarly , 01 per cent , of acridine disinfected perfectly at 35-5 ' , but not at the lower temperature .
It was probable enough that the empyreumatic products of tobacco , consisting to a considerable degree of members of the pyridine series , would also be disinfectant .
The smoke from an ordinary pipeful of common shag tobacco was pulled through a few c.c. of sterilised water .
In this tobacco-water threads infected with the bacterium were soaked for twenty-fours , and afterwards submitted to cultivation , but no growth resulted .
It may not be rash to infer that the cavity of the smoker 's mouth during the act of smoking , is likely to have a disinfecting action on any bacteria which may at that time gain access .
Alkaloids.\#151 ; Experiments were made on certain of the alkaloids by the " thread " method .
The exact manner in which the alkaloids were dissolved , \amp ; c. , was as followsBrucine and strychnine were respectively converted into chlorides and the neutral salt dissolved in 20 per cent , alcohol so as to make a 2 per cent , solution .
Sulphate of atropine was dissolved in 20 per cent , alcohol .
Quinine sulphate was in one experiment dissolved in 20 per cent , alcohol with the addition of a sufficient quantity of hydric sulphate to ensure solution ; but in another experiment the acid was omitted , a saturated solution of the quinine being used instead ; this saturated solution was made by boiling the salt for a few minutes , and then allowing the solution to cool .
A solution thus made equals 0'3 per cent , of anhydrous quinine sulphate .
Morphine was used in the form of acetate .
Theine was simply dissolved in the weak alcohol without further preparation .
The results are given in the table , from which it will be seen that strychnine , brucine , quinine , and atropine all destroyed the bacterium in from 025 to 05 per cent , strength .
The saturated aqueous solution of quinine permitted growth on the sixth day when acting at ordinary temperatures , but when the action took place at the heat of the body then sterilisation was effected .
It is noteworthy that solutions of morphine acetate of 1 per cent , strength seem to have no disinfecting properties .

Potassic Permanganate.\#151 ; Experiments on the action of potassic permanganate were made by the thread method .
As the infected thread was immersed in a large volume of the disinfectant , the latter acted under more favourable conditions than are likely to occur in actual practice , in which there will be usually a quantity of easily broken up organic matter , decomposing the permanganate , and thus in effect removing it .

Sterilised threads were , therefore , infected with the bacterium , and submitted for twenty-four hours to chlorine , bromine , and iodine water of known strength , the thread being afterwards soaked in distilled water to free it from all traces of the halogen , and then planted in gelatin .
The results are not essentially different from those obtained by other observers , and fully confirm the great disinfecting power of the halogens , 0-01 per cent , solution of any of the three being sufficient to destroy the bacterium .
Of the three , chlorine is the most active .

Experiments on the Disinfection of Sewage .
In the following series of experiments an entirely different method of procedure was adopted .
The number of colonies in a gram of sewage or other suitable liquid was carefully determined by a modification of known methods .
The same sewage was then treated by substances the disinfectant properties of which formed the subject of inquiry , and the number of colonies capable of growing in a nutrient soil , representing the microorganisms which had escaped destruction , again enumerated .

267 The only special apparatus used requiring description is the " dropbottle " and the " rings and plates .
" The Drop-bottle.\#151 ; The figure represents its shape and size , the capacity is about 25 c.c. The stopper is hollow and terminates in a pipette ; it has a pin-hole at a , which can be closed by the finger .
The Glass Plates and Bings.\#151 ; The glass plates were 4 by 2 inches square , the rings 4 inches in diameter , \#163 ; inch thick , and inch high .
The plates had a ground surface the size of the ring thickness ; the rings were cemented to the plates in the following manner .
After heating the rings and plates in a hot air oven for many hours a little peptone gelatin was run on to the ribbon of ground surface , the ring adjusted , and the whole allowed to cool in a glass chamber formed by a small dish covered by a slightly larger one ; at the bottom of the dish was some filter-paper moistened with a solution of mercuric chloride .
The plates were not used until the gelatin cement had perfectly set .
I should also add that the plates were ruled by means of a diamond into squares for the purpose of easy enumeration .
Solid substances , such as ferrous sulphate , were weighed and dissolved in definite quantities of the sewage ; in other cases solutions of known strength were mixed with the sewage .
The time during which the disinfectant acted was , as a rule , twenty-four hours .
The method of cultivation was as follows .
A small quantity , whether of diluted or disinfected sewage , was transferred to the previously cleansed and sterilised drop-bottle , the bottle and its contents carefully weighed , then by means of the pipette stopper one or two drops spotted on to the surface of the glass cell formed by the plate and ring already described ; the weight of the drops was ascertained by reweighing the drop-bottle .
Ordinary nutrient gelatin liquefied at a gentle heat was run from a Lister flask into the glass cell , and mixed equally with the drops by inclining the plate in different directions .
During these several operations dust was exclnded as far as possible by covering the glass cell by a second glass plate , merely shifting the plate sufficiently on one side to allow the insertion of the nozzle of the Lister flask or the point of the pipette .
The cells thus charged were placed in the moist chamber ; the gelatin rapidly set , and at the end of from three to five days the colonies of growth were counted in the usual way and their general nature determined .
The weight of the drop or drops taken varied from 20 to 100 mgrs .
, the gelatin in which the drop was cultivated from 15 to 20 grams , so that the minute quantity of disinfectant contained in the drop itself was diluted from 200 to 1000 times .
This amount of dilution with the comparatively weak percentages of disinfectants used would reduce the action of the disinfectant on the gelatin , the cultivating 268 Mr. A. W. Blithe .
[ Nov ; 26 ; soil\#151 ; to a minimum , so that practically as soon as the micro-organisms still surviving were floated into the nutrient gelatin they were removed from the sphere of disinfectant influence .
Phenol and Cresol.\#151 ; It is of importance to know the relative disinfectant powers of phenol and cresol , and for this purpose the following comparative experiment was made .
Two quantities of sewage were respectively treated with phenol and cresol , so that the mixtures were equivalent to 1'9 per cent. , and allowed to act for twenty-four hours ; the mean of two strictly concordant experiments gave the following as the number of colonies which at the end of four days could he enumerated\#151 ; .

None of the colonies in the disinfected sewage liquefied the gelatin .
The fungi which developed after the treatment with phenol were to the other colonies as 3:5 , the fungi in the cresol experiment were to the other colonies as 1 : 7 .
Weight for weight , pure crystalline phenol and pure liquid cresol seem to he about equal in disinfectant power.* In another experiment 10 grams of phenol and 10 grams of cresol were mixed respectively with 90 grams of pure calcic hydrate .
1 gram of each of these powders was digested with 100 grams of sewage for twenty-four hours .
The results of the cultivation were as follows:\#151 ; No. of colonies per gram of the sewage taken .

The strength of the solution # Mr. J. P. Laws , F.C.S. , in some recent experiments on the disinfection of the Bacillus anthracic , found the relative " restraining " power of phenol and paracresol to be as 2 : 3 , the killing power as 2 : 5 ; hence he gives some superiority to cresol as regards B. anthracic .
His samples were both crystalline , and obtained from Kahlbaum and made from the benzene and toluene sulphonates of potassium ( Fourteenth Annual Report Local Government Board , Supplement\#151 ; Medical Officer .

271 On the fourth day of cultivation the colonies produced were calculated to be equal to 33,846 per gram of the original sewage , which when not disinfected yielded 1,490,000 per gram .
It was noted that the fungi were to the other organisms as 4 : 7 .
About 1500 of the colonies were of the class that liquefy the gelatine .
' Quinine Sulphate.\#151 ; A saturated solution of quinine sulphate was made by boiling the crystals with water , allowing to cool , and filtering from the crystals which separated .
The strength of this solution was ascertained by evaporating 10 c.c. to dryness in a tared platinum dish .
It was found in this way to be equal to 0'3 per cent , of the anhydrous sulphate^ ^ sew{igewas mixed with 50 grams of the saturated solution , and after acting for twenty-four hours drops were weighed out and cultivated .
The colonies developed at the end of five days were noted to be about one-half composed of fungi , and to equal 48,936 per gram of the original sewage , which , as previously stated , contained 1,490,000 Terebene.\#151 ; 20 c.c. of terebene were added to 100 c.c. of sewage and digested with frequent agitation for twenty-four hours at the common temperature .
In this way the sewage was saturated with as much terebene as the conditions would allow , the excess separating and floating in an upper stratum .
A small quantity of the lower liquid was transferred to the weighing bottle , and some drops weighed out for cultivation .
_ At the end of four days the number of colonies were only equal to 83 per gram of the original sewage , nor did any fresh colonies make their appearance even after keeping the cell in the moist chamber for ten days . . .
, Potassic Permanganate.\#151 ; Two flasks , each containing gram o crystallised permanganate , were submitted for twenty-four hours to different temperatures , viz , the one at 18 ' , the other in an incubator set at 37 ' . .
, The sewage used was the same as in the former experiments , and contained over a million and a quarter of centres of growth when cultivated in its normal state .

The Action of Disinfectants on Typhoid Excreta .
Eberth , Klebs , and Gaffky have each described micro-organisms which they consider peculiar to abdominal typhus , i.e. , enteric or typhoid fever .
Gaffky has specially studied the question , and describes , with great minuteness , the manner of growth of a bacillus which he found in twenty-six out of twenty-eight typhoid bodies ( Gaffky , " Zur Oetiologie des Abdominal Typhus .
" " Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte , " 2 Band , Berlin , 1884 ) .
The bacillus grows in nutrient gelatin , in light brown colonies , which do not liquefy the gelatin ; if a minute portion of one of the colonies be taken up on a needle and transferred to a drop of water for microscopic observation , the bacillus is seen to have the power of self-movement .
If the bacillus is sown on sterlised potatoes , a peculiar sort of pellicle in about forty-eight hours is produced , formed wholly of bacilli .
The method of growth on gelatin , on potato , and the power of self-movement , taken together , Gaffky considers to belong to no other bacillus hitherto described .
At the ordinary temperature no spores were formed , but they were readily produced when the bacillus was cultivated on potato at a blood heat .
Gaffky , although seldom failing to find this bacillus in typhoid bodies , could not detect it in the excreta .
In the study of the action of disinfectants on typhoid excreta , it was necessary to first determine the number of colonies which could be raised by cultivation from a gram of the typhoid matter operated upon , and also search for any distinctive organism .
Erom a typical case of typhoid fever , on the tenth day of the disease , a small quantity of the typhoid stool was obtained ; it was very liquid , offensive , of a light brown colour , and free from blood .
A portion of this was weighed and diluted with sterilised water , so 1885 .

that the solution equalled 5 per 1000 .
Weighed drops of this solution were cultivated , and the number of colonies obtained enumerated .
According to the mean of four experiments the number per gram of colonies of all kinds in the original typhoid stool was 1,031,250 .
Of these various growths 40 per cent , were forms of mucor and asper-gillus , about 20 per cent , were bacilli , bacteria , and micrococci , which , from their manner of growth and general characters , seemed to belong to common and familiar forms , and were not farther investigated .
Besides these there were some light brown colonies which grew slowly , the one generally in almost circular spheres , the other in flatter irregular wart-like masses ; neither of these growths while cultivated on the thin sheet of gelatin-peptone in the glass cell seemed to liquefy the gelatine , that is , within five or six days of cultivation , for observation could not be carried on longer than this period , other common organisms , such as B. , liquefying the whole mass and mixing up the colonies .
It was , therefore , necessary for the farther study of these brown colonies ( which might be Gaffky 's bacillus ) to obtain of each pure cultivations .
For this purpose a minute quantity of each was transplanted into a test tube of nutrient gelatin by means of a sterilised platinum wire ; from this cultivation a second was produced , and from the second a third .
As the general behaviour of the various cultivations never altered , nor could any foreign element be detected , the last cultivations were considered to be pure , and from these the surface of sterilised slices of potatoes were inoculated .
The bacillus , which may be referred to as bacillus ( \#174 ; ) , and which grew in a more or less spherical manner in the sheet gelatin , when transferred to a test-tube of solid gelatin-peptone , liquefies very slowly the gelatin , growing always in contact with the air .
On potato it extends as a dirty scum .
The bacilli examined in water showed no power of self-movement .
The irregularly growing brown colony , which may be called bacillus ( 5 ) , also very slowly liquefies the gelatin , but only along the track of the needle .
A test-tube cultivation at the end of from fourteen to twenty days has the following appearance .
Along the track of the needle there is a cone-shaped perfectly liquid mass .
On the surface of the liquid float little detached white-brown colonies ; at the bottom is a white deposit composed of colonies which , having been formed on the surface in contact with the air , have slowly sunk .
The liquid intervening between the deposit and upper floating colonies is perfectly clear .
On potato the bacillus grows rapidly , forming an irregularly-shaped brownish crust , and ultimately presents an appearance very similar to the common wall lichen Whether these bacilli have any connexion with the typhoid state or not , the characters described are quite different from those of Gaffky s bacillus .
Mr. A. W. Blytli .
[ Nov. 26 Whatever their significance may be , they were for this particular sample of excreta distinctive , and moreover had such a special manner of growth that they could be readily recognised by the unaided sight , so that their presence or absence in the succeeding experiments could be easily noted .
The disinfectants first experimented upon were some in common use , such as ferrous sulphate , cresol , and potassic permanganate .
Ferrous Sulphate\#151 ; To the 0'5 per cent , typhoid water crystals of the sulphate were added and allowed to remain at the ordinary temperature for twelve hours , crystals at the end of that period were still undissolved , so that in effect the solution was saturated .
Of this liquid a quantity equal to 125 mgrrns .
of the original typhoid stool was taken for cultivation .
Growth was rapid ; at the end of three days fifteen colonies were counted , composed of common liquefying bacteria and bacilli ; besides these , there were sixty-five others which did not liquefy the gelatine , i.e.f within the same time , among which were to be found both kinds of the light brown bacilli above described .
The total number of colonies calculated per gram of the original typhoid matter , which had escaped destruction , were thus 640 .
Cresol.\#151 ; The crude carbolic acid of commerce , so largely used for disinfecting purposes , is a mixture of phenol and cresol with small quantities of other tar principles .
The cheapest carbolic acid may be considered impure cresol , all phenol that the manufacturer can possibly crystallise out having been removed ; hence in the following experiments with Calvert 's cresol some information is obtained as to the value of the disinfection of typhoid matters as ordinarily performed .
An exact 1 per cent , solution of cresol was made in typhoid water , and drops weighed out , at the end of fifteen minutes , three hours , and twenty-four hours respectively .
The number of colonies per gram of the original typhoid matter appearing at the end of four days ' cultivation was as follows :\#151 ; No. of colonies per gram of typhoid matter taken .

The brown colonies were not detected in the last cultivation , but were present in the others .
The experiments were next extended to the amines and to the pyridine series , substances , the action of which on Bacterium termo and on sewage had already been studied .

Ammonia , hydroxylamine , and the amines.\#151 ; The same strength of solution of ammonia and the amines employed in the treatment of sewage was also used in the experiments on typhoid matter .
The 0'5 per cent , of typhoid stool was diluted with an equal volume of these solutions , with of course the result that every 100 parts contained by weight one-tenth of an equivalent of ammonia , hydroxylamine , and the amines , and 025 per cent , of typhoid matter .
As a control one volume of typhoid water was diluted with one volume of sterilised water and cultivated side by side with the others .
At the end of four days the colonies were enumerated , the light brown bacilli ( a ) and ( 6 ) were present as well as representatives of all others seen in the control .

Equal volumes of these solutions were then mixed with equal volumes of the 0*5 per cent , typhoid water , and after the end of twenty-four hours weighed drops were cultivated .
Pyridine.\#151 ; The quantity taken for cultivation of the typhoid water was equivalent to 0'5 mgrm .

After four days cultivation three colonies developed , two of these were common moulds , the third a common bacillus .
Picoline.\#151 ; After four days ' cultivation , a quantity of the solution equivalent to 0'885 mgrm .
of typhoid yielded fifteen colonies , five of which were identical with the light brown bacillus ( a ) already described .
Lutidine.\#151 ; After four days ' cultivation , a quantity of the solution equivalent to 0'62 mgrm .
of typhoid stool yielded twelve colonies , all of which seemed of a common kind .
Parvoline.\#151 ; After four days ' cultivation , a quantity of the solution equivalent to 0'85 mgrm .
of typhoid stool yielded five colonies , five of these were common forms of mould , one was the light brown bacillus ( 6 ) previously described .
Hence with regard to the members of this series experimented 276 Studies of Disinfectants by New Methods .

19,355 Summary.\#151 ; Prom the three series of experiments certain general conclusions may he drawn ; these are as follows :\#151 ; 1 .
The relative merits of phenol and cresol as a disinfectant are fairly equal , as shown by experiments on Bacterium termo and on sewage , so that preference for one or the other must be determined from considerations apart from degrees of activity.* 2 .
Ferrous sulphate as a disinfectant of Bacterium , of sewage , and of typhoid excreta is shown to be unreliable .
Even strong solutions fail to destroy all classes of micro-organisms .
Considering the extensive use of ferrous sulphate in cases of typhoid fever , and that in both scientific and popular manuals ferrous sulphate is confidently recommended as a disinfectant of specific excreta , it seems important to accentuate the fact that my experiments are in their result wholly opposed to the popular view and custom .
3 .
The experiments on the amines clearly show that the disinfectant action of members of that series differs in degree according to the displacement of hydrogen by methyl , ethyl , propyl , or hydroxyl .
The connexion between chemical constitution and disinfectant action is also seen in the experiments on the pyridine series , but is not so marked .
4 .
Other things being equal , the .shorter the time a disinfectant acts , the less the disinfection ; this was shown very clearly in the experiments on typhoid excreta treated with cresol for varying periods of time .
It , therefore , necessarily follows that even when strong disinfectants are poured on to specific excreta , and the whole within a few minutes thrown into a drain or cesspool , which by great dilution more or less removes the excreta from the sphere of disinfectant influence , no true disinfection has been accomplished .
5 .
Disinfection is far more efficient at 35*5 to 37 , the temperatuies at which development and growth of micro-organisms is most active , than at ordinary temperatures .
This is shown in the experiments on Bacterium termo with phenol , cresol , lutidine , collidine , and potassic permanganate , as well as in the experiments in the treatment of sewage with chloride of lime and potassic permanganate .
