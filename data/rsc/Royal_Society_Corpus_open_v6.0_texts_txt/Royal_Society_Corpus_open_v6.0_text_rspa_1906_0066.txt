) The rare earth , ytterbia , was discovered in 1878 by Marignac.* In 1880 Wilson , f in purifying Marignac 's ytterbia , found that it contained another earth which he named scandia .
Cleve , and more recently his daughter Astrid Cleve , have worked much on ytterbia , and within the last few years M. Urbain has taken up the subject , and has succeeded in purifying ytterbia in larger quantities .
During my own work on the fractionation of the rare earths I also have prepared and worked with ytterbia .
Marignac , Wilson , Cleve , and Urbain have each presented me with some of their ytterbia .
Wilson 's earth , sent in 1886 , appears very pure .
Unfortunately , there was only sufficient to enable me to photograph the part of its spectrum between wave-lengths 2400 and 2580 .
Ytterbia is one of the least basic oxides of the yttria group ; the order being yttria , erbia , thulia , ytterbia , and scandia ; yttria being the most basic and scandia the least .
The atomic weight of ytterbium , taking the formula of the oxide , the only one known , as Yb203 , is , according to Wilson , 173'01 .
Miss Astrid Cleve obtained the number 173Y1 .
The salts of ytterbium are colourless and show no spectrum bands by transmitted light .
My ytterbia was prepared from the mixed yttria earths by the old method of partial decomposition of the nitrates by heat .
The chief difficulty is to free the ytterbia from the last traces of thulia .
The fractionation of the nitrates must go on until a considerable thickness of the fused nitrate shows no trace of the thulium absorption bands at wave-lengths 4700 and 7000 .
A trace of scandia may still be present , but this earth is very seldom met with .
All my tests have failed to show its presence , and Miss Cleve , working with several kilogrammes of ytterbium earths derived from different minerals , also was unable to find scandium in them .
In April , 1904 , M. Urbain gave me sufficient of his purest ytterbia to enable me to photograph its complete ultra-violet spectrum .
His earth was prepared by the fractional crystallisation of the ethyl-sulphates of crude gadolinite earths.^ The subsequent separation is by the fusing nitrate method .
This after 20 series of fusions gave in the least basic portions a mixture of * ' Comptes Rendus , ' vol. 87 , p. 578 .

ytterbia and thoria , which are easily separated by Wyrouboff and Verneuil 's method .
This is the ytterbia of which I have photographed the spectrum .
It still contains traces of thulia .
M. Urbain 's more recent method of preparing ytterbia is by fractionally crystallising the nitrates from a slightly diluted nitric acid .
In this way he tells me he has succeeded in getting ytterbia free from thulia .
The examination for absorption bands in a strong solution is a fairly good test for an earth , such as erbia and thulia , giving absorption spectra , but it is not so delicate as an examination of the spark spectrum photographed through a quartz train , for dominant lines , which most elements show in some part of their spectrum .
For instance , the dominant lines of yttrium are at wave-lengths 36009 , 3710-4 , 3774-5 , 4177*7 , and 4375-1 .
The dominant lines of erbium are at 3499-3 , 3692-8 , and 3906"5 .
They are , however , not strong , and fortunately the absorption bands of this element are striking and characteristic .
The spark spectrum of thulium has only been slightly examined by me , and 1 do not think it has any strong lines .
Its absorption spectrum , as with erbium , is a very characteristic one .
The spark spectrum of ytterbium has strong dominant lines at 3289-5 and 3694-4 .
Scandium has dominant lines at 3572'7 , 3614-0 , 3630"9 , 3642-9 , and 4247*0 .
The spark spectrum of ytterbium was first examined by Thalen , but only in the visible portion .
Exner and Haschek have published a set of measurements of the spark spectrum of ytterbium from wave-lengths 2116\#151 ; 4726.* I have found them to be very accurate , and in my photographs I have generally adopted their figures .
Occasionally lines are in their list which appear to belong to other elements , and in some cases lines given by them cannot be distinguished in my spectrum .
My photographs were taken with the quartz apparatus already described , the spectrum of pure iron being used as a standard .
The ytterbium spark was taken from a strong solution of the nitrate betwepn platinum poles , sufficient self-induction being introduced to eliminate nearly all the air lines .
The ytterbium , by this very severe spectrum test , is seen to be not absolutely free from impurities\#151 ; thulium , f copper and calcium , being present .

t M. Urbain writes , under date May 5 , 1906 :\#151 ; " The ytterbium , of which you have taken the spectrum , was prepared some years ago .
It is impossible to affirm that it does not contain thulium , and the experience I have acquired since these already ancient researches leads me to think it does contain traces .
Thulium is very difficult to separate completely from ytterbium , and I have only recently succeeded in doing so .
Do not fail to mention that this preparation was obtained by fusion of the nitrates of the rose-coloured yttric earths obtained in the tails of the crystallisation of the ethyl-sulphates .

is seen by its lines at 30207 , 3131*4 .
3425*2 , 3441*6 , 3462*4 , and 3848*2 .
Copper is seen by its dominant lines at 3247*7 and 3274*1 , and calcium by its dominant lines at 3933*8 and 3968*6 .
The platinum lines which are present are easily recognised , and are useful as an additional measure of identification .
Besides these , a number of fainter and indistinct lines are seen .
These may be due to ytterbium or to traces of hitherto unrecognised impurities .
The wave-lengths of all the recognisable lines of ytterbium are given on the photograph , and also those of thulium , calcium , and copper , but the platinum lines are not marked .
