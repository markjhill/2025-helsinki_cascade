Sugar as a Food [ Dec. 14 , furnishes the chromatic element to the daughter nucleus .
The cell walls rapidly meet in the centre , and their union is effected before the reconstruction of the daughter nuclei .
The spindle mass contracts up to the middle of each of the four cells , and invests the young nucleus in the same manner as was the case with the original body .
Often during this part of the process there appeared to be two nuclei in each spore cell , but I regard this as probably due to an unequal contraction of the archoplasmic mass .
In many of the daughter nuclei the two chromosomes could be detected for some little time , but they frequently become more numerous , and they finally lose their distinctness and are impossible to trace , though I leave , for the present at least , the question of their real permanence an open one .
[ Since the above was written , I have seen a quadripolar spindle , also in Aneura multifida .
It is not so well marked as in A. pinguis , and seems only to occur immediately before division .
Its extremely short duration is indicated by the fact that , although I possess several hundred preparations , all fixed at nearly the same stage , in only two of them is there unequivocal evidence of the existence of such a spindle before the individualising of the chromosomes takes place.\#151 ; November 21 , 1893 .

It may be said to have been universally believed that proteids were the essential producers of muscular work until the experiments of Voit* and Pettenkoferf showed that , within certain limits , muscular work can be produced by carbohydrates .
They did this by showing the relative amounts of nitrogen eliminated during muscular activity and repose .
Subsequently , Chauveau and KaufmannJ showed , by comparing the quantity of sugar that disappeared from the blood traversing a muscle while contracting and at rest , that four times more sugar was used up during the period of muscular activity .
Having failed to find any further recorded facts regarding sugar as a muscle food , I thought it desirable , in connexion with the investiga* Yoit , * Ueber d. Einfluss d. Muskelbewegung auf d. Stoffwechsel .

481 tion I have for some time been engaged upon , as regards the role played by sngar in the animal organism , to try and ascertain , by direct experiment , if sngar when taken as food is actually a supporter of muscular energy\#151 ; a point of great value to be decided at the present moment , when sugar is so cheap that its use need no longer be restricted to that of a mere palatable condiment , but it might , perhaps , be profitably added to the daily diet of the working man as a muscular power-producing element .
With the object of , if possible , settling this point , I availed myself of the opportunity I had of making a series of experiments upon myself with 'Professor Mosso 's ergograph , while working in the autumn of 1892 in the Physiological Laboratory at Turin.* The amount of muscular energy developed by sugar was calculated by the quantity of work that could be done by the muscles of the middle finger of each hand , in a given time , before fatigue set in .
And I think that the results obtained by experimenting with the fingers may not unreasonably be regarded as a reliable indication of the effects of sugar on the other muscles of the body .
Throughout the whole time of the experiments , except when it is specially mentioned to the contrary , not only was the mode of life , as regards the amount of sleep , \amp ; c. , kept uniform and the same kind of food taken , but , as nearly as possible , in the same quantities , along with varying amounts of sugar taken .
Each separate experiment with the ergograph was repeated every two hours , a voluntary muscular contraction being made every two seconds .
Being right-handed , a 4-kilo , weight was used for the right finger and a 3-kilo , one for the weaker left .
The total height to which the weight was raised , being multiplied by the weight , expressed in kilogrammetres the amount of work accomplished .
The amount of work done was calculated by two methods : firstly , the total amount of work accomplished up till fatigue set in ; secondly , the amount of work accomplished by each thirty voluntary muscular contractions .
The diurnal variations in the amount of work performed , as pointed out by Lombard , f and confirmed in my own experiments , rendered it necessary to compare the results at precisely the same hours on different days , in order to avoid error in drawing conclusions of the value of sugar , as the muscular working capacity varies at different times of the day .
The first step was to ascertain the value of sugar when taken alone * I here beg to express my warmest thanks to Professor Mosso for kindly placing his apparatus at my disposal , and I may at the same time mention that his brother Professor Ugolino Mosso and Luigi Paoletti afterwards corroborated the results I obtained ( 'Report of the Roman Academy , ' 15th October , 1893 ) .

The right hand , during the four periods when sugar was taken , performed 15-316 kilos , of work , as against 11-544 kilos , while fasting , thus showing the still higher gain in muscular power , on sugar , of 32"675 per cent. The effect of sugar in retarding the approach of fatigue was next estimated .

The left middle finger being capable of working 528 seconds , as against 374 seconds ; while the right worked 484 seconds , as against 300 seconds .
The total work perfoi-med by the left middle finger was 34-311 kilos , as against 19'425 kilos .
, giving a total gain of 76 per cent. ; the right , 21-700 kilos , as against 13'476 kilos .
, yielding a total gain of 61 per cent , from the sugar .
When the result obtained from each successive working of the ergo-graph is compared , the total muscle-working power is apparently far more increased than that obtained from merely thirty contractions .
This , in all probability , is due to the carbohydrates formed during fasting , from the proteids of the tissues , being sufficient for the performance of a small amount of work , though the supply is insufficient for prolonged work .
When , however , sugar is taken , it supplies the 2 l 2 484 Dr. V. Harley .
Sugar as a Food [ Dec. 14 , muscles .with , a sufficiency of working material , and the advantage , consequently , is most markedly seen in the total amount of work performed .
Having found that sugar when taken by itself is undoubtedly a muscular food , it was next necessary to ascertain its value when it is taken along with and in addition to an ordinary diet .
First , in order to see the effects of sugar added to a frugal meal , 200 grams ( 7 ounces ) of sugar were taken at 9 a.m. , after a breakfast , at 8 a.m. , of a cup of coffee , with milk , and two rusks .

The increase in the quantity of work done being most marked in the case of the right finger , for it was 39'06 per cent. , whereas the left was only 6'16 per cent. It is further seen that , although the taking of the sugar caused an immediate increase in the work done , the increase was far more marked two and a half hours later ; that is to say , when its assimilation had taken place .
Having thus ascertained that sugar increases the power of doing muscular work when added to a small meal , 1 will now give an example of what it does when added to a fall one ; that is to say , a luncheon consisting of beefsteak with vegetables , an omelet , and 1893 .

In this instance it was the left hand that showed the greatest increase in working power , for it gave on the sugar day 16'599 per cent. , while the right only yielded 8'433 per cent , more work .
As usual , on both of the above days exactly the same quantities of food were taken , so that the only difference in them was the taking of 250 grams of sugar on the one and not on the other day .
From this one is forced to conclude that sugar when added even to a copious meal has a most important power in increasing the human capabilities of doing muscular work .
I now give the result of the amount of work done on 250 grams of sugar in two periods of eight hours each , where in one case the sugar was taken in divided portions at three different times\#151 ; 100 grams ( 3-^ ounces ) at 8 a , m. , and 100 grams again at 12 a.m. , and 50 grams 486 On Sugar as a Food .

And that fatigue was retarded in the one case 12 seconds and in the other 180 seconds .
Thus it is seen that when 250 grams ( 8f ounces ) of sugar is taken along* with ordinary diet , it not only prolongs the time during which work can be done , but also increases the total amount of work performed in eight hours .
It is further seen that the sugar taken at 3.50 p.m. had the effect of increasing the work done at 5.30 and 5.40 p.m. , and that , instead of there being the usual diurnal fall in the amount of work done in the afternoon , there was actually an increase in the total amount of work accomplished .

487 Conclusion:\#151 ; 1 .
Sugar when taken alone is a muscle food .
500 grams ( 17^ ounces ) of sugar increased in my case the amount of muscular work done on a fasting day from 61 to 76 per cent. 2 .
The muscle energy-producing effect of sugar is so great that 200 grams ( 7 ounces ) added to a small meal increased the total amount of work done from 6 to 30 per cent. 3 .
That when sugar was added to a large meal it increased the total amount of work done from 8 to 16 per cent. 4 .
That the work done during a period of eight hours can be increased from 22 to 36 per cent , by taking 250 grams ( 8f ounces ) of sugar .
5 .
That when sugar is taken at 3.50 p.m. it not only obliterates the normal diurnal fall in the muscular power , which usually occurs at 5.30 p.m. , but even causes an actual increase in the total amount of work done .
