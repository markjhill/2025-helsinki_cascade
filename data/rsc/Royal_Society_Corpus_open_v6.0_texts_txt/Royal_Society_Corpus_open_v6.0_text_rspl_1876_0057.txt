Magnetic Work.\#151 ; The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year .
The horizontal-force instrument has undergone readjustment of its suspension on two occasions , in order to increase its sensibility , which appears to have somewhat diminished of late .
In accordance with the usual practice , determinations of the scale-values of all the instruments were made in the first week of the new year , and of the Bifilar when required .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been continued , as usual , by Mr. Whipple and Mr. Figg , and the results are given in the Tables appended to this Report .
The paper referred to in the last Report , containing the results of the Absolute Observations for the six years ending March 1875 , having been read before the Royal Society , has been printed in vol. xxiv .
of the * Proceedings .
' The two Sergeants of the Royal Artillery , formerly in Sir E. Sabine 's office at Woolwich , have been in regular attendance at Kew throughout the year , principally engaged in the preparation of his paper " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism , No. XV .
, " which will be printed in the Philosophical Transactions .
Report of the Kew .
371 The tabulation of the magnetic curves , alluded to in the last Report as being in arrear , for the years 1871-73 was almost completed when it was stopped in May by the resignation of the extra assistant appointed for that work .
The vacancy has not yet been filled , and the work , together with the measurement of the recent curves , is at present suspended .
Magnetic data have been supplied to Prof. Barrett , Prof. Core , Messrs. Elliott Brothers , Mr. Gordon , Dr. Guthrie , The Hydrographic Office , Prof. Balfour Stewart , Dr. Marshall Watts , and Mr. H. Watts .
The IJnifilar , Declinometer , and Azimuth Compass used by Captains Anderson and Featherstonhaugh , of the Royal Engineers , during their operations in the North-American Boundary Commission , have been returned to Store in the Observatory , and the observations made with them having been examined , will be embodied in a paper shortly to be presented to the Royal Society .
Captain Maclear , R.N. , has visited the Observatory , and , assisted by the Staff , redetermined the constants of the magnetic instruments used by him during the ' Challenger ' Expedition , thus completing the observations by making Kew the base station of the voyage .
A communication having been made io the Committee by Mr. R. J. Ellery , Director of the Melbourne Observatory , requesting an expression of opinion from them as to the desirability of continuing the photographic registration of the magnetometers at his Observatory , and asking also for suggestions for dealing with the results obtained , a circular was drawn up , and replies to it were received from the following gentlemen :\#151 ; Prof. J. C. Adams .
Prof. W. G. Adams .
Prof. Buys Ballot .
J. A. Broun , Esq. Captain F. J. O. Evans .
Prof. C. Hornstein .
Dr. C. Jelinek .
Prof. J. v. Lamont .
Rev. H. Lloyd , D.D. Rev. R. Main .
C. Meldrum , Esq. Major-General W. J. Smythe .
Prof. Balfour Stewart .
Prof. G. G. Stokes .
Prof. H. Wild .
Most of whom strongly advocate the continuance of self-recording magnetometers in Victoria .
Meteorological WorTc.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of pressure , temperature , humidity , wind ( direction and velocity ) , and rain have been maintained in regular 372 Report of the Kew .
operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by T. Gunter .
The daily standard eye-observations for the control of the automatic records have been made regularly , as well as daily observations in connexion with the Washington synchronous system .
In addition to the regular work of Kew as one of the self-recording Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office , the duty of examining and checking the work of the six other self-recording Observatories of the same character has been carried on , in accordance with the method described in the Report of the British Association for 1869 .
This portion of the work has been performed of late by Messrs. Hawkes-worth , Aldridge , and Harrison .
The arrears of work , caused by the removal of Mr. Cullum to the charge of the Yalencia Observatory , have been cleared off , and the work is now up to date .
The Observatories at Aberdeen , Armagh , Falmouth , Glasgow , Stony-hurst , and Yalencia have been visited by Mr. Whipple , and their instruments inspected .
Electrometer.\#151 ; This instrument having experienced an accidental derangement in June has since failed in its action , and all attempts at setting it to work satisfactorily have been hitherto unsuccessful .
The maker , Mr. White , of Glasgow , has promised to visit the Observatory at an early date and examine it to find the cause of failure .
A determination of the scale-value of the Electrometer by means of a 100-cell Bunsen battery was made in January .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; ThePhotoheliograph having been replaced in the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , by one of the instruments constructed for use in the Transit-of-Yenus expeditions , was returned to the Observatory January 5th , and re-erected in the Dome , but was again dismounted in March , and sent , together with a number of solar negatives , to the Loan Exhibition , South Kensington , where it now remains .
The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures , as noticed in former Reports , has been steadily carried on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose ; and the Ephemerides for the whole period of the Kew Sun-Spot Observations have been recalculated by Mr. A. Marth , and are now in the Observatory .
All of these operations have been conducted at the expense of Mr. De La Rue .
A new Micrometer for use in India , with a Photoheliograph , has been made under the supervision of Mr. De La Rue , in which various modifications , suggested by experience obtained in the use of the instrument at Kew , have been introduced .
At the request of Mr. Hind , E.R.S. , a careful inspection has been made of the Kew sun-pictures from 1858 to 1875 , with a view to obtain evidence as to the existence of the intra-Mercurial planet .
The observations bearing on the question have been communicated to that gentleman .
Report of the Kew Committee .
373 The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily by Mr. Foster , when possible , as described in the Report for 1872 , in order , for the present , to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
A catalogue of the Schwabe MSS .
, deposited in the Observatory , has been made for the Royal Astronomical Society .
Extra Observations.\#151 ; The observations with Prof. H. E. Roscoe 's Photometer were discontinued in November last , the year for which the experiment was undertaken having expired .
The instrument has since been returned to the Owens College .
The Solar-radiation Thermometers are still observed daily .
The Campbell Sundial , described in the last Report , continues in action , and the improved form of the instrument , giving a separate record for every day of the duration of sunshine , has been regularly worked since March .
At the request of the Editor of the * Times/ a copy of the traces of the self-recording instruments on a reduced scale , together with an epitome of the general features of the weather , is now prepared .
This is published every week in that journal , the cost to the Observatory being defrayed by the proprietors .

Magnetic Observations made at the Keiv , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " A. , Long. Oh lm 15s , l W. , for the year October 1875 to September 1876 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones , the property of the Magnetic Office , directed by General Sir E. Sabine .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Eorce , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the units in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English values to metric values being 046108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log 7r2K employed in the reduction is 1-64365 at temperature 60 ' .
The induction-coefficient y is 0-000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' Eahr .
is 0-0001194 ( \#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)+ 0-000,000,213 ( \#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1-0 ft. and 1-3 ft. , are 1-000075 ft. and 1-300097 ft. respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
