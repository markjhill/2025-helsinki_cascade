] The ova of the Frog , when examined in the ovaria , consist of darlk coloured vesicles , which acquire a gelatinous covering on entering the oviduct , and are completely formed by the time they reach the cavities in which the oviducts terminate , and during their expulsion from which they receive the male influence ; after this , the contents of the ovum , previously fluid , coagulate and expand , the central part being converted into brain and spinal marrow , while in the darker substance of the egg the heart and other viscera are formed .
The membrane forming the vesicles being destined to contain the emnbryo when it has become a tadpole , enlarges as the embryo increases , and may be said to perform the office both of the shell and its lining membrane in the pullet 's egg , serving as defence and allowing aeration .
The black matter which lines the vesicle probably tends to the defence of the young animals from the too powerful influence of the solar rays , frogs ' spawn being generally deposited in exposed situations .
Sir Everard observes , that in the aquatic Salamander , an animal whose mode of breeding closely resembles the frog , this nigrum pigmentum is wanting ; but that that animal deposits its eggs within the twisted leaves of water plants , which afford them an equivalent protection .
