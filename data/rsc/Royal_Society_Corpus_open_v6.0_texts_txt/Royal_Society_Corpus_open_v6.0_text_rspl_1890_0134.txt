] IV , " Preliminary Note on the Development of the Tuatara ( Sphenodonpunctatum ) .
" By Professor A. P. W. Thomas , M.A. , F.L.S. , F.G.S. , University College , Auckland , N.Z. Communicated by Professor E. Ray Lankester , F.R.S. Received May 19 , 1890 .
A grant was made by the Royal Society in the year 1884 to Professor J. T. Parker , of Dunedin , for the study of the development of Apteryx , Sphenodon and Callorhynclnis .
As Sphenodon does not occur near Dunedin , but is found chiefly on outlying islands belonging to the province of Auckland , at the opposite end of the colony , Professor Parker invited me to join him in the investigation of this form .
We gathered from what had been written on the natural history of the tuatara , as well as from oral information obtained from those who were best acquainted with the New Zealand fauna , that the month of February was probably the time at which the tuatara bred .
We therefore started from Auckland at the beginning of February , 1885 , for what appeared the most promising hunting-ground\#151 ; the island of Karewa , some ten miles from Tamanga , in the Bay of Plenty .
Mr. A. Reischek , a naturalist well known by his researches on the natural history of New Zealand , who had already had opportunities of observing the tuatara , was good enough to accompany us .
The island of Karewa is situated some four miles from the mainland ; it is little more than a rock which rises with precipitous sides high above the sea .
At one spot only can a landing be effected , as the island is exposed to the ocean swell rolling in from the open Pacific , whilst the shores are for the greater part formed by unscalable cliffs of rhyolitic rock .
Our first attempt at landing was frustrated by the swell , but a day later a second attempt was successful- The vegetation on the island is largely composed of small karaka trees and thickets of coprosma .
The light , loose soil between the roots of trees and the rocks is mined by countless burrows , in which live mutton-birds ( Puffinus tenuirostris ) and tuataras .
On the " Chicken Islands " the tuataras have been described by Mr. Reischek as living with certain other sea-birds , namely , another
