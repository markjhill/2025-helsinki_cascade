390 Preliminary Report upon the Injection of Rabbits with Protein-free ( Tuberculo- ) Antigen and Antigen-Serum Mixtures .
By Alfred H. Caulfeild , M.B. ( Communicated by Prof. T. G. Brodie , F.R.S. Received August 24 , \#151 ; Read November 2 , 1911 .
) ( From the Pathological Department of the National Sanatorium Association , Gravenhurst , Canada .
) The injection of animals and the further study of the resulting serological reactions have mainly been made with proteins , and one has tacitly accepted the view that the various phenomena were concerned chiefly with this class of antigen .
Previous work had shown that the injection of dogs with Vaughn 's non-toxic tubercle residue , which is rich in proteins , produced fixation bodies ( sensitisers , amboceptors ) to an alcohol-ether extract of tubercle bacilli prepared as described.* Following this it was shown that the injection of thisf protein-free extract produced the same result , specific sensitisers .
A determination of other biological reactions is in progress , and will be reported in connection with other parts of the work .
At present it can be stated that this serum usually is capable of precipitating certain of the tuberculous proteins .
The value of the experimental production and study of various biological reactions in animals is obvious , but it has become almost essential for the logical advancement of the investigation begun on patients .
From the data obtained in this manner many considerations suggest that the elective material for correlation of the various immunological states is often to be obtained wTith clinical normals under exposure and cases of early and slight involvements .
With the latter , initial implantations can probably only be obtained in children .
It is further desirable that the tuberculous infection be the predominant factor , * and not , as often one is forced to conceive , the apex of other pathologic conditions .
Obviously the assemblage of such * See preceding paper .
t From the method of preparation a few bacilli may be present in the extract .
The extent to which this condition may obtain can be shown to have no practical effect .
i In this connection , D. V. Hansemann ( ' Berl .
Klin .
Woclienschr .
, ' 1911 , vol. 48 , No. 1 ) states that it is not logical to say that the tubercle bacillus is the cause of pulmonaiy phthisis , as this applies to non-phthisieal tuberculosis , notably miliary tuberculosis and acute caseating bronchitis .
As regards true tuberculous phthisis , it can only be said that the tubercle is one of the cetiological factors which is certainly essential for the setting up of the typical caseous process , but which is not capable alone of causing phthisis .

Injection of Rabbits with [ Aug. 24 , material is difficult , and even then the work may be hampered by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities of serum with the desired reactions .
It would seem more probable that certain of the larger and more resistant .animals would respond in a more analogous fashion to man than rabbits , and it is hoped that later the work may be continued in this manner .
In the meantime , however , it seemed desirable to determine certain conditions with rabbits , the results of which may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The injection of rabbits with a saline dilution of an alcohol-ether extract of tubercle bacilli is capable of producing complement-fixation bodies .to that antigen .
( 2 ) The digestion at 37'50 C. of the alcohol-ether extract with inhibitive serum ( human ) for various intervals up to one hour does not affect the production of the specific sensitisers .
Examples of both antigen and antigen-anhibitive serum ( human ) mixtures are given in Table I. ( 3 ) The digestion at 37*5 ' C. of the alcohol-ether extract with fixation-positive serum ( rabbit ) for one hour inhibits the production of specific sensitisers ( Table II ) .

failed to do this ( Rabbit 105 , weight 1815 grm. ) .
( 6 ) With the amounts and time interval as shown in the tables there has been no evidence of anaphylaxis.* ( 7 ) The technique !
followed has already been outlined .
The rabbit 's blood was obtained by puncture of the ear vein and withdrawal by a 2 c.c. Record syringe .
This has been found to be the most rapid and satisfactory method of obtaining up to 5 c.c. of blood .
The needle and syringe are sterilised in hot oil , the needle being then well cleared in cold sterile saline .
* W. M. Scott ( " Anaphylaxis in the Rabbit : the Mechanism of its Symptoms , " ' Journ. Path , and Bact .
, ' 1911 , vol. 15 , No. 1 ) points out that anaphylactic symptoms depend for their severity upon the amount of precipitate produced in response to the sensitising dose .
It is further noted that " the low limit of dose for producing the sensitive condition probably lies about 1 c.c. of blood , " and that " the minute dose which it is essential to use in sensitising guinea-pigs towards foreign serum has no effect in the rabbit .
" It is difficult to compare these necessary amounts of blood quantitatively with the solid substances contained in the alcohol-ether extract , although , as already mentioned , the production of precipitation with tuberculo-protein has been demonstrated by injection of the tuberculo-protein-free antigen .

[ Nov. [ Noteadded November 23 , 1911.\#151 ; Since submitting these papers in August several articles by Kurt , Meyer , Muck , and others have appeared upon antigens , other than protein , with their effects both in test-tube and injection experiments .
Muck* shows that both tuberculo-fat mixtures and tuberculo-nastin act importantly in both test-tube and living experiments .
In contrast to these results Lautf reports that the injection of different tuberculo-products fails in healthy guinea-pigs , rabbits , and goats to produce specific fixation antibodies ; in the horse only were these results obtained .

By Prof. E. W. MacBride , E.R.S. , Imperial College of Science and Technology , South Kensington .
( Received November 7 , \#151 ; Read November 16 , 1911 .
) The manner in which parental characters are transmitted to the offspring when different species of Echinoderms are crossed has been the subject of much experimental enquiry and quite contradictory conclusions have been arrived at by different investigators .
Thus Vernon ( 13 ) , who carried out a most extensive series of experiments with the species of the genera Arbacia , Echinus , Strongylocentrotus , Sphaerechinus , and Eehinocardium which are available at Naples , came to the conclusion that the condition of the genital glands of the parents ( whether imperfectly ripe , fully ripe , or stale ) determines in many cases whether or not a hybrid will be formed , and further that though in the majority of cases the hybrid exhibits purely maternal characters , yet it sometimes exhibits paternal characters also , and that this result is also due to the condition of ripeness of the genital glands of its parents .
Herbst ( 5 ) , who also worked at Naples and who used the genera Echinus , Strongylocentrotus , and Sphaerechinus for his experiments , found also that the hybrids in many cases showed the paternal influence , but that the extent to which this influence was exhibited varied with the temperature .
Doncaster ( 1 ) , who likewise worked at Naples , also arrived at the conclusion that the greater or less development of paternal characters in the hybrid was due to the temperature .
On the other hand , Loeb ( 7 , 8 ) and his pupil Hagedoorn ( 4 ) came to the conclusion that the hybrid exhibited
