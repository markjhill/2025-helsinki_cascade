lative care , ensured exactitude for purposes of comparison between the behaviour of the magnetised and unmagnetised steel bars in the corrosive fluid .
An average of the twenty-nine experiments in Table I indicates an increase of corrosion in the steel due to magnetic influence of about 3 per cent , under the conditions of experimentation .
The steel bars were not highly magnetised , and I purposely exposed them to the action of the solution for somewhat long periods in the present experiments , as thereby , perhaps , affording a better indication of the influence of magnetisation on general corrosion , the almost immediate effect of magnetisation on the corrosion of steel having been demonstrated in the electrical observations of Part II .
It is probable that the deviation in the individual results of Table I , in the extent of the loss by corrosion , may be attributed to variation in the extent to which the several bars were magnetised .
The results recorded in the present paper indicate that magnetisation exerts an effect , though small , on the extent of the corrosive action of copper salts on iron and steel .
This is probably owing to the local currents , set up by magnetisation between the polar and central portions of the bars , inducing somewhat greater chemical action .
In some of the experiments with the copper solution which contained the more highly magnetised bars , the copper solution was of a perceptibly lighter colour towards the end of an experiment when compared with the colour of the copper solution containing the unmagnetised steel bar .

] A study of the spectra of flames offers many points of interest .
It is long since A. Mitscherlich ( Poggendorff 's 'Annalen , ' vol. 116 , p. 499 ; vol. 121 , p. 459 ) showed that the spectra of flames are , for the most part , those of compounds of the elements present , and contain comparatively few rays proceeding directly from the elements themselves .
But there are many questions still undecided .
For example , it is not known whether the vibrations which give the spectra of compounds in flames are those which the molecules of the compounds in question would assume under the action of a high temperature alone , or whether they are not vibrations of a different order , arising during 118 Profs .

On [ June 16 , chemical changes , and deriving their energy directly from the chemical energy of the interacting substances .
When the absorption spectrum of a compound is observed to correspond with its emission spectrum in a flame , we may infer that the vibrations are those which the compound molecule assumes when sufficiently heated .
But there are not many cases in which this has been observed .
We have observed it in the case of cyanogen ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 44 , p. 247 , note ) , but we are not certain of any other case .
The difference between the spectrum of the base of a flame and that of the upper part , observed in many flames , lends support to the supposition that there ure rays which originate in the chemical change , perhaps occurring in the molecules which are in intermediate stages of the change , and not assumed by the molecules which are the final product , even when intensely heated in the upper part of the flame .
The fact that the same rays which are seen in the base of a flame may be sometimes generated by electric discharges in the gases which are burnt in the flame , or in their products of combustion , is not at all inconsistent with this supposition , for such discharges certainly have electrolytic effects , and may very well give rise to molecules in the intermediate stages between one state of chemical combination and another.* The flames of substances , such as the organo-metallic compounds , into which metals enter as chemical ingredients , have not hitherto , so far as we know , been observed , and it is to two such flames that these notes refer .
Spectrum of the Flame The remarkable compound of nickel and carbonic oxide , Ni(CO)4 , discovered by Mr. Mond , burns in air with a luminous , smoky flame , and the spectrum it emits appears to be a continuous one .
When the vapour is burnt in oxygen instead of in atmospheric air , the spectrum still appears to be quite continuous ; in fact , such a spectrum as carbonic oxide , without any nickel , gives under similar circumstances .
This , however , is only in appearance , because the brightness of the continuous spectrum overpowers the feebler bands and lines which belong to the flame of the nickel compound .
These bands and lines come out when the vapour of the nickel compound is diluted with a * It is sometimes assumed in books on chemistry that the atoms which form a chemical compound can never be in an intermediate state between complete separation and complete combination .
So inconceivable an assumption would hardly have been made except to support a theory , but it has nevertheless obtained a certain currency .
It is supported by no fact and no analogy .
Two atoms which are within the spheres of each other 's influence , but have not yet reached the state of relative tranquillity which we recognise as chemical combination , may very conceivably be the seat of very violent agitation and vibratory motions , which cease when they are actually combined .

good deal of hydrogen .
We have employed two methods of making such a mixture .
The first was by passing a stream of dry hydrogen , mixed with carbonic oxide , over reduced nickel in a glass tube , and burning the issuing gas in a double jet with oxygen either outside or inside the burning gas .
The nickel was freshly reduced at a gentle heat with hydrogen , and allowed to cool in carbonic oxide .
When quite cold the stream of mixed hydrogen and carbonic oxide was found to take up quite enough nickel at the temperature of the room , and would continue to do so for some hours .
After a time , however , the nickel required to be again warmed in a current of hydrogen , when some water was given off , and the metal recovered its sensitiveness .
Another plan was to pass a stream of hydrogen through a ( J -tube containing a little of the liquid nickel compound in the bend .
The result was the same in each case , but the proportion of vapour of the compound was more easily varied ( by simply varying the proportion of carbonic oxide in the stream of gas ) in the former method .
The mixed gas and vapour burnt in air with a smoky flame , but in a full supply of oxygen with a bright yellowish-green flame without visible smoke .
The first jet we used was of platinum , but nickel-carbonyl deposits nickel at a red heat , so that the platinum soon became coated with a thick deposit of nickel , which qhoked the orifices .
This nickel adhered so closely to the platinum that it could not well be removed mechanically , and had to be dissolved off .
We found it , therefore , more convenient to use a jet made of a piece of porcelain tube , about 1 cm .
in diameter , with a narrow porcelain tube , fitted by means of a cork , in the axis of the wider tube .
The mixed gas and vapour were passed either through the inner or through the outer tube , and oxygen through the other .
The porcelain being a bad conductor , no nickel was deposited on it , except close to the orifice , whence it could be easily removed mechanically without disturbing the apparatus .
The porcelain , of course , added some lines to the spectrum , but these were easily .detected .
In fact , we noticed only the lines \lt ; ?f .
sodium , calcium , and lithium .
The spectrum of the flame of the nickel-carbonyl thus diluted consists of two parts : ( 1 ) the spectrum of the main body of the green flame , ( 2 ) that of the base of the flame when the oxygen is outside , and of the surface of the small inner cone when the oxygen is inside , the flame .
t .
The spectrum of the main body of the flame consists of a series of shaded bands , brightest in the green , but extending on the red side beyond the red line of lithium , and on the violet side well into the \ blue , though with rapidly diminishing distinctness .
These bands have their sharp bright edges on the more refrangible side , that is , they Are turned in the opposite direction to the bands produced by electric 120 Profs .
G. D. Living and J. Dewar .
On the [ June 16 , discharges in carbonic oxide at low pressure .
The positions of the bright edges of the bands in the flame of the nickel-carbonyl have some correspondence with those of the bands produced by electric discharges in carbonic oxide , but it is not a very close one , and may be only accidental .
With the dispersion employed , which gives a difference of deviation of 2 ' 52 ' between D and F , there was no sign of a resolution of these bands into lines .
The brightest bands had , however , their more refrangible edges pretty sharply defined , while the less bright bands , especially those in the blue , were very hazy .
A certain amount of continuous spectrum , of course , overlay the bands , and made them somewhat less distinct .
Photographs show that this continuous spectrum continues as far as X 3500 , bat fading sensibly from A 4200 onwards .
The photographs do not show any extension of the bands beyond the blue .
Besides the bands , a few lines , but only a few , in the visible part of the spectrum , extend into the upper part of the flame .
Of these few only one is a known line of nickel ; it is the green line X 5476 .
This was also the only line of nickel which we observed in the visible part of the spectrum in explosions of hydrogen and oxygen in a nickel-lined tube ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 36 , p. 475 ) .
In the ultra-violet part of the spectrum of the flame a great number of nickel lines were photographed ; indeed , by far the greater part of the lines of nickel found by us in the arc ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 179 ( 1888 ) , A , p. 247 ) between X3972 and X 2943 5 .
In this case also there is a close correspondence between the spectra of the flame and of the explosions , except that the lines of the flame are much more numerous than those recorded of the explosions .
This difference , however , is probably due to the much shorter exposure of the photographs of explosions .
Although the photographs show lines as high as X 2943 , the lines in this region are very faint , and gradually die out in proceeding from the less to the more refrangible side of the spectrum .
In the region about L , M , and N the lines are very strong , so that it is for rays of those rates of vibration that nickel is most sensitive at the temperature of the flame .
Turning now to the base of the flame , we find a great number of lines , of which most extend but a short distance from the bottom of the flame .
They form two principal groups , one in the orange and red , and the other in the citron and yellow .
These lines are for the most partly sharply defined , and in the more refrangible parts of each group very fine and closely set .
They are probably channellings following Rydberg 's law , and somewhat confused by overlapping .
The diagram indicates the strongest of these liaes , as they appear on the background of shaded bands in the flame .
It is drawn to a scale of oscillation frequencies .
Rone of these lines appear to be nickel lines , and , as they are limited 1892 .

to the base of the flame , they cannot be ascribed to any of the final products of the combustion , such as nickel oxide , but must be due either to the as yet unaltered molecules of nickel carbonyl , or to some molecules intermediate between that compound and the products of combustion which have only a transitory existence , and may perhaps have a transitory agitation of a particular kind imparted to them by the chemical energy which changes its form in the combustion .
The following tables give the approximate oscillation frequencies of the edges of the principal shaded bands , and of the lines seen at the base of the flame , but the numbers are only approximate .

The continuous spectrum of the limelight extends some distance further than the most refrangible of these nickel lines .
Flame of Zinc Ethide .
Zinc ethide burning undiluted produces so much continuous spectrum as to overpower any special rays .
But by passing a stream of hydrogen through a bent tube containing zinc ethide , and burning the mixed gas and vapour in oxygen , as we did the nickel-carbonyl , * A query is placed against this number because the water spectrum is so strong at this point that we cannot certainly distinguish the nickel line .
There is no other reason for doubting its presence .

12 3 1892.1 we reduced the continuous spectrum sufficiently to enable us to observe any fairly strong rays which might be peculiar to the flame .
In the visible part of the spectrum the three well-known rays of zinc in the blue A 4812 , 4721 , and 4681 were easily seen .
Photographs of the more refrangible part of the spectrum showed no trace of the ultra-violet lines of zinc ; no more , in fact , than the flames of hydrocarbons usually show .
Nor did there appear to be any rays from the base of the flame other than those seen in hydrocarbon flames in general .
In our observations on explosions ( .
cit. ' ) we did not find that a zinc lining to the tube in which the oxy-hydrogen gas was exploded brought out any zinc line , either in the visible or ultraviolet part of the spectrum .
The flame of the compound containing zinc chemically combined may be supposed to give the rays of zinc more readily .than the exploding gases , which merely take up the metal mechanically .
But the flame does not , in either case , seem hot enough to develop the ultra-violet rays , though these are very strongly developed in the arc .

" Preliminary Note on the Pressure developed by some New Explosives .
" By Captain Noble , C.B. , F.R.S. Received June 10 , 1892 .
For a considerable time I have , with the assistance of Sir F. Abel and Professor Dewar , been engaged in researches upon the new explosives which during the last few years have attracted so much attention , and which apparently are destined to do much in developing the power of modern artillery .
From the nature of these researches and the considerable scale upon which they have to be conducted , as well as from certain difficulties which have manifested themselves , I am not at present in a position to submit to the Royal Society the results of these experiments ; but , as one particular portion throws light upon a question of considerable importance , I propose very shortly to give the results at which I have arrived , leaving fuller details for a subsequent communication .
Artillerists of all nations are pretty well agreed that , save under exceptional circumstances , the maximum working pressure in a gun should not exceed 17 tons per square inch or , say 2500 atmospheres .
The reasons for this limitation are weighty , but I need not here discuss them .
Now , taking cordite and pebble powder as illustrations , since we can , even in guns not designed to fire the former explosive , obtain with the same maximum pressure , energies higher than those obtained with pebble powder by nearly 50 per cent. , it is obvious that
