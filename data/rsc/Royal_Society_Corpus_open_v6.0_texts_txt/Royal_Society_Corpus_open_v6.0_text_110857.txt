Sec. R.S. The present paper purports to be the sequel of a work , already published by the author , on the subject of the education of animals .
It is the first part only of the paper which is here presented , and contains preliminary observations on the nature of the inquiries which the author proposes to enter into in the subsequent parts .
It is divided into three chapters ; the first comprising some general remarks on the objects to be attained in the education of animals , and some criticisms on the opinions of preceding writers relating to the subject ; the second treating principally of Instinct and its characteristic features , as contrasted with Intelligence and Reason ; and the third entering into various metaphysical disquisitions on the nature and peculiar sphere of action of the different intellectual faculties , both those which are common to man and the lower animals , and those which are peculiar to the former .
