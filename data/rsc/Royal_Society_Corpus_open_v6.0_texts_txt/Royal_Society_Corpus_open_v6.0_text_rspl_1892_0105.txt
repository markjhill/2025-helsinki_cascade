] modulus : that is , that there are numbers whose successive powers have for their rests the complete set of numbers less than , and prime to the modulus .
A primitive root may he said to generate by its successive powers the complete set of rests .
It is also known that in general , when the modulus is any composite number , though primitive roots do not exist , there may be laid down a set of numbers , which will here be called generators , the products of powers of which give the complete set of rests prime to the modulus .
The principal object of Part I is to investigate the relations which must subsist among any such set of generators ; to determine the most general form that they can take ; to show how to form any such set of generators , and , conversely , to furnish tests for the efficiency , as generators , of any given set of numbers .
Other results which are obtained as instrumental in effecting these objects , such as the determination of the number of numbers that belong to any exponent , may also possess independent interest .
The object of Part II is to make , for complex numbers , an investigation which shall be as nearly as possible parallel to that of Part I for real numbers .
Much of the work of Part I may be applied immediately to complex numbers ; of the rest some will need slight modiB-cation , and some will need replacing by propositions leading to corresponding results .
Of those cases which thus call for independent treatment , the most noticeable is that of the modulus ( l + i)\ which is the complex analogue of the real modulus 2\ The work is put in the form of a series of propositions , and is started almost from first principles .
The early part is consequently elementary , but the advantages of completeness and ease of reference may be more than sufficient to compensate for this .
A large number of illustrative examples are given .
These will sometimes , perhaps , assist in elucidating the symbolical proofs which they follow : in all cases they will help to maintain clearly the actual arithmetical meaning of the results arrived at , a meaning which may easily seem obscure if it be noticed only in its symbolical and generalised form .
The Appendix contains tables of indices for complex numbers for all moduli whose norms do not exceed 100 .

A List of the Presents received was laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " Transformers .
" By John Perry , F.R.S. , Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics , City and Guilds Technical College , Finsbury .
Received March 23 , 1892 .
I. In a transformer with many circuits , of resistances in ohms and numbers of turns Rj , Ni , R2 , N2 , \amp ; c. ; let the currents at any instant bo Ci , C2 , \amp ; c. , amperes , and let the independent electromotive forces ei , e2 , \amp ; c. , volts be maintained in them ; let I be the total magnetic induction which threads through all the circuits ( 108 C.G.S. units being taken as the unit of induction ) .
The equations to the circuit\#174 ; are:\#151 ; e1 = R1C1 + N16\gt ; I , e2 = R2C2+Na0l , \amp ; c. , using 6 for d/ dt .
Multiplying each equation by its N and dividing by its R and adding , we find , using A for the ampere turns N1Ci+N2C2-f-\amp ; c. and qfor ^+^+\amp ; c. , A + q0l = 2(Ni/ Ri)e , - ... ... .
