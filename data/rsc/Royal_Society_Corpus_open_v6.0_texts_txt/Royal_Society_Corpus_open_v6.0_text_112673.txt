( Abstract ) .
Although the practical and natural classification of the Madreporaria ( Sclerodermic Zoantharia ) which has been submitted by MM .
MilneEdwards and Jules Haime is very generally admitted to be the best , still there are great gaps in the succession of the genera , and , moreover , some genera cannot be placed .
The " ' break " between the Turbinolides and the Astraeides is so great as to render the classification rather artificial ; but Dr. Duncan 's discovery of a genus Asterosmilia , comprising several species , unites these great divisions .
The new genus has the peculiarities of the Trochocyathi , but in addition it is furnished with an endotheca .
The species are described .
The genera HeteropJhyllia , McCoy , and Battersbyia , Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime , are amongst those incertce sedis .
The discovery of several new species of Heterophyllia enables Dr. Duncan to determine the anatomy of the genus , to offer for consideration the most extraordinary coral form he has ever seen , and to ally the genus with Battersbyia , which he proves had no coenenchyma .
The species of both of the genera are described shortly , and the development and reproduction of B. gemmans also .
The genera are placed amongst the Astraeidse .
The genus Palceocyclus , M.-E .
&amp; J. H. , supposed to be one of the Fungidme , is proved to be a vesiculo-tuibulate coral genus , and to be one of the CyathophyllidEe .
One Mesozoic family is therefore removed from the Palwozoic coral-fauna , and two genera of a Mesozoic division are introduced .
They foreshadow the Thecosmilise of the Trias .
