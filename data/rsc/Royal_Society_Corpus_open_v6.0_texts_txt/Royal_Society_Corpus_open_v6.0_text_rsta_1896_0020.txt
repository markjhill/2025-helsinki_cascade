600 MR. A. W. RtTCKER AND DR. T. E. THORPE ON A MAGNETIC which it may once for all be determined whether they are fixed or varying , and , if the latter , for tracing their changes .
The agreement between our two surveys , and the approximate agreement of our results in Scotland with those which we deduced from Mr. Welsh 's measurements made in that country about a quarter of a century before our own ( " 1890 Memoir , " p. 293 ) , sufficiently prove that if the local Disturbing Forces alter , they change but slowly .
We hope , however , that our work will be repeated by others in the not very distant future .
It would not be necessary to observe at as many stations as those we have studied , for our pioneer investigation has shown where the most definite results are to be sought , and has also proved that the terrestrial lines may be obtained with sufficient accuracy , in the centre of the country at all events , from two hundred stations .
If from fifty to a hundred more were chosen from among those between which we have proved that the ridge lines now run , a definite answer would be obtained to the question whether the loci of attraction have moved from between those stations in the interval .
We venture to think that the results would be more conclusive if the methods of working up the observations were as similar as possible to those we have used .
