] At the commencement of this paper the author states the advantages which may be derived from the emnployment of analogical reasoning in mathematics , and recommends it as a very useful guide to new discoveries : he then proceeds to point out the striking resemblance which subsists between several parts of common algebra and the integral calculus , and similar parts of the calculus of functions .
Mr. Babbage then notices certain fractions which , by peculiar relations among the functions of which they consist , become evanescent .
The true values of these fractions are ascertained , and they are applied to the solution of a class of functional equations which the author had solved in a former paper , from which the following result is obtained:- " Whenever the mode of solution there adopted seems to fail , the failure is apparent only , and the general solution may always be deduced from it .
" Several points of resemblance between the integral calculus and that of functions , are then noticed ; and a remarkable analogy between a method of integrating , differential equations , and a mode of solving functional equations , is pointed out ; in both cases the operations are performed by multiplying by a factor , whose form is to be determined by another equation .
Some equations are given in which this method is successful , and the obstacles to its general application are pointed out as demanding further inquiry .
