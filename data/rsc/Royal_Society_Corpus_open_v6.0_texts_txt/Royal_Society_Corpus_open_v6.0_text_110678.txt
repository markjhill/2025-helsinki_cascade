A paper was also read , entitled " On the theory of the dark bands formed in the solar spectrum from partial interception by transparent plates .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Sa ?
vilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
This paper contains the mathematical investigation of the phenomena of peculiar dark bands crossing the prismatic spectrum , when half the pupil of the eye , looking through the prism , is covered by a thin plate of any transparent substance , the edge being turned from the violet towards the red end of the spectrum ; and which were first noticed by Mr. Fox Talbot , and were ascribed by Sir Da ?
vid Brewster to a new property of light , consisting of a peculiar kind of polarity .
The author shows , that on the undulatory theory , in all cases , a difference of retardation between the two halves of each primary pencil throughout the spectrum may give bands within certain limits ; and that it affords a complete explanation of the phenomena in question .
