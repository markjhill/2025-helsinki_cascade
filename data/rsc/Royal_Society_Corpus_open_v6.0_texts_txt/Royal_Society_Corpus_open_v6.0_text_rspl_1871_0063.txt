]\gt ; observational element , but that they are chiefly due to atmospheric turbances , which no instrumental perfection can control .
As to vertical angles , the test of direct levelling compared with trigor metrical eVelling , applied to a distance of 2700 miles , shows a between the resuIts of these two independent methods averaging per 100 miles , or of an inch per mile .
There seems little room instrumental improvement here .
In respect to astronomically detel .
azimuths , I hope the present instrument will give improved results , on account of the superior steadinw of level which I think it possesses .
For the determination of astronomical latitudes it has more powerful more complete vertical appliances than any former theodolite , and it shMA therefore give better results .
Finally , I believe it will be found to be more permanent in its adjM .
ments , and more con venient both to ftdjust and to use , than any of its decessors .
To these points , as those which makers , not being observer4 are peculiarly prone to overlook or mismanage , I have given the mcu } earnest attention , knowing how indispens it is that a man engaged iu the most difficult and refined of all obserrations should be spared every anxiety and inconveuience which it is in the power of mechanical ance to prevent .
If I have in some only attained this appttrently humble object , I shall feel that the laboul .
of years and the anxious of many a sleepless night have been in vain .

329 secting in aline Q. If we suppose one bone AB to be fixed and the other bone to be movable , and that the contraction of the muscle compels the bone to evolve round as an axis of rotation , it is required to fiud the conditions necessary in order that the work done by the contraction of the muscle shall be lnaxlmum .
I shall in this note discuss the case in which the bones A lie in the same plane .
In this case I have succeeded in demonstrating the following propositions in the case of maximum work : 1 .
The axis of rotation must be formed by the intersection of rectangular planes passing through Al } and 2 .
The teral muscle A must be inscribable in a circle .
If it be true ( as I believe it is ) that the muscles , bones , and joints of all verlc'orate nnimals are so related to each other as to produce in all cases the maximum amount of work possible with a given weight of musde , then the second proposition affords us a severe test of the truth or falsehood of my postulate .
If the muscle be circumscribable by a circle , it follows , from Ptolemy 's theorem , that its sides and diagonals must fulfil the following condition :\mdash ; where are one pair of opposite sides and the other pair , and are the onals of the quadrilateral .
The pectineus muscle of many nimals forms a plane quadrilateral when in its position of maximum extension of fibres , and erefore furnishes us with a favourable test .
In he freshly dissected animal it is easy to measure with the lengths of the six lines in question , and so test the truth of the postulate .
I have thus obtained the follo ing results:\mdash ; 1 .
