( Abstract .
) The author gave a detailed description of his apparatus , and of the method employed in drying the air .
The result of his experiments gave as the coefficient of increase of elasticity of air of constant volume for 1 ?
F. 0'002040 , this being slightly different from that given by Regnault , which is 0'002036 .
He also finds that the temperature of the freezing-point of mercury is constant , and that its value on Fahrenheit 's scale , as given by an air-thermometer , is -37ยง 93 , while as recorded by a standard mercurial thermometer it is -38 ?
'00 .
It is probable that this difference is owing to an anomalous contraction of mercury before it freezes , similar to the corresponding expansion of water ; but this effect in the case of mercury seems to be very small , and it may be said that a mercurial thermometer properly graduated , will denote the true temperature , even down to the freezing-point of the mercury itself .
