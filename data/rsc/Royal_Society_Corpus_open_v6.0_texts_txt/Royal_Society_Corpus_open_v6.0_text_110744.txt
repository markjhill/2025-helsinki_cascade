" On the Phenomena of thin plates of Solid and Fluid Sub ?
stances exposed to polarised light .
" By Sir David Brewster , K.H. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp; V.P.R.S. Ed. From a theoretical investigation of the phenomena described in this paper , the author deduces the important law , that when two polarized pencils , reflected from the surface of a thin plate , lying on a reflecting surface of a different refractive power , interfere , half an undulation is not lost , and white-centred rings are produced .
When the inclination is exactly 90 ?
, the pencils do not interfere , and no rings are produced .
