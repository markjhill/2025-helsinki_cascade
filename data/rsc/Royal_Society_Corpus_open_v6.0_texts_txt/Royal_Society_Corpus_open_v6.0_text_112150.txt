" On the Summation of Series .
" By W. H. L. RUSSELL , Esq. , A.B. Communicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received May 13 , 1865 .
In a Memoir published in the Philosophical Transactions for the yearl855 , I applied the Theory of Definite Integrals to the summation of many intricate series .
I have thought my researches on this subject might well be terminated by the following paper , in which I have pointed out methods for the summation of series of a far more complicated nature .
I commence with some remarks intended to give clear conceptions of the general method of calculation .
In any series , uo + au1+ a2u + 3u , + &amp;c. + au + &amp;c. Where a is less than unity , it is evident that we can sum the series by a definite integral when u , =fdu U1 UX , U1 and U being functions of u , and the integral being taken between certain assigned limits .
For it is manifest that the quantity under the integral sign then becomes a geometrical progression .
Again , for a similar reason we can express by a definite integral the sum of the series uovowo ... i+ 'au2U , vw2 ... - .
+ &amp;c. + atuZvZw , ... + &amp;c. , where u. =fdu UU , vu =fdvVV ' , wX=fdwW , Wx , &amp;c. Lastly , we can sum the series UoV0Wo ... + Ol uv1W1 ... + a2V2W2 , w ... + &amp;c. +O tUvZw ... + &amp;c. by a definite integral when u , =fduUlU fd'UU +f U duf1U'flUJ+. .
vX=fdvV1Vx f/ dvy+ f fdv v , m +fdvfr I + .
w=f dwWW + fdw'W'W'X +f dwl"W ' , W"+. .
&amp;c. = &amp;c. , the number of each set of quantities u , , u ' , &amp;c. , vI , ' , &amp;c. , , , w ' , &amp;c. being of course finite .
I shall now consider the series ?
( 0)(0)+ ( 1)1 ) + ( ) 2(2+a2 ( 2)( + &amp;c. +ao(x)X+ )+ &amp;c. , where q(x ) and i(x ) are rational functions of ( x ) .
Let ( ?
) = ( a + x ) ( )a + , X ) ( 2+ ). .
( a + bx ) ( a1 + b ) ( a2 + bx ) ... ( x)mm++n +nm 2n+n m 2+ Hence , by what has been said , the problem is reduced to finding a definite 1 integral of the formfdu UJ1U equivalent to { + } m+ n Now 1 a+bx 1 { a+bix }}m+n1 r4 du.u+ ( log l)m+nx\m+nxo " a+bx 1 1I 7r m+n-1 + OX.1\ -sin nx-1 P du.u+ loge nx 7r m+ nx m+ nx JW1r7 1 .

log u( , a -+i-1 ) Elogeloge ( mnx ) ( where log , loge1 is positive ) .
u By means of these transformations the series is reduced to forms considered in my previous investigations ; for the general term of the transformed series included under the signs of definite integration is of the form Pax em +n { CO h ( m + nx)sin k ( m + n ) } , a form which I have discussed in the memoir in the Philosophical Transactions mentioned at the beginning of this paper .
Next let us investigate the series C/ A(0)+ XX(o ) + a4/ +( ) + 4/ x(l ) - .

The general term of the series included under the signs of definite integration is now of the form 3r P(x)E , l4(X ) X(x)X(x ) rn , belonging to a class which I have considered in my former memoir .
Let us now consider the series V/ +(o ) r(o ' + a. , M- &gt; 1 ) a. , _(2 +y ( . .
