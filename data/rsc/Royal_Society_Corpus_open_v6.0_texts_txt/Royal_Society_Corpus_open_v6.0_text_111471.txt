" A Fifth Memoir upon Quantics .

( Abstract .
) The present memoir was originally intended to contain a development of the theories of the covariants of certain binary quantics , viz. the quadric , the cubic , and the quartic ; but as regards the theories of the cubic and the quartic , it was found necessary to consider the case of two or more quadrics , and I have therefore comprised such systems of two or more quadrics , and the resulting theories of the harmonic relation and of involution , in the subject of the memoir ; and although the theory of homography or of the anharmonic relation belongs rather to the subject of bipartite binary quadrics , yet from its connexion with the theories just referred to , it is also considered in the memoir .
The paragraphs are numbered continuously with those of my former memoirs on the subject : Nos. 92 to 95 relate to a single quadric ; Nos. 96 to 114 to two or more quadrics , and the theories above referred to ; Nos. 115 to 127 to the cubic , and Nos. 128 to 145 to the quartic .
The several quantics are considered as expressed not only in terms of the coefficients , but also in terms of the roots , and I consider the question of the determination of their linear factors , -a question , in effect , identical with that of the solution of a quadric , cubic , or biquadratic equation .
The expression for the linear factor of a quadric is deduced from a well-known formula ; those for the linear factors of a cubic and a quartic were first given in my " Note sir les Covariants d'une fonction quadratique , cubique ou biquadratique a deux indeterminees , " Crelle , vol. 1 .
pp. 285 to 287 , 1855 .
It is remarkable that they are in one point of view more simple than the expression for the linear factor of a quadric .
