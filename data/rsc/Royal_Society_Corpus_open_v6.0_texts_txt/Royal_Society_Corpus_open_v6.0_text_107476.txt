Observations on the heights of mountains in the nort of England .
By Thomas Greatorex , Esq. F. L. S. ha letter to Thomas Young , M. D. For .
Sec. R. S. Read May 7 , 1818 .
HAVING been desirous , for many years past , to revisit the lakes in the north of England , and wishing , when I should be able to take that tour , to make some experiments on one of the mountains in that district , I applied to the late Mr. RAMSD N , who made for me the following instruments : A mountain barometer. .
A stationary do .
( the mercury of both boiled in the tube .
) A telescope with cross-wires , and a level fitted to it , mounted on a tripod-staff .
And a small theodolite , with compass , &amp;c. These he assured me were made with the greatest care .
I have this summer passed some weeks in the vicinity of the Lakes ; and at Keswick I fortunately met with one of those superior self-taught geniuses , not uncommon in the North , who entered into all my views , and proved eminently serviceable to me .
His name is OTLEY , and he is a watchmaker , but acts occasionally as guide up the mountains , &amp;c. As I wished to measure Skiddaw geometrically down to the average level of Derwent Water , I had a tapering staff made about e8 feet long , shod with an iron point , and very carefully graduated from an accurate standard yard measure , sent from the proper office , in London .
The graduation commenced from a zero about 3 feet from the bottom of the staff , so that from the zero to its top was exactly 25 feet ; the top ending in a bluntish point .
Twelve feet six inches of the upper part of the staff could occasionally be separated from the lower part , both for the convenience of carrying , and in case the wind should prevent the use of the whole length .
Small cords were also attached to it , for the purpose of holding it steady and perpendicular .
We first determined the height of OTLEY'S house above the lake , which was io yards , and at this height the stationary barometer was placed ; and Mr. CROSTHWAITE , of the Keswick Museum , undertook to note its variation and that of the thermometer every half hour .
We then ascended Skiddaw , accompanied by Mr. AIREY , a black-lead pencil maker ( who proved an excellent assistant ) , and two boys .
On the summit the barometer was set up .
I first adjusted it , and privately noted down the height of the mercury ; then purposely deranged it , to let OTLEY re-adjust it , and write down his observation , which never differed from mine more than one thousandth of an inch during the whole series of observations .
The heights of the attached and detached thermometers being also noted , we proceeded to the measurement by the level and staff .
The telescope being levelled , and its cross wires intersecting the highest point of the mountain , it was then pointed in the direction of the , most convenient descent , and the staff carried down the hill till its top exactly coincided with the cross wires , the level of the telescope being carefully preserved ; the perpendicularity of the staff was ascertained by 396 plumb lines .
And here I must mention how greatly we were favoured by the weather : the sun only shone during the first observation , and it was nearly a calm during the whole of the measurement , so that AREY could frequently , by inserting the pole a little in the ground , set it on a balance , which would remain during the time necessary for adjusting the level , and observing it .
I have also to observe , that we chose so precipitous a descent , that the pole was seldom 40 feet from the telescope , therefore no allowance was necessary for the earth 's curvature .
I found the most expeditious and exact mode of managing the pole , was to stop Mr. AIREY , when I perceived its top to be about an inch above the cross wires ; as I could then make signs to him to press it into the earth by little and little till the coincidence was exact : the telescope was then carried down to the pole , and placed ( when levelled ) in exact correspondence with the zero .
The pole was again removed down to a new station , and this mode continued till we had completed six observations , or 50 yards of descent .
Here the barometer was again set up , separately examined as before ; and this process continued to the foot of the mountain .
After descending 175 yards , it was necessary to take a dead level of half a mile , which was corrected by several observations back and forward , as also by a middle station .
We measured 4oo yards down the first day , and on the following day completed goo yards , which brought us to the village of Applethwaite , and near the level of Bristow Hill , about a mile distant .
The next day many observations were made back and 397 forward between Armathwaite and Bristow Hill , allowing 8 inches for the earth 's curvature : a small allowance appeared necessary for refraction , the object appearing rathter lower than it ought to have been , ( This was in the forenoon .
) From Bristow Hill , by means of a middle station , a level was taken to Crow Park , close to the lake , and the measurement completed down to the mean height of Derwent Water .

By Dr , MASKELYNE 171.333 error 4.667 By Dr. HvTroN From the near agreement of the measured and barometrical heights on the summit of Skiddaw , I had formed sanguine hopes that the barometer would prove a most exact determinator of altitudes , and almost supersede the necessity of having recourse to any other mode ; but the subsequent observations lead me to fear that the state of the atmosphere has an effect which we cannot yet account for , and to which we cannot apply a correction .
When the operation was discontinued on the evening of the 5th , the air was dry and clear ; but on the morning of the 6th , the top of the mountain was clouded about 300 yards down , which might be the reason of the two observations differing by more than four yards .
But the object of this paper is not to surmise , or submit any hypothesis ; but faithfully to state the result of operations carried on with all the exactness I was capable of .
If what I have done be deemed worthy of any attention by the learned and distinguished Society of which you , Sir , are a member , I shall be most highly gratified , and amply compensated for the toil attending operations on high mountains .
THOMAS GREATOREX .
P. S. Dr. MASKELYNE'S rules for determining the height of mountains by the barometer , are these : ist .
Take the difference of the tabular logarithms of the observed barometrical heights at the two stations , considering the four first figures ( exclusive of the index ) as whole nunm bers , and the remaining figures to the right as decimals .
sdly .
Observe the difference of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer at the two stations ; multiply this difference by - , 4 and add or subtract this product , according as the thermometer was highest at the upper or lower station , which will give an approximate height .
gdly .
Take the mean of the two altitudes of the thermometer , and find the difference between this mean and 32o .
Multiply the approximate height by this difference , and the product by the decimal fraction.oo244 .
This last correction being added to , or subtracted from the approximate height , according as the mean of the two altitudes of FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer was greater or less than 3s ?
, will give the true height of the upper station in English fathoms .
Dr. HUTTON'S rules .
ist .
Let the heights of the barometer at the top and bottom of any elevation intended to be measured , be observed as near the same time as may be , as also the temperatures of the attached thermometers , and also the temperature of the air in the shade at both stations , by means of detached thermometers .
sdly .
Reduce these altitudes of the barometer to the same temperature by augmenting the height of the mercury in the colder temperature , or diminishing that in the warmer by its V , o part for every degree of difference of the two .
3dly .
Take the difference of the common logarithms of the two heights of the barometer ( so corrected ) , considering the four first figures ( exclusive of the index ) as whole numbers , and the rest to the right as decimals , which will give an approximate height .
MDcccxvIII .
G 4thly .
Tae the mean of the two detached thermometers ; and for every degree which this differs from 3t ?
, take so many times the z part of the approximate height ; and add them if the mean temperature be above S3 ?
; but subtract them if it be below Si ' ; and the sum or difference will be the true altitude in fathoms .
