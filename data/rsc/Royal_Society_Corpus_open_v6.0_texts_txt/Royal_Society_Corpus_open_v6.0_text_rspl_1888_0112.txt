( Abstract .
) This paper contains an account of a large number of experiments made with the object of determining the velocity of waves of com* pression caused by explosions under water .
The method adopted depended on the use of a certain devised for the occasion , whereby the arrival of the disturbance at a given point was transmitted to a chronograph .
The disturbances themselves were caused by submarine explosions of dynamite and guncotton in quantities varying from nine ounces four pounds .
The distance over which the velocity was measured was a 200 yards .
c P rt The water was that of the Pacific Ocean in the harbour o ... Jackson , N.S. Wales .

The absolute time was obtained by comparing the chronojpf^r tuning fork with an astronomical clock .

( Abstract .
) The subject of the paper of which this is an abstract , is the determination of the rate of change of the velocity of the propagation of an explosion in gaseous explosive mixtures .
It has been noticed by several investigators , viz. , MM .
Berthelot and Vielle , MM .
Mallard and Le Chatelier , and Professor H. B. Dixon , I.R.S. , that explosive gaseous mixtures after ignition do not reach their maximum velocity of propagation at once , but that a certain maximum velocity is attained soon after initial ignition .
In order to investigate this interesting period , which may be called the acceleration period of an explosion , chronographic measurements 'f a peculiar nature were found necessary .
It was at once evident that but little advance in this branch of the snbject of explosions could be made unless exceedingly minute periods time could be measured with certainty .
