) The close connexion between the cathode rays and the more recently discovered Rontgen rays gives a new interest to the study of the properties of the former , although , indeed , the two widely different views that are held as to the nature of these rays render such an impetus unnecessary .
One theory holds that the cathode rays are a stream of material particles shot off from the negative electrode , and carrying with them a negative charge , while the other theory ascribes the rays to a phenomenon in the ether .
Both theories have received a large amount of support .
Hertz* found that thin films of gold-leaf , when placed in the path of the rays were sufficiently transparent to allow a slight phosphorescence to be produced behind the films .
This at first sight does not appear consistent with the view that the cathode rays consist of a stream of charged particles , and that the phosphorescence is produced by the rapid approach of these particles up to the surface of the phosphorescing* substance .
Even the thinnest films of gold-leaf could not allow the passage through them of such material particles .
But it has been suggested by Professor J. J. Thomsonf that under the action of the cathode rays the thin film of gold-leaf itself acts as a cathode , and thus from its further surface we have rays given off similar to those given off by the primary cathode .
If this be the true explanation of the phenomenon we would expect these secondary cathode rays to be identical in their properties with the primary cathode rays which produce them .
Recently Lenard , J in a very valuable series of experiments , has studied the secondary rays which are pi'oduced , and which are usually called by his name , when the cathode rays fall upon thin films of aluminium , and the results he obtains appear to be explicable by the above-mentioned suggestion of Professor J. J. Thomson .
The experiments described in this paper have to do , partly with these Lenard rays , and partly with the cathode rays themselves .
In the first place experiments were devised to test whether the rays produced by the incidence of the cathode rays on thin films carried a negative charge as the cathode rays do .

That the cathode rays do carry a negative charge has been conclusively shown by Perrin , ^ and the method here used for testing the charge carried by the Lenard rays is the same in principle as that used by him on the cathode rays .
A tube as shown in fig. 1 was constructed .
Fig. 1 .
A is the anode and is connected to earth , C is the cathode .
Inside the tube are fixed two short metal cylinders a and The inner cylinder b has a small circular opening at d , facing towards the .cathode , and is held in position by a stiff wire which passes through the glass at E , and is connected to a pair of quadrants of an electrometer .
If then the cathode rays entering the cylinder b carry a charge the electrometer detects it , even though the rays may not give up their charge to the metal walls of the cylinder .
The outer cylinder a , which has also a small opening at c facing the cathode , is kept connected to earth by means of a wire passing through the glass at D , and thus protects the inner cylinder from .outside electrical action .
S is a screen ( shown in front view at Sj ) , made of a circular disk of lead with the central part cut away , and the hole covered with a thin piece , jf , of aluminium about O'Ol mm. thick .
The screen is mounted on a piece of iron , h , to enable it to be moved about in the tube by means of a magnet .
The screen is of such a diameter as to almost touch the glass all round , just allowing freedom of motion under the action of the magnet .

The wide side tube B is to enable the screen S to be pulled aside ' entirely out of the path of the cathode rays whenever it is desired to do so .
The screen can easily be moved about by the magnet without disturbing the tube which is kept sealed on to the exhausting-pump .
When the tube has been exhausted until the cathode rays are well developed , the screen is pulled into the side tube B , the cylinder h is connected to the electrometer , and the coil turned on .
The electi-o-meter shows a negative deflection , which rises rapidly to a point at which it remains constant .
The passage of the discharge inside the tube breaks down to some extent the insulation between the-cylinders a and b , and as the negative potential of b increases the rate of flow of negatively charged particles into it will diminish , until a state is reached at which b is losing charge to a at the same rate at which it is receiving charge by the flow into it of the charged particles , and at this point the potential of b remains constant .
In one experiment the deflection rose to 175 scale divisions , which showed that a capacity of about 30C C.Gr .
S. units had been raised to a potential of 87 volts .
Everything else remaining the same , an electromagnet is placed with its poles on opposite sides of the tube between the cathode C and the cylinder a ; when the magnet is on and the cathode rays deflected off the opening c , the cylinder b receives scarcely any charge , , showing that the negative deflection previously observed is really due to the charge carried by the negative rays .
The screen S is now pulled from the side tube B , and placed in the path of the negative rays .
When the coil is turned on , a negative charge , smaller than previously , is still obtained in the cylinder b , and this charge is again not observed when the magnet is placed so as to deflect the rays-off the screen , or so as to deflect the secondary rays from the sci* even off the opening c. The screen was moved along the tube and the deflection measured in different positions with the following result .
The length of the tube from the cathode C to the cylinder a was 12 cms .

cylinder was raised to a potential 6/ 7 of that to which it was raised when the screen was away , and the cathode rays fell directly on the opening c. This must not , however , he taken as meaning that the flow of\amp ; charged particles into the cylinder was almost as great with the screen as without it , because the potential to which can be raised depends , as we have seen , on the conductivity of the air between a and b , and this with the screen in position is probably much less than without it , so that the flow of charged particles m the first case is much less than the numbers would indicate .
But the experiment does show that when the cathode rays fall upon a thin sheet of aluminium , we have a flow of particles away from the further side of the aluminium , which is deflected by a magnet , and which carries a negative charge .
The Lenard rays , therefore , like the cathode rays , carry a negative The negative potential to which the cylinder b is raised , depends on the position of the screen in the tube , as shown in the table given above .
The intensity of the Lenard rays at a will depend on the distance of the screen from a , and also on the intensity of the cathode rays falling upon the screen .
^ .
, When we consider the great amount of electricity carried by the negative rays ( as we have seen , a few breaks of the coil charged 300 C Gf S units to 87 volts , and other experiments of a different .character on this point will be described later on ) we can easily understand this stream of negatively charged particles away from the further side of the thin screen .
This large negative charge suddenly brought up to the screen and there stopped , must cause a similar rush of negative charge away from the screen , especially as the air in the tube is in a condition suitable for a discharge to pass The screen in this experiment was not kept connected to earth , although in other similar experiments described below it was so connected .
Nor does this appear to be of much consequence , because even if the screen is well earthed , the sudden rushes of negativ(j charge up to it will cause variations in its potential so that 1 wi not shield the portion of the tube on its further side .
In the experiments described above , the negatively c arge secondary rays are collected inside the tube ; it is more convincing to arrange the apparatus so that they can be collected outside the tube , as in this case it is easier to screen the collecting cylinder from outside electric forces .
, , For this purpose a tube , as shown in fig. 2 , was constructed .
A circular brass cup , B , is made to fit closely on the end of the glass tube in which are fixed the terminals A and G. The brass cup has a small aperture e , 1 mm. in radius , in the cen le Cathode and LRays .

of its base .
This hole is covered with a piece of oiled silk fixed on with sealing-wax , and the brass cup is then fastened on also with sealing-wax to the tube .
Oiled silk was used for the window because with it no trouble is experienced in getting a piece thin enough , and at the same time free from holes .
It easily bears an atmosphere pressure on an aperture 1 mm. in radius .
The brass cup is connected to earth and used as the anode ; C is the cathode .
A is an additional terminal which may be used as the anode .
The cylinders a and b are arranged as in the last experiment .
When the openings are directed towards e , and not more than a few centimetres from it , the electrometer shows a negative deflection which slowly rises to a value at which , it remains constant .
The cylinder b , with electrometer and connexions , had a capacity of about 250 C.Gr .
S. units , and in one experiment was raised to a potential of 11 volts .
The cylinder is not charged if , by means of a magnet , the cathode rays are thrown off the window e ; neither is it charged if the cylinders are tilted a little so as not to point directly to e. The experiment was tried with a similar brass end of equal thickness ( 1'5 mm. ) , but with no window in it , and no charge was obtained .
The negatively charged rays given off from the window are soon stopped by the air at atmospheric pressure , and no effect is obtained when the cylinder is moi'e than a few centimetres from the window .
The experiment confirms that described above .
The negative discharge from the window may be shown in another way .
A plate of ebonite is placed opposite the window at a centimetre or two from it , and the coil turned on for a few seconds .
The plate is then dusted evenly over with a mixture of sulphur and minium , and tapped lightly to clear it of the powder which does not adhere to it .
The well-known negative Lichtenberg figure is produced on the plate with its centre at the point opposite the window .
In Lenard 's experiments he placed a sci* even of aluminium between Mr. J. A. McClelland .
the tube in which the cathode rays were produced , and a second tube which could be exhausted independently of the first , and in this tube he observed the deflection produced by a magnet on the rays after they had passed through the aluminium , or , on our way of looking at it , on the secondary rays produced in this tube by the rapid approach of the negatively charged particles , in rushes , up to the aluminium window .
Lenard found that if the conditions in the discharge tube remained the same , he could vary the pressure in his observing tube within wide limits without producing any change in the amount of deflection of the rays .
This at first sight appears to show that the Lenard rays are different in character from cathode rays , because we know that when the pressure in a discharge tube is diminished the cathode rays are less deflected by magnetic force .
But when we diminish the pressure in a discharge tube we at the same time increase the difference of potential required to make the discharge pass , and if we regard the negative rays as negatively charged particles shot off from the negative electrode , this increase of potential difference will increase the momentum given to these particles , and consequently they will be less deflected .
We may thus regard the change of pressure as changing the deflection not directly , but because it changes the difference of potential between the electrodes .
We cannot test this view , experimentally , inasmuch as we cannot vary the pressure and keep the difference of potential constant , but we can keep the pressure constant and vary the difference of potential to some extent .
If a spark gap is placed in series with the discharge tube , by increasing the length of the spark we may make the difference of potential between the terminals of the tube greater than that required to make the discharge pass , and it is found that forcing up the potential difference in this way does diminish the deflection of the cathode rays .
In an experiment a cylindrical tube of 1'5 cm .
radius was used with the cathode at one end .
A central beam of cathode rays was deflected by a magnet on to the side of the tube so as to form a well defined patch of phosphorescence .
When the spark gap was closed , this patch was at a distance of 38 mm. from the cathode .
Increasing the length of the spark gap up to 10 mm. was sufficient to make the patch travel away to 44 mm. from the cathode .
This shows that without any change in pressure , an increase in potential difference is sufficient to diminish the deflection .
Now in Lenard 's arrangement a change of pressure in the observing .tube has no effect on the forces producing the rays m that tube , if we regard them as produced by the rapid pulses of charged particles up to the aluminium screen .
The impulse starting the rays is not varied , and consequently we would expect no change in Cathode and L Rays .
the curvature of the rays .
Of course in the denser medium we would expect the rays to lose their velocity sooner by impact with the gas particles , and Lenard himself found that in air at atmospheric pressure he could only observe the rays at a few centimetres from the window , while at lower pressures he could observe them at much greater distances .
In one of his experiments Lenard reduced the pressure so low in his second or observing tube , that he could not produce rays by connecting the coil directly to terminals in this tube .
The pressure was so low that the discharge refused to pass .
When the coil was connected to terminals in the primary tube the rays , even at this low pressure , were propagated in the second tube away from the aluminium window .
To explain this it is necessary to assume that the electromotive intensity produced by the impact of the charged cathode rays on the window is sufficient to produce discharge in the second tube , even when the coil connected to terminals in this tube cannot produce discharge .
From the first experiment described above we calculate that at a single break of the primary of the ' coil the atoms striking on a square millimetre of area of a screen placed in the path of the cathode rays at a distance of 12 cm .
from the cathode , carried a charge of about 60 C.G.S. units .
A charge of this magnitude , brought suddenly up to the screen will produce very great electrostatic effects , and the electromotive intensity produced in the second tube may be great enough to dissociate the molecules close to the window , and produce discharge .
On the whole , the theory that the cathode rays are a stream of charged atoms explains satisfactorily the observed properties of these rays , and also the production and properties of the Lenard rays .
Seeing that the cathode rays produce some of the most interesting of the phenomena presented by a discharge tube , it is important to get some idea of the amount of the current actually carried by the rays .
It is generally stated that the cathode rays play a comparatively unimportant part in the actual passage of the discharge , but although this may , to some extent , be true in the earlier stages of exhaustion , it is certainly not so at lower pressures .
By making use of the fact observed by several experimenters that the discharge does not always take the shortest path between the .electrodes , we can separate out a part of the negative rays from the remainder of the discharge , and measure this part directly with a galvanometer , and thus get an inferior limit to the fraction of the whole current carried by the cathode rays .
The appearance of the tube justifies us in assuming that the part of the current we thus separate out and measure is carried entirely by cathode rays .

s Mr. J. A. McClelland .
A tube of the form fig. 3 was constructed , with the terminals A and C about 40 mm. apart .
This tube has a narrow side tube B , as in figure , the shortest distance between the terminals by this path being about 160 mm. Fiu .
3 .
As the tube is being exhausted the discharge at first passes by the shortest path from A to C , but when the dark space round the cathode C spreads out until it reaches the walls of the tube , a point is reached at which the positive column starts behind the disk A , and travels by the side tube B. The part between A and C which was formerly occupied by the positive column is now entirely free from glow , but there is still a stream of negative rays from C towards A. Of course , there is also a less intense stream of rays behind C , but still , if we measure the current carried by the rays from C to A , we have an inferior limit .
The reason why the much longer path by the side tube B is the path of least resistance , seems to be , because by that path the positive column is enabled to approach closer to the negative electrode , the intensity of the cathode rays being less behind C than from C towards A. When the positive column is travelling by the side tube B , if we hring a magnet up to the tube between A and C , so as to deflect the cathode rays on to the side of the tube near C , the whole Cathode and Tjenard Rays .
discharge again takes the shortest path AC , so that a field of magnetic force across the direction of discharge in this case diminishes the resistance of the tube , by diminishing the length of it which is occupied by the negative dark space and allowing the positive column to lengthen out .
A slight variation in the tube ( fig. 3 ) enables us to measure the current carried by the cathode rays in CA .
The tube is made as in fig. 4 .
C is the cathode , A and A !
are both connected to earth , and the anode of the coil is also to earth .
At first the discharge passes between A and C , but when the proper exhaustion is reached the positive column starts from Aj , and travels round by the longer path .
We can insert a galvanometer between A or Ax and the earth connection , and measure the current through AC and AjC .
The galvanometer used was a very sensitive one shunted with a small resistance negligible in comparison with that of the discharge tube .
The results obtained were as follows:\#151 ; Before the positive column changed from the large tube to the side-tube B , no current could be detected in the latter .
A very small diminution of pressure causes the positive column to travel by AxC , and now the current in AC was about 1/ 50 of that in AxC .
The pressure was now gradually diminished and readings taken at every step until very little glow was visible in AjC , while the phosphorescence in AC was steadily increasing .
The ratio of the current in AC to that in AXC meanwhile steadily increased , until finally it was 1/ 4 .
These numbers show that even at a pressure at which there is little phosphorescence a considerable fraction ( more than 1/ 50 ) of the whole discharge was carried away from the cathode by the negative rays , while at lower pressures these rays carried a large portion of the discharge .
The fact that the negative rays travel in straight lines away from the cathode , independently of the position of the anode , and therefore , in a discharge tube in which the anode is not in the line of the rays , do not directly convey their charge to the anode , does not necessarily prove that the part of the dischai'ge which they carry away from the cathode is small .
In such a tube there will be an excess of negative electricity at the point where the cathode rays are stopped by the glass , and this makes its wray to the anode by a current in the gas , which is a good conductor when the primary discharge is passing .
In conclusion , I wish to thank Professor Thomson for many valuable suggestions in the course of the above work .
