A paper was read , entitled , " On the extensive atmosphere of Mars .
" In a Letter to His Royal Highness the President .
By Sir James South , Knt. F.R.S. In this paper the author gives an account of a further observation which corroborates the conclusion he had stated in a former commu ?
nication " On the extensive atmosphere of Mars , " namely , that no indication now existed of any atmosphere being attached to that planet .
A star retained its light blue colour , and its full brilliancy and comparative steadiness till the very instant of its occultation by Mars .
At its emersion it was seen nearly dichotomised .
The author concludes .
that either some physical change has occurred in the atmosphere of that planet , or that the observations of Cassini and of Roemer were inaccurate .
