Cases of monochromatic vision are rare , and I have thought it right to put on record one which was kindly brought me some time ago by Mr. Parker .
The patient , whom we will call K. B. , was aged twenty-five at the time when I examined him for colour vision .
The notes of his case are as follows :\#151 ; Vision always defective ; has always been colour blind .
Has quick horizontal nystagmus ; probably an absolute central scotoma .
He is always " day blind .
" His vision for right and left eyes is 6/ 60 .
He is not night blind .
His fields are nearly , but not quite , full for white .
He shows no definite changes in his eyes .
I took his luminosity curve , and all colours he matched with white with the same facility as if they were white .

In the accompanying diagram both these curves are shown , together with the curve of luminosity for the normal eye .
As regards the first two , it will be seen that the maximum of each curve is about scale number 40 , or close to E. On the right-hand side of the maximum the curves do not absolutely agree .
K.B. 's observations were first made in the red and green , and his readings at first were not very close , and a mean had to be taken .
As the colours he had measured went towards the blue his measures were much more accordant , as he had become accustomed to the methods Dr , A. Macfadyen .
' Influence of employed .
The slight divergence on the left-hand side of the curve from that of P is probably due to his colouring matter in the yellow spot .
Attention must be again called to the fact that these curves are practically identical with those obtained by the normal eye when it measures a spectrum of very feeble luminosity , and also agree with 6 e to iz h- / 6 is to ti the results obtained by measuring the diminution of each ray when it first becomes invisible , and making a curve of the reciprocals of the numbers , taking the highest point of it as 100 .
This is clearly shown in Part III , " Colour Photometry."* It may be mentioned the scale of the prismatic spectrum employed is the same in this communication as in that paper , the wave-lengths of each scale number being given in it .
