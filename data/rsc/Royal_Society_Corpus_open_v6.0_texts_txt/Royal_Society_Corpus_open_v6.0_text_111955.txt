( Abstract .
) The memoir of M. Hermit , " Sir quelques theoremes d'algebre et la re'solution de l'equation du quatrieme degrd , " Comptes Rendus , 488 t. xlvi .
p. 961 ( 1858 ) , contains a very important theorem in relation to Tschirnhausen 's transformation of an equationf ( x ) =0 into another of the same degree in y , by means of the substitution y= qx , where ox is a rational and integral function of x. In fact , considering for greater simplicity a quartic equation , ( a , b , c , d , elx , 1 ) ' =0 , M. Hermit gives to the equation y=ox the following form , y=aT+(ax+b ) B+(ax'+4bx+6c ) C+(ax3+4 b2+ 6cx+d ) D ( I write B , C , D in the place of his To , T1 , T2 ) , and he shows that the transformed equation in y has the following property : viz. , every function of the coefficients which , expressed as a funtion of a , b , c , d , e , T , B , C , D , does not contain T , is an invariant , that is , an invariant of the two quantics ( a , b , c , d , e(X , Y)4 , ( B , C , DIE , --X)2 .
This comes to saying that if T be so determined that in the equation for y the coefficient of the second term ( y3 ) shall vanish , the other coefficients will be invariants ; or if in the function of y which is equated to zero we consider y as an absolute constant , the function of y will be an invariant of the two quantics .
It is easy to find the value of T ; this is in fact given by the equation O=-aT+3bB+3cC+dD ; and we have thence for the value of y , y=(ax+b ) B+(ax2+4bx+3c ) C+(axS+4bx'6cx+3d)D ; so that for this value of y the function of y which equated to zero gives the transformed equationwill be an invariant of the two quantics .
It is proper to notice that in the last-mentiond expression for y , all the coefficients except those of the term in x , or bB + 3cC + 3dD are those of the binomial ( 1 , 1)4 , whereas the excepted coefficients are those of the binomial ( 1 , 1)3 ; this suffices to show what the expression for y is in the general case .
I have in the two papers , " Note sir la transformation de Tschirnhausen " and " Deuxieme Note sir la transformation de Tschirnhausen " ( Crelle , t. lviii .
pp. 259 and 263 , 1861 ) , obtained the transformed equations for the cubic and quartic equations ; and by means of a grant from the Government Grant Fund , I have been enabled to procure the calculation by Messrs. Davis and Otter , under my 489 superintendence , of the transformed equation for the quintic equation .
The several results are given in the present memoir ; and for greater completeness , I reproduce the demonstration which I have given in the former of the above-mentioned two notes , of the general property , that the function of y is an invariant .
At the end of the memoir I consider the problem of the reduction of the general quintic equation to Mr. Jerrard 's form x ' + ax +b O.
