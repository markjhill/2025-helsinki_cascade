[ 359 ] X. On Scandium.\#151 ; II* By Sir William Crookes , .
, Received December 14 , 1909 , and April 29 , 1910 , \#151 ; Read January 20 and June 2 , 1910 .
Since the publication of the first part of my paper on Scandium , f G. Eberhard , | of the Astrophysical Observatory , Potsdam , reasoning from the fact that the strongest lines of the scandium spectrum are observed in the spectra of stars in diverse stages of development , has come to the conclusion that scandium must be universally distributed on the earth .
Investigating the arc spectra of 366 minerals and rocks , he obtained the remarkable result that scandium in small quantities is actually one of the most widely distributed earth elements .
He shows that it occurs most frequently in zirconium minerals\#151 ; in beryls , titanates , columbites , and titanocolumbites of the rare earths\#151 ; also in micas ; and , finally , that specimens of wolframite and tinstone from Saxony and Bohemia contain scandium in sufficient quantity to make its extraction advantageous .
These results of Eberhard were quickly verified by Prof. R. J. Meyer , S Berlin University , who , in a preliminary paper , has described experiments on extracting scandia from the Zinnwald wolframite .
Prof. Meyer concludes that this wolframite contains from 0T4 to 0T6 per cent , of rare earths , and that these rare earths contain 0'30 to 0*33 per cent , of scandia .
Thus the original wolframite would contain about 0-15/ 100x0-315/ 100 = 0-04725/ 10000 , or about 0*0005 per cent , of scandia .
Prof. Meyer has worked out two methods of separating scandia from the wolframite rare earths :\#151 ; ( a ) Precipitation with hydrofluoric acid from an intermediate product in which the scandium has been concentrated by an oxalic acid precipitation , and precipitation with hydrofluosilicic acid , or sodium silicofluoride in acid solution .
The * * * S * The descriptions and analyses of the following salts were communicated to the Society on December 14 , 1909 , as now printed:\#151 ; Scandium aurochloride , platinocyanide , iodate , sulphite , malate , malonate , tartrate , racemate , laevotartrate , and mesotartrate .

) 18.6.10 raw scandia prepared by the above methods still contains small quantities of yttria and ytterbia , particularly if method ( b)is used .
Prof. Meyer says that his scandia , when freed from cerium and yttrium earths , lias the atomic weight 45 to 46 , and still contains about 1 per cent , of thorium.# On reading Prof. Meyer 's paper I examined the felspar and mica which were associated with the parcels of wiikite procured by me from Finland .
The felspar contains a small percentage of rare earths , hut no trace of scandia could I detect on examining their photographed spectra , the dominant line , wave-length 3613*984 , being entirely absent .
The mica was found to contain about 1 per cent , of rare earths , and in the photographed spectrum the dominant lines of scandium are plainly visible .
From a comparison of the spectra with those taken with the rare earths from wiikite I should estimate the scandia at about half that in the earths of the best black wiikite .
A specimen of wolframite from Zinnwald was found to contain less than 1 per cent , of rare earths , and in the photographed spectrum of these earths , the dominant lines of scandium were strong , accompanied by only the faintest trace of yttrium or ytterbium lines .
Through the kindness of a friend , Dr. Wahl , of the Mineralogical Institute , University , Helsingfors , I also obtained the following authentic specimens of minerals from the locality whence my wiikite was mined :\#151 ; No. 1 .

( Probably from the wiikite quarry .
) Of Dr. Wahl 's minerals , No. 1 , felspar , contained 1T1 per cent , of rare earths .
On photographing the spectrum only a very faint trace of scandium appeared .
No. 2 , monazite , contained 17'15 per cent , of rare earths ; the photographed spectrum showed no scandium .
No. 3 , black wiikite , contained 22*58 per cent , of rare earths ; the spectrum showed considerable quantities of scandium .
No. 4 , brown wiikite , contained 23*77 per cent , of rare earths ; the spectrograph showed only a small amount of scandium .
No. 5 , wiikite , contained 24*85 per cent , of rare earths ; the photographed spectrum showed considerable quantities of scandium .
* A mixture of 99*25 parts of scandium with 0*75 part of thorium would have an atomic weight of about 45 * 5 .
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
No. 6 , mica , contained 0'63 per cent , of rare earths , which , on spectrographic examination , contained an amount of scandium about equal to that in the rare earths in Nos 3 and 5 .
I have also to thank Dr. A. Hiorth , of Kristiania , for a typical collection of 23 specimens of rare minerals from Norway ; the results of examination of most of these specimens have already been given .
The scandia used in the preparation of some of the salts here described was not absolutely pure .
Chemically , no other earth could be detected in it , but the spectrograph revealed traces of yttria and ytterbia .
These traces could have been removed by one or more operations , but I thought it advisable to leave them in , for the following reasons : In each operation of purification some loss is unavoidably incurred , and when chemical reactions are insufficient to find the other earths it is not worth diminishing my lessening stock of scandia for the sake of academic purity .
The chief reason , however , for leaving these traces in is that they might afford evidence of a difference of behaviour between one earth and another in the presence of some of the acids used .
After each quantitative determination the scandia was dissolved in acid and a spectrogram taken to see if yttria or ytterbia were present .
The residual earth was then collected from the mother-liquor and a photograph taken of its spectrum .
A comparison of the pair of spectra shows at once if any separation has been effected between the earths present .
When separation is apparent further experimentation on a larger scale is reserved to a future occasion .
Scandium Iodate , Sc(I03)3+18H20 .
Scandium iodate is best prepared by the metathesis of a soluble scandium salt with ammonium iodate .
It forms a white crystalline powder almost insoluble in water .
After being well washed and dried in the air it contains 18 molecules of water .
The water is held loosely ; long drying in a desiccator , or exposure to a temperature of 100 ' and slightly higher , drives some of it off ; only by repeated trials with slight alterations of temperature have I obtained certain definite hydrates .
There are indications of other hydrates , but I have not attempted to prepare them .
Analysis .
( 1 ) 15'483 gr. of 18-hydrate scandium iodate , dried in the air at the temperature of about 15 ' , were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and heated until chlorine ceased to be evolved .
It was then evaporated to dryness with excess of acid and dissolved in water .
Ammonia in excess was added , and the whole boiled .
The precipitated scandia was filtered , washed , and ignited .
It weighed R229 gr. , = 0'7959 gr. of scandium .
VOL. CCX.\#151 ; A. 3 A ( 2 ) 17*956 gr. of 18-hydrate were heated carefully until the temperature rose to 250 ' .
At this point the white salt became slightly brown .
It weighed 11*265 gr. , showing a loss of 6*691 gr. of water .

Scandium sulphite is formed by mixing solutions of scandium chloride and sodium sulphite .
It forms a heavy white precipitate , soluble in excess of sodium sulphite when heated , slightly soluble in hot water and insoluble in cold water .
The air dried salt is anhydrous , and has the composition given above .
Analysis .
4'236 gr. of the air-dried salt were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the solution boiled until sulphurous acid ceased to be driven off .
Ammonia in excess was added , and the whole boiled .
The scandia was filtered , washed , and ignited .
It weighed 1*765 gr. = 1*1430 gr. of scandium .

Slight combination takes place on boiling the mixture , but no definite compound is produced .
Re-crystallised boric acid and scandia were mixed together , the acid being in excess , and the whole heated to bright redness for an hour in a platinum crucible .
The mixture fused to a clear liquid , and on cooling the melt was extracted with boiling water , filtered , and washed .
The residue on the filter was shaken up with much water , levigated , and poured on to a filter , and thus was separated , until only the larger heavy particles were left behind .
The scandium borate thus prepared is in the form of a white powder , having the appearance under the microscope of minute transparent spheres .
In transmitted polarised light each spherulite shines like a point of light on the dark field when the analyser is crossed , each point alternately disappearing and reappearing as the stage is rotated .
The analysis of the borate at first presented difficulties .
It dissolves easily in dilute acids , and on adding ammonia a precipitate , chiefly of scandium hydroxide , is formed , but the hydroxide carries down with it variable quantities of borate .
The plan finally adopted was to dissolve the borate in dilute hydrochloric acid and precipitate hot with ammonia .
The precipitate was filtered , washed , and dried .
The precipitated hydroxide was then ignited in a platinum crucible , hydrofluoric acid was poured on , and it was kept at a gentle heat for some hours .
Strong sulphuric acid was added , and the mixture was gradually heated till dry .
The residual scandia was then ignited strongly and weighed .

8'037 gr. of scandium borate , treated in the manner described , gave 5*277 gr. of scandia , = 3*4173 gr. of scandium .

Scandium aurochloride is prepared by mixing strong solutions of the component chlorides , and allowing the mixture to evaporate slowly over sulphuric acid in a vacuum desiccator .
The double salt separates out in a felt-like mass of yellow needle-shaped crystals , which are very deliquescent .
In this state the salt has the composition given above .
The composition is unusual , but the analytical results agree very well with it , and I have not succeeded in preparing a salt with different proportions of the chief constituents .
The water8of'crystallisation can be driven off gradually by careful heating .
For analysis the felt-like mass of aurochloride was made as dry as possible by pressing it several times between warm dry filtering paper until the paper was unsoiled .
Analysis .
26*717 gr. of scandium aurochloride , dried by pressure , were heated in an air-bath to 100 ' , and kept at that temperature for three hours .
The aurochloride melted to a clear orange-coloured liquid , solidifying on cooling to a crystalline mass .
The loss of weight after liquefaction was found to be 4*350 gr. After keeping the salt for several days at 100 ' the liquid gradually becomes solid and crystalline , and in this state is anhydrous .
The further loss of weight was 2*672 gr. , equal to a total loss of 7*022 gr. The residue from which the water had been driven was dissolved in hot water acidulated with hydrochloric acid , and sodium bisulphite was added .
Gold commenced to separate at once , and on boiling the metal collected in a coherent sponge .
It was filtered , washed with dilute acid , and weighed after ignition .
After separating the metallic gold , the filtrate was mixed with excess of ammonia and boiled .
The precipitated scandia was filtered , washed , ignited , and weighed .
Experiment .
42*52 57*48 100*00 The 26'717 gr. of hydrated aurochloride treated in this manner yielded 7'361 gr. of gold , and 3*862 gr. of scandia , = 2*5009 gr. of scandium .

Scandium aurochloride with eight molecules of water is obtained by drying in a desiccator over sulphuric acid the 21-hydrate .
After about a fortnight 's drying the weight , which at first rapidly diminishes , becomes constant .
SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM .
For analysis the hydrate , dried to a constant weight , was dissolved in water and the gold precipitated by the addition of metallic magnesium , the liquid being well boiled .
The filtrate from the gold was mixed with an excess of ammonium chloride , ammonia was added , and the whole boiled .
The scandia , which came down free from magnesia , was filtered , washed , dried , and ignited .

Scandium platinocyanide is formed by the metathesis in the cold of scandium sulphate and barium platinocyanide .
The barium sulphate filtered off , the clear liquid is evaporated at a moderate temperature .
Scandium platinocyanide crystallises out in large monoclinic prisms on a rhombic base , the angles of which are 81 ' 20r and 98 ' 40r .
The crystals frequently group themselves in rosettes .
They are dichroic , crimson by transmitted light , and a rich metallic green by reflected light .
The reflected and transmitted rays are oppositely polarised .
The red transmitted ray is extinguished when the short diagonal of the nicol is parallel to the long axis of the crystal , and the reflected green ray is extinguished when the long diagonal of the nicol is parallel to the long axis of the crystal .
Light passing along the axis of the crystal is crimson , and not polarised .
[ June2nd , 1910.\#151 ; I have submitted the metallic green crystals of this salt to the low temperature of liquid air with a view to ascertain what change of colour , if any\gt ; accompanies the reduction of temperature .
After an exposure for ten minutes in liquid air the green colour becomes paler and more of a yellowish hue , while the transmitted light changes from crimson to deep brown .
On removing the platino-cyanide from the liquid air the normal colours come back as the salt warms up to the temperature of the laboratory .
] The crystals are soluble in water , forming a colourless solution , and are insoluble or nearly so in absolute alcohol .
Boiled in alcohol they dehydrate , turning white but not dissolving .
The white dehydrated salt dissolves easily in water , and on evaporation separates out in crystals of the normal appearance .
Analysis .
( 1 ) 5755 gr. of well crystallised and air-dried scandium platinocyqmide were dissolved in water and precipitated hot with ammonia .
The scandia was filtered off , well washed , dried , ignited , and weighed .
It weighed 0*627 gr. , = 0*406 gr. of scandium .
The filtrate was evaporated to dryness in platinum , and the residual ammonium platinocyanide slowly decomposed by heat and then ignited strongly .
The platinum left from the decomposition weighed 2*446 gr. ( 2 ) 9*612 gr. of scandium platinocyanide were fused at a full red heat with potassium bisulphate .
Hydrocyanic acid was evolved with much intumescence and separation of platinum , and the mixture finally fused quietly to a clear liquid .
The mass was extracted with water containing a little acid , and the platinum filtered off ; it weighed 4*028 gr. Ammonia in excess was added to the filtrate and the precipitated scandia collected ; it weighed 1*132 gr. , = 0*733 gr. of scandium .
( 3 ) 10*741 gr. of air-dried scandium platinocyanide were kept over sulphuric acid in a desiccator for 80 hours .
It lost 2*121 gr. of water .
The salt was then put into a hot-air oven and kept at 100 ' for 17 hours .
It became a good canary-yellow , and was found to have lost an additional 0*1343 gr. The temperature was raised to 160 ' for 10 hours , when an additional 0*644 gr. of water was driven off .
The temperature was finally raised to about 180 ' , when the salt began to decompose .
Calculated out , these losses nearly approximate to successive losses of 15 , 1 , and 4|- molecules of water , with half a molecule still remaining in the salt at 160 ' , and only driven off as decomposition commences .

During re-crystallisation the solution , at first clear and colourless , deposits a yellow powder and gives an odour of hydrocyanic acid .
Analyses of the yellow deposit have not yet given me concordant results ; roughly it contains 23"5 per cent , of scandium and 6 per cent , of platinum .
The analytical results with the normal platinocyanide given above show an excess of scandium and a deficit of platinum .
This may be the result of slight decomposition during re-crystallisation , with production of a trace of the yellow compound .
Scandium Mono-ohloroacetate , ( CH2C1COO)2ScOH + 2H20 .
Scandium hydroxide , ground and well shaken with a cold aqueous solution of monochloracetic acid , dissolves slowly and almost completely .
The clear filtered solution , evaporated in the cold over sulphuric acid , deposits a crystalline crust , appearing under the microscope as flower-like groups of stellate crystals , and showing good colour when examined by polarised light .
These crystals are permanent in dry air , and lose no water at 100 ' .
On being heated they decompose quietly , and at a red heat leave a white residue of scandia .

36*03 J 87*48 347*25 100*00 100*00 The scandium nitrate used in the preparation of the lactate contained traces of yttrium and ytterbium .
The scandia resulting from the ignition of the lactate showed no appreciable diminution in the amount of impurity present .
The mother-liquors , however , appeared free from both yttrium and ytterbium. .
The impurities in the lactate could only be detected spectroscopically , and were not present in sufficient quantities to interfere with the properties of the lactate , or to increase perceptibly the atomic weight of the scandium .
Scandium Malonate , CH\lt ; coo\gt ; ( 'H\gt ; - Scandium hydroxide dissolves readily in a cold aqueous solution of malonic acid , and the solution when heated deposits a semi-transparent granular precipitate , having no crystalline appearance under the microscope .
This precipitate partially dissolves on cooling .
If this solution is boiled for some time a dense precipitate is formed , which on cooling does not re-dissolve .
When a cold solution of scandium malonate containing excess of malonic acid is slowly heated on a water-bath , it becomes cloudy at first ; as the temperature rises the liquid becomes clear , and a thick transparent gummy liquid sinks to the bottom .
If now the supernatant liquor is poured off and cold water poured on , the transparent colloid-looking mass is slowly converted into a fine white crystalline powder .
The colloidal gummy mass , smeared on a microscopic slide , dries to a clear non-deliquescent glass-like substance .
Exposed to dry air the film cracks and flakes off* like a pharmaceutical scale preparation .
A lump of the viscid transparent mass , free from adhering water , dried in a water-oven at 100 ' , becomes white , hard , and brittle .
It is now insoluble in either hot or cold water , although before heating the gummy mass is easily soluble in cold water .
The side of the beaker in which the gummy mass is precipitated by heat from the solution of the malonate is seen to be studded with brilliant colourless transparent crystals , some measuring more than a millimetre across .
According to the mode of preparation , scandium malonate contains either one or two molecules of water .

Malic acid and scandium hydroxide rubbed together with a little water react , and the liquid when heated becomes clear .
When gradually cooled a precipitate appears , and at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory the solution is opaque and almost solid .
The precipitate consists of very fine granules , having no crystalline appearance under the microscope ; it re-dissolves on being heated .
Scandium malate formed in this manner is a granular white powder , soluble in hot and difficultly soluble in cold water .
It is easily soluble in ammonia , and is not precipitated from the ammoniacal solution by dilute acetic or malic acid ; neither is it precipitated by ammonium sulphide .
The aqueous solution dries to a transparent gummy mass when evaporated to dryness .
It has a strong mousy odour .
The ammoniacal solution also dries to a clear glassy mass , entirely soluble in water .

Fumaric acid is neutralised with dilute ammonia , and to the warm solution is added an equivalent quantity of scandium sulphate .
A white precipitate comes down , which partially re-dissolves on cooling .
Scandium fumarate , therefore , like so many other scandium salts , is more soluble in cold than in hot water .
The liquid is well boiled , kept for some time in a hot-water oven till the precipitate settles , then quickly filtered and washed with boiling water .
After drying in a desiccator at the ordinary temperature , it is powdered and again exposed to dry air .
Scandium fumarate is a white powder , appearing under the microscope as very minute spheres , slightly soluble in hot , more so in cold water , and easily soluble in ammonia .
When heated to redness in the air it decomposes quietly , leaving , after the carbon has burnt off , pure white scandia , The salt is difficult to get to a constant weight ; it had to be heated to 105 ' in a hot-air bath for many days , and the weight taken at intervals of five or six hours .
At the end of a fortnight it was still slightly losing weight .
I am therefore inclined to think that the half molecule of water may be due to water of crystallisation not entirely driven off* at 105 ' .

The earth from the mother-liquor showed the yttrium lines faintly and ytterbium lines strongly .
Further experiments are in progress with fumaric.acid as a separating agent .
Metzger found this acid very effectual in separating thoria from other monazite earths ; the present experiments give hopes that it may be useful in separating scandium from ytterbium .
Scandium Tartrate , CH(OH)COO I \gt ; Sc(OH ) .
CH(OH)CO(r Scandium hydroxide is added to a strong solution of tartaric acid with slight warming until the greater part of the scandium hydroxide is dissolved ; care must be taken to keep the base in slight excess .
The turbid solution is filtered and boiled , when a granular precipitate comes down .
This precipitate is well washed with boiling water and dried in a desiccator over sulphuric acid .
In this way scandium tartrate forms a white crystalline powder , insoluble in hot , slightly soluble in cold water , and insoluble in alcohol .
Dried in a desiccator it is anhydrous .
When heated it emits the empyreumatic odour peculiar to decomposing tartrates and leaves a white residue of scandia .

18*016 J 80*59 80*70 227*156 100*00 100*00 The analysis of the compounds of scandium with tartaric acid and its isomers has been complicated by the tendency to form basic salts admitting of no simple formulae .
Thus , both the tartrate and laevo-tartrate occasionally form salts containing 3 c VOL. CCX.\#151 ; A. percentages of scandium ranging near to 23'5 , with a deviation of two- or three-tenths of a unit one side or the other .
The nearest basic salt which contains such an amount of scandium has the composition I CH(0H)000 CH(OH)COO-Sc : O ScOH + | CH(0H)C00-Sc:0 and contains 23 " 49per cent , of scandium .

Scandium dibromopropionate is almost insoluble in hot or cold water and , when dried over sulphuric acid in a desiccator , is a white amorphous powder , so easily electrified that it requires great care in powdering and moving it from one vessel to another or it flies out of the mortar or watch-glasses .

The sodium salt of this acid is dissolved in water and a solution of scandium nitrate added .
If the solutions are strong , a red precipitate falls ; if weak , the mixture must be concentrated .
On cooling , the scandium salt separates in feathery crystals of a fine scarlet colour .
It must be purified by re-crystallisation from a hot aqueous solution .
The crystals are slightly soluble in cold water .
Heated in an air-bath to 105 ' for 48 hours , the scarlet crystals assume an orange-yellow colour , losing water and becoming anhydrous .
On being further heated , the salt decomposes rather suddenly , with intumescence , leaving a carbonaceous residue , which at a red heat gradually burns white , leaving scandia .

How would scandium behave when combined as a salt with a highly complex acid ?
In Dr. Silberrad 's recently published paper on " The Condensation Products of Mellitic Acid with Meta-amino Phenol , " * some highly complex bodies are described ; it became interesting to determine precisely what basicity scandia would assume towards polycarboxylic acids of this nature .
By the kindness of Dr. Silberrad I have had an opportunity of experimenting with octamethyl tetramino dihydroxy paradixanthyl benzene tetracarboxylic acid .
Previous experiments would lead one to expect the scandium salt of this acid to have the composition C44H40O14N4Sc2 .
This I could not prepare , the salt produced by metathesis containing more scandium than this formula admits of .
The only scandium salt I could form of this acid has the composition shown above .
Octamethyl tetramino dihydroxy paradixanthyl benzene tetracarboxylic acid is a dark red powder , insoluble in water and easily soluble in dilute ammonia .
The solution in ammonia , very slightly alkaline , is exactly neutralised with acetic acid ; to the hot * ' Journ. Am .

1711*71 88*59 88*22 1932*21 100*00 100*00 More than once I have been asked why I chose such very out-of the-way acids wherewith to prepare scandium salts ?
I give my chief reason :\#151 ; Attempts on several occasions have been made to discover a means of separating some of the " rare earths " from their companions by forming compounds with weak organic acids .
Thus , in 1897 , Kosmann# employed citric acid in the separation of thoria .
UrbainI used acetylacetonate of sodium for the same purpose .
Metzger^ tried maleic acid , cinnamic acid , picric acid , phthalic acid , and fumaric acid .
He found fumaric acid effectual in separating thoria from the other earths in monazite , whilst the other acids also gave partial separations , although not complete .
In 1904 , NeishS tried many organic acids for the separation of the rare earths , chiefly thoria .
Among other acids , he tried gallic , tannic , citric , salicylic , oleic , linoleic , paratoluic , oxyisophthalic , benzoic , meta- , ortho- , and para-nitrobenzoic , and fumaric .
Of these the metanitrobenzoic acid proved most effectual , the process being capable of accurate quantitative results .
It was found that other rare earths besides thoria behaved differently towards these acids , but the variation was not sufficient to enable the reactions to be used for accurate separations .
Soon after those experimental papers appeared I commenced similar researches hoping to find an organic reagent which would be a precipitant for some of the yttria earths\#151 ; if not with quantitative accuracy , at all events with sufficient separation to allow a fractionation method to be based on the reaction .
My results , not being sufficiently definite , were never published ; but as the organic acids were in my laboratory when the scandium research was commenced , I preferred to use these acids , * * * S * 'Chem .

of which the purity and the history were known , rather than start afresh with acids of unknown history .
Many of the acids were prepared and purified by myselt ; for others I am under obligations to friends , among whom 1 must specially thank Dr. O. Silberrad .
I wish also to express warm thanks to Dr. yon Martius for the munificent gift of 100 gr. of almost pure scandia\#151 ; a gift which has enabled me to work on a larger scale , and to preserve many specimens of analysed salts for future reference .
