A paper was read , entitled , " Some Remarks on an Error respect ?
ing the Site and Origin of Graham 's Island.* ' By Capt. W. H. Smyth , R.N. K.F.M. F.R.S. The author rectifies an erroneous assertion , originating from the report of Captain Larmour , who in the year 1800 , when commanding the Wassanaer , a troop-ship on the Egyptian expedition , thought he observed a shoal of four fathoms water with breakers , within a mile of the latitude and longitude of the new volcanic island .
The author has determined , by his own observations , that no such reef exists in that spot , nor is the assigned place of this shoal near that of Graham 's Island , which arose considerably to the eastward , from a depth of above a hundred fathoms below the surface of the water .
A knoll , with only seven fathoms of water upon it , was discovered not far from the site of these reports .
The Adventure bank extends from Sicily nearly to Pentellaria , where the water deepens at once from 76 fathoms to above 375 fathoms , at which no bottom was met with .
But , even on the supposition that what Capt. Larmour imagined he saw was the result of a temporary subaqueous volcanic eruption , it could not have justified the assertion of there being breakers with four fathoms upon them ; and still less does it afford any foundation for the hypothesis that Graham 's Island was formed by the mere lifting up of such shoal .
