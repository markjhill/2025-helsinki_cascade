166 The Physiological Cost of Muscular Work Measured hy the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .
Part I.\#151 ; The Energy Output of Dock Labourers during " Heavy Work !
' [ Interim Report to the Royal Society Food ( War ) Committee .
] By A. D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. ( Received November 22 , 1919 .
) The metabolism Sub-Committee of the Food ( War ) Committee of the Royal Society at its first meeting considered the following two methods of inquiry for the determination of the energy output of men and women workers:\#151 ; A. The Douglas-Haldane method , by which determinations of C02 and of 02 are made , was adopted for recommendation to new workers as the standard method .
B. Waller 's method by which determinations of C02 alone are made at short frequent intervals , was to be taken on trial .
Allocations for the necessary expenses were made , and interim reports , , dealing with the results obtained by both methods , were presented to and considered by the Sub-Committee at several subsequent meetings .
Of these interim reports , two dealing with results of method A have recently been communicated to and published* in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' and the present interim report of method B is submitted for similar publication .
It deals with the C02 output of heavy workers , for whom the energy output has been estimated by the Food ( War ) Committee at 1100 to 2000 calories per 8 hours per " average man " [ i.e. , 78 to 142 calories per square metre per hour ] .
Both methods A and B afford the measure of energy output by readings of the respiratory exchange .
By method A the intake of oxygen and the output of carbon dioxide are measured ; by method B the output of C02 alone. .
By method A the relation quotient C02 plus/ 02 minus is ascertained , and its variation taken into the calculation of the final energy value of the exchange , which is expressed in calories per square metre , f * O.

t In accordance with the practice of the Carnegie Laboratory .
A full account of the method is given by Cathcart in the 'Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps , ' November , 1918 .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular Work .
167 In method B , the results are directly read and expressed in terms of CO* output as cubic centimetres of COa per second .
The final energy value if required is calculated on the assumption of a normal value of the respiratory quotient CO2/ O2 = 0*85 + 0*05 .
It is claimed that the range of error involved by A can be reduced to + 1 per cent. , in method B to + 5 per cent. The speed with which useful data can be obtained is much greater by method B than by method A.* Errors of Observation .
Errors of timing , of volume reading , corrections for temperature and pressure , errors of CO2 ( and O2 ) readings , and clerical errors of arithmetic can occur by both methods ; their detailed consideration would occupy too much space , and must be deferred .
I shall assume that due care and accuracy have been given to the carrying out of both methods , and consider in detail only the error due to the assumption of a normal respiratory quotient which forms the essential difference between methods A and B. In the first place it should be realised as being not an error of observation peculiar to method B , but an error of translation , occurring when the results measured in terms of cubic centimetres C02 per second are converted into calories\#151 ; calories per hour , or calories per square metre per hour .
This error of translation can be evaluated from the following two considerations : 1 .
Its maximal ( improbable ) value with maximal ( improbable ) fluctuations of the CO2/ O2 quotient , e.g. , between 0*7 and 1*0 which are its theoretical values on diets exclusively of fat or exclusively of carbohydrates .
2 .
Its practical ( probable)f value with practical ( probable ) fluctuations of the CO2/ O2 quotient .
1 .
Its maximal value is to be appreciated from the following Table of Equivalents of 1 c.c. C02 :\#151 ; * With Method B , Miss De Decker 's ordinary day 's work on dock labourers was , for Perry , 20 readings per day ( 10 double readings ) , for King and others only 10 per day .
But in the laboratory when getting out C02 curves , she has worked up to 80 per day .
None of her hourly readings on labourers has been rejected or amended .
The net expenditure of time at the docks and at Smithfield was 27 days and 6 nights , and the data collected have not involved the employment of an expert computer .
By Method B , Greenwood obtained a total number of 226 readings during the period November , 1918 , to March , 1919 , upon 43 subjects engaged upon various kinds of work .
t Not probable error in the technical statistical sense .
My data are not numerous enough for calculation of " probable error .

by inspection of which it appears : ( 1 ) That the maximum error between the extremes TOO and 070 is +13'79 per cent. ( 2 ) That the practical error between the probable range 0-90 and 0'80 is + 4-598 per cent. I have allowed therefore as inherent to method B the practical ( probable ) error = + 5 per cent. There is an error of observation inherent to short ( 1 to 5 min. ) samples that requires particular consideration at this stage .
In forced breathing , either voluntary without other muscular exertion , or involuntary in consequence of work , there is increased ventilation and increased output of CO2 , which is pumped out of the pulmonary alveoli and blood to an exaggerated degree .
It is difficult in a short sample taken during increased work to assign the shares of increased muscular action and of increased pump action in the total increase exhibited by a short sample , which therefore cannot be regarded as a fair sample indicative of increased metabolism .
The objection is well founded as regards brief sampling during the period of establishment of augmented breathing , but not as regards brief sampling when the augmented regime has become established .
During the first minute or two of increased muscular activity the increased expiration of CO2 is partly due to increased pumping action , partly to increased muscular metabolism ; but at the end of five minutes ( or less ) of steady work a steady regime of CO2 output is established , during which the rate of output is unaffected , or inconsiderably affected by variations of pump effect .
A person breathing at rest 6 litres per minute at 3 per cent. CO2 , i.e. , discharging C02 at the rate of 180 c.c. per minute or 3 c.c. per second , on commencing work at say 10 kgrm .
per second exhibits at once an increased ventilation , accompanied by a rise of C02 percentage and a total increased output of C02 , which during the first minute of effort is certainly the resultant of two factors , Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .
169 increased pumping out of CO2 by the lungs and increased muscular metabolism ; but as time passes , the CO2 output reaches a maximum , and a constant regime is established , during which the CO2 ordinate serves as a true physiological indicator of muscular metabolism .
This constant regime is reached very rapidly , i.e. , in a very few minutes\#151 ; certainly in five minutes , sometimes even less\#151 ; and while it lasts , the CO2 ordinate is a faithful indicator of the internal physiological activity .
During the constant regime of deeper breathing caused by work , the physiological order of events is ( 1 ) increased production of CO2 causing ( 2 ) greater thoracic movements by which the increase is got rid of .
With the increased ventilation there is of course increased pump action , and both these factors are equally physiological , in as much as both are excited by the state which they serve to relieve .
And so the muscular metabolism of a workman at steady work\#151 ; preferably piece-work\#151 ; is usefully measured by short samples of expired air from which his " CO2 ordinate , " i.e. , his established rate of CO2 discharge , is ascertained .
The procedure has two principal advantages : ( 1 ) The interruption of work is trifling ; it is , e.g. , cheerfully tolerated by piece-workers , to whom time is money : ( 2 ) The sampling is taken under actual conditions of work , and as nearly as possible during work .
Work done in a respiration chamber , or for a few minutes for the sake of affording a sample , cannot be regarded as normal or as affording a fair sample of the respiratory activity obtaining during normal work .
As is shown in this preliminary report , the constant regime during work is established at the beginning of work and disestablished at the end of work with surprising rapidity .
Samples should not be taken during either of these periods of change .
They should be taken if possible without interruption of work in progress , or if this should be impossible , with least interruption for the shortest practicable periods\#151 ; 20 to 30 seconds\#151 ; immediately after the load or tool has been dropped as , e.g. , in the carrying of coal or grain or meat , which form the hardest labour going on in the London docks .
An obvious drawback to short sampling is , of course , the possible error arising from turning the tap at beginning and end of say 30 seconds during different phases of respiration .
This error is to be avoided by turning the tap on and off at the same phase , i.e. , immediately after expiration .
In the mouthpiece which I prefer , the expiratory valve click is easy to follow , and I have not found any disturbance of the subject to be caused by the valve clicking , as has been reported by some observers .
For a subject breathing say 15 per minute , it is 2 to 1 against the tap being closed during the expiratory movement ; but if this should happen , a considerable error , amounting to perhaps 10 per cent. , might be made in a half-minute sample .

This was an orientation observation , by which the system of sample collection was shown to the labourer for the first time .
No difficulty in the use of the apparatus was experienced and no serious interruption of work occurred .
Serviceable data were obtained at once .
The effect of a brief rest for two or three minutes was evident , also the gradually increasing output of CO2 during the afternoon .
Three last readings were 13-98 , 15-00 , and 18-12 c.c. CO2 per second , i.e. , an average output of 15*7 c.c. ( gross ) per second ( = 319'7 Kalories per hour ) .
I quote this first observation in order to show that the collection of " first observations on a reasonably large " number of subjects under their normal conditions of work is a legitimate task and likely to afford serviceable data .
From inspection of the work in progress it appeared to me that the operation known as " tapping " ( in which a known weight is lifted to a regular height at a regular rhythm ) is one that lends itself best to a direct mechanical Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .
171 .estimation .
But the detailed study of this particular form of work was foreign to my present purpose , which is to make good the method of estimating the cost of work of unknown mechanical equivalence in terms of C02 discharged .
The next step in the enquiry was to take hourly observations of the C02 discharge for the complete day 's work and for several days .

The rapid fall of C02 during a rest pause of three or four minutes , 172 Dr. A. D. Waller .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular showing that it is necessary to take samples with least possible delay .
The average discharge for the last three hours of forenoon was 1353 : of afternoon 14-78 .
4 .
The maximum discharge is greater at the end of the afternoon than of the forenoon .
The volume of ventilation and the percentage of C02 were both higher in the first sample , taken immediately after the labourer had dropped tools than in the second sample , taken after a pause of three minutes .
There is , as may be seen throughout the protocols , a general correspondence between volume of ventilation and amount of C02 per second , so that it is allowable , with due reservation , to make use of ventilation alone as a guide to work done .
I have found this guide of value in prolonged observations , and when it was not possible to take samples by bag quickly enough to follow the change of output of C02 that takes place at the beginning and end of a spell of work .
Tor this purpose I have adapted a Verdin spirometer as a litre recorder of expired air during rest and during certain kinds of work .
The results obtainable by this means will be reported upon later .

The time of collection of samples was chosen as one minute when the subject was at rest , but when he was at work it was necessary to collect for a shorter period ; the beginning and end of each period was made by sharply turning the tap at the end of an expiration , as indicated by the valve click .
No disturbance by reason of this click was experienced by any of the subjects ; it Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .

3.0 30 14 467 2*5 11 *67 4.0 30 19 633 2 *4 15 19 The most remarkable " new fact " brought out in these observations is the progressive increase of the COa ordinate in successive hours , which must be Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .
179 due to one or other of two alternatives , viz. , increasing labour or decreasing efficien ey .
In view of its gradual progression from hour to hour , it cannot be attributed to a discharge of accumulated C02 , but is to be regarded as a true expression of the fact that the rate of internal production of C02 progressively increases .
A progressively increasing discharge of C02 for such long periods , otherwise than in consequence of its increased production , is inconceivable , whereas it is quite reasonable to imagine that the animal machine at constant work loses efficiency with lapse of time , i.e. , does its work at an increasing cost , as expressed by its discharge of C02 .
Unless , of course , it should be due to increasing work .
Between the two possible causes , ( 1 ) increase of work , ( 2 ) decrease of efficiency by fatigue , I am inclined towards the second as the more probable .
The root fact in fatigue is a consumption of material , presumably of carbohydrate in first instance , also of fat and of protein ; subjective fatigue is felt when a certain degree of waste has been incurred .
Objective fatigue commences long before its subjective aspect is experienced ; it begins , indeed , with the beginning of work , with increased metabolism , of which increased discharge of C02 is the indicator and measure , and in the progress of the expenditure there is no line of demarcation to be drawn between a state of freshness and a state of fatigue ; these terms are statements of the subjective states associated with the filled and unfilled reservoir of fuel .
Moreover , the progressive increase takes place with piece-work under conditions where the work is of steady value .
For reasons that will be more fully developed , I hope , in a future report , I regard the slowly increasing ordinate during presumably constant work as a sign of the increasing cost of such work , i.e. , of the decreasing efficiency of the worker .
The hourly rise of C02 during a continuous spell of work has been in my experience a rule without exception under all conditions of work so far examined , and if peradventure a worker shows a fall in the ordinate one may be certain that a temporary remission of work has occurred just before observation .
In the present examples the hourly rise has been particularly well marked with piece-work , as shown in diagram , where the starred hours have been piecework and the unstarred hours time-work .
It is still more marked , though with less apparent regularity , in cold storage labour , which is less regular , but while it lasts , more exacting .
The cold storage workman , on duty from 1 a.m. to 7 p.m. , is " standing by " through the night hours upon an hourly time wage that we may call basal .
180 Dr. A. D. Waller .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular As goods come in he is told off in gangs for piece-work , which brings him supplementary pay as his surplus .
He wants to earn this surplus , and each workman does so under the automatic supervision of his mates in the gang , who are earning money in common ; therefore he is working at full pressure , and the expired air collected from him at the end of each hour affords a fair sample of the level of C02 expenditure at which he is working .
This expenditure is the important fact to ascertain ; the result in cubic centimetres per second can afterwards be translated into calories per hour , and in this translation there is perhaps room for difference of opinion among different physiologists .
I am accustomed for the mental arithmetic of the conversion to think of 1 e.c. per second C02 as representing 20 cals , per hour ; but in case any other observer should be of a different opinion , and prefer to reckon from another respiratory quotient , I have given in the last column of Table YII Kalories per hour that correspond with different respiratory quotients .
The further conversion of calories per hour per individual into calories per hour per square metre is , of course , readily accomplished by taking out from Tables ( e.g. , that of Du Bois* ) the surface values corresponding to the weight and height of the individual in question .
Thus , e.g. , in the cases of Labourers No. 1 and No. 2:\#151 ; | Labourer .

I think it preferable to plot the C02 ordinate of the whole day and to estimate the day 's work from the area representing its net cost in cubic centimetres of C02 or in Kalories cubic centimetres of C02 x 20 ) .
The hourly figures given above have been averaged from the three last hours of work , omitting the first reading as being possibly too low .
Estimation of the area for the whole day includes , of course , the first reading and the hourly estimate obtained by dividing the day 's value by the number of hours of work comes out lower than the hourly figures averaged from the last three hours .
In the case of Labourer No. 2 the net cost of his six days ' work calculated by area comes out as follows:\#151 ; * Du Bois and Du Bois , " Tenth Paper on Clinical Calorimetry , " ' Archives of International Medicine , ' vol. 15 , Part II ( May 15 , 1915 ) .

From these figures I read as the hourly cost of piece-work 175 Kals per hour per square metre ; of time-work 100 Kals per hour per square metre , or 1400 and 800 Kals per day of eight hours .
The man-value of this labourer is considerably above that of the " average man " as defined by the Committee ( weight 89 kgrm .
, surface 2 square metres ) .
The allowance of 1900 calories made by the Committee for an average man should therefore , be increased by , say , 22 per cent. ( 27 per cent , according to weight , 17 per cent , according to surface ) , raising the allowance from 1900 to 2318 .
The total food-requirements of this labourer are thus:\#151 ; Per day ( 8 hours ) of heavy work ( time ) 2318 + 1600 = 3918 Of heaviest work ( piece ) 2318 + 2800 = 5118 , or in round figures , 4000 and 5000 Kalories .
The mechanical value of the ( eight-hour ) day 's work , costing 2800 and 1600 Kals , could be estimated if we knew the " physiological efficiency " of the worker .
This was not measured for Labourer No. 2 , but assuming that his efficiency was substantially the same as that measured for Labourer No. 1 , viz. , 25 per cent. , the calculation is as follows:\#151 ; Net cost .

The conclusion drawn from these tests was that an average healthy young man , fit for military service , can do at least 100,000 kgrm.-metres per day , and that a mechanical task of 200,000 kgrm.-metres per day is beyond his power .
I much regret that I did not then possess the simple apparatus necessary for keeping the CO2 ordinate during these tests , and should be very glad if any " healthy young man " would volunteer to repeat the tests with control of his CO2 .
Conclusion .
The Food ( War ) Committee , in its 'Report on the Food Requirements of Man , ' March , 1919 , has proposed the adoption of the following classification of manual workers , in conformity with the excess of energy expended during eight hours ' work over that expended during eight hours of sleep , as follows ( p. 5 ) Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .
183 Calories .
Sedentary ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
Less than 400 Light work ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
400 to 700 Moderate work ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
700 to 1100 Heavy work ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
1100 to 2000 ( Requirements apart from work ) ... . .
( 1900 ) These are " net " values , applicable to the daily sustenance of an " average man , " defined in the Report as " an adult man of 66 kgrm .
( unclothed ) , 171 centimetres in height , " * performing eight hours ' average work in a climate such as that of France or England .
We have to examine how far the results observed on these two dock labourers , working under normal conditions , conform to the recommendation of the Food ( War ) Committee , and to collate them with the results of other observers associated in the inquiry .
To make this comparison it will be necessary to reduce all results to a common denomination , preferably to the expression " calories per square metre per hour .
" Averaged from the last three hours of forenoon and afternoon work ( the first hour of work being omitted from calculation in order not to include readings taken before a steady regime has been established ) , the results in Kalories per square metre per hour come out as 127 and 123 for time-work , and 210 for piece-work .
But estimates based on the last three hours to the exclusion of the first are probably too high , and it is preferable , ( vnfo infra ) to estimate from the entire period of work inclusive of the first hour .
The results on this basis are approximately 100 Kalories per hour for time-work and 160 for piece-work .
With the exception of the last value , which represents a maximal value for the very heavy work accomplished in piece-work against time , the ordinary output for the heavy work done by these two labourers falls within the limits ( 78 to 142 ) contemplated for " heavy work " by the Food ( War ) Committee of the Royal Society , These results should also be compared with those reported to the Committee by Rosenheim and by Greenwood .
I have found some difficulty in making this comparison in the case of Rosenheim 's figures , which are for the most part given in terms of standard ( basal ) metabolism taken as l.f To quote these figures as they stand would not afford any obvious comparison ; 1 have therefore converted into Kalories * For comparison with our observations which were made on clothed labourers , we have taken the average man as weighing 70 kgrm .
clothed , with a body-surface of approximately 1*75 square metres .

Greenwood and his collaborators conclude their report by the following estimate , but the conditions of observation described in the text do not appear to have afforded any opportunity of securing normal work data.* According to the weight of work , the subjects of observation are arranged in four groups:\#151 ; Calories per sq .

100 " II " " 125 " HI \gt ; , " 160 " IV " " 180 These appear to be gross values , inclusive of the values of basal metabolism .
As stated in the report , the work was remarkably slack .
Nevertheless from them the four corresponding work quotas for a seven-hour day : 1120 , 1400 , 1782 , 2016 calories , which , augmented by 1410 for travelling and household work , with a 10 per cent , allowance for digestion , give as the final figures for the requirements of " strenuously employed industrial women " :\#151 ; 2810 , 3120 , 3555 , 3805 calories .
These are surprising figures in view of the slackness of work that prevailed during Greenwood 's observations .
According to his conclusion , a " strenuously * Greenwood , Hodson , and Tebb , " Report on the Metabolism of Female Munition Workers , " 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' B , vol. 91 , p. 62 ( 1919 ) .
It is stated in the Report that the experiments were carried out during November , December , January , February , and March , 1918-19 , in a factory , manufacturing 6-inch shell cases , and that in consequence of the relaxation of effort caused by the Armistice , the individual output was reduced by at least 50 per cent ... .
" The value of observations in this department ( Tool Setting ) is reduced by the notorious idleness of the operatives after November 11th .
Often the work under experimental study was all the work done in the hour .

185 employed industrial woman , " with a body surface of 1*6 square metres , requires nearly as much food-energy\#151 ; 3805 Kalories\#151 ; as does our dock labourer during hard work , viz. , 3918 Kalories .
The expression " work quota " might be understood to imply that the basal metabolism has been subtracted from the previous figures per metre , but , as stated on a previous page , the basal metabolism of the subjects was not measured .
The gross values 100 , 125 , 160 , 180 have , therefore , to be reduced by , say , 64 to give net results for comparison with our other data , viz. , 34 , 59 , 96 , 116 .
With these modifications , which have been necessary for the purpose of reducing the figures to a common denomination , the various sets of values presented to the Committee may be briefly set out as follows:\#151 ; Net Kalories per square metre per hour .

Adequate laboratory space has been placed at my disposal , and the courtesy of the officials and labourers with whom I have been brought in contact has made my task most agreeable .
I wish also to acknowledge the zeal , tact , and efficiency with which my assistant , Miss G- .
de Decker , has carried out the observations ; they could not have been made at all without such assistance , which has assumed more and more the character of an independent enquiry , conducted and reported on by herself alone .
This acknowledgment applies in fullest measure to the observations ( Part II ) of day-work and night-work carried out by Miss de Decker upon cold storage labourers .
