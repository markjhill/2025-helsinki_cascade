1893 ] this point on one of the known harmonic polars , the remaining two points in which the harmonic polar meets the cubic are found by a quadratic construction , and triangular symmetry completes the determination of the cubic ; the inflexional tangents to the Hessian and the cusps on the Cayleyan are found by linear constructions ; and the pairs of points in which these curves are met by the harmonic polar , by quadratic constructions .
Any coincidence among the points so found indicates some special cubic whose properties may thus be investigated ; among these special cubics are the equian-harmonic cubics , whose properties present themselves very simply by means of the preliminary constructions .
These special cubics are the critical ones when we follow out the variation in the Hessian and Cayleyan , which , depending directly on the variation in the original cubic , expresses itself by the change in the relative position of the points determined as above .
This variation is shown in a series of diagrams exhibiting the cubic , its Hessian , and Cayleyan ; and , finally , the results being compared with those derived from analysis , the variation is represented graphically by means of a single diagram .
