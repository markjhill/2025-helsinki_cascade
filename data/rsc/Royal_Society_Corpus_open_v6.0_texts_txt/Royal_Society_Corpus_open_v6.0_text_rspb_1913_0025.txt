) In previous papers by one of us ( 1 , 2 ) observations on the gaseous metabolism and on the nitrogen metabolism of tumour-bearing rats have been recorded .
The present paper contains observations on the carbohydrate metabolism of tumour-bearing rats .
The tumour-strain employed in our previous work was also used for these experiments ; it is a spindle-celled ' sarcoma ( J.R.S. of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund ) which has a rapid growth .
This tumour does not contain any glycogen .
A large number of glycogen estimations were carried out with the liver of normal and of tumour-bearing animals .
The glycogen estimations were made by Pfluger 's method ; the glucose obtained by the hydrolysis of glycogen was estimated in the first part of the work gravimetrically according to the technique used by Pfliiger ; later on , Bertrand 's method of titration was employed .
It is necessary to bear in mind that only 4 to 6 grm. of liver tissue are available for analysis in these estimations , so that with a glycogen percentage below 0T to 02 per cent , the absolute amount of glycogen present in the whole liver of a rat is so small that it cannot be determined * * This research is in continuation of papers in ' Roy .

accurately by these methods .
Quantities of glycogen below this limit are therefore indicated in the following tables by the expression " \lt ; 0-2 per cent. " Since the glycogen store of the liver is known to be dependent upon and influenced by external conditions , an attempt was made to equalise these as far as possible .
All the animals were of about the same age and weight ; they were kept on a constant diet of bread and milk in the special metabolism cages devised by Professor Schafer.* In some series the supply of food was limited to a definite quantity , which was sufficient to cover the requirements of the animal with regard to the growth of both the host and the tumour ; in other series the supply was ad libitum .
The results of these first observations , which have been grouped together in Table I , show that the glycogen-content of the liver of both normal and tumour-bearing animals varies within very wide limits .
The following data were also known , but since they were found to have no relation to the variations observed in this series , they have been omitted from the table :\#151 ; sex of host , weight of host .
The fact that the observations extended over several years also excludes the possibility of seasonal changes on the part of the host and of cyclical changes on the part of the tumour-cells as being responsible for these wide fluctuations .
These must have been caused , therefore , by factors which had not been controlled by the conditions under which the observations had been carried out .
A closer analysis of the results appeared to give a clue as to the nature of these factors .
It will be seen that the variations in the glycogen-content of the liver are , as a rule , not so marked in animals killed on the same day .
Now when several estimations were carried out on the same day , the animals were killed at practically the same time .
Since all the animals were always fed at the same time , it seemed possible that the influence of the time which elapsed between the last meal of the animal and the moment when the liver was subjected to analysis was operative within narrower limits\#151 ; in such small animals as rats at any rate\#151 ; than the data given in the literature for larger animals would lead one to suppose .
Some estimations carried out with normal rats weighing about 100 grm. showed that the glycogen-content of the liver was always relatively high three to five hours after a meal , and that 15 hours after a meal it fell so low ( below 02 per cent. ) that with the small amount of liver available it could not be determined .
In order to be able to compare the conditions in tumour-bearing animals with those in normal animals it was therefore necessary to compare animals in the same state of digestion and assimilation .
This object was attained in * For a detailed description , see 'Quart .

the following manner : Animals of approximately the same weight ( 100 grm. ) were kept for at least two weeks on a diet of bread and milk .
During the last five days the amount of food eaten was determined and , unless otherwise stated , the food was supplied ad libitum and was kept in the cages all the time , so that the animals could feed whenever they were hungry .
As a rule the amount of food consumed in 24 hours did not vary very much .
In the mornings when only a little food was left at the bottom of the beaker which the animal could not reach without difficulty , fresh food was placed in the cages , so that as a rule the animals would begin to feed at once .
Having determined the amount eaten , animals were selected which had consumed 1913 .

about equal quantities , the food was removed from the cage and a given time afterwards the animals were killed by breaking the neck .
In every case a normal and a tumour-bearing animal were killed at the same time .

\gt ; The results shoiv that a definite difference exists between the glycogen metaholism of a normal and a tumour-bearing animal : the glycogen disappears more rapidly from the liver of a tumour-bearing rat than from the liver of a normal rat .
This result is in complete agreement with some observations on the gaseous metabolism , which were carried out by one of us in 1908 ( 1 ) , and which have been confirmed since by Chisholm ( 3 ) .
It was found then that after a meal a tumour-bearing animal returns to the fasting state more rapidly than a normal animal .
These observations , taken together with those made four years ago by Cramer and Pringle on the nitrogen metabolism of tumour-bearing rats , throw some light on the metabolic conditions of an animal in which processes of active growth are taking place .
Cramer and Pringle found that a tumour transplanted into young growing rats grows to a considerable size without interfering with the growth of the animal .
As the tumour grew the nitrogen excretion of the host fell , so that there was a " sparing " of the 1 protein metabolism .
The present observations show that this " sparing " is associated with an increased carbohydrate metabolism .
In these experiments on the nitrogen metabolism it was necessary to maintain the animals on a constant nitrogen intake .
It might be argued that 306 Messrs. W. Cramer and J. Lochhead .
[ Jan. 16 , the " sparing " of the protein metabolism takes place only with a restricted food supply , but that with an unrestricted supply of food the animals simply take in more food and thus cover the requirements of the tumour .
But the experiments of Medigreceanu ( 4 ) , which we are able to confirm from our own observations , have shown that , even with an unrestricted food supply , tumourbearing animals do not eat more than normal animals .
He also found that the growth of the tumour , wThile it does not stimulate the host to an increased intake of food , leads to an increase in the weight of the liver ( 5 ) .
It is interesting to note that the same holds good also for pregnant animals .
The sparing action on the protein metabolism referred to above might be explained simply by assuming that in tumour-bearing rats more carbohydrate material is burnt up instead of protein material , and that the glycogen which disappears so rapidly from the liver of tumour-bearing animals , by being used as a source of energy , protects an isodynamic equivalent of protein material , which then becomes available for the formation of new protoplasm .
In that case the part taken by carbohydrates would not be specific and could be taken equally well by fats .
On the other hand there is the possibility that the more rapid disappearance of glycogen from the liver is due to the fact that , in addition to the carbohydrate material which is burnt up and used as a source of energy , some glycogen is used together with nitrogenous substances as material for the synthesis of new protoplasm .
The results of the observations on gaseous metabolism by Cramer and by Chisholm indicate that the latter alternative is the correct one .
For if in tumour-bearing animals more carbohydrate were oxidised in place of proteins than in normal animals , one would expect to find that the rise of the respiratory quotient from about 0*7 to about 1 which takes place after a meal rich in carbohydrates should be more persistent in tumour-bearing animals than in normal animals .
But the observations which we have quoted show that this is not the case ; on the contrary , if there is any difference between tumour-bearing animals and normal animals it tends , in the case of rats , to be in the direction of a less persistent rise of the respiratory quotient in the tumour-bearing animals .
We have repeatedly pointed out the close analogy which exists between the metabolic conditions of pregnancy and those of an animal bearing a transplanted new growth .
In the former , where a definite organ\#151 ; the placenta\#151 ; presides over the nutrition of the foetus , we have been able to show that carbohydrates are used as a material for the building up of the foetal protoplasm .
The relation of the liver to the nutrition of the tumour is not so intimate as that of the placenta to the nutrition of the foetus and does not afford so direct an insight into this aspect of the problem .
But the evidence 1913 .
] Contributions to the Biochemistry of 307 which we have brought forward in the present paper points to the same conclusions .
Conclusions .
Glycogen disappears more rapidly from the liver of tumour-bearing rats than from the liver of a normal rat .
Since observations on the gaseous metabolism showed that there is no increased oxidation of carbohydrate material in tumour-bearing animals , the results confirm the conclusion arrived at previously from observations on pregnant animals , that in growth carbohydrate material is used for the synthesis of protoplasm .
The expenses of this research were defrayed by grants from the Moray Fund of the University of Edinburgh .
