L'Jan.gl , 1 } are well seen also in the indium spectrum No. 5 from 3850 to 35U i f The enlargements of these prismatic spectra , however , cannot com. \#174 ; pare with the grating spectra , the air lines being , as far as possible , suppressed in the former .
X do not attribute much importance to the fact that argon gives two spectra ; the red appears to be the spectrum of the first order , or the spectrum of the lower temperature which corresponds thereto ; the blue is the line spectrum , or spectrum at the higher tem ' perature .
I have photographed simultaneously from the same spark the two spectra of nitrogen as rendered by atmospheric air .
It is therefore more likely that argon is one substance and not two .
Whether it is a compound or an element is a question into which the following considerations may enter .
There are at present no^gaseons substances known which can withstand the temperature of the condensed spark without exhibiting the spectra of one or other of the elements of which it is composed .
If , therefore , argon were N3 it would disclose the spectrum of nitrogen .
As the spectrum is not that of any known substance , it follows that , if a compound , it must be a compound of a new element .
A Letter from Prof. Fitzgerald upon the Atomicity of Argon was read .

( Abstract .
) The paper contains an application of the analysis used by M , Poincare , in his memoir " Sir l'equilibre d'une mass fluide animee dun mouvement de rotation , " * to the determination of the free I oscillations of a system consisting of a fluid mass contained within a rigid ellipsoidal envelope , rotating about one of its principal axes , t ia found that , when such a system is oscillating in one of its undamental modes , the disturbances of the fluid are all expressible I means of Lame functions , the functions involved being all of the j order ; and a method of obtaining the frequencies of these ijj OScblations , similar to that used by M " Poincare for a fluid ellipsoid with a free surface , is given .
he oscillations , however , which involve Lame functions of the ^econd order , demand exceptional treatment in consequence of the p'.C t at these alone imply any disturbance of the containing shell .
