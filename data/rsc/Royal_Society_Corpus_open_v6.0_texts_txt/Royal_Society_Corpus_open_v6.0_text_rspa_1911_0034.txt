Also from equation 2 ) it appears that the final slope of the curve divided by its initial slope , i.e. , , is equal to Hence we can calculate and .
These numbers were calculated in several cases and found be in reement with those found by the more direct method which ill now be described .
Method of Investigation .
In equation ( 4 ) the term results from the fact that corpuscular produced in the gas in the layer next to the bounding walls aoe stopped produced should entail quite a small effect and only at low ; Indeed , in the experimental culves it was found impossible to deUei irregularities due to this cause .
When curves connecting ionisation and pressure were now drawn , it found that in every case the curve was a straight line through the ( fig. 4 ) .
Since a curve representing equation ( 5 ) can only be obtained it FIG. \mdash ; Se Radiator .
coefficient of the corpuscular rays from the films , can be determined from th6 curve in fig. 5 in the manner described in a previous paper .
* The values of are given in Table I , Column 4 .
To obtain the total ionisation in relative to that in air , the ionisation in the vessel was measured at different pressures when the vessel was occupied by 1 ) , ( 2 ) air .
The ratio of the slopes of the linear parts of the thus obtained gives the total ionisation in relative to that in air for any particular radiator .
The values the relative total ionisation are given in Table , Column 5 .
