The fundamental conditions are :\#151 ; 1 .
That aqueous vapour and carbon compounds are present in stellar or interplanetary space .
2 .
That these gaseous compounds are capable of being dissociated by radiant solar energy while in a state of extreme attenuation .
3 .
That these dissociated vapours are capable of being compressed into the solar photosphere by a process of interchange with an equal amount of reassociated vapours , this interchange being effected by the centrifugal action of the sun itself .
If these conditions could be substantiated , we should gain the satisfaction that our solar system would no longer impress us with the idea of prodigious waste through dissipation of energy into space , but rather with that of well-ordered self-sustaining action , capable of perpetuating solar radiation to the remotest future .

( Abstract .
) This paper contains an account of a repetition by Dr. Schuster , Mrs. Sidgwick , and myself , of the British Association experiment on the unit of resistance with an improved apparatus .
Three distinct series of observations were taken , of which the two first were more or less imperfect .
In the third series an extraordinary concordance in the results obtained on different occasions at the same speed of rotation was arrived at , but the numbers corresponding to the four speeds 1882 .

The " number of teeth " in the first row is inversely as the speed of rotation .
The second row gives the resistance of a certain platinum-silver standard at 13 in absolute measure , as calculated with a value of the self-induction derived from evidence independent of the spinnings .
The simple mean of these numbers is 23*627 ( xlO9 C.G.S. ) , but they exhibit a well-marked tendency to rise with the speed .
In the third row are numbers proportional to the squares of the speeds , by subtraction of which a practically perfect agreement is arrived at .
The mean 23-612 thus represents the result of the investigation , if the effect of self-induction be determined from the spinnings themselves , and is to be preferred for reasons explained in the paper to the simple mean 23*627 .
The difference is , however , less than one part in a thousand .
The resistance at 13 ' of the same coil in terms of B.A. units is 23*935 , from which we find 1 B.A. unit = -98651 eM'th *"*\#187 ; ! !

Rowland 's value is distinctly higher ( *9911 ) , while Kohlrausch obtained 1*02 .
No satisfactory reconciliation of these results is arrived at , but some remarks are made upon the relative merits of the various methods .
