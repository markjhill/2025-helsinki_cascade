Antelope Infected with Trypanosoma gambiense .
By Captain A. D. Fraser , B.A.M.C. , and Dr. H. L. Duke .
( Communicated by Sir John Bradford , Sec. R.S. Received December 2 , 1911 , \#151 ; Read January 25 , 1912 .
) The Sleeping Sickness Commission of the Royal Society , Uganda , 1908-10 , \lt ; showed that waterbuck , bushbuck and reedbuck could be readily infected with a human strain of Trypanosoma gambiense , and that clean laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis were capable of transmitting the virus from the infected antelope to susceptible animals .
In the present paper , observations which were made upon these antelope during the eight months subsequent to the Commission 's departure from Uganda are recorded .
Experiments are also described which show that the duiker\#151 ; another species of antelope common in most parts of Uganda\#151 ; can also be similarly infected with a human strain of T. gambiense .
As regards the antelope employed by the Commission , six of the nine remained in apparently excellent health in April , 1911\#151 ; roughly , a year after they were infected .
Until Bushbuck 2428 escaped from the kraal , and Bushbuck 2372 died 338 days after its infection as the result of an accident , they had also been healthy .
A post-mortem examination was made immediately after death in the case of Bushbuck 2372 , but no evidence of trypanosomiasis was found .
Reedbuck 2427 appeared to be perfectly healthy for 200 days after it had been infected .
It then died suddenly .
At the post-mortem examination performed immediately after death the prescapular glands were found to be the size of a hazel-nut .
On section they were haemorrhagic .
There were numerous petechiae on the mucous membrane of the mesentery .
The 1911 .
] Antelope Infected with Trypanosoma gambiense .
485 mucous membrane of the fourth stomach also showed many petechiae .
Microscopical examination of smears made from the various organs was negative .
It is , therefore , impossible to say what the cause of death was in the case of this buck .
With the view of ascertaining how long the antelope remained infected , investigations were carried out on the following lines:\#151 ; 1 .
Feeding laboratory-bred G-lossina palpalis for several days on the antelope and subsequently endeavouring to infect a healthy susceptible animal .
2 .
Dissecting these flies and examining them for flagellates .
3 .
Injecting blood of the buck into animals susceptible to T. gambiense infection .
Table I gives the detailed results obtained by the first of these methods The number of days which elapsed from the date on which the buck was infected until the commencement of the experiment is given .
" Hereditary transmission " flies indicates that the flies before being put upon the antelope had been fed for 30 days upon healthy monkeys to ascertain if laboratory-bred flies which had never fed upon an infected animal could give rise to an infection .
As it has been suggested that flies were most readily infected when their first feed was upon an infected animal , these flies were used with the view of obtaining evidence on this point , control experiments being at the same time made with lahoratory-bred flies which had not fed before they were put upon the antelope .
Although it will be noted that no infection occurred among the " hereditary transmission " flies , whereas the control flies sometimes became infected , the numbers of the flies used are too small to allow of any \#166 ; conclusions being arrived at .
It will be noted that flies which were fed on Bushbuck 2372 , 315 days after it had been infected with a human strain of T. gambiense , became infected and successfully transmitted the disease to a healthy monkey .
Table II gives the results of the dissections of laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis which had fed on the infected antelope .
The experiments recorded in Tables I and II are summarised and grouped according to the length of time the antelope had been infected in Table III .

[ Dec. 2 , It will be seen that positive experiments were obtained from all the buck ( nine examined ) when the flies were fed upon them before 200 days had elapsed from the date of the antelope 's infection .
When more than 200 days had elapsed four of the seven buck examined yielded positive results . ?
The results of all experiments are shown in Table IY .

This diminution becomes still more striking when these results are compared with those recorded by the Commission of experiments carried out soon after the antelope were infected .
( Of the 24 experiments carried out by the Commission 17 were positive , 1722 flies were dissected , and 6-9 per cent , were found to be infected .
) The results of injecting blood of these antelope into susceptible animals are shown in Table V ( p. 491 ) .
It is seen that the injection of a small quantity of the blood of Bush-buck 2372 , 327 days after it had been infected with T. gambiense , produced an infection in a white rat .
This , however , was the only positive result which was obtained .
Three injections were carried out from Waterbuck Experiment 2378\#151 ; on one occasion 5 c.c. of blood was injected\#151 ; and all were negative .
It will be remembered that the Commission found it easy to produce infections in susceptible animals by injecting the blood taken from these antelope soon after they were infected .

Can a Duiker be Infected with a Human Strain of T. gambiense ?
Experiment 99 , Duiker.\#151 ; On August 30 , 1910 , 3 c.c. of this buck 's blood were injected subcutaneously into a normal monkey to ascertain if the antelope naturally harboured trypanosomes .
The monkey 's blood was examined regularly for a month .
No trypanosomes appeared in its blood , the monkey remaining healthy .
For nine days ( January 25 to February 2 , 1911 , inclusive ) laboratory-bred G. palpalis known to be infected with a human strain of T. gambiense were fed upon the buck .
On February 4 , the tenth day after the infected flies first fed upon the antelope , T. gambiense appeared in fair numbers in its blood .
On February 10 and 11 , 1911 , 119 clean laboratory-bred G. palpalis were fed upon the duiker .
These flies were subsequently fed on a normal monkey , which they infected after 28 days had elapsed from the date of their first feed on the buck .
Of 42 flies which were dissected , two were found to be infected with flagellates .
Remarks.\#151 ; The duiker was free from trypanosomes inoculable into a monkey on its arrival at the laboratory .
T. gambiense appeared in the buck 's blood on the tenth day after infected flies had fed upon it , and clean laboratory-bred flies successfully transmitted the infection to a healthy susceptible monkey .
492 Dr. A. Harden and Mrs. D. Norris .
Production [ Nov. 22 Conclusions .
1 .
Antelope may remain in apparently perfect health for a year after having been infected with a human strain of T. gambiense .
2 .
One antelope was still capable of infecting clean laboratory-bred G. palpalis 315 days after it had been infected .
3 .
A small quantity of blood taken from one antelope 327 days after ita infection was proved by inoculation into a white rat to be infective .
4 .
As the interval after the infection of the antelope increases their infectivity , as tested by " cycle " transmission experiments , dissection of flies which have fed upon them , and by the injection of the buck 's blood into susceptible animals , appears to diminish .
5 .
A duiker was infected with a human strain of gambiense by feeding infected G. palpalis upon it .
The Bacterial Production of Acetylmethylcarbinol and 2.3-Butylene Glycol from Various Substances .
By Arthur Harden , F.RS .
, and Dorothy Norris .
( Received November 22 , 1911 , \#151 ; Read February 1 , 1912 .
) ( From the Biochemical Department , Lister Institute .
) In working out the action of B. lactis on glucose quantitatively .
Harden and Walpole ( 1 ) found that , in addition to the products already noted in the action of B. coli communis on glucose ( 2 ) , a small quantity of acetylmethylcarbinol , CH3CH(OH)COCH3 , and a- considerable proportion of 2.3-butylene glycol , CH3CH(OH)CH(OH)-CH3 , were formed , the latter corresponding to about 33 per cent , of the carbon of the sugar fermented .
The production of acetylmethylcarbinol by the action of tenuis , B. subtilis and B. mesentericus vulgatus , and similar organisms on glucose , had been previously noted by Grimbert ( 3 ) and by Desmots ( 4 ) .
The presence of acetylmethylcarbinol is of especial interest , as it has been shown to be the substance responsible for the Yoges and Proskauer reaction ( 5 ) .
In view of this fact , and of the interest attaching to this mode of decomposition of glucose , it becomes a matter of some importance to discover what substances will give rise to acetylmethylcarbinol and butylene glycol during fermentation , and also which bacteria are capable of producing these two compounds .
