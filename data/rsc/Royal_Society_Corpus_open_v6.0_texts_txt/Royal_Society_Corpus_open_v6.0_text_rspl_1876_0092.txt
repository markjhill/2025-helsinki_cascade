In my previous paper I endeavoured to establish a basis for calculating the amount of fresh air necessary to keep an air-space sufficiently pure von .

b 2 Dr. F. S. B. Francois de Chaumont on [ May 4 , for health , taking the carbonic acid as the measure .
The results showed \lt ; that the mean amount of carbonic acid as respiratory impurity in air un-distinguishable by the sense of smell from fresh external air was under 0*2000 per 1000 volumes * .
My object in the present note is to call attention to the relative effects of temperature and humidity upon the condition of air , as calculated from the same observations .
If we adopt the figures of Class No. 1 ( that is " fresh , " or not differing sensibly from the external air ) we find the following :\#151 ; Temperature .
Humidity .
Carbonic acid .
63 ' F. 73 per cent. 0*1943 per 1000 volumes .
If , now , we arrange the observations according as they differ from the above standard of temperature and humidity , and note the record of sensation attached to each , we may ascertain how far the said record departs ( if at all ) from what it ought to have been as calculated from the actual C02 .
To do this we may employ the numerical values of the different classes , taking No. 1 ( fresh ) as unity , thus :\#151 ; Class .

4*66 Taking each observation and dividing the C02 found by the mean quantity of No. 1 , viz. 0*1943 , we get a number which will give the theoretical value of its effect upon the se nes ; and by comparing this with the actual value of the recorded sensation , we can note whether the difference is plus or minus , if any .
All observed quantities of C02 below 0*1943 are considered equal to that number , and all quantities above 0*9054 as equal to it , as the sense of smell does not seem capable of differentiating quantities except between those limits .
Out of 458 fully recorded cases , 186 gave a recorded sensation in excess of the theoretical value\#151 ; that is , the air seemed less pure than would have been expected from its C02 .
In these the average temperature and humidity were both above Class 1 .
* In the former paper the amount was given at 0*1830 per 1000 ; but on revising the calculations , a previously unobserved error was found in one of the constants employed , l the correction for which would have the effect of altering the figures a little , the changes being as follows.\#151 ; Respiratory impurity as COa .

] the Theory of Ventilation .
152 cases gave a recorded sensation , below the theoretical value\#151 ; that is , the air seemed purer than would have been expected from its C02 .
In those cases the average temperature was above , but the average humidity below the mean of Class 1 .
120 cases gave a recorded sensation that exactly corresponded with the theoretical value .
In those cases the average temperature was above and the average humidity below the mean of Class 1 .
Arranging these results and putting F for the temperature in degrees of Fahrenheit , and H for the humidity per cent. , we have :\#151 ; + 58-6 F+86 H + 230-8 F \#151 ; 82 H + 244-0 F\#151 ; 91 H + 197-70 - 117-37 0 [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] f " Aggregate difference of the .\lt ; recorded and the theore-|_ tical value of sensation .

Do .
Adding the two last equations , we have , + 474'-8 F \#151 ; 173 H = - 117*37 [ 4 ] Do .
From [ 1 ] and [ 4 ] we can determine the respective values of F and H , which are as follow :\#151 ; F = 0-4730 H = 1-9765 Or , stated in terms of C02 , by multiplying by 0-1943 , F == 0*0919 H = 0-3833 per 1000 vok .
Taking F as unity , we have , F : H : : 1-0000 : 4-1789 Or an increase of 1 per cent , of humidity has as much influence on the condition of an air-space ( as judged of by the sense of smell ) as a rise of 4'-18 of temperature in Fahrenheit 's scale , equal to 2'-32 Centigrade , or l'-86 Reaumur .
This may be taken as a proof of the powerful influence exercised by a damp atmosphere , corroborating the conclusions arrived at by ordinary experience ; and it follows that as much care ought to be taken to ensure * proper hygrometric conditions as to maintain a sufficiently high temperature .
This is especially the case in the wards or chambers of the sick , in which regular observations with the wet and dry-bulb thermometers ought to be made ; these would probably give a valuable indication of the condition of the ventilation , either along with or in the absence of other more detailed investigations .
Thus a room at the temperature of 60 ' F. and with 88 per cent , of humidity contains 5*1 grains of vapour per cubic foot : suppose the external air to be at 50 ' F. with the same humidity , 88 per cent. ; this would give 3*6 grains of vapour per cubic foot ; to reduce the humidity in the room to 73 per cent. , or 4*2 grains per cubic foot , we must add the following amount of external air , 5-1 - 4-2 _ 4-2 \#151 ; 3-6 * \gt ; 4 On Absorption-Spectra .
[ May 4 , or once and a half the volume of air in the room .
If the inmates have each 1000 cubic feet of space , it follows that either their supply of fresh air is short by 1500 cubic feet per head per hour , or else that there are sources of excessive humidity within the air-space which demand immediate removal .

Received March 16 , 1876 .
( Abstract .
) The paper contains the results of an exact series of measurements of the absorption-spectra of the vapours of the element bromine and of the compound iodine monochloride , made with the object of ascertaining whether the molecules of these two gases vibrate identically or similarly , their molecular weights and colour of the vapours being almost identical .
The two spectra , which are both channelled , were compared simultaneously by means of one of Kirchhoff 's 4-prism spectroscopes , the position of the lines being read off by reflection on an arbitrary scale .
In order to determine the wave-lengths of these bands , the wave-length of each of 27 air-lines lying between the extremes of the absorption-spectra was ascertained by reference to Thalen 's numbers ; whilst for the purpose of reducing the readings of the absorption-bands to wave-lengths a graphical method was employed , the details of which are given in the paper .
This method appears to be one of general applicability for the plotting of spectra .
Tables then follow giving the wave-lengths of 66 bands of each absorption-spectrum ; and a map accompanies the text in which the bands are drawn to a scale one half that of Angstrom 's " Spectre Normal .
" A careful comparison of these Tables and of the map shows that , although both spectra contain a large number of lines which are nearly coincident , the spectra as a whole are not identical , either when the vapours are examined at high or low temperatures , or when the lengths of the columns of absorbing gas are varied .
