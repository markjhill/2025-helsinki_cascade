" On the Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight at Kew and Para in 1865-67 .
" By HENRY E. ROScOE , F. I.S. Eeceived May 14 , 1867 .
( Abstract .
) This communication contains the results of a regular series of measurements of the chemical action of daylight , carried out at the Kew Observatory , through the kindness of Dr. Balfour Stewart , according to the method described by the author in the Philosophical Transactions for 1864 , p. 605 .
The observations extend over a period of two years , from April 1 , 1865 to March 31 , 1867 .
The second part of the communication gives the results of observations upon the Intensity of the Chemical action of Sunlight under the Equator , made at Para in latitude 1ยง 28 ' S. during the month of April 1866 .
I. J.iew Observacions .
The Kew measurements do not profess to exhibit the changes in chemical intensity which occur from hour to hour , but : they give , with accuracy , the mean monthly chemical intensity , showing the rise and fall with the changing seasons of the year , and they enable us to deduce the mean monthly and yearly chemical intensities at Kew for 1865-67 .
Tables showing the daily mean chemical intensity obtained from the daily observations , according to the method described in the above-mentioned paper , are given .
The first result which these observations yield is that the mean chemical intensity for hours equidistant from noon is constant ; that is , the mean chemical intensities are equal for equal altitudes of the sun ; thus the mean of all the observations made about 911 301 " A.M. corresponds with the mean intensity at 211 30 " P.M.

20 Hence the author concludes that when the disturbing causes of variation in amount of cloud , &amp; e. are fully eliminated by a sufficient number of observations , the daily maximum of chemical intensity corresponds to the maximum of sun 's altitude .
The author then shows from measurements made at varying altitudes of the sun at H4eidelberg and Pari , that the relation between sun 's altitude and chemrical intensity may be represented by the equation C01 = CIO const .
a , where CIa represents the chemical intensity at a given altitude ( a ) in circular measure , CTI the chemical intensity at the altitude 0 , and const .
( a ) a number to be calculated from the observations .
The agreement of the chemical intensities as found at Heidelberg with the calculated results is seen in the following Table:-Altitude .

0506 A similar relation is found to hold good for the Para observations .
Assuming the same relation to exist at Kew as at Heidelberg and Par , , the values of the mean monthly intensity at noon have been calculated from the observations at 2.30 and 4.30 P.M. , and the mean monthly integrals of chemical intensity for each month , from April 1865 to March 4 1867 inclusive , have been obtained .
Curves exhibiting the daily rise and fall for each of the twenty-four months , as well as a curve showing the biennial variation of chemical intensity for the same period , accompany the paper .
The curve of yearly chemical intensity is found to be unsymmetrical about the vernal and autumnal equinoxes ; thus in spring and autumn the results are as follows:1865-67 .

The author discusses the probable causes of this autumnal maximum ; he finds that it is not due to variation in the amount of cloud , and believes that it is to be explained by a less amount of atmospheric opalescence in the autumn than in the spring .
The yearly integral for the twelve months , January to March 1867 and April to December 1865 , is 55'7 , whereas that for the twelve months of the year 1866 is 54-7 .
II .
Pared Observations .
All the knowledge we possess concerning the distribution and intensity of the chemically active rays in the tropics is derived from the vague statements of photographers .
According to their observations it appears that the difficulty of obtaining a good photograph increases as we approach the equator ; and more time is said to be needed to produce the same effect upon a sensitive plate under the full blaze of a tropical sun than is required in the gloomier atmosphere of London .
Thus in Mexico , where the light is very intense , from twenty minutes to half aii hour is stated to be required to produce photographic effects which in England occupy but a minute .
Hence the existence of a peculiar retarding influence has been suggested which the heating and luminous rays are supposed to exert upon the more refrangible portions of the spectrum .
The fallacy of these statements has been fully proved by a series of direct measurements of the chemical intensity of sunlight under the equator , made at Para by Mr. T. E. Thorpe .
The curves of daily chemical intensity given in the paper show that the activity of the chemical rays in the tropics is very much greater-on one day fifty-five times as great , as in our latitudes ; and these measurements prove that the reported failures of photographers cannot at any rate be ascribed to a diminution in the chemical intensity of sunlight .
The following numbers give some of the daily mean chemical intensities at Para compared with the same days in Kew : 43 Daily Mean Chemical Intensity .
