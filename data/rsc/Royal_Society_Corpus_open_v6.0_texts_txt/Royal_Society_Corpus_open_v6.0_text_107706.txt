On the north polar distances of the principal fixed stars .
By JOHN BRINKLEY , D. D. F. R. S. &amp;c. Andrew 's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin .
Read December 18 , 893 .
THE apparent disagreement of the Catalogues of North Polar distances of the fixed stars,.as given by different astronomers , has lately excited considerable attention .
Many persons may be induced to imagine , that the means of making observations are not in so perfect a state as has been supposed .
The following examination of some important points relative to this subject , will , I hope , be deemed not unworthy of the notice of the Royal Society .
A comparison of the North Polar distances of Mr. POND and Mr. BESSEL , with my own , may give occasion to some useful enquiries .
It will give me an opportunity of stating the results of my researches relative to southern motion , to which my catalogues of 18s1 and 1823 are , as is known , quite opposed .
In discussing these subjects , I hope I shall be considered as searching after truth , not as handling a useless controversy , than which nothing can be more injurious to science .
It will be necessary for me to enter into a considerable detail , I shall therefore briefly state the objects of the following enquiries .
Of the recent Catalogues that have been formed of the principal fixed stars , two , those of Dublin and Greenwich , agree very exactly .
That of Mr. BESSEL differs considerably ; but the differences are such that they would agree by a modification of the constants of refraction used .
This leads me to some considerations respecting the different modes in which my Tables of Refraction , and those of Mr. BESSEL , have been constructed .
I do not venture to decide which Catalogue will ultimately be found more correct , that of Dublin , and consequently that of Greenwich , or that of Konigsberg .
Mr. POND , however , does not admit the agreement of the Dublin and Greenwich Catalogues , because we use different refractions , and for comparison , takes my column of North Polar distances , computed by BRADLEY'S refractions.* From the differences then resulting , he infers a flexure of my instrument .
But that such reasoning is inconclusive , will , I think , appear from what I shall afterwards state .
In asserting the general agreement of the Catalogues of Dublin and Greenwich , both for 1813 and 1823 , 1 mean , they agree within certain narrow limits .
The mean of the differences of the Catalogues of 1813 is only a few tenths of a second .
The mean of the differences of the Catalogues of 1823 is still less .
It must therefore at first view appear extraordinary , that from the comparison of the two Catalogues of Greenwich a southern motion is deduced , whereas none appears from a comparison of the two Dublin Catalogues ; but this is easily explained by an examination of the Catalogues .
From the weight of external testimony that I shall adduce , I think it will readily be conceded to me , that the southern motion does not exist .
It will follow , therefore , that the mean Southern motion must be regarded as an error belonging to one or both of the Greenwich Catalogues of 1813 and 1823 .
It may be inferred , that the mean error principally belongs to the Catalogue of 1813 , as the mean exactness of the Greenwich Catalogue of 1823 may be inferred from its agreement with the Dublin Catalogue of 1823 .
This is the only way it can be inferred .
The observations by reflection only go to prove a relative exactness ; for , in consequence of the Pole Star not having been observed at Greenwich by reflection , it was necessary for Mr. POND to assume the latitude of Greenwich , more or less , to accommodate it to the mean error of the Catalogue .
In my researches relative to the Southern motion , I have been able to avail myself of the result of important observations by Dr. BRADLEY , made at Wanstead , in 728 ; of zenith observations made in France , in 1740 ; of Dr. MASKELYNE'S observations at Schehallien , in 1774 ; of General MUDGE 's observations with the zenith sector , in 1802 ; and of General LAMBTON'S zenith distances observed in the Mysore , in 18o5 .
All these observations were made with instruments not inferior to the zenith sector with which BRADLEY so exactly ascertained the quantity of the aberration of light , and it is not necessary for my purpose to suppose them superior .
It has been said , that the Westbury observations of Mr. POND confirm the Southern motion , as also a few stars observed by MECHAIN , in the late French measurement .
But the irregularities to be found in comparing the Westbury Catalogue with the two Catalogues by the Greenwich mural circle , show that the former cannot be of any use in this enquiry .
The few French results that appear to support the Southern motion , are opposed to other results by better instruments .
The Palermo Catalogue , published by M. PTAZZI , as containing the correct result of all his observations , when compared with BRADLEY'S Catalogue of 1755 , and the two Dublin Catalogues afford a remarkable testimony in favour of the uniformity of the annual variation in declination of the principal stars .
This result of the question of the Southern motion , appears adverse to the opinion advanced by Mr. POND , relative to the decided superiority of the Greenwich over the Dublin circle .
If we are to judge of the instruments by the observations , I am probably right in the opinion I have long entertained , of the unfitness of the Greenwich circle for the accurate investigation of small motions .
Whereas I have generally found my instrument consistent in that respect ; unless it be said , it has deceived me in regard to the parallax of a Lyrae .
This , resting on the authority of the Greenwich instrument , I am not at present disposed to admit .
I had intended concluding with some notices respecting Mr. POND'S paper " on the Parallax of a Lyrae , " read before the Royal Society on the same day as that relative to the Southern motion ; but as that paper requires to be particularly remarked on , I 53 shall here confine myself to the consideration of the North Polar distances , and as connected therewith of the Southern motion .
On the Catalogues of JVorth Polar Distances .
I have placed , in Table I. , beside each other , the North Polar distances observed at Greenwich about 1813 , and at Dublin about the same time , together with the differences .
In like manner have been placed also the Greenwich and Dublin North Polar distances of 1823 together with the differences .
An inspection of these will show , except in one or two instances , a very extraordinary agreement .
Many of the Polar distances differ by less than 1 " ; and with the exception of Sirius , in the Catalogue of 1813 , the differences are never greater than what might arise from accidental circumstances .
The Greenwich Catalogue of 1813 is less in its mean quantity than that of Dublin by o",47 , and the Greenwich Catalogue of 1823 is greater than that of Dublin in its mean quantity by o " , io .
But we are to consider that these Catalogues are computed by different tables of refraction .
The constant of refraction ( si-in BRADLEY'S table ( that used by Mr. POND ) is 57 " .
In my Table it is 57",72 .
My constant has been determined by the circle and the meteorological instruments used here , and therefore must necessarily be adopted for my observations .
When an astronomer has found the constant of refraction by his own instruments , his Catalogue of North Polar distances ought to be formed independently of any other instrument or table of refractions .
No partial change can be admitted .
Mr. POND , 54 however , as has been mentioned , has done otherwise , and applied BRADLEY'S refractions to my Catalogue.* I particularly regret this circumstance , because it has occasioned my Catalogue to appear to differ more from that of Mr. BESSEL , than it really does .
The differences that actually exist are sufficiently difficult to account for .
Indeed had Mr. POND also reduced the Catalogue of Mr. BESSEL by the same refraction , the differences would have appeared much better .
But this mode of proceeding would not have been less objectionable .
From the differences between his own Catalogue and my Catalogue reduced , Mr. POND infers that my telescope is subject to flexure by the quantity of the difference at each zenith distance .
Now it must appear a very extraordinary law , and not easily reconcilable to any mechanical principle , that the flexure should be nearly as the tangent of the zenith distance .
This it must necessarily be according to his method of changing my North Polar distances .
It is evident , by comparing the two Catalogues , that there is no difference between them but what might arise from unavoidable errors .
Had each star been exact to the tenth of a second , still Mr. POND 's reasoning would have led him to do the same .
He would have reduced them by BRADLEY'S refractions , and so made the Catalogues differ .
He attributes the differences to flexure .
Now he admits that the flexure would be the same at equal distances on each side of the zenith ; but it does not appear to have occurred to him that my refractions were determined by observations of circumpolar stars to the north of the zenith by the same instrument , and that therefore they must be exactly in error by the quantity of flexure ; and so when applied to stars south of the zenith , must exactly compensate for the effects of flexure.* Mr. POND did not perceive that what he took away with one hand , he ought to have restored with the other , and so left my Catalogues as he found them .
It is difficult to say how far the difference of our constants of refraction may be occasioned by a discordance in the meteorological instruments .
This should be enquired into .
It is still more difficult to imagine a difference in the mean refractions at the two places .
In whatever way the subject is considered , the coincidence of the Greenwich and Dublin Catalogues speaks in the strongest manner for the excellence of the divisions of both instruments .
This coincidence will , if I mistake not , appear in a stronger point of view , by deducing the co-latitude of Greenwich from applying the zenith distance of each star , as observed by reflection at Greenwich , to the Polar distance of the same star as given in the Dublin Catalogue for 1823 .
The results are given in Table 2 .
The mean of the 30 stars is 38 ? ?
31 ' 20",8 , or two tenths of a second less than that assumed by Mr. POND , and four tenths greater than that found by Mr. BESSEL , from .
Dr. BRADLEY'S observations .
The difficulty that has arisen from the comparison of the Greenwich and Dublin Catalogues with that of Mr. BESSEL , is now to be considered .
In this also , there will , I think , be nothing found adverse to that degree of accuracy , which is supposed to belong to modern instruments and modern observations .
It will readily appear , that the differences between the Dublin Catalogue and that of Mr. BESSEL , are equivalent to achange in the constant of refraction of about one second .
If , in computing the Dublin observations , we increase my constant of refraction by half a second , and in computing the Konigsberg observations , we decrease Mr. BESSEL'S constant of refraction by half a second , the Catalogues will be found to agree sufficiently .
It is not necessary to search for other causes till we are assured this is not the true one .
The investigation of the exact constant of refraction will be found one of great difficulty , if we consider the nature of it .
Mr. BESSEL and I have proceeded by different methods , and , in some respects , my method appears more likely to lead to an accurate result .
Mr. BESSEL'S object is to obtain a formula that shall embrace all elevations from the zenith to the horizon , and , therefore , he necessarily assumes a law of variation of density in the atmosphere .
In my investigation , I only consider zenith distances not greater than about 75 ?
or 76 ?
, where no sensible effect is produced from our ignorance of the law of variation of density .
Let us consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method .
Mr. BESSEL* supposes the equation of density to be g---1 P=(P)eg-"'as p being the density at the height , as &amp; ( p ) that at the surface , a being the radius of the earth , and I the height of an uniform atmosphere .
He proposes to find g , so that the formula of refraction deduced may satisfy the observations .
He has therefore two unknown quantities , g , and the constant of refraction , k. When we consider the irregularities of refraction at low altitudes , and the number of observations required to make those irregularities disappear , it may be thought that the problem is unnecessarily involved by requiring the investigation of two unknown quantities , and , under the circumstances of the case , there is reason to suppose that the observations may be satisfied within certain small limits , by assigning values , Astronom , Fundament .
p. 28 .
58 to k , even differing i " , by making corresponding changes in g , so that the problem partakes toomuch of the nature of an indeterminate one .
Thus the advantage apparently gained by large refractions , is lost by attendant inconveniences .
In my investigation , there is only one unknown quantity , but then I have much smaller quantities to work with .
Theory gives as far as about 76 ?
, whatever be the law of variation of density in the atmosphere .
The mean refraction ( r ) =k tan .

&amp;c. ( 1 v 'a cos. zz being the zenith distance .
By a table of refractions , or by the pole star , and a star or stars more remote , k is easily obtained nearly .
Then if the true value be k+ dk dr= dk tan .
z(2 ) sufficiently exact .
Let A and B be the observed zenith distances of a circumpolar star , ( considering B negative when south of the zenith ) above and below the pole , R &amp; R ' the refractions exactly computed by the formula ( i ) , k being the approximate constant of refraction .
Then by ( 2 ) Co-lat .

B Hence , if C represent the mean co-latitude thus determined by circumpolar stars remote from the pole , and NIthat by stars near the pole , we obtain an equation of the form C+mdk N+n dk and dk c m-n In this investigation the Z. D. of the stars remote from the Pole , should not be greater , when below the Pole , than about .
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy , Vol. 12 .
76:or 77 ?
0 , and not less than about 69 ?
or 70 ? .
Let us suppose it in its mean quantity at about 7s3 , and then the value of m will be about tan= 1,6 , and for the stars near the Pole , the mean value of n about 0,7 .
Hence m-n is less than unity , and , consequently , the error of the constant of refraction is greater than the error of N C. Now I think it will be conceded to me , that it requires the exactest instruments and exactest observations to determine the quantity NC certain to half a second .
A greater number of stars can be used for determining C than for N , but then the greater zenith distances will probably occasion C to be more inexact than N. In C , the irregularities of refraction , and in N , the errors of division , have most influence .
In a series of observations in which I am at present engaged , for determining anew the constant of refraction , I use for N the Pole star only , and I lessen the effect of the errors of division , that may be apprehended , by being enabled to observe the Pole star in all parts of its daily course .
I shall not anticipate here the probable result of these observations .
The object of the above , is not to examine whether the constant of refraction has been determined with greater exactness at Dublin or at Konigsberg , but only to endeavour to show that the uncertainty , which exists , cannot be considered in any manner adverse to the received opinion respecting the exactness of modern observations and modern instruments.* Before leaving this subject , I may be permitted to make a few remarks relative to one circumstance , that Mr. BESSEL relies on a good deal , as proving the exactness of his refractions , viz. that they give the obliquity of the ecliptic at the Winter and Summer solstices the same .
Whereas other Tables of refraction give the obliquity in Winter less than in Summer .
We have lately commenced here to observe the zenith distance of the sun every day at noon , on which it can be seen .
I had formerly been unwilling to observe the sun with the circle , except at the solstices , as I considered the heat likely to derange the instrument for my observations relative to parallax .
The Dublin circle , in one respect , is well adapted for observing the sun .
By observing a few minutes before and after noon , four observations give me the zenith distance of the centre , independently of the semi-diameter , or correction for collimation .
'Observations on eighty-seven days have been obtained during the last year .
The manner in which I have used them , is , I believe , somewhat new .
With the declination in the Nautical Almanac , and the meridional zenith distance deduced from the observation , I obtain the .
latitude of the Observatory .
I assume , that the declination in the Nautical Almanac is only erroneous by an error in the longitude ( L ) of the sun , and obliquity of the ecliptic ( O ) .
Then , for each day , I have the lat.== Z D. observed + decli .
+ md L - : n dO +pd k. From the nature of the Solar Tables it may be assumed , and the assumption is exact enough for iny enquiry , that dL only arises from an error in the place of the equinox .
The mean of the latitudes thus found during the year , will be affected by an error s dL +t dO +vd k , in which the coefficients s and t are so small , that the effects of dL and d0 will be insensible .
Thus the eighty-seven observations give my latitude 530 23 ' 12",39 + o , o0 dL + 0,21 dO + X,4 d-k .

, we deduce dk =.o " , 5- .
o,0o dL 0,07 d O. This small value of dk appears to confirm the accuracy of the constant k that I had used .
But if I relied on this I should deceive myself ; for on examining the-series of latitudes deduced , it is , evident that this coincidence arises from the circumstance of more observations having been made while the sun was on the north side of the equator , than while on the south , The latitudes deduced show clearly , that had more observations been made nearer the winter solstice than the summer , the value of dk would have been much more considerable , This contradictory result , and some other circumstances that appear on an.examination of the latitudes deduced , seem to point , out that some new , equation is required to be applied for the solar refraction .
At least , that no conclusion can be drawn as to the exactness of a table of refractions , from its giving the obliquity of the ecliptic the same at the two solstices .
On the Southern Motion .
In Table III .
are given the North Polar distances of forty~ix principal stars , from recent observations with the circle of the Observatory of T. C. Dublin , and also the North Polar distances of the same stars from the Catalogue of 1813 ' reduced to 1823.f The column of differences shows that there are none greater than what may be attributed to accidental circumstances , especially when it is considered that the Catalogue of 1813 was formed from a small number of observations of each star .
The mean difference " 1o " , ; whereas the mean difference of Mr. POND'S Catalogues = 11,1 .
In this then our instruments are at variance .
The discordance appears much more striking if we examine the differences that exist as to certain stars .
It is from these , unless I am much mistaken , I shall be enabled to show the greater exactness of the Dublin instrument .
But it may be useful to add a few remarks respecting the mean difference , to show there are reasons for supposing a constant error , which , being allowed for , would considerably reduce the above mean difference of 1",1 .
By Table I. it appears , the mean difference between the Dublin Catalogue of 1813 , and the Greenwich Standard Catalogue of 18x3 =+ O",47 .
The mean difference between * Trans. R. I. Academy , Vol. z2 , p. 69 .
t To the Catalogue which was published in the Journal of Science , October , 82zz , have been since added several stars , viz. a Persei , Rigel , o Hydrx , 2x Libra , a Herculis , and a Pegasi .
In that Catalogue , the mean difference from that of 813 was exactly o " , o. the Catalogues of 1823 = o " , o. Now , supposing for a moment these differences are errors belonging to the Greenwich instrument ; that is , the Catalogue of 1813 is in defect = o",47 , and the Catalogue of 1823 is o " , lo in excess .
Here then the mean southern motion would be reduced by o",6 , and there would remain only o",5 to be accounted for , half of which might be accounted for by a circumstance to be mentioned presently .
The error I suppose in the Catalogue of 1823 is so small , that the observations by reflection cannot be adduced to controvert it ; this , as I have mentioned , could not even be done had the supposed error been much greater , in consequence of the latitude having been assumed .
The observations by reflection have only shown the consistency of the North Polar distances , not their absolute exactness .

It is highly probable , that this apparent southern motion of the Pole star has arisen from small errors in determining.the place of the Pole star at each period .
It will be remarked in the Catalogue , Table III .
, that the Pole star , as determined with the Dublin instrument at the two epochs , agrees exactly .
Predicted , 1823 , 7 ?
s8 ' 7",3 Observed , 1 38 7 , This is a mean between Mr. POND'S observed and predicted places .
A circumstance above alluded to is of some importance .
In Table IV .
will be found the annual variations as found by Mr. POND , by myself , and by Mr. BESSEL .
Mine are between those of the other two , but nearer to Mr. POND'S than to Mr. BESSEL'S .
The effect of this would be , as to mine , to reduce the mean southern motion of Mr. POND , about a quarter of a second ; but if Mr. BESSEL 's annual variations be adopted , they would , in conjunction with the above supposition relative to the Pole star , entirely take away the mean southern motion of Mr. PoND 's Catalogue .
It will be found , I conceive , difficult , in forming a Catalogue of stars by a mural circle , to avoid a small constant error , and if the Greenwich observations of the Pole star be consulted from the beginning , we shall find enough to induce us to suppose , that such errors may exist in one or both of the Greenwich Catalogues of 1813 and 1823 .
In respect to the annual variations , I shall not venture to give an opinion whether Mr. POND'S or Mr. BESSEL'S be more exact .
I shall only state that mine , which are generally between the two , were formed , as will easily be seen on examination , by a careful comparison of my Catalogue of 1823 , with the Catalogue* deduced by Mr. BESSEL from Dr. BRADLEY'S observations .
The above remafks , relative to the mean difference of Catalogues , have been adduced only because I hope they will be found to contain some useful illustration on this subject .
The proofs I shall now bring of the non-existence of a southern motion , are derived from comparing , in years remote from each other , the places of particular stars , supposed by Mr. POND to have a considerable southern motion , with others supposed to have none , or only a very small southern motion .
Whatever doubt may arise when we reason on such small quantities as the mean difference , none can occur with respect to several particular stars that have been supposed to have a great southern motion .
The conclusion that follows is , that there is no southern motion similar to what Mr. POND has deduced .
There may be certain stars of which the proper motions are not uniform .
In some stars these may have a tendency to diminish , and in others to increase , but nothing of this kind is as yet certainly known .
Perhaps , hereafter , it may be confirmed that the proper motion of Procyon is increasing .
( I ) The stars a Cassiopeae and y Ursee Majoris , are particularly considered by Mr. POND .
According to him , a Cassiopee appears to have a considerable southern motion relatively to y Ursae Majoris .
It is a somewhat singular circumstance , that Dr. BRADLEY observed , with great care , at Wanstead , in 1727 and 17e8 , the difference of declination between these two stars .
It is worth while to quote his own words.* " But as it may be of some use to future astronomers to c know what were the mean differences of declination , at a t ' given time , between some stars that lie nearly opposite to one another in right ascension , and not far from either of the colures , I shall set down the result of the comparison " of a few that ( liffer so little in declination , that I could determine the quantity of that difference with great cer"tainty .

It may not be without its use in this enquiry , to show what the latitude of Greenwich comes out independently on the mural circle , viz. by reducing the zenith sector observations of i802 to 1823 ( applying an uniform variation , viz. that deduced from the variations in 1789 , by allowing the changes in precession ) and then computing from the north polar distances for 182e , determined by the Dublin observations .

( IV .
) Two stars in which Mr. POND finds a great southern motion are y and a Pegasi .
These two stars were observed by General LAMBTON , at his station of Dodagoontah , in the Mysore , at the same time that a Serpentis was also observed.* For a Serpentis , Mr. POND finds none , or a very small , southern motion .
We have hence an opportunity of comparing the relative changes of N. Polar distance of these stars and cs Serpentis .
An examination of the observations in the Asiatic Transactions will show , that for stars so near the zenith , much reliance may be had on the results of the observations.t ( i ) y Pegasi and a Serpentis .

t It may be said , that the observations made at Dodagoontah weretnot exact , judging by the irregularities exhibited by the latitude found by different stars .
But these were owing to the errors of the catalogue of declination which General , LAMSTON posessed .
If the zenith distances be reduced , and applied to either of the Dublin Catalogues of N. Polar Distances , the latitudes by each star wili be -found to agree .

( V. ) Sirius has , according to Mr. POND , a greater southern motion than any other star , amounting to 3",4 for ten years , between 1813 and 1823 , compared with its rate for ten years at 1784 .
This star , in these latitudes , is far from the zenith , on which account , the result of the observations of M. PIAZZI , at Palermo , will be of considerable authority in estimating the value of observations made at Greenwich , and in Dublin .

( VI .
) Several of the stars of M. PIAzzI 's Catalogue have been already referred to in this enquiry .
It is right to remark , also , the general agreement of the Dublin Catalogue of 1813 , and the N. P. D. distances for 1813 , deduced from M. PIAZZI'S Catalogue , taking the annual variations , ( reduced to 1806 ) that were obtained by a comparison of BRADLEY'S Catalogue of 1755 , by BESSEL , with the Dublin Catalogue of 1823 .
These variations are given in Table V , column 5 .
In this Table , in Column i , will be found how much the respective stars of the Dublin Catalogue of 181 3 are north or south of their places so computed ( predicted ) from the Palermo Catalogue .
It is evident here is no southern motion , the mean of all 75 the differences is o " , i north , a remarkable confirmation of the exactness of the annual variations used .
Column 2 , of Table V. , shows how mruch the observed places , 1823 , are north or south of their places , computed from the Catalogue of 1813 .
These results are mentioned before , and are only placed here to be seen at one view with the rest .
It has been supposed , that Mr. POND'S Westbury observations afford a confirmation of the southern motion .
Column s , of Table V. , shows how much the observed places , at Greenwich , 1813 , are north or south of the places predicted from the Westbury Catalogue .
Column 4 contains Mr. POND'S differences between his Catalogue , 1823 , and the places predicted from his Catalogue , 1813 .
A comparison of Columns 3 and 4 will show , that the Westbury Catalogue is , in many instances , so irregularly at variance with the Greenwich Catalogues of r813s and 1823 , that no ' conclusion whatever can be deduced from it .
In the Conn. des Tems .
1809 , p. 458 , are given declinations of four stars observed by MECHAIN , with the repeating circle of BORDA , which , at first sight , may appear to support the southern motion .
The first of these stars is Capella , N.P.D. 1800 , 44 ? ?
13 81 , o0 .
The zenith distance of this star , observed at Greenwich by General MUDGE with the zenith sector , and reduced to 1800 , is 5 41 ' 51 " , o + 9',2 .
Hence the co-lat .
of Greenwich 380 311 17",8 .
Therefore , either the zenith sector , or BORDA'S circle , must have been in error ; and had we not proof of the exactness of the sector , we could scarcely hesitate between the two instruments .
76 Two of the four stars above mentioned are 3 Tauri and Pollux .
MECHAIN'S declination gives the predicted N. P. D. of A Tauri , conformable to Mr. POND'S southern motion , who makes it only ',7 , a quantity evidently too small to found an argument on ; besides , MECHAIN'S places of this star , deduced at Paris and Montjoy , differ by 1",8 .
Pollux also gives a southern motion , but Mr. POND , finds the southern motion of this star only o'",2 .
Also MECHAIN'S results as to Pollux are very discordant .
MECHAIN 's declination of Sirius also seems to support the southern motion , but in this it is opposed by that of PIAZZI .
I shall conclude by mentioning a result recently obtained , that shows , in a remarkable manner , that the Dublin circle has been consistent with itself from the beginning , and has suffered no derangement .
From 1809 to 1823 , inclusive , thirteen summer solstices have been observed with the circle , for which , observations on eighty seven days have been made .
I have investigated from these , the maximum of lunar nutation , and found it = 9",6o , which happens to be exactly what I have hitherto used for the Sun .
I am induced , however , to give more weight to my result from the stars , viz. 9g " , e6* .
The difference is less than could have been expected from solar observations .
It puts beyond all doubt the permanent state of the instrument .
Had any circumstances taken place similar to those , of whatever nature they may be , by which the Greenwich instrument has shown so great a southern motion in certain stars , they must have given a very erroneous quantity of lunar nutation , POSTSCRIPT .
Since the above was written , the kindness of a friend has communicated to me , by letter , Mr. POND'S Paper , read in June last , and which has appeared in the Second Part of the Transactions recently published : the volume itself has not reached me , and therefore I have not seen the Tables .
I find Mr. POND has referred to the Palermo Catalogue , as contained in the Philosophical Transactions , 1806 .
That Catalogue has been long rejected by the author .
The improved places of the principal stars , as given in the great Catalogue , are those to which I have referred .
This explanation appears necessary .
The exact Catalogue was first published , probably about 1807 , as the Conn. des Tems .
1809 , p. 458 , which was published in 1807 , contains the principal stars agreeing with the great Catalogue very nearly .
The observations were therefore made prior to 1807 .
Indeed it is probable both Catalogues were founded on nearly the same observations .
I beg leave to refer here to Mr. BESSELIS ' Astron. Fundam .
p. 297 and 298 , " for some remarks relative to the improved Catalogue of M. PIAzzI .
Mr. POND states , that unless the southern motion be admitted , the Greenwich observations of 1813 will appear very erroneous , and those of Dublin still more so .
As I am unacquainted with the arguments by which he supports this opinion , I cannot reply to them .
But I think quite the contrary , as far as regards my observations , will appear from the preceding pages .
The southern motion will change every 78 thing in my results , as well as in those of other astronomers ; whereas , without it , every thing is consistent ; and I cannot but feel considerable satisfaction in the conviction , that , sidereal astronomy is a more certain science than it is represented to be in the last communication of Mr. POND to the Royal Society .
