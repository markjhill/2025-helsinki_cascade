" Report to the Committee on Solar Physics on the Basic Lines common to Spots and Prominences .
" By J. NORMAN Lockyer , F.R.S. Communicated at the request of the Committee .
Received June 19 , 1879 .
I have now for some time past been making efforts .to bring together 1 the various observations which have been recorded of the lines visible i in solar disturbances at the sun 's limb , and those observed to be V widened , brightened or otherwise modified in the spectra of solar [ I spots .
The result which stares us in the face when we examine the lists of fe the lines given by Young as representing his Sherman work is so I striking , both with regard to the conclusions which we are justified in f drawing from the old work , and the suggestions for future operate tions , that I have thought it desirable to call attention to it without n waiting until the Italian Observations have been discussed .
Although Young 's observations of the chromospheric lines extend 0 over the whole visible spectrum , the list of lines in the solar spots is 1 limited to the region between B and b , I have therefore limited the I discussion to this region .
As a basis for the discussion , I have used the lines given in Thalen 's I admirable tables , comparing these lists with the lines shown in i Angstrom 's and Thalen 's map , and indicating the intensities of the I lines which are given in the tables , and which particular line occurs I in the map only .
Further , as a discussion of the coincident lines shown in some sheets I of Angstrom 's map , which I communicated to the Royal Society last n March , had convinced me that the lines shown to be common to two or a more substances by Thalen were not due to impurities ( " Proceedings 1 of the Royal Society , " No. 194 , 18^0 ) , I have shown these co-1 incidences , where they occur , in a special column .
Having then Thalen 's list for a basis , other columns showing us 1 whether each line is seen in spots and prominences , and how it is \#166 ; affected , give us in one view , for each metallic substance , exactly what I happens to the lines of that substance .
We see at once , for instance , a which lines are not touched , those again which are visibly affected 1 both in spots and storms , or those recorded in one table and not in the \#166 ; other .
Taking all the lines included in the discussion , the following |j statistics will show how they are distributed:\#151 ; Total number of lines in Thalen 's list and map included in the discussion ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 345 248 Mr. J. N. Lockyer .

108 Number of lines bright in storms ... ... ... . .
122 Number of lines common to spots and storms ... 68 Number of lines seen in neither spots nor storms ... 183 So much for the list of lines as a whole : the following list shows the number of lines assigned to each metal , the number of lines which occur in both spots and storms , or only in one or the other , and the number of lines unaffected .

104 33 50 62 25 345 68 108 122 183 It will be seen that the ratio between the affected and unaffected lines is very variable .
What strikes one indeed in regard to all these substances is the wonderful irregularity in the behaviour of the various lines ; there is no relation for instance between the widening of the lines in the spots and their appearances in the prominences .
As I have before shown , there is no relationship between the intensities of the lines and their appearances in the spots and storms .
Amongst the substances shown in the table I have included strontium , in order that the difference in its behaviour in comparison with calcium and barium may be seen .
But all these , however , are matters for subsequent discussion ; what does come out in the strongest way is the following very remarkable fact .
Among the 345 lines given by Thalen are 18 with identical readings in two spectra .
I have before given reasons to show that these are not due to mutual impurities , they therefore are the exact equivalents of those lines which I have termed basic in my communication of last December to the Royal Society .

] Basic Bines common to Spots and Prominences .
If they be basic , then we should expect a considerable development of these lines in the spectrum of the sun 's reversing layer , which spots and storms enable us to study apart from the absorption going on at higher levels .
These tables enable us to settle this question , and they settle it in the most conclusive way .
The only constant thing about the tables is , that these basic lines are always widened in the spots .
However badly the brighter lines of a chemical substance may be represented amongst the 'spot lines , the basic line , which is often of the second or third order of intensity and sometimes even of the fourth , is never absent .
The same fact holds almost equally true with regard to the storms .
The following table gives a comparison of these coincident lines of Thalen 's with Young 's tables .

Mr. J. N. Lockyer .
On [ June 19 This result of the inquiry not only adds a new importance to the observations of spot and storm phenomena , but it suggests the precise work which should be done , both in the observatory and laboratory .
Not only must special prominence be given to the brightening and thickening of these basic lines in spots and storms , but the existence or non-existence of them in other substances besides those indicated by Thalen , should be inquired into .
This latter branch of work has indeed already been begun , since I have pointed out ( in the " Proceedings , " No. 194 , 1879 ) , in a table showing basic lines , that some lines in the blue and green seen many times by Young in storms , are common to many substances , the spectra of which were observed with a Rutherford 's grating ( secondorder , 17,000 lines ) .
In this work it will be well to include those lines which only differ by a tenth of Thalen 's unit , although they have been rigorously rejected in the present discussion and tables .
Young , indeed , included such lines , among his coincidences , the line at 5269'5 being a case in point which is widened in spots , and has been seen 50 times in storms , ' Attention must also be directed to those lines which , like those shown in the following table , although seen both in spots and storms , ; have not yet been detected in the spectrum of any chemical substance .
