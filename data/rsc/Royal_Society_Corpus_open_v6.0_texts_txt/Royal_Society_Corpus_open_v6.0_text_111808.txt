" Researches on the Partition of Numbers .
" By AR1THUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received April 14 , 1855 .
The author discusses the following problem:-- " To find in how many ways a number q can be made up of the elements a , b , c. .
, each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times .
" The solution depends upon a peculiar decomposition of any algebraical fraction Ox , where the denominatorfx is the product of any number fx of factors , the same or different of the form 1 -x " , and upon the expansion by means thereof of the fraction in ascending powers of x. The coefficient of the general term is expressed in terms of circulating functions , such that the sums of certain groups of the coefficients are severally equal to zero ; these functions the author calls prime circulators .
The investigations show the general form of the analytical expression for the number of partitions , and they also indicate how the values of the coefficients of the prime circulators entering into such expression are to be determined .
