" Observations on the Temperature of the Arctic Sea in the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen .
" By John C. Wells , Capt. R.N. Communicated by Dr. Carpenter , F.R.S. Received November 28 , 1872 .
While almost every other nation is making its effort to promote scientific discoveries in the high latitudes of the north , England remains inactive .
My object in addressing the following remarks to the Royal Society is to bring to its notice the voyages of the ' Samson ' yacht , and to direct attention to some points on the temperature of the Arctic Sea , to which access is obtained through the broadest gateway to the north , i. e. that between Greenland and Norway , the portal of which is guarded by Spitzbergen .
In the western portion , along the coast of Greenland , it is more or less blocked with ice , and the water is cold .
In the eastern part , in the vicinity of Spitzbergen , there is warm water and an open sea at certain seasons of the year as far north as 81 ' , and in some years one or two degrees further .
Nearly all the discoveries in these regions have been made by persons engaged in commercial enterprise ; so that , even when favourable opportunities offered , their interests restrained them from taking advantage of the same .
In 1871 Mr. B. Leigh Smith made a cruise in his schooner yacht ' Samson/ and reached 81 ' 24 ' N. , with an open sea before him , comparatively free from ice .
The pack-ice was drifting southwards , and the water at the surface was 33 ' E. , while at 300 fathoms it was 42 ' F. This fact was observed by Capt. Scoresby in lat. 78 ' N. , 0'*10 W. , surface 32 ' F. , and at a depth of 760 fathoms 38 ' F. In 1872 a second cruise was undertaken , in which I had the pleasure of accompanying Mr. Smith .
On this occasion the sea was crowded with ice , and the ship was beset .
The ice had evidently required more than one year for its formation ; its surface was covered with opaque snow , and was generally flat , and in no case rose higher than the gangway of the little schooner .
Owing to the floes presenting a comparatively smooth surface , with a total absence of icebergs , we were led to form the opinion that no land can exist in the vicinity immediately north of Spitzbergen , as the southerly drift would be sure to bring down floating bergs , which are always formed in the valleys of northern land .
On this occasion observation with the Miller-Casella thermometer confirmed the result of the previous year , viz. gradual increase of temperature at great depth .
On July 12th , when in 80 ' 17 N. , and when the vessel was fixed in the ice , the temperature gradually increased to 64 ' F. at a depth of 600 fathoms .
These facts indicate the southward flow of a vast body of warm water .
It cannot be said that the heat is derived from the Gulf-stream , because nowhere in its course , even in such latiCapt .
J. C. Wells the [ Dec. 19 , tudes as 50 ' or 60 ' , does it acquire so high a temperature , even at the surface ; and it is highly improbable that the general warmth of the ocean along the west coasts of North Europe , on the shores of Norway , could possibly be supplied by the limited body of warm water which leaves the Gulf of Florida .
If the whole of the Gulf-stream water were spread over the warm-water area in the north , its depth , even allowing the most liberal estimate for its volume , would not exceed 10 fathoms ; whereas warm water of 42 ' F. occurs to the depth of 400 fathoms in this region , and north of Spitzbergen it is found as high as 64 ' F. at 600 fathoms .
If it be said that this temperature is due to the northward drifting of the Atlantic from warmer localities , we are met by two difficulties , of which one is , that the soundings obtained by Carpenter and others gave temperatures much below 64 ' , and the other is , that the waters flow south , not north .
Volcanic action , or a warm mineral spring rising from the ocean-bottom , may by some be imagined to be the cause of the temperature of 64 ' ; but there is no evidence of either of these agencies , and it is quite reasonable to suppose any other feasible cause .
Passing over the discovery of 64 ' F. at this depth , we still have to account for the water of 42 ' F. flowing southwards , as evidenced by the increase of its temperature as we proceeded northwards .
It is clear that this question of temperature requires further investigation ; and it is also clear that whatever the result may be , it will materially affect all the prevailing theories respecting oceanic currents .
It is not improbable that this warm water flows from the circumpolar region ; and if so , it would indicate a circumpolar sea .
Many facts are known which are consistent with this view .
Every year the edge of the pack-ice , and the ice-fields themselves , break up and drift south , at a rate sometimes equal to thirteen miles a day , as found by Capt. Parry .
This does not occur when the northern ocean is wholly covered with ice , in the winter season .
The drifting of the ice ( as also currents ) implies a sea free of ice somewhere in the north , occupying an area at least as extensive as the drift-ice .
As has been seen , some of the ice is the result of more than one year 's growth ; and as the ice travels southerly , say , from four to thirteen miles or more per diem , a similar area of open sea must be simultaneously forming round the pole , the ice-holes and clear spaces in the drift-ice being quite insufficient to make up for the space left by the ice during the summer .
The great abundance of animal life in the waters of the highest latitudes reached indicates that the water is not ice-cold ; and the migration of numerous species to the north of 80 ' shows that the means of subsistence can be obtained .
There is reason to believe that whales occur far to the north of 80 ' ; and if so , there must necessarily be sufficient open water to allow of their finding ready access to air .
In the Spitzbergen seas a blue , cloud-like appearance is well known as a sign of open water ; and this has been seen on the distant north horizon 1872 .

93 even by ships which have been beset by ice in the highest latitudes .
Icebergs , it is well known , waste more rapidly below the surface than in the air , causing them to topple over frequently , obviously the effect of the warm current .
The question , then , is , from whence do the warm waters come ?
and how do they acquire their heat ?
And this is one of the questions which a polar voyage by way of Spitzbergen would almost certainly elucidate .
Another important subject of investigation would be the conditions under which the prevalent north winds of high latitudes originate .
There is one argument bearing upon the temperature of the circumpolar seas which should not be overlooked .
During six months of the year the sun is above the horizon ; and although the rays may be oblique , still the waters may acquire a higher temperature than under similar conditions further south , owing to there being little or no cooling from nocturnal radiation , and probably to the constant dryness of the air allowing the sun to strike with full power .
During the winter these causes would intensify the cold .
The occurrence of warm water is by no means confined to the sea around Spitzbergen ; but , before referring to other regions , we may mention that a set of instruments for taking soundings and deep-sea temperatures was supplied this year by Mr. Smith to Capt. David Grey , of the whaler ' Eclipse , ' whose father , in the year 1855 , supplied the valuable information and survey of the extension of Pond 's Bay , now called Eclipse Sound .
His observations were made in the middle of the sea , between Greenland and Norway , and along a line running north-easterly from Iceland .
They coincide with Dr. Carpenter 's observations , proving the termination of the Gulf-stream .
In June 1854 Morton advanced beyond Kennedy Channel , and saw open water as far as the horizon , visible from a hill 500 feet high .
The wind was from the north-west , and a rain-cloud was seen in the distance above the open sea .
The water was setting in a strong current south , and the ice along the shores was in a rapid state of dissolution .
The water was found in the several places tried to be well above the freezing-point ; and in one place , some distance from the ice-foot , and at a depth of 5 feet , the temperature was 40 ' E. There was a strong tide from the north .
Kane 's vessel -wintered in Itenselaer Harbour ; the strait was bridged across by ice , with a current running south flowing beneath it .
Although the open waters above alluded to may not be direct evidence of a comparatively mild circumpolar region , yet the stream of warm water coming from the north seems to indicate it .
Where can this water acquire its warmth ?
Sir John Richardson suggests that it is derived from the warm area near Spitzbergen ; but this is not supported by evidence , which indicates that in both areas the water comes from the north .
It has been suggested that it is a continuation of the Gulf-stream , apparently because it is supposed to supply all the warm water in the Arctic seas ; but if there is no reason for believing that the warm sea around Spitzbergen derives its heat from this source , it is still Capt. J. C. Wells on the [ Dec. 19 , less credible in the case of the Kennedy-Strait water .
It has been suggested that the source of warmth is the northward flow of the general mass of the North Atlantic .
If this did account for the warmth of the Spitz-bergen area , although this view would be with difficulty reconciled with a southward flow of Arctic water , it would be quite inapplicable to the Kennedy-Channel area .

] Temperature of the Arctic Sea .
Among the many advantages that would result from circumpolar research and the following up of this warm current , not the least important would be the insight which it would probably afford as to the regulating influences of the weather of North Europe , or generally of the northern hemisphere .
Meteorologists have long suspected that the weather in Western Europe depends in some way upon what has happened in the vicinity of the pole .
The many advantages to be gained to science by circumpolar navigation cannot be doubted .
Among them would be careful observations of the currents and temperatures of the surface and at various depths , and organisms which doubtless would be obtained by dredging , as far as practicable , in the bed of the Arctic Sea , in the highest latitude , and the probable extension of the whale-fisheries , as well as the discovery of new land , should such exist .
June 1.\#151 ; The edge of the ice was 170 miles distant , and the warm water was found at the surface , and cold water , which is of greater density , below .
June 13.\#151 ; The sounding was taken at the edge of the pack .
If the experiments had been continued , increasing temperature would probably have been found at a lower depth , as was the case further north .
June 15.\#151 ; To-day we were well in the ice , and had only time to sound in 50 fathoms ; but even here we found an increasing temperature .
June 17.\#151 ; Being far in the ice , we only found a slight increase .
June 18.\#151 ; A second sounding , 50 fathoms deeper than yesterday , when sailing among large pieces of floe-ice , gave an increasing temperature up to 48 ' E. June 19.\#151 ; To-day we had an increase of 7 ' above the surface-temperature at 250 fathoms deep , although but 10 miles distant from yesterday 's soundings ; but the ice was more open : probably evaporation occurred here , owing to the surface not being so closely covered with ice .
June 20.\#151 ; The first sounding shows the water to be coldest at the icefoot ; the second and third prove the increasing temperature , which , as we were somewhat more closely packed in the ice , increased more quickly , and 39 ' E. is obtained at 150 fathoms deep .
June 22.\#151 ; Here we were more closely packed .
The surface was a degree colder than yesterday , and the water at the ice-foot had also gone down half a degree ; but the warm stream below was the same .
If we had had time to sound at greater depths , the temperature of the water would in all probability have been found still on the increase .
June 27.\#151 ; In this case we have the warm current clearly defined at 250 fathoms depth , being kept below by the lighter ice-water , which is nearly fresh and of less specific gravity .
July 1.\#151 ; \\ e were clear of the ice , and had a lower temperature than before obtained .
If the flow of warm water came from the south , the surface-temperature would have been greater than any temperature as yet obtained , because of the absence of ice .

H 96 Capt. J. C. Wells on the [ Dec. 19 , july 6.\#151 ; This observation shows a gradual increase as far down as 200 fathoms .
We were well in the ice , and were prevented from continuing our sounding-operations .
Little evaporation has taken place , owing^to the closeness of the ice and the gradual increase of the temperature , with one exception , which occurred on the 18th of June , when a temperature of 48 ' was obtained , \#151 ; showing that the temperatures are materially affected by local causes , the closeness of the pack or the opening of the ice allowing evaporation to take place .
july 7 , __Here , where the ice is close , there is a great difference be- tween the surface temperature and that at the ice-foot .
We pulled up a very beautiful description of starfish , which would not be likely to inhabit this warm current were it of volcanic origin .
July 10.\#151 ; The crew being required elsewhere , we could not continue our sounding-experiments .
The sounding shows a decrease of temperature , owing to the ice-water .
July 12.\#151 ; This remarkable sounding was carefully registered specially by Mr. Smith , who saw the index before it was immersed and immediately on its coming up .
This shows a gradual increase of temperature towards the north , proving the current to come from the north ; and its temperature being above that of the Grulf-stream , where it disperses itself , is a proof it is in no way connected with it .
The thermometer has since been examined by Mr. L. P. Casella , who certifies that it " has been tested in the hydraulic press , as well as carefully compared with my standard , and found correct in every way , no change whatever having taken place in the instrument .
