) , Synopsis .
As the history of bacteriology has shown that conditions regarded as clinical entities may be caused by a number of different organisms , it seemed of importance to determine whether the Bacillus tetani is an individual micro-organism , or whether there are several organisms differing from one another , but all capable of elaborating a spasm-producing toxin .
This enquiry involves the demarcation of the tetanus bacilli from similar organisms and their differentiation inter se , by serological methods .
By employing the agglutination reaction it can be shown that there are at least three serological types of B. tetani .
One of these , which may be designated Type I , has hitherto been almost exclusively used for the preparation of antitoxin , and , so far as is known , such antitoxin protects against the toxin of all three types .
The results obtained in the present investigation suggest that this is only partially true , as the types of B. tetani isolated from cases of the disease do not correspond serologically with the type in common use for the preparation of antitoxin .
This question is still under consideration , as the number of cultures so far examined is too limited to permit of far-reaching conclusions being drawn from the work done .
In attempting to isolate numbers of strains of B. tetani it is found that there are frequently present in the wounds of men suffering from tetanus , bacilli which have morphological characters so like those of B. tetani that they might readily be mistaken foi that organism .
Serological investigation of these ( non-toxic ) micro-organisms , which might be referred to as tetanoid bacilli , shows that they too constitute a group , the members of which can be differentiated one from another by serological methods .
I. Introduction .
In view of the fact that bacteriological investigation has shown that conditions which had been regarded as clinical entities were really caused by Dr. W. J. Tulloch .
Isolation and infection with a number of different organisms , admittedly often closely allied to one another , but susceptible of classification by serological methods , it seemed of importance to determine whether , in the case of tetanus , we are dealing with an infection due to one and the same organism in all cases of the disease , or to a number of different though closely related bacteria .
The differentiation of the dysentery bacilli , of the enteric group of organisms , of the pneumococci , and of the meningococci , indicated that examination should be made of the causal organism of tetanus by all bacteriological , and especially by serological methods .
II .
Cultivation of B. tetani .
The main obstacle to be overcome in studying tetani is the difficulty experienced in isolating the organism .
Owing to its living in symbiosis with other bacteria that grow more vigorously in artificial media than does B. tetani , special methods have had to be elaborated for the ( partial ) isolation of that organism .
The rationale of the technique which I use depends upon the fact that if material from wounds infected with the anaerobes be inoculated into a medium consisting of chopped meat and water , sterilised in the autoclave , the proteolytic organisms\#151 ; notably B. spor\#151 ; first appear in the culture and are replaced later by organisms which resemble the tetanus bacillus , both morphologically and , to some extent , culturally .
Many of these organisms are non-pathogenic , and fromithe standpoint of cultural requirements A. tetani is included with them .
After several attempts with a variety of procedures , I have so far found the following method most satisfactory for my purpose :\#151 ; Take 1 lb. of chopped meat and add 1 litre of tap-water , then boil for 30 minutes .
Cool to 45 ' C. , make slightly alkaline , and add trypsin as for the preparation of Douglas ' broth , then incubate in an open vessel at 37 ' C. for five days , and allow to undergo natural putrefaction .
The putrescent material so obtained is filtered through paper , made neutral to phenolphthalein , and sodium formate is added to the extent of 1 per cent , of the total .
The material is then sterilised and cleared by being passed through a Berkfeld and a Doulton filter in series .
The medium is stored in sterile flasks under paraffin , and is syphoned off as required .
It keeps well , but should not be sterilised by heat .
Before use the sterility of the medium is tested by inoculating quantities of from 5 to 01 c.c. into tubes of meat-water medium , which are incubated anaerobically for seven days .
This medium , while it has desirable selective properties , is not sufficiently nutrient , and must be enriched before use by Serological Differentiation of Bacillus tetani .
147 the addition of fresh rabbit tissue .
Prepared in this way , the medium inhibits the growth of B. sporogenes , and allows of the growth of B. , atoxic tetanoid bacilli , and oval-endsporing organisms .
The value of this medium , in its application to the study of B. tetani , will be considered later .
III .
Application of Serological Methods to the Study of Toxic Cultures .
Using this putrid medium and Barber 's micro-inoculation method , I succeeded , with the assistance of Miss Robertson , of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine , in isolating from wounds a small number of strains of B. tetani in a fair state of purity .
Particular attention is called to the question of purity of cultures of the anaerobes .
I advisedly describe the growths which are under consideration as being only relatively pure , since extreme difficulty is experienced in completely purifying these cultures .
This difficulty is due probably to the symbiotic relationship which the anaerobes bear to one another .
I would here record my deep debt of gratitude to Miss Robertson for her kindness in purifying these growths for me , as they formed the basis for serological methods being applied to the examination of the question under consideration .
Having obtained from wounds a number of fairly pure growths known to be toxic , I immunised a rabbit against one of the laboratory strains of B. tetani , with a view to the production of an agglutinating serum .
The strain of B. tetani chosen was an isolation made by Miss Robertson from the U.S.A. standard culture .
This culture will hereafter be designated " A. " The process of immunising the animals was as follows:\#151 ; A culture of the organism to be inoculated was grown in peptone broth neutral to a-naphtholphthalein under anaerobic conditions at 37 ' C. for a period of four days .
The cultures were then heated to 60 ' C. for 30 minutes , and thereafter centrifugalised at high speed to deposit the organisms .
The supernatant fluid was pipetted off , saline added , and the suspension so obtained was again centrifugalised .
The deposit resulting from this second centrifugalisation was shaken in a small quantity of saline , and the resulting suspension was standardised .
Sufficient saline , containing 0*5 per cent , phenol , was then added to reduce the bacillary content of the suspension to 2000 million per cubic centimetre .
In immunising the animals , 0'7o c.c. of this suspension is inoculated intravenously , and , after an interval of five days , 1*5 c.c. is injected by the same route ; after a further lapse of two days , the agglutinating titre of the serum is tested , and , if suitable , the animal is killed .
ISTo difficulty was experienced in obtaining a serum of moderate titre\#151 ; 1 / 800 in two hours at Dr. W. J. Tulloch .
The Isolation and 55 ' C. was aimed at\#151 ; and , using this serum to agglutinate laboratory strains and strains isolated from wounds , the following results were obtained:\#151 ; Diagram I.\#151 ; Agglutination of Toxic Cultures with Serum of Animal Immunised with Culture A.

It will be seen that only one of the toxic cultures\#151 ; 1\#151 ; derived from a wound agglutinates with this serum , while , on the contrary , all the laboratory strains give a positive reaction .
Culture 2 was therefore used for immunising a second animal , which was bled out on attaining a titre of 1/ 800 when tested in presence of its homologous organism .
Using this serum , the results tabulated in Diagram II were obtained .
It is therefore found that three of the organisms which failed to react in presence of the agglutinating serum from the U.S.A. cultures are flocculated by this serum .
Culture 6 was used for immunising a third animal , and with this serum the remaining bacilli 6 and 3 gave a positive reaction .

The Isolation and It appears , then , that there are at least three serological types of organisms capable of producing a tetanising poison , but it might be justifiably argued that the agglutination of Cultures 2 , 4 , and 5 , and of 3 and 6 , was due to the presence of a common contaminating organism in each instance .
To exclude such possible error , the following strains of organisms which were known to be non-toxic , and which superficially resembled B. both culturally and in morphological characters , were exposed to three " type sera , " corresponding to the three serological varieties that the foregoing experiments demonstrate , and also to sera which agglutinated B. B. pseudo-tetani , and an organism superficially resembling B. tetani , but known to be non-toxic .
This non-toxic organism and others similar to it are frequently present in wounds infected with B. tetani .
I shall refer to it as " tetanoid bacillus No. I , " as there appears to be a group of such organisms which can be differentiated from B. pseudo-tetani , B. IX , and from one another by serological methods .
Diagram IV indicates the results obtained on exposing these non-toxic bacilli to the action of tetanus and other agglutinating sera .
It is seen from this result and from Diagram I that Culture E is a mixed growth of two organisms : ( 1 ) Corresponding to Tetani U.S.A. ( Type I ) .
( 2 ) " " Tetanoid No. 1 .
In the succeeding sections of the present communication those ( toxic ) bacilli which give a positive agglutination in presence of the serum of an animal immunised against Culture A ( U.S.A. bacillus ) will be referred to as tetanus bacilli of No. I serological type , those which react in the same way as Culture 2 as of the No. II serological type , and those which behave as does Culture 6 as No. Ill serological type .
IV .
Examination of Organisms resembling B. tetani obtained by Direct Cidti-vation of Wound Exudates in the Putrescent Medium .
In order further to test the validity of the deductions made from the result obtained on examining the non-toxic organisms , and to determine , if possible , the frequency with which the various types of B. tetani are found in wound exudates , I carried out the following experiment .
Cultures from wound exudates in cases of tetanus , or from old meat cultures , were made , ( 1 ) directly into the selective medium , and ( 2 ) the same inocula were grown in broth under anaerobic conditions for eight days .
The growths in the selective medium were filtered through a loose plug of cotton-wool to remove detritus , centrifuged , and the deposit suspended in ' .

153 saline .
The deposit was examined microscopically to determine the presence of endsporing bacilli in overwhelming numbers .
The saline suspension was standardised by the opacity method and exposed to the action of agglutinating sera specific to the three toxic types , and also to sera specific to B. sporogenes , B. pseudo-tetand Tetanoid No. 1 bacillus .
The eight-day broth culture was inoculated into animals in a dose of 0'5 c.c. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining guinea-pigs for this purpose I was compelled to employ rats .
The animals were inoculated subcutaneously at the root of the tail .
Diagram Y ( p. 154 ) illustrates the results obtained .
The points calling for comment in these results are:\#151 ; ( a ) The agglutination and toxicity tests agree in all but two cultures\#151 ; 84 and 89 .
Whether these two cultures represent a fourth type of the bacillus or not I cannot at present state definitely , but from the late development of symptoms of tetanus in the animals inoculated with the broth cultures corresponding to these , it appears to me to be probable that the inocula contained but few B. tetani and the agglutination was masked by the overplus of other organisms present in the suspension .
( b ) Up to the present the type of B. tetani most frequently obtained from wound exudates in cases of tetanus among men who have received prophylactic inoculation , corresponds to the culture designated Type II .
The number of cultures examined is at present too small to permit of any far-reaching conclusion being drawn from the results obtained .
The following agglutination results with four toxic cultures are of peculiar interest , in that these organisms were derived from wounds in men not suffering from tetanus .

It is interesting to note that the non-toxic culture Tetanoid Ho. 1 was isolated from the whole culture E 27 , which as is seen from the above diagram is a toxic tetanus bacillus of the IJ .
S.A. type ( Type I ) .
The culture E 27 was obtained from a man 49 days after the infliction of his wound .
He had received one dose of tetanus antitoxin on the day of wounding .
Cultures E 62 and E 68 , which are also of the U.S.A. type ( Type I ) , were both obtained on the 56th day after the infliction of the wound .
In the case of one of these , the man is not clear whether he had or had not received a dose of antitoxin at ' the time of wounding .
Culture 146 was obtained on the 8th day after wounding .
A dose of antitoxin had been administered in this case .
Ee-examination of the wound made 30 days after the infliction of the wound showed that no anaerobic organisms of any kind whatsoever were present in the exudate .
It is significant that three of these four toxic cultures , obtained from men not showing evidence of tetanus intoxication , are of the U.S.A. type , particularly in view of the fact that of the cultures obtained up to the present from cases showing symptoms of tetanus occurring for the most part in inoculated men , only one culture of the U.S.A. serological type has been obtained .
In my opinion this may mean that the prophylactic inoculation of the antitoxin at present in use protects strongly against intoxication from the U.S.A. type of bacillus , while its protection against the other types is apparently short lived .

The Isolation and V. Absorption of Agglutinin Tests .
In order to be satisfied that the agglutination results , tabulated in Diagrams I , II , and III , indicated definite antigenic differences between the three types of bacilli , I carried out a number of absorption of agglutinin tests .
Two representatives of each serological type of the bacillus were chosen for this test:\#151 ; Representatives of Type I:\#151 ; ( i ) A , an isolation from the U.S.A. culture .
( ii ) C , the standard U.S.A. culture .
Representatives of Type II:\#151 ; ( i ) 2 , isolated from a wound .
( ii ) 5 , " " " ( this culture was selected because it had failed to agglutinate to the full titre in presence of Type II serum ) .
Representatives of Type III:\#151 ; ( i ) 3 , isolated from a wound .
( ii ) 6 , Each serum was absorbed by contact with suspensions of each of thSse cultures thus:\#151 ; Three horizontal rows consisting of six centrifuge tubes were set up .
Into each tube of the first row was pipetted 0'05 c.c. of Type I serum ; into those of the second row 0'05 c.c. of Type II serum , and of the third , Type III serum .
There was then added to each tube in the vertical columns ( consisting of three tubes each ) 2-5 c.c. of a 2,000,000,000 suspension of bacilli , ( a ) to those of column 1 , Culture A. 0 ) V J ) 2 , " C. ( c ) \gt ; \gt ; r\gt ; 3 , " 2 .

The tubes were incubated at 37 ' C. for 24 hours , centrifuged , and the clear supernatant fluid from each was then distributed into agglutination tubes in such dilution that with the addition of bacillary suspension the concentration of the sera in each series would be 1/ 100 , 1/ 200 , 1/ 400 .
Tjie absorbed serum in each case was used for agglutinating suspensions both of the homologous bacillus and the test bacillus .
Serological Differentiation Bacillus tetani .
157 The serum was considered to be absorbed if its titre was reduced to not more than 1/ 100 , from 1/ 400 .
The results were controlled by reactions with unabsorbed serum in the same series of dilutions 1/ 100 , 1/ 200 , 1/ 400 .
As the following Table shows , the absorption of agglutinin test confirms the previous observations and shows that considered as antigenics , the three types are distinct from one another .

Are the Toxins Produced by each Type in any way showing Differences Corresponding to those made Manifest by the Agglutination Reaction in the Case of the Bacilli ?
This question has not yet been gone into , but will form the subject of further research , for the determination of such a specificity of toxin is of paramount import in view of the influence it would have upon the prophylaxis and therapeutics of the disease .

The Formation of Nitrites from Conclusions .
The following conclusions may , I think , be justifiably drawn from these observations .
( 1 ) More than one variety of ( non-toxic ) endsporing bacillus , resembling B. tetani in morphological characters , can be recovered from wound exudates in cases of the disease .
( 2 ) There are at least three different types of ( toxic ) B. tetani .
( 3 ) The " U.S.A. type " of the bacillus\#151 ; that commonly used for the preparation of antitoxin\#151 ; is not frequently obtained from wound exudates in cases of the disease occurring among men who have received prophylactic inoculations of antitetanic serum .
( 4 ) Culture in a selective medium , followed by agglutination of the washed growth in presence of the three type sera , gives valuable information .
It is , however , apparently not so delicate a test for the presence of B. tetani as is animal inoculation after culture of the wound exudate .

) The number of chemical changes brought about by the activity of light is multitudinous , and the study of these reactions has been very intensive in recent years .
In the majority of the photo-chemical reactions , the effect produced is that of hastening an exothermic reaction , and in this resembles the action of a catalyst .
The substances formed have a less content of chemical energy than the mother substances , and are usually of a more simple structural type .
In such cases there is no clear proof of transformation , or .conversion , of light-energy into chemical energy , and the light acts more as a detonator to a chemical reaction in which chemical energy is set free .
