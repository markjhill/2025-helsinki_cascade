The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. tl Thermo-Electric Behaviour of Aqueous Solutions with Mercurial Electrodes .
" By G. Gore , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received November 24 , 1879 .
In order to investigate this subject , I devised and constructed the following apparatus :\#151 ; A and B are two thin glass basins , 81 millims. internal diameter ( =5,153 sq .
millims. of mercury surface ) , and 6'0 centims. deep ; each containing a layer of mercury about 1*0 centim. deep , covered by a layer , about 3 centims. deep , of the aqueous solution to be examined .
C is a thin bent glass tube , about 3 centims. diameter , filled with the liquid , and closed by means of a bung at D.# E and E are stout glass tubes , about 2 millims. bore , E having a platinum wire sealed into it at its lower end , and E being filled with mercury ; the ends of these tubes are usually placed in the mercury previous to adding the liquid ; and F is fixed so that the solution cannot enter it .
G and H are terminal wires of platinum , touching the mercury , but not the liquid .
I and J are thermometers , with their bulbs immersed in the pools of mercury .
Each cup is closed by a bung ( not shown in the sketch ) , to prevent loss of liquid by evaporation , also to support the thermometer and keep the tubes steady .
The dish B is supported on wire gauze , placed upon an iron tripod with a Bunsen 's burner beneath , and A is placed on a shelf level with * It is not necessary to have the vertical limbs of this tube of as great a length as they are shown in the sketch .

This kind of apparatus was used in all the experiments , and acted very satisfactorily .
I devised one of different construction for a similar purpose many years ago .

) Liquid Thermo-Pair with Mercury Electrodes .
The mercury employed was prepared by distilling the ordinary metal twice , then shaking it strongly in succession with dilute nitric acid , water , solution of cyanide of potassium , distilled water , and filtering it .
Distilled water was used in making all the solutions .
In using the apparatus , the mercury was first poured into the basins ; the tubes E and E placed , taking particular care that the mercurial column in F and its contact with the pool were complete .
Two very shallow india-rubber bungs were next inserted in the lower ends of the bent tube C , the tube then put in position , and filled with the liquid .
The solution was now put into the basins ; the bung D inserted tightly , the shallow ones then removed , and the bungs inserted in A-and B. The completeness of the circuit was next tested by attaching a galvanometer to the instrument , and , if necessary , a 2 k 2 474 Dr. G. Gore .
Thermo-Electric Behaviour of [ Dec. II* piinute swing of the needle was obtained by repeated connexion at proper intervals of time .
B was now beated .
About seven or eight minutes was usually occupied in raising its temperature the-required number of degrees ; the deflections at the various temperatures being noted .
After an experiment had been made , the mercury and solution of both vessels were mixed and cooled , and the mercury filtered , before repeating the trial with the same liquid .
Care was taken to select solutions which had the least amount of chemical action upon the mercury ; those of salts of the heavy and less positive metals were therefore not employed .
No liquid was used which produced any visible film or dullness upon that metal when heated with it .
It was found necessary to heat each solution to-about 180 ' F. , and keep it at that temperature some little time to expel dissolved air , and then cool it previous to making experiments , otherwise the results obtained in repetition experiments were not quite uniform .
In a previous research on the thermo-electric properties of liquids ( " Proc. Boy .
So .
, " No. 188 , 1878 , pp. 513\#151 ; 543 ) , in which platinum electrodes were employed , such previous heating was less necessary , probably because the thermo-electric currents were then stronger.* After heating and cooling the liquid , it was freely shaken with the mercury , and then filtered , previous to making experiments with it .
With every liquid , one or more repetition experiments were made in order to obtain uniform results , and confirm their reliability ; the amount of difference of deflection of the needles ; in such experiments did not exceed one degree .
The galvanometer-employed was an astatic one , having two coils , each of 50 ohms resistance , the two being connected and used as one of 100 ohms-resistance .
I have ascertained by separate experiments of a different kind , that-mercury when sufficiently agitated with solutions , neutral to test paper , of salts of the alkali metals , renders some of those liquids feebly alkaline ; the effect , however , is so slight , requires such extensive and long-continued contact of the substances , that it appears consistent with the view that chemical action is not the cause-of the currents in these thermo-electric experiments .
The following are the results obtained with different liquids in the-above apparatus .

Ten ounces of water , and 2^ grs. of potassic cyanide of a high degree of purity .
Cold mercury was positive 2 ' * The greater strength of the currents with the platinum electrodes was partly due to the circumstance that each platinum electrode offered a surface of 71,680 sq .

By this means the following series was obtained , in which the couple giving the strongest positive current is at the top , and that giving the most powerful negative current at the bottom , as in the previous list .
The horizontal line separates those liquids in which the hot metal was positive from those in which it was negative .
The relative positions of the solutions in the two series , although they agree in the main , are not identical ; for instance , nitrate of potassium occupies the eighth place in the first series , and the second place in 1879 .

the second series ; phosphate of ammonium , sulphate of ammonium , \amp ; c. , are also changed in position .
Such changes were probably affected by the circumstance , that whilst in the first series the electrodes were 81 millims. diameter ( =5,153 sq .
millims. of surface ) , and the current from a single apparatus circulated through a continuous double length of wire in the coil of the galvanometer , in the second series the electrodes were only 75 millims. diameter ( =4,418 sq .

The temperatures at which the deflections were noted were also different in the two series .
The surface of one electrode in the smaller apparatus was about ^ and in the larger one Jj- of that of one of the platinum electrodes in the apparatus already referred to ( see foot note , p. 474 ) .

Thermo-Electric Behaviour of [ Dec. 11 , Remarks.\#151 ; Many of the remarks which I have made in a previous paper on the thermo-electric properties of liquids ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , vol. xxvii , pp. 535-538 ) respecting the cause of the currents , apply to the results obtained in the present research ; and I consider that the causes of the currents and of their direction are similar in the two cases .
On examining the results it will be observed that the effects are not manifestly related to the chemical nature of the solutions ; thus , the liquids in which hot mercury is positive include those of acid , as well as those of alkaline reaction ; and similarly with the solutions in which cold mercury is positive ; To what extent chemical action occurred in the experiments and operated as a cause of electric currents , would be a difficult point to completely prove , because the amount required to produce such feeble currents would be so extremely small ; the result of a general examination of the phenomena , however , does not support the hypothesis that the currents were of chemical-origin .
The evident cause of the currents was heat , and the direction of them was probably due to molecular changes in the liquid attendant upon alteration of temperature .
In nearly all cases the magnitude of the current increased with the amount of difference of temperature ; the apparent , but not real , exceptions were those in which a reversal , or an advance towards it , occurred .
The strength of the solution manifestly affected the quantity , and in some cases the direction of the current , as may be perceived with the solutions of potassic cyanide ( Nos. 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , selenic acid ( Nos. 5 and 6 ) , ammonia alum ( Nos. 9 and 10 ) , formic acid ( Nos. 11 and 12 ) , sulphuric acid ( Nos. 15 , 16 , and 17 ) , and phosphate of sodium and ammonium ( Nos. 33 and 34 ) .
If the cause of the current , in the case of sulphuric acid , was chemical action , the direction of the current would probably not have been reversed by mere alteration of temperature , or by variation of strength of the mixture .
If , also , the cause of the currents in general was of a chemical nature , the currents would probably have been much stronger , especially with the stronger solutions , and would have increased in all cases , with the strength of the solution , until the latter was much more concentrated than those which were employed .
Stirring either portion of the liquid influenced the deflection in 59 cases out of 72 , increased it in 49 , and decreased it in 10 of those cases .
Stirring the cold portion altered the current in 31 cases out of 36 , and stirring the hot portion changed it in 28 cases out of 36 .
Stirring the cold portion also had a greater average magnitude of effect upon the current than stirring the hot portion .
Stirring a liquid of acid reaction increased the current in 13 cases out of 20 , decreased or reversed it in 3 cases , and had no effect in 4 cases .
Stirring an alkaline one increased the deflection in 12 cases out of 24 , decreased it 1879.1 Aqueous Solutions with Mercurial Electrodes .
in 5 , and had no effect in 7 .
The effects of stirring upon the amount of deflection were greater in alkaline liquids than in those of acid reaction .
Influence of previously heating the Solution .
Having observed , even with solutions formed with water which had been preboiled to expel dissolved air , that unless such liquids had been further heated to 180 ' F. ( and cooled ) , after the salt , \amp ; c. , had dissolved , the currents obtained in successive experiments with such a solution were not quite uniform in amount , but always decreased , I examined this circumstance .
Twenty ounces of distilled water was boiled and cooled ; the salt to be employed was then dissolved completely in it , and the solution shaken with pure mercury .
The mixture was then divided into two equal portions , one of those portions raised to a temperature of 180 ' F. in a covered glass vessel , and the evaporated water condensed and returned to the mixture , so that the solution remained unaltered in composition ; the liquid was then cooled .
These preheated and non-preheated portions were employed respectively to charge the two apparatuses already described .
The two thermo-pairs were then simultaneously excited , their currents allowed to circulate in opposite directions through the coils of the galvanometer , and the deflection noted when the hot portions of the two liquids had simultaneously acquired a temperature of 160 ' F. The following is a brief statement of the results .
Twenty ounces of distilled water , and 200 grs. of crystals of sodic-phosphate .
The non-preheated portion of solution yielded the strongest current ; deflection 1 ' .
Twenty ounces of water and 2 drms .
of sulphuric acid .
The non-preheated portion gave the strongest current ; deflection '25 .
Twenty ounces of water and 100 grs. of partly dehydrated sodiu carbonate .
The non-preheated portion gave the strongest current ; deflection '33 ' at 140 ' F. , and *25 ' aFt 160 ' F. Twenty ounces of water and 200 grs. of baric nitrate .
The non-preheated portion yielded the strongest current ; deflection 1 .
The same mixture as the last ; one portion of the solution was preheated with mercury , instead of being preheated alone .
The non-preheated portion gave the strongest current ; deflection 1 at 180 F , In each of these five experiments the non-preheated portion of liquid yielded the current of greatest electromotive force .
This accords with the original observation that repetition experiments always yielded weaker currents ( see p. 480 ) .
In order to ascertain whether preheating the one portion of salt before dissolving it had the same effect upon the current as heating it after having been dissolved , the following experiments were made : 482 Profs .
Living and Dewar .
[ Dec. 11 , Preboiled and cooled 20 ozs .
of distilled water , and divided into two exactly equal portions .
Took two portions of 50 grs. each of partly dehydrated sodic carbonate ; heated one portion to 180 ' F. for fifteen minutes until it ceased to evolve moisture ( it lost 12 4 grs. ) , and cooled it .
Dissolved the two separate portions of salt in the separate quantities of water , and tested the solutions against each other in the two apparatuses .
No difference of strength of current occurred at any temperature up to that of 180 ' F. In another experiment of this kind , 200 grs. of ammonia alum were divided and treated as above .
The solution of the non-preheated portion gave the strongest current ; deflection '75 ' at 180 ' F. Remarks.\#151 ; The conclusion I draw from these last two experiments .and results , combined with those of the previous ones , is that preheating the salt either before or after solution usually weakens the current , both in thermo-electropositive and in thermo-electronegative liquids .
In the several classes of cases described in this paper , it is evident that the currents are not due to chemical action , but to heat acting upon and altering particular molecular structures , and that the difference of electromotive power in different liquids is not due to differences of chemical action , but probably to differences of molecular arrangement of the solutions .
Also that in the class of experiments where the liquids compared had the same chemical composition , but had been differently treated , the differences of molecular arrangement were less , and the currents obtained were consequently more feeble .
A difference .of strength of current caused by repetition of experiments , or by continuance of heat , also renders manifest the change of molecular arrangement ; and the above method may be employed for detecting molecular differences in conducting liquids having the same chemical .composition .
In the class of cases in which the differences of molecular arrangement were the least , and the currents the most feeble , the direction of the currents was the most uniform .
This is in accordance with the common truth in science that the smallest phenomena are the most .constant .
