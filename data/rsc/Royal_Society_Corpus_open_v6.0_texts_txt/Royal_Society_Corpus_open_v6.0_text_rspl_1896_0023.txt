" The Relation between the Refraction of the Elements and their Chemical Equivalents .
" By J. H. Gladstone , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. Received June 3 , 1896 .
This paper is .
intended to give a preliminary account of some recent investigations into the specific refraction of the elements .
It may be conveniently divided into two distinct parts .
The first part is a revision and extension of the list of specific and atomic refractions , which was first published in the ' Phil. Trans. ' for 1870 , and was reprinted with modifications in a lecture given at the Royal Institution in 1877 .
The second part is an amplification of some deductions made in that lecture .
Pakt I.\#151 ; The Specific and Atomic Refractions of the Elements .
The following table contains the atomic weights , the specific refractions , and the atomic refractions of the elements as revised and extended .
For the atomic weights I have adopted the numbers recently published by the American Chemical Society 's Committee on Atomic Weights ( ' J. Amer .
Chem. Soc. , ' vol. 17 ) , revised up to January , 1894 .
In regard to the specific refraction , advantage has beeii taken of the work done in some departments of the inquiry by Landolt , Haagen , Briihl , Topsoe and Christiansen , Mascart , Becquerel , Kanonnikoff , Soret , Kasim , Ghira , Perrot , Tutton , Lord Rayleigh , Edwards , and others , as well as many additional observations made by myself or by Mr. Hibbert .
The atomic refraction is the product of the numbers in the two earlier columns , that is , it equals where P is the atomic weight , and p\#151 ; ljd is the specific refraction , that is , the refractivity divided by the density .
Of course , these are not generally determined by observations of the element itself , but are deduced from those of its salts or other compounds .

T Relation between the The most notable change from previous tables is the increase in the value of hydrogen and the decrease in that of carbou , but the necessity of this has been gradually recognised by the principal workers on the refraction of organic bodies .
This in no way affects the well-determined value CH2 = 7*6 .
It should be borne in mind that the specific refraction cannot claim a constancy equal to that of the atomic weight .
The latter is generally believed to be identical under all circumstances , though the element may be capable of combining with another in two or more multiple proportions .
On the other hand , several of the elements , as oxygen and iron , exhibit two or more specific refractions , which are not in multiple proportion , but depend upon the manner of combination .
The best recognised of these are given in the third column , and the existence of others is indicated by an " \amp ; c. " Beside these well-marked differences , there are many smaller variations , scarcely , if at all , beyond the limits of experimental error , which depend upon differences of physical condition or chemical structure .
The numbers given in column 3 are therefore subject to an uncertainty , which may in some instances amount to 5 per cent. Where there is a greater divergence among the values observed , or where the deductions have been made from only one specimen , it is indicated by a query .
Part II.\#151 ; The Relation between the Specific Refraction and the Combining Proportion of the Metals .
In the paper " On the refraction equivalents of the elements " previously referred to , it was shown that if the metallic elements be arranged in the order of their specific refractions , they are roughly in the inverse order of their combining proportions .
In the lecture at the Royal Institution , I showed that this inverse order followed an approximate law , namely , that the " specific refractive energy of a metal is inversely as the square root of its combining proportion .
" This generalisation was proved for univalent metals , the figures showing ( with the exception of sodium ) a practically constant value for the product of the specific refraction and the square root of the combining proportion .
By the aid of the table in the first part of this communication , the generalisation can now be tested throughout the whole range of the metallic elements .

This is in spite of the fact that lithium and caesium differ from one another in either factor in the ratio of about 9 to 2 .
The two metals below the line , though acting as monads in the compounds from which these values are deduced , are considered to be dyad and triad respectively .
With them , the product is a little higher ; this will be referred to afterwards .

0-98 These tables show : First , that the metals which have the same valency , have the same , or nearly the same , constant of refraction for equivalent weights .
Refraction of the Elements and their Chemical Equivalents .
145 Secondly , that the constants of the bivalent , trivalent , quadrivalent , and apparently quinquivalent groups are practically the same , ranging about 101 .
Thirdly , that when a metal combines in a proportion that indicates a lower valency than that ordinarily assigned to it , its constant is somewhat elevated .
I refrain at present from pointing out minor analogies between closely-allied metals , and from attempting to explain the difference between the univalent and the other groups ; why sodium should fall away from the value proper to the alkaline group , and closely approximate to that of all the other groups ; or why beryllium , bivalent tin , and tri valent iron should be represented by such exceptionally high figures .
It is to be understood that the values given are all deduced from compounds in which the metal plays the part of an electro-positive radicle .
Where they combine with oxygen to form the electronegative radicle , the values are completely altered , just as we find in the case of several non-metallic elements .
If we calculate these constants for the square root of the atomic weight instead of that of the combining proportion , we shall obtain for the means\#151 ; Univalents ... ... ... 1'30 Bivalents ... ... ... . .

T75 Quadrivalent^ ... ... 2T2 Quinquivalent ... ... 2T9 This arrangement does not , as in the former case , give a practically identical constant for the bivalent , trivalent , quadrivalent , and quinquivalent metals .
The fact that these numbers increase nearly in the proportion of the square roots of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , indicates that the relation involved is not between the specific refraction and the atom , but rather between it and the combining proportion or chemical equivalent of the metal .
This brings the optical property into analogy with Faraday 's law of electro-chemical equivalents .
I propose to give this product the descriptive name , " Refractive constant of equivalent weights .
" It may be represented by\#151 ; SE* = constant , where S is the specific refraction , and E the chemical equivalent of the metal .
Some physicists may prefer to make use of the square of the above formula , namely , S2E = constant .

'Z_1 1 If the Lorenz expression for S , namely , ---- .
be preferred to d f.i\#151 ; 1/ d , it may be substituted in either of the above formulae .
In either case the actual numbers will , of course , be changed more or less , but the relation above pointed out will still hold good .
The discrepancies will , however , be somewhat exaggerated by the change .
This is suggested as a first approximation to a new law .
It may be useful in both chemical and physical science .
It holds good , however , only for the metallic elements .
" Selective Absorption of Rontgen Rays .
" By J. A. M'Clelland , M.A. , Fellow of the Royal University of Ireland .
Communicated by Professor J. J. Thomson , F.R.S. Received June 11 , \#151 ; Read June 18 , 1896 .
( From the Cavendish Laboratory .
) The experiments described in this paper were made to determine whether or not the Rontgen rays given off by a vacuum bulb were of a homogeneous nature , by examining the manner in which they are absorbed by different substances .
The induction coil and vacuum bulb for producing the rays were enclosed in a wooden box thickly lined with metal , with a small hole in the top , directly beneath which and close up to it the vacuum bulb was placed .
Over the hole a well-insulated metal disk was placed and connected to one pair of quadrants of an electrometer .
The two pairs of quadrants are first connected together and with one terminal of a battery of small storage cells , the other terminal being connected to earth .
The quadrants of the electrometer are then separated from each other and from the storage cells , and the induction coil turned on .
The Rontgen rays passing through the hole in the box and falling on the charged disk discharges it , and the intensity of the radiation is measured by the rate at which the spot of light from the electrometer needle moves across the scale .
The metal lining of the box is connected to earth , and the small hole covered with a single sheet of tinfoil to screen the electrometer from direct electrical disturbances .
The substance whose absorptive power is to be examined is placed over the hole so that the rays traverse it before falling on the charged disk .
Evidences of selective absorption were sought for in the following manner .
The rate of leakage was accurately determined when the rays were passing through one of the substances used , say a plate of glass .
Sheets of tinfoil were then substituted for the glass and the
