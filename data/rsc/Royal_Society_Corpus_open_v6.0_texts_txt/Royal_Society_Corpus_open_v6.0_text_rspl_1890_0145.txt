[ Feb ; 26 , Excitation of the Spinal Cord.\#151 ; Whereas in the foregoing series ( I ) we dealt only with ascending impulses , we proceeded to investigate the distribution of descending impulses by observing the above-named changes when the individual columns of the cord are excited by minimal and later with , more intense stimuli , controlling our results by the method of intervening sections .
We can summarise the effects observed as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Marked quantitative diminution suffered by impulses , leaving the spinal cord by the anterior roots , whether originating in the cortex cerebri , corona radiata , or the lateral columns of the cord .
( 2 .
) Localisation of direct transmission of impulses in the posterior column and passing out into the posterior roots of the same side .
( 3 .
) Proportionate development of the direct and indirect paths in the individual columns of the cord , passing out into the mixed nerve of the one side .
( 4 .
) Effects observed in the posterior roots when the bulbo-spinal centres are excited either by strychnine or electrically ( kinsesthesis ) .
Finally , the chief general principles elucidated by this research may be stated as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Unilateral character of the representation of function in the paths of the central nervous system .
( 2 .
) The physiological characteristics of the regions of a nerve centre:\#151 ; ( a. ) The kinsesthetic activity of the afferent region of the centre .
( b. ) The obstruction offered by the efferent region , including the field of conjunction , to the transmission of impulses through the centre .

" The Rupture of Steel by Longitudinal Stress .
" By Charles A. Carus-Wilson .
Communicated by Professor G. H. Darwin , F.R.S. Received March 10 , \#151 ; Read March 27 , 1890 .
[ Plates 2 , 3 .
] In a paper read before the Royal Society on June 16 , 1881 , Professor G. H. Darwin stated : " It is difficult to conceive any mode in which an elastic solid can ruptnre except by shearing , and hence it appears that the greatest shearing stress is a proper measure of the tendency to break " ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' 1882 , p. 99 ) .
In this paper , I have recorded the results of some experiments made with a view to throwing light on the question raised by Professor Darwin .
The experiments were conducted in the mechanical laboratory at the Royal Indian Engineering College , Cooper 's Hill , the machine used being a hundred-ton single lever , hydraulic testing machine by Messrs. Buckton \amp ; Co. , of Leeds .
This machine is fully described in Unwin 's ' Testing of Materials of Construction , ' p. 133 .
All tension experiments were performed on circular specimens fitted with a screw thread at each end , on to which were screwed steel nuts resting in spherical seatings to ensure directness of pull .
The shearing experiments were conducted on specimens screwed throughout their entire length into three steel blocks , and tested in double shear , i.e\gt ; , the two outside blocks were pulled in the opposite direction to the inside block\#151 ; perpendicularly to the axis of the specimen , and the bar sheared in two places at once .
The idea of rupture necessarily implies an overcoming of resistance .
If the power* of steel to resist rupture under tension were a constant quantity , the conception of rupture would be simple , for we should only have to increase the stress up to the required amount , \#174 ; ud the bar would break ; but the resistance to rupture appears to e a function of the amount of flow that has taken place ( see experi-uients described in Table II ) .
If we take two axes , OX , OX , to represent respectively the elongation per unit of length , and the stress per unit of area of transverse section of elongated bar , we obtain the
