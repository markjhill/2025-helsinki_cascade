By Martin Barry , M.D. , F.R.S. Having in the paper to which the present is supplementary made known the fact that the germinal spot in the mammiferous ovum re ?
solves itself into cells , with which the germinal vesicle becomes filled , the author has since directed his attention to the corresponding parts in the ova of birds , batrachian reptiles , and osseous fishes , which he finds to be the seat of precisely the same changes .
The numerous spots in the germinal vesicle of batrachian reptiles and osseous fishes are no other than the nuclei of cells .
The cells themselves , from their transparency , are at first not easily discerned , and appear to have hitherto escaped notice ; but after the observer has become aware of their presence , they are , in many instances , seen to be are ?
ranged in the same manner , and to present the same interior themselves as the corresponding cells in the ovum of mammalia .
In the representations given by Professor Rudolph Wagner , the discoverer of the germinal spot , the author recognizes evidence of the same changes in ova throughout the animal kingdom .
He confirms and explains the observations of R. Wagner , that in the ova of certain animals an originally single spot divides into many , and that in the ova of other animals the number of spots increases as the ovum ripens .
But he expresses also the opinion that in all ova there is originally but a single spot , this being the nucleus of the germinal vesicle or cell .
The analogy between the ova of mammalia and the animal abovementioned , extends also to the substance surrounding the germinal vesicle , which consists of nucleated cells .
