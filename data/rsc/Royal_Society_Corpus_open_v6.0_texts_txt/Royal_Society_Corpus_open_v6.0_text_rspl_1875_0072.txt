On the Voyage from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
623 Of the promontories above mentioned , the one which extends towards the west is a lofty mountain rising precipitously from the sea on the N.E. and S.W. , and terminating in two peaks .
Between these two peaks a glacier descends to the edge of the cliff overhanging the sea on the north-east side , over which the ice-masses fall with a thundering noise .
The other promontory or peninsula is covered by a flow of very recent lava , the eddies and ripples on the surface being still quite fresh .
This stream of lava proceeds from the base of a recent but much dilapidated crater , which having sprung up close to the sea could only have been preserved by renewing its substance with constant eruption .
When this ceased , the degrading action of the waves began to tell ; and at present it is worn into a group of fantastic-looking peaks , the vertical sides of which are marked by the layers of scoriae dipping away from the centre .
The lava-stream covers the whole of the peninsula , and from having been worn by the waves it forms a range of low black cliffs along the north side of Corinthian Bay .
In the face of these cliffs many large cavities , bubbles in the once molten lava , had been opened , and were tenanted by the nesting Cape pigeon .
The glaciers which cover the whole of the southern side of Corinthian Bay have been prevented from encroaching on the beach at the head of it by a sharp conical hill of scoriae , behind which the ice-covering stretches from sea to sea .

Sir , \#151 ; I have the honour to report that we left Stanley Harbour in East-Falkland Island for Monte Video on the afternoon of the 6th of February , and on the 8th we sounded in lat. 48 ' 37 ' S. , long .
55 ' 17 ' W. , about 200 miles to the N.E. of Stanley , in a depth of 1035 fathoms .
The trawl was lowered , but it was unfortunately carried away , after the weights , which were at a distance of 300 fathoms in advance of the trawl , had been brought in board .
The rope looked much chafed , as if it had been ground against rocks .
The sounding-machine brought up no sample of the VOL. xxiv .
2 Y 624 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the f Challenger ' bottom ; but a tow-net attached to the dredge-rope at the weights contained a little gravel and one or two small organisms .
The bottom-temperature was 1'*7 C. The following day was fine , with light uncertain winds ; on the 10th it was blowing half a gale and the sea was running too high for sounding-operations .
On the 11th the weather was fine , the wind becoming more moderate towards noon ; at 10 a.m. we sounded and put down the trawl in 2040 fathoms , with a bottom of bluish mud containing many , and a bottom-temperature of +0'*3 C. The position of the sounding was lat. 42 ' 32 ' S. , long .
56 ' 27 ' W. , about 200 miles to the eastward of Valdes Peninsula .
Temperature-soundings were taken down to 1500 fathoms ( Curve 318 , Plate 27 ) .
This sounding gives a singularly rapid fall from 140,2 on the surface to 2 ' C. at 125 fathoms ; the edge of the Antarctic indraught appeared to be pushed up against the American shore by the western border of the southern branch of the reflux of the equatorial current , as the Labrador current is banked up by its northern branch , the result being no doubt increased in both cases by the flinging up of the polar water against the western land-barrier on account of its low initial velocity .
On the 12th we sounded in 2425 fathoms , and took a series of temperatures ; the upper temperatures were decidedly higher than they were the day before , 5 ' occurring at 125 fathoms , 2'*5 at 700 , and 2 ' C. at 1100 fathoms .
The position of the sounding was lat. 41 ' 54 ' S. , long .
54 ' 46 ' W. ; it was nearly double the distance of the previous sounding from the 100-fathom line , which here nearly corresponds with a steep submarine cliff of great height .
The bottom-temperature was \#151 ; 0'*4 C. ( Curve 319 , Plate 27 ) .
On the 14th we sounded in 600 fathoms on the plateau extending from the South-American coast , opposite the estuary of the Liver Plate , 144 miles from Lobos Island .
We took a set of temperatures to the bottom , and found the gradation , so far as it went , much the same as the day before ; the bottom-temperature was 2'*7 C. On this occasion the trawl was most successful , and gave us a very fair idea of the fauna of moderate depths along the coast ; probably not fewer than sixty species of different groups were recovered , including a very handsome Pennatula between two and three feet in height , some deep-sea corals of very special interest , which are being worked up by Mr. Moseley , and some fine Echinoderms and sponges .
On the 15th we anchored in Monte-Video Loads .
We left the anchorage at Monte Video at daybreak on the 25th of Eebruary , and after swinging ship for errors of the compasses , we proceeded down the estuary .
In the afternoon the trawl was put down in thirteen fathoms to get an idea of the fauna of the brackish water .
The species procured were comparatively few ; but among them was a plentiful supply of an interesting Alcyonarian Coelenterate of the genus Renilla , which was new to us .
On the two following days we crossed from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
625 the shallow-water plateau , and on the 28th we sounded and trawled in 1900 fathoms over the ledge .
A serial temperature-sounding gave a bottom-temperature of 0'*0C .
, l'-0 at 1725 fathoms , 3'-0 at 600 fathoms , and 20 ' at 50 fathoms ( Curve 323 , Plate 29 ) .
The trawl was not very successful , but it brought up a few things of some interest ; among them an example of a small sea-urchin , of which we had previously taken single specimens at widely , distant stations , off the coast of Nova Scotia , near Gomera Island , near New Zealand , and near Japan .
The bottom was chiefly river-mud with very little carbonate of lime .
On the following day we sounded in 2800 fathoms , and again lowered the trawl .
The bottom was a greyish mud , with little or no carbonate of lime , and the bottom-temperature was \#151 ; 0o,4 C. The trawl-line parted near the ship in heaving in .
On the 1st of March we proceeded on our course , and on the 2nd we sounded in 2650 fathoms , with a bottom of grey mud and a bottom-temperature of 0'*4 C. The trawl was put over , and a series of temperature observations was taken to 1500 fathoms .
( Curve No. 325 , Plate 29 .
) This sounding is very instructive ; the isothermobath of 3 ' C. is found at 600 fathoms , so that we have a mass of water at a lower temperature 2000 fathoms in thickness ; 20,5 C. occurs at 1900 fathoms , and zero at 2400 .
The very marked hump of the curve extending from a depth of 125 fathoms to a depth of 255 , and corresponding with the wide spaces between the isothermobaths of 15 ' C. and 6 ' C. on Plate 28 , evidently indicates the position and volume of the Brazil current , the southern deflection of the equatorial current after its bifurcation at Cape St. Boque .
The trawl came up containing an unusually large number of organisms for this depth , including two specimens of an undescribed species of Euplectella , some corals , several Echinoderms illustrating three of the orders , some beautiful examples of a species of Sty lifer commensal on one of the Holothurians , and several fishes .
Next day we sounded in 2775 fathoms , and took temperature-soundings .
This series ( Curve 326 , Plate 29 ) presented a marked difference from that of the previous day .
All the lines from that of 1''5 C. had risen most palpably , most of them between 100 and 200 fathoms .
Even the surface participated in the fall of temperature , having sunk from 21''6 C. to 19'*9 .
This is evidently a space in the Brazil current occupied by colder water , like the peculiar cold interdigitations which are so marked in the Gulf-stream .
The position of this sounding was lat. 37 ' 3 ' S. , long .
44 ' 17f W. A serial temperature-sounding on the following day , at a distance of 80 miles to the eastward , where the depth was 2900 fathoms and the bottom-temperature \#151 ; 0'*3 C. , showed by the sinking of all the isothermobaths that we had again entered the normal flow of the Brazil current .
On the 6th of March it was blowing hard from the S. W. with a heavy sea .
We sounded in 2900 fathoms , with a bottom of grey mud and a bottom2x2 ( 326 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the Challenger * temperature of \#151 ; 0'*3 C. ; but the weather was too boisterous to admit of a serial temperature-sounding .
On the 7th the sea was more moderate , and we sounded in 2675 fathoms , with a bottom-temperature of \#151 ; 0'*6 C. , and took the temperature series represented by Curve 329 ( Plate 30 ) .
The bottom was again a very fine grey or slightly reddish mud , almost free from calcic carbonate ; samples of water were obtained for specific-gravity determinations and analysis down to 2000 fathoms .
On the 8th of March we sounded in 2440 fathoms , with a bottom of light red mud , and a bottom-temperature of \#151 ; 0'*3C .
; and on the 9th , somewhat to our surprise , we sounded in 1715 fathoms , with a bottom of " Globigerinci-ooze " and a temperature of l0-3 C. The sea was heavy , and trawling-operations were consequently rather difficult ; the trawl wa3 lowered , however , on account of the remarkable shallowness of the sounding ; but it unfortunately came up foul , and the observation was lost .
It seems that this sounding was on the central meridional rise which separates the western from the eastern trough of the Atlantic at a depth apparently nowhere much beyond 2000 fathoms , near its western edge .
As usual , the lower isothermobathic lines showed a tendency to rise slightly in the shallower water .
On the 10th the morning was misty and raining , with the wind northerly , shifting to the southward towards noon .
We sounded in 2200 fathoms , " Globigerina-ooze , " with a bottom-temperature of +0o,4 C. The trawl was put over ; but on being recovered , it was found to have been down on its back , and it contained only a few fragments of one or two sponges , Crustaceans , and Echinoderms .
We ran on during the 11th and 12th , and on the 13th we sounded on " Globigerina-ooze " at a depth of 2025 fathoms , with a bottom-temperature of 1''2 C. The trawl again came up empty and reversed , some fragments adhering to the net , showing that there was a varied fauna , and that much interesting material must have been got from a successful haul .
The position of the sounding on the 14th was lat. 35 ' 45 ' S. , long .
18 ' 3 ' W. ; the depth was 1915 fathoms , the bottom " ooze , " and the bottom-temperature 1''5 C. , the distance from Tristan d'Acunha 310 miles .
The trawl came up again foul , with only some fragments to indicate the presence of an abundant fauna .
As we had already crossed our outward track in 1873 , and as the temperatures at depths uninfluenced by the changes of the seasons seemed to verify in every way our former work , we thought it unnecessary to go further to the eastward on the direct line , and we took a north-easterly course towards a point in the meridian of the Island of Ascension , which was distant from us about 1685 miles .
We ran on next day , and on the 16th the position of the ship was lat. 32 ' 24 ' S. , long .
13 ' 5 ' W. , 1470 miles almost due south of Ascension , and 280 miles north by west of Tristan d'Acunha .
from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
627 | .
We sounded in 1425 fathoms on " ooze , " with a bottomtemperature of 2''3 C. The trawl had failed so frequently of late , that we determined to send down instead a large light dredge , which we had had made at Hong-Kong for the shallow-water sponge-producing seas of the Philippines .
It came up with scarcely any ooze , and with only a small number of animal species ; but among them were many very perfect specimens of the rare little sea-urchin , Salenia It is singular that although there were a large number of hempen tangles attached to the dredge , and they seemed to have done their work well , none of the Bryozoa so characteristic of moderate depths , with a bottom of " gerina-ooze , " in the Atlantic were taken on this occasion .
In the evening we made sail due north .
This portion of the voyage divides itself into two parts with very different conditions\#151 ; the nearly meridional passage from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video , a distance of 1100 miles ; and the line from Monte Video to Station 335 , a little to the south of the parallel of 35 ' S. for a distance of 2100 miles .
Between Stanley and Monte Video four observing-stations were established , numbered on the charts and diagrams from 317 to 320 .
Two of these were in comparatively shallow water near the edge of , but still upon , the plateau which extends from the coast of South America to a distance of nearly 400 miles , and includes the Falkland Islands ; the two remaining soundings , 318 and 319 , were well beyond the cliff of the plateau at depths greater than 2000 fathoms .
The shallow-water soundings were upon hard ground ; in the two others the bottom was a greyish mud , to a great extent composed of land detritus .
All these soundings , the two deep ones particularly , indicate the presence of a great underlying mass of cold water , the isothermobath of 2 ' C. occurring at Station 318 at a depth of 125 fathoms .
At Station 319 the 2D-C .
line is at 1100 fathoms , and the other isothermobaths up to 5 ' 0 .
show a corresponding rise .
I attribute this remarkable difference between two soundings so near one another to the banking of the cold water against the submarine cliff by the Brazil current ; sounding 118 seems to have fallen directly upon the " cold wall .
" At the deeper sounding ( 319 ) the thermometer fell , for the first time in our experience in the South Atlantic , below the freezing-point ; but the relations of this very low bottom-temperature will be better understood when we come to consider the section between Monte Video and Tristan d'Acunha .
On the line between Monte Video and Station 335 , fifteen observing-stations were established .
The first three of these , 321 to 323 , were on the estuary of the Biver Plate , or ( 323 ) just beyond the edge of the delta at its mouth ; the next seven , 324 to 330 , gave a section of a wide inlet into the western trough of the South Atlantic with a mean depth of 2750 fathoms ; and the remaining five stations , 331 to 335 , were on the 628 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the Challenger3 central rise , with an average depth of 1850 fathoms .
The mean bottom-temperature of the seven deep soundings is \#151 ; 0'-4 C. , and that of the five soundings on the rise 10,3 C. ; the isothermobath of 0o,0 0 .
is at a depth averaging 2400 fathoms , a depth which it never much exceeds except where the cold water rises against the American coast , as at Stations 319 and 323 ; it therefore occurs in the line of the seven deep soundings only ; and there it forms the upper limit of a mass of water with a temperature below zero , 320 square miles in section .
Perhaps the isothermobath of 1'*5 C. may fairly be taken as the upper limit of the very cold water ; the section of the Antarctic indraught below that temperature is here about 800 square miles .
( The transverse section of the Gulf-stream is about 6 square miles ; there is no volume of water at all in the Labrador current below 1'*5 0 .
opposite Halifax , that temperature being only found at the bottom .
) The isothermobaths of 2 ' , 2'-5 , 3 ' , and 4 ' C. are very constant at 1500 , 900 , 600 , and 400 fathoms respectively for all the stations on the parallel except Station 323 on the " cold wall , " where all the lower temperature-lines are at a much higher level , and at the shallow sounding at Station 331 , where all the lines below that of 4 ' C. rise slightly .
We must be careful , however , not to attach too much importance to slight deviations of the colder lines .
On the scale used in Plates 26 , 28 , 32 , and 33 , the mean interval between the isothermobaths of 2 ' and 3 ' C. in the Atlantic is 1000 fathoms ; so that a rise or fall of 100 fathoms , which is very prominent on such diagrams , actually represents only one tenth of a Centigrade degree , an amount very small in itself , and , it must be remembered , entirely within the limit of error of observation with a deep-sea thermometer ; it is only where there is a concordance among several lines in such a rise or fall that the indication is of any real value .
The mean temperature of the surface of the water at the anchorage at Monte Video was 220,5 C. ; at Station 320 , just before entering the estuary , it was 190,7 C. ; at Station 323 , on the edge of the plateau , it rose to 23 ' ; and a temperature of 20 ' C. or a little above it was maintained up to Station 328 , except at Station 326 , which I have already referred to as occupying a cold space .
After reaching Station 328 the temperature began to sink , and only recovered its former height when we moved northwards .
The curves deduced from the serial temperature-soundings along this line ax'e represented in groups of four on Plates 29,30 , \amp ; 31 .
At Station 323 the temperature of the water fell rapidly and tolerably evenly , with only a slight prominence between 150 and 250 fathoms , to 5 ' C. at 350 fathoms ; it then took a slower , but still a symmetrical sweep down to zero at 1900 fathoms .
At Stations 324 and 325 the lines fell , with 'still only a slight protuberance in the same position as before , to 3 ' C. at 600 fathoms , when they sank very slowly to 1 ' C. at 2000 fathoms , and then from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
629 again a little more rapidly to \#151 ; 0'*4 at the bottom .
At the next Station ( 326 ) all the upper temperatures were remarkably low , corresponding with the cold " interdigitation " in the Brazil current .
Stations 328 and 329 repeat Stations 324 and 325 with little variation ; at the three Stations 330 , 331 , and 332 there was a most marked hump on the curves , occupying roughly the space between 150 and 250 fathoms ; and at the three succeeding stations , 333 , 334 , and 335 , the hump wore out and finally disappeared .
The high surface-temperatures between the mouth of the Biver Plate and Station 328 are doubtless due to solar radiation ( early autumn temperature ) plus the additional warmth of the Brazil current , which is logged from the 29th of February to the 10th of March as running in a generally southerly direction at an average rate of 20 miles a day .
The rapid fall for the first 150 fathoms represents mainly the loss of the heat due to direct radiation , which does not affect the curve to a depth much greater than 100 fathoms ; and the hump from 150 to 250 fathoms represents the extra effect of the current , which appears to have there an average depth of 250 fathoms ; it seems , however , not to be very constant , either in volume , direction , or rate .
To recapitulate briefly the more important points with regard to the distribution of temperature:\#151 ; 1 .
The section between Monte Video and the meridian of Tristan d'Acunha includes , besides the soundings on the South-American plateau and the sounding on the " cold wall , " a series of soundings in a western trough with an average depth of 2750 fathoms and an average bottom-temperature of \#151 ; 0o,4 C. ; and a series of soundings on the middle bank of the Atlantic , with an average depth of 1850 fathoms and a mean bottom-temperature of 1'*3 C. 2i In the trough a huge mass of Antarctic water at temperatures ranging from 1''5 C. to \#151 ; 0o,6 C. is creeping northwards at depths greater than 1800 fathoms ; on the rise very little water at a lower temperature than l'-5 C. passes northward ; but that is only on account of the absence of the required depth , for the isothermobaths of 10,5 and 2 ' C. are practically at the same level over the central plateau and over the trough .
3 .
On the surface a warm current , perhaps about 800 miles wide , and affecting the temperature of the water to a depth of 250 fathoms , continuous to the northward with the southerly deflection of a part of the equatorial current , passes to the southward , taking a slightly easterly direction on account of its higher initial velocity .
4 .
As a rule , the temperature falls rapidly throughout the section to a temperature of 3 ' O. at 600 fathoms , and then extremely slowly to the bottom .
We had always attached special importance to the temperature-soundings on this section , for we had expected them to throw some additional 630 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the ' light upon the observations taken in the West Atlantic in the year 1873 .
These seemed at first sight to present certain anomalies ; thus in our somewhat hurried run from Bahia to Tristan d'Acunha , we appeared to have missed the source of supply of water at an unusually low temperature which we found near the island of Pernando Noronha .
The result has fully justified our anticipations .
Diagram A , Plate 32 , represents the vertical distribution of temperature at Station 112 , lat. 3 ' 33 ' S. , long .
32 ' 16 ' W. , 21 miles to the N.E. of Pemando Noronha .
Diagram B gives the temperatures at Station 129 , lat. 20 ' 12 ' S. , long .
35 ' 19 ' W. , nearly halfway between A and C , which represents the distribution of temperature at Station 327 , one of the most characteristic in the section at present under consideration .
The depth at Station 327 is 2900 fathoms , and the depths at the two other stations 2150 and 2200 respectively ; and it will be seen that at the latter stations the bottom-temperatures correspond almost precisely with the temperature at Station 327 at like depths .
The isothermobath of 2 ' C. is at the same height , 1500 fathoms , at the two southern stations ; and at the northern station only , near the equator , it sinks to 1800 fathoms .
The isothermobaths of 2''5 and 3 ' C. correspond almost exactly in level at Stations B and C ; at Station A all the isothermobathic lines under that of 4 ' C. down to the line of 1 ' C. are much lower than at Stations B and C ; that is to say , that at the equator between 4 ' C. and 1 ' C. the water is considerably warmer than it is further south .
The isothermobathic lines of 4 ' and 5 ' C. seem everywhere in the Atlantic to mark broadly the line of demarcation between the upper zone , where the temperatures are obviously affected by the diffusion of water by wind-currents , and the lower zone , where the temperatures are continuous with those of the Southern Sea .
In the North Atlantic they are markedly lower than they are to the south of the equator ; that is to say , there is a much larger body of water above them heated by conduction , convection , and mixture .
I have given in Plate 33 a general diagrammatic scheme of the vertical distribution of temperature in the western trough of the Atlantic , constructed from our serial temperature-soundings in the years 1873 and 1876 .
The diagram extends from lat. 42 ' S. to lat. 42 ' N. , and includes as its southern limit the banking up of the Antarctic indraught against the South-American coast , and as its northern the " cold wall5 ' of the Labrador ' current .
v This Plate seems scarcely to require much comment ; but there are one or two points to which I would wish to direct attention .
At Station 327 , so often referred to as a typical sounding on our present line , there is a mass of water* 400 fathoms thick at a temperature below zero .
Station 131 , 600 miles south of Martin Yas , is on the edge of the central plateau , with a depth of 2275 fathoms and a bottom-temperature of 0'*7 0 .
; the deep passage therefore probably lies , if it have not from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video , 631 already come to an end , between long .
28'*9 W. and the coast o\#163 ; America .
The distribution of the lower temperatures is much the same at station 131 as it is at station 327 , the isothermobaths sinking slightly .
At station 129 , which is right in the middle of what may be supposed to be the direction of the current , the depth is 2150 fathoms , and the temperature 0*6 G. ; the cold-water trough has therefore probably stopped before reaching this point ; all the belts of water at given low temperatures are evidently continuous , although the isothermobaths of 3 ' C. and 20,5 C. are now sinking rapidly .
The accumulation of water above 3 ' C. in temperature is still more apparent at Station 112 , nearly under the equator .
The next station , No. 15 , is the first of a series of rather deep soundings taken after crossing the " Dolphin Else " ( the central bank of the Atlantic ) on our voyage from Teneriffe to Sombrero in 1873 .
The deepest of these soundings are a little above 3000 fathoms ; and they look from their position very much as if they were in the axis of the Antarctic indraught ; but the temperature in no case falls below 10,3 C. ; and , tracing southwards , we find that a belt of shallow soundings ( not more than 2000 fathoms ) extends from the central plateau about lat. 21 ' N. , long .
46 ' 30f W. , to the coast of South America , somewhere about Cape Orange .
Going northwards , wTe encounter much greater depths , but no temperatures lower than 10,3 C. ; the whole mass of water to the very bottom rises steadily , though only slightly , to the northward , the merely local depression , which never reaches 10,3 C. along the line of the Labrador current , being scarcely worth mention .
It is evident that the water of the Atlantic is not generally affected by an indraught from the Arctic Sea .
The diagram ( Plate 33 ) shows very well the effect on the relative positions of the isothermobathic lines of the rapid removal of the warm surface-water over the region of the equatorial current and counter-current in the gathering up of the higher lines near the equator , and of the curl of the warm water to the north and south as the Gulf-stream and the Brazil current after the bifurcation of the equatorial current , in the depression of the isothermobaths of 20 ' , 15 ' , and 10 ' C. to the north and south of the equatorial region .
The causes of the very perceptible rise in temperature of the whole mass of the water of the North Atlantic will require further investigation .
As I have said elsewhere , I am inclined to attribute it mainly to the banking in and accumulation of the northern reflux of the equatorial current , and its gradual mixture with the water beneath ; and it seems to me that this cause is adequate to the effect .
Still , even if this be so , we have to discover how that mixture takes place ; and as there appears reason to believe that evaporation is in excess of precipitation in the Atlantic , it seems almost certain that differences in specific gravity and 632 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the ' Challenger * other causes come into play , though not very obviously .
It is most probably a phenomenon of considerable complexity .
I will not refer to the thermal conditions of the eastern trough of the Atlantic at present ; they are somewhat different , and will require separate illustrations after we have recrossed the basin , which we hope to do in the next six weeks .
To recapitulate the general facts and conclusions with regard to the distribution of ocean temperatures in the western trough of the Atlantic , it seems to me:\#151 ; 1 .
That this trough ( and the Atlantic as a whole ) must be regarded in the light of an inlet or gulf of the general ocean of the " water hemisphere , " opening directly from the " Southern Sea .
" 2 .
That the water of the Southern Sea simply wells up into the Atlantic , and that all the temperature bands of the Western Atlantic are essentially continuous with like temperature bands in the Southern Sea , with these modifications :\#151 ; that ( a ) above a certain line , which may be roughly represented by the isothermobathic lines of 5 ' and 4 ' C. , the temperature of the water is manifestly affected by direet radiation and by the very complicated effects , direct and indirect , of wind-currents ; and ( b ) that the whole mass of under-water gradually and uniformly rises in temperature towards the head of the gulf .
3 .
That water at any given temperature ( below 4 ' C. ) can only occur in the Atlantic where there is a direct communication with the zone of water at the same temperature in the Southern Sea without the intervention of any continuous barrier .
( The actual result of the present arrangement of such barriers is , that , however great the depth may be , no water at a temperature lower than 1'*3 is found to the north of the equator , and no water below the freezing-point in any part of the trough except in the depression already described between the mouth of the River Plate and Tristan d'Acunha .
) 4 .
That the water of the Atlantic is not sensibly affected in temperature by any cold indraught from the Arctic Sea .
( I purposely neglect the Labrador current and the small branch of the Spitzbergen current ; for these certainly do not sensibly affect the general temperatures of the North Atlantic .
) 5 .
That although there is a considerable flow of surface-water through the influence of wind-currents from the Atlantic into the Southern Sea , that flow does not seem to be sufficient to balance the influx into the basin of the Atlantic ( the constant influx being proved by the maintenance of a general uniformity in the course of the isothermobathic lines , and by the maintenance in all the .
secondary basins of the minimum temperature due to the height of their respective barriers ) ; that for several reasons ( the lower barometric pressure and the supposed greater amount of rainfall in the Southern Sea , the higher specific gravity at the surface than at greater from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
633 depths in the Atlantic , the higher specific gravity of the surface-water in the Atlantic to the north than to the south of the equator ) , it is probable that the general circulation is kept up chiefly by an excess of evaporation in the region of the North Atlantic , balancing a corresponding excess of precipitation over evaporation in the water hemisphere .
Determinations of the specific gravity of the surface-water have been made daily .
The mean of these for the section between ( Stations 323 and 335 , the temperature reduced to 150-56 C. , is 1-02620 .
Of the eighteen days occupied in running the section nine were dry and fine , and on nine rain fell either continuously or in showers .
The mean for the nine dry days is 1-02639 , and for the nine wet days 1*02591 .
The maximum surface specific gravity for the section ( 1-02680 ) was at Station 323 , at the point where probably the Brazil current has most effect on the surface , and the minimum ( 1-02494 ) was at Station 326 after a heavy fall of rain .
The mean specific gravity of the surface-water at the temperature at which it was procured was 1-02502 .
The specific gravity of the bottom-water was determined at ten stations on the section .
Reduced to a temperature of 15'-56 C. , the mean was 1-02601 ; the maximum , 1*02650 , was at Station 323 at a depth of 1900 fathoms ; and the minimum , 1-02580 , was at Station 326 at 2775 fathoms .
The mean specific gravity of the bottom-water at the depth at which it was procured was 1-02811 , showing a difference between the two means of 0-00210 , due to difference of temperature alone .
It seems from these observations that the differences of surface specific gravity due to differences of salinity along the section are very small , and that , with the exception possibly of station 323 , which is abnormal in many respects , they depend mainly on the rainfall .
The difference between the mean surface specific gravity , the temperature reduced to 15'-56 C. , and the mean bottom specific gravity under the same conditions is also very slight ; the actual specific gravity at every point is practically determined by the temperature ; and consequently the bands of equal density are , like the bands of equal temperature , virtually continuous with those of the Southern Sea .
There seems to be little doubt that the specific gravity of the surface-water is considerably higher in the North Atlantic than it is on the present section .
On one section between Teneriffe and Sombrero , in 1873 , Mr. Buchanan found the mean specific gravity at the surface ( the temperature reduced to 15'-56 C. ) to be nearly 1-02760 ; from the surface it fell rapidly to 1-0260 , at a depth of about 600 fathoms , after which it remained nearly the same to the bottom .
Throughout the whole of this section the trawling-operations ha\e been singularly unsuccessful .
Out of ten trials in depths o\ei 1000 fathoms only four produced any thing like satisfactory results ; and this was the more unaccountable , as the comparatively moderate depths oi most of them were such as usually to make the process almost cextaiu .
634 Prof. W. Thomson on the Voyage of the ' Challenger* In many cases , however , even when the line parted or the trawl came up foul , fragments sufficient were preserved to show that the fauna of the region was by no means deficient .
The first successful trawl was at a depth of 600 fathoms , on the edge of the South-American plateau .
As at most places where we have had a fair opportunity of working at such depths , the number of species procured was very large .
Sponges were abundant , including a large number of corticate forms , and several specimens of a species of the fine hexactinellid genus Bossella , identical with or very closely allied to antarctica , so common at Kerguelen .
I have already referred to the large Pennatulids and to the remarkable corals belonging to the family Stylastericlce , a group which Mr. Moseley , in an important paper which I beg to submit along with this , has determined to belong , with the Milleporidce , to the Hvdbozoa , and not to the Anthozoa , as previously supposed .
All the orders of Echinodermata were well represented .
Bryozoa were abundant , and included fine masses of Tubulijpora , and Cellepora , such as are found in like depths off the west coast of Ireland .
Numerous crustaceans occurred , among them large species of Arcturus , of Gammarus , and of other genera , recalling the northern crustaceous fauna , along with species of Serolis and markedly southern Schizopods .
Mollusca were , as usual , few ; there were two or three fishes of deepwater types .
The next trawlijig-station was on the 28th of Eebruary in 1900 fathoms ( No. 323 ) ; the number of species was not so great as on the previous occasion , but the different groups were fairly represented .
We got here a single stem only of Bhizocrinus lofotensis , one of the rare crinoids belonging to the Apiocrinidae .
We have been unfortunate in never having found perfect specimens of this pretty little species , although fragments have come up frequently at widely separated stations .
Bryozoa were abundant , of more characteristic deep-water types than on the last occasion .
There were two species of deep-water fishes belonging to the Macruridse .
At Station 325 the depth was 2650 fathoms , and the number of species procured was , as I have already mentioned , unusually large for so great a depth .
The assembly of forms was of the usual deep-sea character .
There were a considerable number of species of Fungicc symmetrica , a generally distributed deep-sea coral ; and the specimens at this station were of a much larger size than we had previously met with .
There were many Echinoderms , including several species of a singular group of Holothuridse , allied in some respects to Psolus , which we find widely distributed at great depths ; they are principally characterized by an almost continuous calcareous plating , which runs out over long , tubular , spine-like appendages .
The next three trawlings were unsuccessful ; and at Station 335 , on the 16th of March , we determined to try a large light dredge .
This was from the Falkland Islands to Monte .
dragged along the bottom freely for a considerable distance ; and although the number of species procured was small , we thought ourselves fortunate in securing fine examples of Oidaris varispinci .

At Station 318 the trawl did not reach the bottom .
At Stations 331 , 332 , 333 , and 334 the trawl came up foul , and fragments of animals only were got adhering to the net .
At Station 235 a large dredge was used .
It has not of course been possible to determine the species in detail ; but the general characteristic of the fauna throughout the section is much the same as we have found almost invariably at like depths in temperate regions .
The general assemblage certainly tends to confirm me in the opinion that the distribution of the deep-sea fauna mainly sets from the Southern Sea into the Atlantic .
I beg leave to report that the departments under my charge are in a satisfactory condition .
I hope to have an opportunity of sending from 636 On the , Voyage from the Falkland Islands to Monte Video .
