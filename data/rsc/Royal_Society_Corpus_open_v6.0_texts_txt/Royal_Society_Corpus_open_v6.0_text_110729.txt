A paper was read , entitled , ' &lt; Miscellaneous Observations on the Torpedo .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. The experiments described in this paper were made on a single fish , of middle size , recently taken out of the water .
Portions of the electrical organs , cut transversely in thin slices , exhibited under the microscope many elliptical particles , apparently blood-cor ?
puscles , the long diameter of which was about 1-800th , and the short about 1-1000th of an inch , and a few filaments , apparently nervous , irregularly scattered ; some of them tortuous , and all about the 2000th of an inch in diameter .
The latter bore no resemblance to muscular fibres .
The blood contained some globular particles , having a diameter of the 4000th of an inch , mixed with the elliptical .
The mucus for lubricating the surface was found to contain globules apparently homogeneous in substance , but of irregular outline , and in size varying from the 2000th to the 270th ofan inch .
