" On / S-Lutidine " By C. Greyille Williams , F.R.S. Received November 30 , 1881 .
In the " Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Paris " for June 5 , 1880 there appears a notice of a paper read before the Russian Chemical Society , by MM .
Boutlerow and Wischnegradsky , m which they state , amono- other things , that by the action of alkalies on cinchonine they had obtained quinoline ( chinoline ) almost pure , and a volatile colourless liquid alkaloid boiling constantly at 166 ' , having the formula C'H9N ; and which they say appears to be identical with the base obtained by me in distilling cinchonine with potash , and also with the lutidine of Anderson .
Of the identity of the base obtained by them with / 3-luti-dine there can be no doubt ; the boiling point ( 166 ' ) given by them being to half a degree the mean of the range ( 163 ' to 168 ' ) given by me in my " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids."* With regard to the identity which they assume between lutidine and jS-lutidine , it is evident that they have not seen my paper last quoted , or they would hardly have ignored the mass of facts which I have adduced to prove the isomerism , and not identity of the two bases .
In the " Bulletin of the Chemical Society " of Paris , Nos. 5 and 9 , for September 5 , 1880 , p. 210 , M. W. Oechsner de Coninck publishes an investigation on the lutidine , collidine , and parvoline obtained as aboi e from cinchonine ; his only reference to my work being to the " Ann. Chim .

, " xlv , p. 488 , + in which he says that I have shown the presence of a base possessing the composition of lutidine .
He then proceeds to give analyses , density , and vapour-densities of / 3-lutidine , apparently unaware that they were simply repetitions of what I had done many years before .
I gave the analysis of the base and the platinum salt in the " Trans. Roy .

I also gave the analyses of the platinum salt of collidine in the same paper .
The specific gravity of / 3-lutidine at 0 ' was given by me in my " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids " as 0'9555 ; M. de Coninck makes it 095035 at the same temperature .
M. de Coninck gives the vapour-density as determined in Von Meyer 's apparatus as 3-80 ; I gave it as 3'65 in two experiments exactly agreeing with each other , and also made in Von Meyer 's apparatus .

[ Dec. 15 , from cinchonine is modified by hot water , losing two molecules of hydrochloric acid .
The extraordinary difference between the decom-posability of the platinum salts of lutidine and / 3-lutidine on boiling with water with evolution of hydrochloric acid , was one of the numerous illustrations of the isomerism of the two bases which I adduced in my " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids " seventeen years ago .
The tone of M. de Coninck 's paper shows that he believes his results to be entirely new .
I mention the above facts partly because they are facts , but , chiefly as showing that other chemists are working on / 3-lutidine , and that it therefore becomes necessary to publish my more recent experiments somewhat earlier than I should otherwise have done .
The preparation of / 3-lutidine in a state of purity is a work of much labour .
On distilling cinchonine with hydrate of potassium a mixture of at least ten alkaloids is obtained , and the / 3-lutidine has to be separated by fractional distillation .
I have , however , prepared for the purposes of this investigation probably the largest quantity of the base that has yet been obtained\#151 ; rather more than half a pint .
Action of Sodium upon I found that by the action of sodium upon chinoline it became polymerised with the formation of a body having the composition of dichinoline .
This substance forms a crystalline hydrochlorate , having , when freshly prepared , a magnificent scarlet colour.* The hydrochlorate of dichinoline dyes silk a brilliant but fugitive orange colour .
This reaction , namely , the formation of a coloured hydrochlorate from a colourless oily base , being probably unique , it became desirable to ascertain how / 3-lutidine would behave under similar circumstances .
Fragments of sodium were added to / 3-lutidine in the cold ; they acquired a brilliant yellow colour , and had exactly the appearance of pieces of metallic gold .
The mixture was then warmed until the sodium melted , it was then removed from the lamp .
A violent reaction ensued , and the whole turned greenish-black by reflected light , and yellowish-brown by transmitted light .
The product was left until the next day , and was then boiled for five minutes ; it thickened , and , on being poured into water , yielded a heavy brown oil .
No pyrrol was formed .
Excess of hydrochloric acid being added , the oil dissolved , forming a brown solution ; this was fractionally precipitated with solution of platinic chloride .
Six precipitates were obtained ; the first was pale brown , the second fawn-coloured , the third a paler fawn , the fourth Naples yellow , the fifth sulphur-yellow .
The last only was distinctly crystalline under the lens .
If put in a wet state into the water-oven they melt , but , if first dried over * " Chemical News , " March 1 , 1878 ; " Proc. Hoy .

The platinum was determined separately in the first four precipitates ; the fifth and sixth were so small in quantity that they had to be mixed .

25- 28 24-82 26- 40 27- 57 30-28 The second precipitate , in its percentage of platinum , agrees with the formula for the platinum salt of the hydrochlorate of dibetaluti-dine containing two molecules of dibetalutidine , the formula being\#151 ; 2(C14H18N3)HCl .

I II III IV Y and VI whichever formula we adopt , the percentage of platinum required is 24-61 , which agrees closely with the experimental number .
The other precipitates were probably mixtures of this salt with the platinum salt of dibetalutidine\#151 ; Q14H18N2.HCl .
PtCl4 , which requires 33'53 per cent , of platinum .
A second preparation was then made , but the oil obtained on treating the crude product with water was distilled ; the boiling point varied from 180 ' C. to a temperature above the range of the mercurial thermometer .
Four fractions were received , the fourth , which distilled at and above 800 ' , was dissolved in hydrochloric acid , and fractionally precipitated with platinic chloride .

It is possible that the fourth precipitate had the composition shown by the formula C14Hl8N3.3HCl .
PtCl4 , which would require 29'84 per cent , of platinum ; I propose to settle this question by further experiments .
162 Mr. C. G. Williams .
[ Dec. 15 , During the precipitation of the platinum salts from the distilled base the solution became of a brilliant but fugitive scarlet colour .
It is evident from the above numbers that the oil of high boiling point had the same general character as the crude mixture first examined .
Sodium amalgam , although it so readily polymerises chinoline , * was found to be almost without action on / 3-lutidine .
The action of sodium was then tried upon / 3-lutidine dissolved in toluene ; two products were obtained , one solid , the other liquid .
The solid substance on being dissolved in hydrochloric acid , and fractionally precipitated as before , gave two precipitates .

30-69 The results , while proving that / 3-lutidine is polymerised by the-action of sodium , show also that at least two substances are formed , , and that separation is not easily effected by fractional precipitation with platinic chloride .
It will be seen that the second precipitate from the hydrochlorate of the solid base gave for the platinum a number almost exactly agreeing with that required for the platinum salt of dibetalutidine C14H18N3.HClPtCl4 , which requires 33*53 per cent , of platinum .
Compound of fi-Lutidine w Nitrate of Silver .
I have shown in my paper " Researches on Isomeric Alkaloids , " f that / 3-lutidine combines directly with platinic chloride ; it does the same with nitrate of silver .
When / 3-lutidine is added to an aqueous solution of nitrate of silver , a white curdy precipitate is thrown down , it dissolves in alcohol , and is reprecipitated by water as a glittering mass of snow-white crystals .
These latter crystallise readily from alcohol in beautiful stellar groups .

On Effect of the [ Dec. 15r Picrate of fi-Lutidine .
When / 3-lutidine is added to a strong boiling solution of picric acid most of the salt formed settles out as an oil , owing to its insolubility and fusibility , but it becomes a solid crystalline mass on cooling .
On redissolving the solid in boiling water , and allowing the solution to cool , the vessel becomes filled with brilliant yellow needles .

Action of Chlorine on ^-Lutidin of Iodine .
The chlorination of / 3-lutidine was effected by Hugo Muller 's method ; for this purpose iodine was added to the alkaloid , the mixture was heated to 100 ' , and a current of chlorine was passed through until complete saturation .
The product was a dark reddish-brown fluid , which was distilled .
The portion boiling below 220 ' was washed with a dilute solution of hydrate of sodium , and then treated with hydrochloric acid , a viscid green substance of peculiar odour remained undissolved .
On adding solution of platinic chloride to the filtered liquid , a granular precipitate was obtained ; it was washed , dried , and the percentage of platinum determined : it amounted to 23'49 per cent. The formula 2(C7H6Cl ' ?
N.HCl)PtCl4 requires 23-74 .
This result shows that the product is a trichlorinated / 3-lutidine retaining the basic properties of the original alkaloid .
