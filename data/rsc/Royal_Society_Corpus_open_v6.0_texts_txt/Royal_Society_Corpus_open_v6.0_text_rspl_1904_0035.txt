) The object of the experiments , of which an account is given in thi paper , was to determine whether the atomic heats of the element entering into combination are preserved in the compound at al temperatures , previous results obtained by the author and other* having shown that the specific heats of metals of small atomic weight such as aluminium , increase very rapidly with rise of temperature .
As it is not possible to determine the specific heat of sulphui throughout a long range of temperature , tellurium was chosen for experiment .
Compounds of tin , silver and nickel with tellurium were prepared , and two alloys of silver and aluminium .
The average specific heats of all these elements , except tin , were determined ovei various intervals from the boiling point of liquid oxygen to nearly 500 C. in the case of the less fusible elements , a range of about 680 C. From these mean specific heats the true specific heats at intervals of 100 Centigrade degrees absolute temperature were calculated , and from the specific heats the atomic heats were deduced .
The mean specific heats of the compounds , formed by their union , were also determined , and from these data the moelcular heats of the compounds calculated .
On comparing the sum of the atomic heats of the elements present with the molecular heat of the compound at the successive temperatures , it was found that there is throughout a close concordance .
Ihe order of difference may be shown by one example\#151 ; Nickel Telluride , NiTe .

They thus support the view that the specific heat of q4 ] On the Temperature Classification of Stars .

Historical Review .
PAGE In my first Bakerian Lecture in 1873 I dealt with the question of he spectra of stars , and pointed out that the facts accumulated up to hat time by Rutherford and others led to the view that in the eversing layers of the sun and stars various degrees of dissociation are it work .
_ I also suggested that the stellar evidence indicated that one of the r esults of dissociation temperatures could be to " prevent the coming together of atoms which at the temperature of the earth , and at a artificial temperatures yet obtained here , compose the metals , the metalloids , and compounds."* In a subsequent communication to the Paris Academy I wiote , t u II semble que plus un etoile est chaude plus son spectre est simple , et que les elements metalliques se font voir dans l orclre de leuis poids atomiques .
" This last generalisation rested upon the great preponderance of hydrogen in certain stars , which I classed as hottest on the gi ound that the blue end of the spectrum was open .
