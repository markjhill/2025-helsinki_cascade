To CHARLES BLAGDEN , M. D. Sec. R. S. DEAR SIR IN a Paper on the Chronology of the HINDOOS , which the Society did me the honour to pritlt in the LXXXth Volulne of their Transactions , I have said ( p. S66 and 570 ) that the era of Bikrolmajit comlmences in the year 56 before Christ , and that the year 1846 corresponds with our year 1790 ( from April ) : but it appears from an examination of the nutubers of an original Benares allnanack , that I have calculated the elapsed time of that er-a one year short ( by comparison with the era of Salab in , xrllicl1 being employed in astronomical computations is sufficiently ascertained ) , and that the year 184,7 not 184,6 &gt; bsh-ould correspond with 1790 , and the columencement of the era with the year 57 before Christ , both from April .
I tdS very desirous that this trror should be noticed as soon as possible , and request that the correction may have a place in the Volume now printiIlgo I am , dear Sir , &amp; ce WM .
M4RSDEN .
