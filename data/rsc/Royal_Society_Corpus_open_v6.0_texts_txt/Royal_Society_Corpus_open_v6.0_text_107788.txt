On the reduction to a vacuum of Captain KATER'S convertible pendulum .
By Captain EDWARD SABINE , of the Royal Artillery , Secretary to the Royal Society .
Read June 18 , 1829 .
THE convertible pendulum with which Captain KATER made his celebrated and very admirable experiments , on the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in vacuo in Portland Place , was deposited , after the completion of those experiments , in the cabinet of the Royal Society .
The experiments of Captain KATER were made , as is well known , in the free air of the ordinary atmosphere ; and the influence of the air in retarding the vibrations , and thereby interfering with the simple effect of the earth 's attraction on the pendulum , was computed and allowed for on a principle universally received by mathematicians and experimentalists at that period .
It has been shown by recent investigations , theoretical and experimental , that the principle on which the reduction to a vacuum was then computed is erroneous : and it is a consequence of those investigations , that further experiments are necessary with the convertible pendulum employed by Captain KATER , in order that the true vibration in a vacuum , corresponding to the distance between its knife edges , may be known ; and that the more correct length of the seconds pendulum , such as Captain KATER would himself have determined it had he been aware in 1817 of what has subsequently been discovered , may be substituted for the result published by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818 .
The apparatus , of which an account has been presented to the Society in the present'session , in which pendulums can be vibrated both in air of ordinary density and in a highly rarefied medium approaching to a vacuum , affords the means of making these further experiments .
At the wish of Captain KATER , and in compliance with a request of the council of the Royal Society , I have undertaken to make them ; and hope , at the commencement of the next session , 2u 2 to present to the Society the result which shall be obtained , as the result of Captain KATER'S pendulum .
From the principles developed in the recent investigation into the action of the air on the vibrations of a pendulum , it was to be inferred that a convertible pendulum , such as the one Captain KATER employed , would in two respects be affected by the medium in a different manner from that which he had supposed : namely , first , in respect to its presumed convertibility ; for , since the amount of the retardation occasioned by the air is dependent in part on the external figure of the body vibrating , and as the two ends of the pendulum are not symmetrical , the one being furnished with a large weight , and the other with a much smaller weight and of a different form , the reduction to a vacuum will not be ofn the same amount ndhen the pendulum is suspended ith the great weih uppermost , as when suspended with the great weight below ; and consequently the pendulum is erroneously supposed to be convertible when the vibrations in air are identical .
And second , in respect to the amount of the retardation produced by the air , which would be considerably greater than the quantity computed on the simple consideration of buoyancy .
The experiments that have already been made with this pendulum in the vacuum apparatus , both in the state in which Captain KATER constructed and employed the pendulum , and with certain alterations which I have found it expedient to make in its tail pieces , have fully confirmed these inferences ; and in the opinion of those whose judgement I have reason to respect , possess an interest in the elucidation , and further experimental illustration of the imode in which a medium acts on the pendulum in retarding its vibration , which makes it desirable that I should communicate the present brief account of them to the Society before the recess .
The pendulum having been conveyed to Greenwich , was examined and found in excellent order ; the knife edges were as clean and apparently as perfect as when first used ; the smaller weight was well secured by its screws , and the slider was at 18.6 divisions towards the greater weight : the rate of vibration on each of the knife edges was then tried by a few coincidences , and found so nearly identical , as to make it probable that little or no alteration had been made in the positions of the weight and slider since Captain KATER'S experiments : and as the reduction to a vacuum for each position of the pendulum , 332 which was the present object of inquiry , did not require that the convertibility should be very rigorously established , the following experiments were made to determine the comparative rate , in air of ordinary density , and in highly rarefied air ; first with the great weight below ; and second , with the great weight uppermost .

; the temperature of the air of full pressure being 49.35 , and that of the rarefied medium 49.9 .
From these results we obtain 15.7 vibrations per diem as the reduction to a vacuum for the convertible pendulum , as it was used by Captain KATER , vibrating with the great weight below , in air of 49 , under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury at 320 ; and 16.1 vibrations per diem , when inverted , or with the great weight uppermost , in air of like temperature and density .
According to the formula by which Captain KATER reduced the vibrations of this pendulum in air to the supposed vibrations in a vacuum , the reduction for each position of the pendulum would be the same , and the amount for air of the named temperature and density would have a little exceeded 7 vibrations per diem .
In the account of Captain KATER'S experiments ( Phil. Trans. 1818 , page 75 ) it is remarked that on a sudden and considerable change having taken place in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere , vibrations which had been previously identical in each position of the pendulum ceased to be so ; an effect which he attributed to an alteration in the weight of the wooden extremities of the pendulum by their loss of moisture as the weather became more dry .
As we now know that the general effect of the air in retarding the vibration is more than twice as great as was then imagined , and that the wooden tail pieces , in consequence of their position , have a far greater proportionate influence on the retardation than would be simply due to the diminution which they occasion in the general specific gravity of the pendulum , we perceive increased reason to agree with Captain KATER , and to apprehend so much danger of derangement from this cause , as to make it desirable to avoid altogether the employment of a material susceptible of changes from moisture .
For this reason I determined to substitute tail pieces of brass , with such an alteration in the position or size of the smaller weight as should re-establish the equality of vibration .
Previously , however , to this being done , and for the purpose of illustrating more strongly the effect of the wooden tail pieces , I had then reduced to less than half their original length , 10.6 inches being taken off from each , leaving them 6.4 inches from the extremity of the brass bar .
By substituting a still smaller weight ( of 1925 grains ) of the same inetal and form , for the smallest weight used by Captain KATER ( of 3325 grains ) , and securing it very nearly in the same position , the pendulum was again rendered nearly convertible , and experiments were made with it in the same succession as before , of which the following are the results .
With the great weight below , there was found a difference of 11.9 vibrations per diem , corresponding to a difference of atmospheric pressure of 28.741 inches of mercury at 320 , the temperature of the air of full pressure being 53.2 , and of the rarefied air 53.8 .
And with the great weight uppermost a difference of 14 vibrations per diem , corresponding to a difference of 28.15 inches of mercury at 32 ?
, the temperature of the air of full pressure being 51.4 , and of the rarefied air 53.8 .
Whence we obtain 12.4 vibrations per diem as the reduction to a vacuum , when the wooden tail pieces were shortened from 17 inches to 6.4 inches , and the great weight was below , in air of 53 ?
.5 , under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury at 32 ?
; and 14.9 vibrations per diem with the great weight uppermost , in air of the same temperature and density .
The wooden tail pieces were then altogether removed , and slips of brass substituted , extending 7 inches from each extremity of the bar .
The pendulum 336 was rendered convertible in air by the small weight used by Captain KATER , screwed to the bar at a somewhat greater distance from its knife edge than in his experiments ; and coincidences being observed in the usual routine , it appeared that with the great weight below , a difference took place of 11.3 vibrations per diem , corresponding to a difference of atmospheric pressure of 28.46 inches of air at 32 ?
, the temperature of the air of full pressure being 58 ?
, and of the rarefied air 55 ?
.5 : and with the great weight uppermost , a difference of 12 vibrations per diem , corresponding to a difference of atmospheric pressure of 28.04 inches of air at 32 ?
, the temperature of the air of full pressure being 60 ?
, and of the rarefied air 60 ?
.5 .
Whence we obtain when the great weight is below , 11.8 vibrations per diem as the reduction to a vacuum , in air of 60 ?
, under a pressure of 30 inches of mercury at 32 ?
; and 12.8 vibrations per diem when the great weight is uppermost .
Finally , recapitulating the results obtained with the different modifications of the tail pieces , we have 1 .

1.8 In comparing Nos. 1 and 2 with each other , and both with No. 3 , we perceive the very great effect which the employment of so light a material as wood for the tail pieces of the pendulum produces , in increasing the difference between the vibrations in air and those in a vacuum .
When slips of brass were substituted for the slips of deal employed by Captain KATER , the retardation caused by the air was diminished not less than between 3 and 4 vibrations per diem on the one knife edge , and upwards of 4 vibrations per diem on the other .
When the wooden tail pieces were reduced to the same length , or nearly so , as those of brass , the retardation with them was still found greater than with the brass tail pieces of similar size and figure , by 2 vibrations per diem on the one knife edge , and 1 vibration per diem on the other .
The retardations were in all cases much more considerable than would have been computed on the simple consideration of buoyancy : they were particularly so in those instances in which the extrenlities of the pendulum were of the lighter material ; for the increase in the retardation in those instances much exceeded the proportion due to the diminution of the general specific gravity of the pendulum , occasioned by the addition of the small portions of wood .
In viewing the comparative retardations in the two positions of the pendulum , in each of these experiments , we find a confirmation of the inference , noticed in the earlier part of this paper , that in consequence of the want of symmetry in the two ends , the reduction to a vacuum ought not to be the same in the two positions , of the pendulum .
We have also a curious exemplification of the influence of the addition of equal portions of matter at each extremity of the pendulum , in diminishing the difference in the retardation occasioned by the disparity in the form and size of the weights .
With the short wooden tail pieces , the difference ( which with no tail pieces at all would probably have exceeded 3 vibrations per diem ) amounted to 2.5 vibrations .
With the brass tail pieces it was lessened to 1 vibration .
And with the wooden tail pieces of their original length , the effect of the inequality of the weights was almost altogether counterbalanced , the retardation being within half a vibration the same in each position of the pendulum .
Finally , it is curious to perceive how much the result obtained by Captain KATER , as the length of the seconds pendulum , deended on the mere accidental circumstance of the addition of tail pieces to his experimental pendulum : had the circumstances of the experiment been varied in regard to the tail pieces ; had they been of brass for example ; --or being of wood , had they been of any other length than that which was determined by the accidental circumstance of the relative heights of the clock , and pendulum support ; -or had they been altogether omitted and the coincidences observed by means of the bar itself , a widely different result would in each of these cases have been arrived at .
