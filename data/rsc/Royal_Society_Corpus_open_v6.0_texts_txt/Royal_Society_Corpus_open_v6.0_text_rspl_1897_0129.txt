( 1 ) The cephalic index , when nsed to test any theory of heredity , .ssesses many merits , and at the same time one or two defects , the first place it is supposed to be a marked racial character , and erefore might be considered to be strongly inherited .
In the next ace it remains sensibly constant after two years of age ; thus the rength of inheritance can be ascertained by measurements on mng children , whose parents are more frequently alive than if we iv to wait for measurement till the offspring are of adult age .
urther , although the cephalic index requires a more trained md to measure it than some other measurements on the living ibject , the trained observer will always deduce sensibly the same \#166 ; suits ; * on the other hand , stature measurements vary sensibly ith the hour of the day , and with the observer .
The need of a loderately trained observer is the chief defect of cephalic index leasurements ; it hinders the rapid collection of numerous family leasurements ; the difficulty , further , of satisfactorily measuring the jmale head without some derangement of the toilet is a further indrance.f The merits of the cephalic index , however , as a test of eredity far surpass its demerits .
A well-organised measurement of he cephalic index in pairs of relatives would probably give the best esults available for the laws of inheritance ?
The cephalic index leasured on the living head is of course not so satisfactory as that aeasured on the skull , but the latter may be considered , even with he aid of Rontgen rays , as at present quite out of the question .
The ollowing paper has been worked out , not on very good material or m material collected with the present end in view , but on the only naterial that seemed at present available .
It suffices to justify the new that the inheritance of the cephalic index offers a most satisfac-ory method of testing the laws of heredity .
( 2 ) Owing to the kindness of Mr. Francis Galton the Department \gt ; f Applied Mathematics in University College , London , was placed in :ommunication with Dr. Franz Boas , of the American Museum of Natural History , who is well known for his elaborate system of * Tliis lias been tested by frequent measurements of the same beads .
t The recent establishment of an anthropometric laboratory at Nevrnliam College will , it may be hoped , remove the difficulty about head measurements on female students felt by the Cambridge Anthropometric Committee .

measurements on North American Indians .
With , extreme kindne ?
Dr. Boas* at once forwarded to England upwards of 1000 sheets c measurements on comparable Indian tribes .
These tribes , howeve contain extremely mixed blood .
In the fewest cases were pui Indian ancestors noted ; one of the grandparents at least exhibited a a rule European blood\#151 ; English , Dutch , French , Irish , \amp ; c. Dr. Boa himself writes : \#151 ; " I could not give you any series that was sufficiently extensiv and embraced pure Indians only , because among these tribes th determination of relationships offers peculiar difficulties .
I am afrai that your results may also bring out the looseness of famil relations .
I should not be surprised if the relation between fathe and child were much lower than that between mother and chile because often another person is actually the father of the child .
" Dr. Boas 's last surmise is amply verified ; it will be found from tli table below that the coefficient of heredity between father and son i abnormally small , while that between father and daughter is actual ] ; less than the probable error of this series of measurements !
If w\#171 ; put upon one side any purely hypothetical supposition that illegiti mate births are more likely to be female than male , there wouk seem reason to suppose some native custom by which it is held lesi discreditable to pass off a daughter than a son upon the titula husband .
It may be asked whether , if the racial mixture is so grea and the paternity so obscure , it was worth while to undertake tin lengthy arithmetiet required to determine the hereditary correla tions .
The answer is threefold : ( a ) if Galton 's law of ancestra heredity be correct , inheritance is not a racial character but a genera law of living forms , and racial mixtures will not influence the result ( 6 ) the results show that obscure paternity does not prevent gooc values being found for other relationships ; in fact , the fulfilment ol Dr. Boas 's surmise is in itself not without value , as showing how well our algebraic theory fits itself to the facts ; it might almost be said to provide a scientific measure of the conjugal fidelity of a race ; ( c ) it is always worth while to undertake an investigation on the best material available , even if it be poor material for this purpose , for it emphasizes the need of new and more elaborate observations .
... .
( 3 ) It will be seen from the table that it has only been possible determine the coefficient of heredity for small series , varying from 80 to 143 pairs of the seven relationships , four corresponding to the first degree of direct kinship and three to the first degree of collatera * It is difficult to sufficiently emphasize the disinterested service to science of men who do not " monopolise " their anthropometric measurements .
+ We have to thank Mr. Leslie Bramley Moore for much aid m extracting head measurements from the slips and calculating cephalic indices .

The probable errors are , as might be expected from su\lt ; small series , large .
Putting aside the paternal relationship , we a justified in drawing certain general conclusions , which may be tli summed up :\#151 ; ( a ) The coefficients of heredity , as determined from the cephal index , differ in all cases from those determined for stature by le than their probable error , and therefore by less than the probab error of their difference .
The stature coefficients were obtained f( the English middle classes.* We thus conclude that these resul confirm Galton 's law , in so far as they tend to show that the strong of inheritance is not a character of race or organ .
Cephalic index is clearly not more strongly inherited than statur Its variability is also very much that of stature .
It is according difficult to see why it should be considered as peculiarly a raci ; character .
( b ) The divergences between the observed values for the coeff cients of inheritance for the cephalic index , and the theoretical value obtained on the basis of Galton 's law of ancestral heredity , ai greater than the divergences between the former and the coefficieni for stature.f They do not , however , exceed the limits of errors c observation .
In the case of mothers and sons the divergence i very slightly above the probable error ; the observed and theoretic !
values are identical in the case of mothers and daughters ; they ai less than the probable error for brothers and brothers and on slightly larger than it for brothers and sisters ; for sisters and sister the divergence is about one and a half times the probable erroi The mean weighted values of the coefficients for direct and collatera kinship are 03366 and 04004 , the former differing by less than hal its probable error from the theoretical value 03000 , and the latte sensibly identical with its theoretical value , 04000 .
We conclude , therefore , that Galton 's law of ancestral her edit-gives values for the inheritance within the limits of the prcbabi errors of observation .
But , ( c ) As in the case of stature there is , on the whole , a tendency o the coefficients for cephalic index to be somewhat greater than then values as given by Galton 's law .
It is therefore reasonable to suppose that the heredity constant 7 ( introduced in the foregoing papei " On the Law of Ancestral Heredity " ) is not , as Mr. Galton takes it unity , but has some slightly less value .
Other conclusions which may be drawn from the above table are : ( d ) Among Indians of mixed blood the women are more brachy* 'Phil .

This is in accordance with e general conclusion reached in a paper on " Variation in Man and oman , " # namely : " The lower races give ns results in sensible accordance with those j have drawn from the data for ancient civilisations , namely , the omen are on the whole more br achy cephalic and slightly more , riable than the men .
" ( e ) The younger generation is more brachycephalic and more unable than its parentage .
The whole of this difference can hardly be due to any change of ape of the skull with old age , for the majority cf parents had in is case not passed the prime of life .
It may be due to ( i ) a corre-tion between dolichocephaly and fertility or between dolichocephaly id philogamy , or ( ii ) more probably to the action of natural lection ( results obtained , but not yet published , by the present liters show a correlation between physique and cephalic index ) , .
( iii ) to a greater or less admixture of white blood in the younger jneration .
( / ) Parents of sons are significantly less variable than parents of iughters .
This is in accordance with the result previously ob-ined that mediocre fathers are likely to have sons , !
but disagrees ith the result for stature\#151 ; based on a far smaller probability\#151 ; that '.ediocre mothers are likely to have daughters .
The conclusions of this paper , while appearing to the writers of iterest , are to be taken , in the first place , as suggestions for much larger iries of measurements and for new lines of investigation .

] In a previous paper read before the Society on April 8 , 1897 , I uggested that the special lines present in spectra of the first iivision of helium stars ( Type I , Divison la ) might possibly be clue to xygen .
These stars are associated by their position and distribu-ion with the gaseous nebulae , and some of the lines in their spectra orrespond with bright lines observed by Campbell in nebulae .
The iuggestion from this was that these stars are in the first stage of itellar development from gaseous nebulae .
