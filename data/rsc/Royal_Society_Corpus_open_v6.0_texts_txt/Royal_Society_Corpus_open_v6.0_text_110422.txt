" On the Nature and Origin of the Aurora Borealis .
" By the Rev. George Fisher , M.A. , F.R.S. The author deduces from his own observations made during a residence of two winters in high northern latitudes , taken in conjunction with the concurring testimony of various navigators and travellers , the general fact that the Aurora Borealis is developed chiefly at the edge of the Frozen Sea , or wherever there is a vast accumu ?
lation of ice ; and he conceives that it is produced in situations where the vapours of a humid atmosphere are undergoing rapid congelation .
Under these circumstances , when viewed from a distance , it is seen fringing the upper border of the dark clouds , termed the " sea blink , " which collect over these places ; and it generally forms an arch a few degrees above the horizon , shooting out vertical columns of pale yellow light .
He concludes that the Aurora Borealis is an electrical phenomenon , arising from the positive electricity of the atmosphere , developed by the rapid condensation of the vapour in the act of freezing , and the induced negative electricity of the surrounding portions of the atmosphere ; and that it is the immediate consequence of the restoration of the electrical equilibrium by the intervention ot the frozen particles , which being imperfect conductors , become lumi ?
nous while transmitting this electricity .
In tropical and temperate climates this phenomenon does not occur , because the electric equilibrium is restored by means of aqueous vapours , a process which often gives rise to thunder and lightning , but never to the Aurora Borealis ; the latter being peculiar to clear , cold and dry weather .
