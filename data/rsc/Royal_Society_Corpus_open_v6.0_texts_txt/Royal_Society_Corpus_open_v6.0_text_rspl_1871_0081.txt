Xuoland not azoditolyldiamine , the latter , as before , still remaining to be discovered .
Since , in consequence of the operations just mentioned , we had in our possession an appreciable quantity of the diazo body , we were not willing to pass by this opportunity of testing , however cursorily , its action on aromatic monamines .
Dyes are in fact produced by treating di-azoamidotoluol with the chlorhydrates of aniline and naphthylamine in alcoholic solution at 150 ' C. The numerous by-products , however , which are formed in these processes sufficiently show that the reaction is by no means a simple one- It is more particularly worthy of remark that in its reaction with aniline salts no trace of the easily recognizable rosaniline was formed , which might have been the case if the true azoditolyldiamine could have been employed .
We have not further studied the products generated in these reactions .

( Abstract .
) The rapidly accelerating value within the last few years of the annual decrease of the westerly magnetic declination over the whole area of the United Kingdom and the adjacent seas , as .
observed at the fixed magnetic observatories of Greenwich , Kew , Brussels , Paris , and also at Christiania in Norway , is a subject of importance in practical navigation as affecting the compass-bearings derived from charts and those laid down for the guidance of pilots .
The attention of the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty ha* been constantly directed to this interesting physical fact ; and as the duties of Her Majesty 's surveying-vessels employed on our shores between the years 1866 and 1870 embraced nearly the whole extent of coast-line , advantage was thus taken , undert^he orders of Rear-Admiral Richards , C.B. , F.R.S. , the Hydrographer , to determine , with great attention to accuracy , the magnetic declination at widely spread and favourable localities .
The observations thus made by the surveying officers of Her Majesty s Navy are given in detail , with the corrections for secular change , to the 1st January 1872* , for which epoch a chart of the British Islands , exhibiting the lines of magnetic declination of equal value , is also appended .
By comparing these lines with the corresponding lines given in the Decimal00 chart for 1842*5 , Phil. Trans , for 1870 , art .

, " by General Sir Edward Sabine , K.C.B. , and President of the Royal Society , the annual decrease of the westerly declination , in the interval 29 oyears , over various geographical districts is thus shown :\#151 ; Shetland Islands and N.E coast of Scotland , between 60th and 56th parallels ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 8'24 East coast of England , between 56th and 51st parallels ... .

6'26 It is thus seen that in the area included by the shores of the United Kingdom the change was greater on the eastern than on the western side ; as also that in the higher parallels of latitude of this area the change wras greater than in the lower parallels .
By a farther comparison of results as observed within the last ten to twelve years , at the same stations within the same geographical districts , the following approximate values of the present rate of annual change ( westerly declination decreasing ) are obtained :\#151 ; Shetland Islands and N.E. coast of Scotland . .
