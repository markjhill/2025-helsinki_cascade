486 Effective Scour inDrainApipes .
Presents[Mar .
28 , investigation of the behaviour of gases through which electric discharges are passing .
It will be interesting to follow out the investigation , especially with a view of examining the influence of sun-spot variation .
The question of magnetic disturbances is more complicated , but as mag-netical observatories are being established in many countries , the time may not be far distant when we shall be able to bring the irregular disturbances within the reach of calculation .
In , order to facilitate the necessarily long computations , the author makes an appeal to the heads of magnetic observatories to reduce the regular variation according to the method adopted by Wild at St ' Petersburg , or that in use at Greenwich , the -two being nearly identical .
The variations should also be reduced to the geographical coordinates , instead of to magnetic coordinates .
The author acknowledges the help he has received from Mr. William Ellis in some of the reductions ; he has also to thank his assistant , Mr. A. Stanton , for much labour bestowed on making and checking numerical calculations .
