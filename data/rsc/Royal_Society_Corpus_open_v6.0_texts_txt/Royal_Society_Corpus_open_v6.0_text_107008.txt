Observations of the diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Needle at Fort Marlborough , in the Island of Sumatra .
By John Macdonald , Esq. In a Letter to John Crisp , Esq. F. R. S. Read April 21 , 1796 .
DEAR SIR , Fort Marlborough , i ; th Murch , 1795 .
I HAVE now the satisfaction to transmit to you the observations of the diurnal variation of the variation of the magnetic needle , with which you wished to be furnished .
A short account of the mode used in laying off the meridian is prefixed .
A small building , devoid of iron , was erected at some distance from-my house .
This building contained the meridian .
By repeated observations , I found the sphere of mutual attraction of the needle and iron to be very small ; a common-sized key presented to it , did not affect it at a nearer distance than A inches .
To exclude every influence of iron , I laid aside such as might be about me , previous to the taking of the observations , and took care to remove the padlock and key , at the same time , to a certain distance from the constructure .
The hasp and staple made use of for the padlock were of wood ; and for the nocturnal observations , I had wooden candlesticks made .
I may venture to say , that the observations were taken with the utmost care ; and that every requisite precaution was used to , exclude errors that might have arisen from a want of minute attention ; The observations contained in pages 346 , 347 , and 348 , were taken by applying the magnet-box three times , each day , to the meridian .
This was , I think , accurately effected , by hairs fixed longitudinally on the inside of the box , corresponding with projecting points on the outside .
When these covered each other , and the meridian , to the eye look- .
ing through a magnifying glass from above , there was a strong presumption that the longitudinal axis and o ?
points of the box were on and in the true plane of the meridian .
In reading off , the right hand covered the .
right eye ; a magnifying glass , of a power of 2- , was held in the left hand ; the upper axis-hair was brought to cover the o0 point ; and the eye , hanging over this point , glanced steadily to the left , to read off the variation west from south as the fine minute-scale was placed on the flat south end of the needle .
This observation was taken each time four times , to ensure accuracy .
Lest , however , any error might have arisen from not placing the box accurately in the same situation , in taking the three daily observations , two pieces of seasoned wood were fixed with wooden pins , nearly parallel to the meridian.- , on either side .
The magnet-box was applied to the meridian between these , and kept firmly fixed in its position by a number of small wooden wedges , urged gently between the box and the lateral fixtures .
The observations contained in page 349 were taken with the magnet thus fixed .
A fourth column of observations , at various nocturnal hours , is given in page 349 .
A corresponds ing thermometrical observation is attached to each magnetic one .
The thermometer was placed in the room on the left side of my hall .
It appears from these observations , that the east variation diurnal Variatiott diurnal of the variation , increased from about 7 in the morning till 5 in the afternoon , and that it decreased till 7 in the morning .
The irregularities which are apparent do not destroy the general evident inference of result , as it is well known that the common increasing or decreasing variation is subject , in the same place , and on the same day , to certain deviations , from latent causes .
It appears in general , that such diurnal variation of the variation as had been observed during thunder , is greater than it ought to have been , cvteris paribus .
It has been remarked , that heat weakens the magnetic virtue , and that cold strengthens it .
Supposing , with the great HALLEY , the existence of 4 magnetic poles , by blending this supposition with the above principle , well ascertained , attempts have been made to account for the diurnal variation of the variation .
The south-east magnetic pole being less heated in the morning , either by the sun or by subterraneous fire , than towards noon , and in ' the afternoon , and being at the same time , by passing through the meridian of Celebes , nearer Sumatra than the south-west magnetic pole , it draws to it in the morning the south end ' of the magnetic needle more powerfully than the other attracts ; and , consequently , the variation diurnal of the variation ought to be , and actually is , less in the morning than in the afternoon .
In the progress of the day , the south-east magnetic pole having become heated , and the south-west pole being at the same time less heated , attracts the south end of the magnetic needle more powerfully than the other does ; and hence the east diurnal variation of the variation appears greater in the afternoon thanin the morning .
It is found in Europe , that this diurnal variation of the variation is greater in summer than in winter .
This seems to point out heat acting on magnets in the earth , as its efficient cause .
This was first observed in Europe in 1756 , by Mr. CANTON ; and the results of the foregoing observation being diametrically opposite to his , with similar effects , afford not a small confirmation of the essential part of HALLEY'S theory .
The sciences of electricity and magnetism ( in my opinion intimately connected ) are at present in their infancy .
We observe effects which we cannot trace up to any satisfactory cause .
If ob-servations similar to these , and to those made by Mr. CANTON , could be made-in equal latitudes and longitudes , and in corresponding situations in the torrid zone , by collating the re " sults , I think a rationale of this wonderful phbenomenon might be obtained .
From the greatness of the angle of dip of the needle , I am led to suppose that the magnetic poles are fixed within the magnetic nucleus far within the earth 's surface , and that some of these poles are more powerful in their action than others , from the variation observed in various places pf the globe .
I shall be happy if these observations ( I mean the figured ones ) will enable you to elucidate this subject ; I remain , with much esteem , &amp;c. JOHN MACDONALD .
24th of June .
A meridian was drawn by means of the following apparatus .
A plate of brass was cast , and reduced to a level surface in , a lathe , in which concentric dircles were accurately cut on it .
A short hollow cylinder was screwed on the centre .
This tube received a brass cylinder , pointed at the upper end .
An iron--wood post was fixed in the ground .
The brass plate was fixed level on the post by means of a gunner 's perpendicular , and strong screws working in two plates , on the principle of the levelling screws of a theodolite .
The cy-O linder was rendered perfectly perpendicular to the level plate , by means of three small adjusting screws on the tube .
These screws acting laterally on the brass wire-pointed pin that gave the sun 's shadow on the concentric circles , brought it perpen- .
dicular over the centre of the plate .
A flat small brass ruler was furnished with a socket , which received the point of the shadow-pin .
This ruler had a horizontal arm to it , having a semicircle at one extremity coinciding with the tube on the centre of the plate .
A pointed wire passed to the plate through the other extremity of the horizontal arm .
This wire could be raised or lowered at pleasure by a small screw .
It is evident that if this point touched , delicately , the plate of brass , in moving it round(by means of the socket above , and semicircle playing round the tube below ) , the shadow-pin must be perpendicular .
If the plate was acted upon evidently roughly by the pin in moving horizontally , it is clear the pin must be inclined to that side , and a delicate correction was given by the little brass screws fixed to the tube screwed on the centre .
By this contrivance the shadow.-pin was fixed exactly perpendicular to the plate .
The box in which the magnet is suspended seems to have come out of the maker 's hand unfinished , having on it no hairs through , or parallel to its axis , by which to apply it truly tQ a meridian .
These hairs were fixed above and below the magnet , in a plane perpendicular to the graduated o0 at both ends .
Two very fine brass wires were fixed on th eouts side , op the ends of the box .
These brass wires were in the plane of the hairs , and when applied to the meridian , the hairs appeared to cover the meridian , through circular holes in the bottom of the box. .
I may venture to assert that the meridian was laid off within one minute of a degree , as it bisected the chords of 12 different'iarcs of concentric circles made use of .
I may also say that the axis , or o0 line of the box , was applied to the meridian within one nlinute of true position .
In laying off the Meridian , the operations of two successive days perfectly agreed.-W .
