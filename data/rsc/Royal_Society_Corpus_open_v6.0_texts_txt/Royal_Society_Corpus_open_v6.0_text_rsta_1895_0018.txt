]\gt ; nsity of the reflected beam to such an extent that it does interfere with settings .
All the glass surfaces which it was possible alter were inclined at a small angle to direction of the light , and the ends of the tube were made parallel to one another , slightly inclined to the axis .
By this means the above difficult , v was overcome .
SULTS O CARBON BISULPHIDE .
A quantity of " " pure redistilled\ldquo ; carbon bisulphide from HOPICIN : : a much better agreement than BICHAT'S parabolic , the mean differpoint oarbon bphide uhigher those oustified ising hindeed , even apart fparts itherefore , appear t ourselves and the other observers quoted on p. 644 , we think that the character of experimental data scarcely warrants the acceptance of his equation as representing $he true temperature variation of the rotation in carbon bisulphide .
Independent evidence in support of this conclusion lies in the fact that if Lord value for the rotation in carbon bisulphide at be reduced to by ur expression for the nperature variation , it agrees much better with the deter ' ination made at by BECQUEREL than when it is reduced by means of BICHAT'S uation .
Absolute Value .
As all observers , except ARONS , who have made absolute measurements of the magnetic rotation in liquids , have used carbon bisulphide , and as the values obtained by them are in all cases lower than ours , we give at this stage a detailed examination the effects which are likely to influence the absolute value .
These may be due to\mdash ; ( 1 .
