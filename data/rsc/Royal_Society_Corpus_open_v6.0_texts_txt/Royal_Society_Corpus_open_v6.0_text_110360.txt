A paper was also read , entitled , " On the present Situation of the Magnetic Lines of Equal Variation , and their Changes on the Ter ?
restrial Surface .
" By Peter Barlow , Esq. , F.R.S. The author has undertaken the task of collecting and arranging all the authentic information respecting magnetic variation which has been recorded in the accounts of several recent voyages and journeys of discovery .
The inconvenience from the distortion and interruptions of the lines of equal variation laid down on maps or charts , induced him to trace them on a globe , where they can , of course , be exhibited in their natural situation , and in regular conti ?
nuity : and he has been careful to mark only such as are deduced from actual observation .
The examination of the lines thus laid down shows them to be dependent on definite and general laws , and not on local influences ; their inflexions and curvatures presenting systems of great regularity , and being exempt from those abrupt and angular configurations which such local disturbances might be expected to produce : neither do they appear to be consistent with the hypothesis of the action of a certain definite plurality of magnetic poles .
The author next offers some observations on the progressive changes which these lines undergo in their places and configurations , and shows their agreement with the hypothesis of a revolution of the magnetic poles for each place round the poles of the earth ; each respec-
