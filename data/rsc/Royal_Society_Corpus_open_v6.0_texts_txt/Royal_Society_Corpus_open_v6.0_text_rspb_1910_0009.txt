Velocity of Reaction in [ Nov. 16 , Hughes Medal .
The Hughes Medal falls this year to Eichard Tetley Glazebrook , F.E.S. Dr. Glazebrook has for many years been closely identified with the construction , testing , and evaluation of electrical standards .
Not only has he published important memoirs on these subjects , but , as Secretary for a very long period of the Electrical Standards Committee of the British Association , and more recently as Director of the National Physical Laboratory , he has taken a leading and responsible part in this type of scientific work and in conferences of international importance .
It is thus specially fitting that he should be the recipient of the Hughes Medal .
The Velocity of Reaction in the " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by Bacteria , and in the " Adsorption of Agglutinins , Trypsin , and Sulphuric Acid by Animal Charcoal* By Georges Dreyer , M.A. , M.D. , Professor of Pathology in the University of Oxford , and J.

) Arrhenius , in his different papers dealing with equilibria in absorption processes , has used the alleged differences in velocity of reaction between the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria and the adsorption of a dye by a fibre , to assist his conclusion that these processes are of different natures .
While a fair number of observations ( Bordet , Bayliss , Hedin , etc. ) exist as to the influence of time on the so-called adsorption processes , e.g. , the adsorption of an acid by charcoal , or of a dye by a fibre , proving that it takes a very * The experiments in this paper wer e partly carried out in the University Laboratory for Medical Bacteriology , Copenhagen , and we wish to express our gratitude to Prof. Salomonsen , the Director of that Laboratory , for the great facilities he always granted us while we worked there .

] " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by Bacteria , etc. 169 considerable time before equilibrium is reached , the study of the time reaction in the taking up of agglutinins by bacteria has been confined to the following brief statements of Eisenberg and Yolk , that the velocity of reaction is extremely fast and that equilibrium is reached even in five minutes at a temperature of 0 ' C. , and that no appreciable difference was to be traced in the absorption velocity whether the reaction took place at 0 ' C. or at 37 ' C. Arrhenius , having founded his theory for the equilibria in absorption processes on the experiments of Eisenberg and Yolk , uses the statement that , as equilibrium is reached in less than five minutes even at 0 ' C. , the process of the taking up of agglutinin by bacteria could not be an adsorption similar to the interaction between dye and fibre as proposed by Bordet , since the reaction velocity is here very slow , taking a long time , even days , before equilibrium is reached at room temperature .
We made the following series of experiments to determine for ourselves if the statements of Eisenberg and Yolk were correct , especially as they were so much in opposition to what one would expect .
We wished to find out whether it would be possible , by comparing the velocity of absorption of specific agglutinins by their own bacteria with the velocity of adsorption of the same specific agglutinins and other organic and inorganic substances as , \#166 ; e.g. , trypsin or sulphuric acid by charcoal , to draw definite conclusions as to the difference in the two processes in the manner done by Arrhenius to support his theory that the interaction between specific agglutinin and bacteria is only a special case of Guldberg and Waage 's law of mass action .
Before passing on to our own results , we must give a detailed account of the technique which enabled us to reach more trustworthy results than could be expected by the somewhat rough procedure of Eisenberg and Yolk .
Technique.\#151 ; For the experiments we used a brand of Bacillus coli communis { called in the tables Bacillus coli lab .
) the purity of which could be relied upon and which had been long subcultured in the laboratory , being the same as that previously used by Dreyer and Jex-Blake .
The emulsions were made from cultures grown for 24 hours in large Boux bottles on agar surfaces inoculated from a 24-hour bouillon culture which had been transplanted daily from bouillon to bouillon for about a week .
The surface growth was removed with an aluminium scraper , great care being exercised to include neither the agar itself nor the water of condensation .
The mass so obtained was emulsified by rubbing it with a glass rod in a glass beaker , 0*85 per cent. NaCl being gradually added , until the emulsion was of the required density , this was such that the emulsion contained 100 times as many bacilli as the standard bouillon culture used for testing the agglutinin content of any given serum , and was called 100/ 1 N emulsion .
The standardisation was effected 170 Dreyer and Douglas .
Velocity of Reaction in [ Nov. 16 , by comparing its translucency with that of the standard culture , a method which allows of great accuracy .
To the 100/ 1 N emulsion was added 1 per cent , of ordinary commercial 40 per cent , formaldehyde .
This stock emulsion was kept in an ice chest in the dark at from 0 ' to 2 ' C. Usually a 10/ 11ST emulsion was used for the absorption of the agglutinin , the stock emulsion being suitably diluted with sterile 0'85 per cent. NaCl for each experiment .
Control experiments were made to ascertain that formalin in this amount did not-give appreciable differences in the quantity of agglutinin absorbed .
The experimental details on this point will be published in a later paper .
The serum used , unless otherwise stated , was obtained from a goat , immunised with the stock Bacillus coli mentioned above , and was suitably diluted with sterile 085 per cent. NaCl .
All apparatus used was carefully cleaned and dry sterilised .
All measurements and dilutions were carried out with accurately graduated glass pipettes .
For investigating the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria , 4 c.c. of the emulsion of the corresponding bacilli were added to 4 c.c. of a given dilution of serum .
The tubes were then at once shaken and left to stand for various lengths of time .
Experiments were undertaken at low temperature ( 1 ' to 2 ' C. ) , at room temperature ( 15 ' to 17 ' C. ) , and in one case at 37 ' C. , room temperature being that to which preference was given , because here no , or only slight , , alteration in the temperature took place during the time of centrifugalisation , while with the experiments at 1 ' to 2 ' C. it was found impracticable to prevent the temperature from rising during this period , as also to prevent a fall in temperature if the experiments were carried out at 37 ' C. A special high speed centrifuge by Burmeister and Wain , run at a speed of 7200 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes , was used for the separation of the bacteria from the fluid .
The clear supernatant fluid was decanted and kept in the dark at a temperature of 0 ' to 2 ' C. until it was convenient , on the same or the following day , to estimate the amount of agglutinin it contained .
The measurements of the agglutinin content of the various fluids were carried out by Dreyer 's modification* of the method originally proposed by Madsen and Jorgensen.f The method adopted for the estimation of agglutinin is as follows:\#151 ; Test-tubes 7 cm .

As soon as all these measurements were completed the tubes were shaken from right to left , care being exercised not to carry fluid from one tube to the other .
They were then placed in a water bath at 37 ' C. for two hours , taken out , allowed to cool down to room temperature ( which takes about a quarter of an hour ) , and examined for agglutination .
Thereafter they stood a further 20 to 24 hours at room temperature and were again examined .
When the agglutinating powers of several sera are to be examined , a similar series of 13 test-tubes is set up for each .
The actual measurement of the agglutination that has taken place is made as follows:\#151 ; From the whole number of tubes set up as above described , that one is selected which shows the minimum amount of agglutination definitely visible to the naked eye .
This tube is called the " standard " tube , and it is carefully compared with those tubes in each of the other series which show nearly similar degrees of agglutination .
In this way one is able either to pick out in each series a tube showing the same degree of agglutination as the standard , or to estimate by visual inspection the situation that such a tube should occupy between one tube showing a greater degree of agglutination and the next tube in the series showing a less degree of agglutination than the standard tube .
Taking the reciprocal figure of the actual amount of diluted serum added to the tube giving the same degree of agglutination as the standard tube , and multiplying this figure by the number of times the serum was diluted , 172 Dreyer and Douglas .
Velocity of Reaction in [ Nov. 16 , it is possible to express the agglutinin strength of the serum in arbitrary units .
Thus it will be seen that it is possible to measure the agglutinin content of a given serum , whether it is strong or weak , with the same procentic accuracy , i.e. to determine whether a serum contains 1 or 1*1 unit as accurately as if it contained 1000 or 1100 units .
The digesting power of the trypsin used in one set of experiments was measured in a similar manner .
A slightly alkaline 10 per cent , gelatin jelly , to which had been added a trace of thymol , took the place of the bacterial culture , the trypsin solution that of the diluted serum .
After the fluid contents had been measured into the tubes , these were shaken and placed in a water bath at 37 ' C. for two hours and then placed in a cold water bath ( 8 ' to 10 ' C. ) to solidify , and read while still in the bath .
A second reading was taken 24 hours later to make sure that the end reaction had actually been reached .
A tube which showed semi-liquefaction was chosen as standard in reading the result .
As we , in the course of our investigations , have been convinced of the importance of paying attention to points previously raised by Dreyer and Jex-Blake , it may be of use to summarise the principal differences between the method as used by us throughout our experiments , and the method as originally proposed by Madsen and Jorgensen .
1 .
To use a standardised killed bouillon culture as described by Dreyer* instead of a fresh 24-hour bouillon culture , of non-standardised strength , to which 0*02 per cent , of formalin had been added immediately before use in order to prevent the further growth of the bacteria while the tubes were kept for two hours at 37 ' C. 2 .
To make the contents of each tube up to the same volume .
Madsen and Jorgensen , and also Jorgensen , have stated that variations in the same amounts of fluid in their test-tubes lying between 1*56 c.c. and 2 c.c. made no difference in the results they obtained , any alterations due to such variations lying within the limits of experimental error .
Our own experience , however , is entirely opposed to this view .
3 .
To take two separate readings of the tubes : the first after they have been left two hours at 37 ' C. and allowed to cool to room temperature , and the second after they have been left a further 20 to 24 hours at room temperature .
This is preferable to the reading of the tubes as soon as they are removed from the water bath and before they have had time to cool down to the temperature of the room as proposed by Madsen and Jorgensen , a course which is impossible where many series of tubes have to be examined , and also , in our experience , gives less trustworthy results .

] " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by Bacteria , etc. 173 24-hour reading is in nearly all cases the one to which the greatest attention should he paid , because such irregularities as are found in the two-hour reading in the same serum in the same dilution ( being caused by some slight difference in the physical condition under which the clumping of the bacteria takes place , time reaction , etc. ) will generally totally vanish in the 24-hour reading .
This absence of irregularities is of the utmost importance where great accuracy is essential , as , for instance , in absorption experiments .
The following figures ( Table II ) clearly illustrate the advantage of the 20- to 24-hour reading .

Velocity of Reaction in [ Nov. 16 , Turning next to the " Tables " at the end of this paper , it should be explained that when it is stated in any one of them that a given agglutinating serum , or a solution of trypsin or of sulphuric acid , contains a certain number of " units , " these " units " may be taken as expressing absolute values , though the " units " themselves are arbitrary .
This is because control measurements were carried out at the time in each set of experiments , and the number of " units " present both before and after absorption has taken place for a given time have been determined by the use of the same arbitrary standard .
With experiments carried out with identical solutions or emulsions , but made at different times , the results are obtained in values which are relative and not absolute , and so cannot be directly compared with one another .
Accordingly in Tables III to XIV the experimental details and the absolute quantities employed are recorded .
In Table XV all the results are summarised , but have been recalculated so as to give figures that are directly comparable with one another .
These figures express relative and not absolute values ; in each case the number of " units " originally present has been taken as 100 , while the quantities absorbed and the quantities left free in the fluid are expressed in corresponding ratios or percentages .
To the time of observation given in the tables must be added the interval of time elapsing between the mixing of the bacteria with the serum and the stopping of the centrifuge , less an unknown time X. This subtraction of the time X is necessary , because it is impossible to say at what precise moment during the centrifugalisation the absorbing material was completely separated from the supernatant fluid , and it is this moment which we regard as the end of the reaction .
Thus the time must be read as 0 + ( time \#151 ; X ) , l + ( time \#151 ; X ) , ... 20+ ( time \#151 ; X ) , etc. , minutes .
Naturally the length of time X may be different according to the nature , quantity , etc. , of the absorbing matter used , i.e. bacteria , charcoal , etc. , and the concentration , nature , etc. , of the fluid with which it is in contact , but is constant throughout each individual experiment since these conditions then remain the same .
In the following discussion , when mentioning the various times , we speak of 0 minutes instead of 0+(time \#151 ; X ) minutes , 3 minutes instead of 3+ ( time \#151 ; X ) minutes , etc. , for the sake of brevity .
In Experiment 1 ( Table III ) , where there were originally present 197'5 units , the number of units left in the fluid decreases regularly as the time increases , although the experiment was carried out at a temperature higher than 0 ' C. , i.e. circa 1 ' C. Thus it will be seen that after 0 minutes 19 units are left , after 10 minutes 7'9 , and after 80 minutes 5'4 units .
1909 .
] " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by Bacteria , etc. 175 Somewhat similar results are found in Experiment 2 ( Table IV ) carried nut at 2 ' C. , where , out of 162 units , there were left after 0 minutes 12-5 units , after 4 minutes 9*7 , and after 20 minutes 6-06 .
It is thus clearly seen that at temperatures but little higher than 0 ' 0 .
, .equilibrium is by no means established even in times of more than 30 minutes .
This is in no sort of agreement with the statement of Eisenberg and Yolk which has been generally accepted by Arrhenius , Craw , and others .
As it now was of interest to see whether equilibrium would be established in a short time at higher temperatures , such as 15 ' to 17 ' C. and 37 ' C. , Experiments 3 and 4 ( Tables Y and YI ) were carried out .
In Experiment 3 , carried out at 37 ' C. , the serum diluted 12'5 times contained 29*2 units .
After 0 minutes were left 3-49 units , after 9 minutes 2*27 , after 30 minutes 2 units , but that equilibrium had not been reached even after half an hour is seen from the fact that after 2 , 4 , and 8 hours there has been left respectively T85 , T78 , and T59 units .
Exactly the same is found in Experiment 4 , .carried out at 16 ' C. , as will be seen from Table YI , save that the velocity of reaction is slower than in Experiment 3 .
To show with how great accuracy experiments of this kind can be carried out , and to prove beyond doubt the correctness of the statements , in each of the Experiments 3 and 4 there were put up three tubes for the time denoted as 0 minutes , and two for the time denoted as 9 minutes .
It is clear that in Experiment 3 , where the greatest individual differences between the observed values are found , the mean variation is , nevertheless , not greater than 3T per cent , from the mean value ; and for 9 minutes the two determinations are identical .
In Experiment 4 , for the 0 minute point the mean variation is less than 0'9 per cent , of the mean value , and at 9 minutes , just as in the previous experiment , the figures are identical .
As one would expect , the greatest error is found where the time reaction is the shortest , and is due to the inevitable small differences in time wdiich can hardly be avoided .
Similar control tubes were used in Experiments 7 , 8 , 9 ( Tables IX , X , XI ) .
These experiments clearly show that one of the fundamental points stated oy Arrhenius to be in good agreement with his theory that the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria should be considered as following a partition law , C = JcBn , similar to that which holds good for the distribution of benzoic acid between two different solvents , water and benzene , is unsound , since the reaction , instead of being a very rapid one ( finished in less than five minutes at 0 C. , Eisenberg and Yolk ) , is a slow one and is still incomplete at room temperature even after several hours have elapsed .
176 Dreyer and Douglas .
Velocity of Reaction [ Nov. 16 , As we know from experiments of Morgenrotli that it takes several hours at room temperature before equilibrium is reached , when a diphtheria antitoxin acts on a diphtheria toxin , there is now no excuse for contrasting " the rapid reaction " in the one case ( absorption of agglutinin ) with " the slow reaction " in the other ( neutralisation of diphtheria toxin ) .
To draw such a distinction between the interactions of these different antigens and antibodies is unjustifiable , since in both instances the reaction is rather a slow one .
As Arrhenius has used " the rapid reaction " in the case of the absorption of agglutinins by bacteria to disprove Bordet 's theory that the agglutinins were adsorbed by the bacteria in the same way as a dye by a fibre , where the reaction is a slow one , it was of interest to make experiments which would enable one to compare the velocity of reaction in adsorption processes with that found by us in the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria .
For this purpose we have investigated the adsorption of agglutinins , trypsin , and sulphuric acid by animal charcoal .
From Experiments 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ( Tables VII , VIII , IX , X ) , in which agglutinin is acted on by charcoal , it will be seen that the amount of agglutinin left free in the supernatant fluid lessens as the time during which the adsorption is allowed to proceed increases .
This observation is in entire agreement with those made by previous observers , showing that in adsorption processes it takes a long time before equilibrium is reached .
Comparing together Experiments 5 and 6 , it is further seen that , at the same temperature , where small amounts of charcoal acted on small amounts of agglutinin , the velocity of reaction is smaller than with larger amounts of charcoal and larger amounts of agglutinin , within the limits of the experiments .
From Experiments 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 , it results that the rate with which the adsorption of agglutinin by charcoal proceeds is markedly greater than is that of the absorption of agglutinin by bacteria .
But if we compare the progress of adsorption in these experiments with that seen in Experiment 9 ( Table XI ) , in which trypsin is treated with charcoal , it is clear that the rate of adsorption in this latter case is ever so much the greater .
Examination of Experiments 10 , 11 , and 12 ( Tables XII , XIII , XIV ) , in which charcoal is allowed to adsorb sulphuric acid , shows that the quantity of acid adsorbed augments with the lapse of time , but does so less rapidly than was the case in the other adsorption experiments ( Nos. 5 to 9 ) .
' The rate of adsorption is , in fact , approximately the same as it was in the absorption experiments ( Nos. 1 to 4 ) , in which agglutinins were placed in contact with bacilli .
For example , in Experiment 4 ( Table XV ) , the percentage of agglutinin absorbed increased from 82*2 at the end of 1909 .
] " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by Bacteria , etc. 177 0 minutes to 92-0 after 240 minutes ; in the case of charcoal and sulphuric acid ( Experiment 12 , Table XV ) , the percentage adsorbed rose from 58'7 at the end of 0 minutes to 65'4 at the end of 240 minutes .
Thus it is found that the time taken before equilibrium is reached varies greatly , not only with the quantity of the adsorbing matter but also with the nature of the different substances , concentrations , absolute quantities , temperature , etc. , and that it is not legitimate to draw from the time taken for equilibrium to be reached any definite conclusion as to the nature of the interaction between the absorbing substance and the substance absorbed from a fluid .
Therefore we consider it just as erroneous to conclude from the reaction velocities that the taking up of agglutinin by bacteria is the same process as the taking up of sulphuric acid by charcoal ( Bordet 's theory ) as it would be to conclude that the adsorption of trypsin by charcoal or agglutinin by charcoal is different from the adsorption of sulphuric acid by charcoal , on account of the great differences in the velocities with which these processes proceed .

] " Absorption " of Specific Agglutinins by , etc. 183 The Velocity of Reaction , etc. Conclusions .
1 .
The establishment of equilibrium in the absorption of agglutinins by their specific bacteria is not attained , as stated by Eisenberg and Yolk , in less than five minutes at 0 ' C. , but takes a considerable time , since equilibrium is not reached at room temperature even in four hours .
2 .
The adsorption of agglutinin or trypsin by charcoal lias not reached an equilibrium within four hours at room temperature , and the adsorption of sulphuric acid by charcoal not in 24 hours , or possibly even in 48 hours .
3 .
There is no justification for judging as to the nature of the interaction between an absorbing material and a substance absorbed , from the rapidity or slowness with which equilibrium is attained , as has been done by Arrhenius. .
