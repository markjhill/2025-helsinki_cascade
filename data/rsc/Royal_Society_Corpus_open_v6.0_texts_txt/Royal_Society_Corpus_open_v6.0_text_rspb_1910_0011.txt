Observations on the Rate of Action of Drugs ( Alcohol , Chloroform , Quinine , Aconitine ) upon Muscle as a Function of Temperature .
By V. H. Veley , F.R.S. , and A. D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. ( Received November 23 , 1909 , \#151 ; Read January 20 , 1910 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , S.W. ) Very scanty information exists as regards the effect of temperature upon the activity of drugs .
Brunton* says :\#151 ; 44 That the action of veratrine and of barium on muscle is very much altered by heat and cold .
Many , if not all , muscular poisons act more quickly with increased temperature .
" According to the same author , Humboldtf noticed that warmth increases the rapidity with which alcohol destroyed the irritability of a nerve and potassium sulphide that of a muscle .
Brunton and CashJ showed that 44 up to a certain point heat increases the effect of veratria and cold lessens it .
" Waller took observations of the rates of action of alcohol , ether , and * 4 Pharmacology , ' 1893 , p. 45 .

Mr. V. H. Yeley and Dr. A. D. Waller .
[ Nov. 23 , chloroform at the temperatures 19 ' and 30 ' , and gives for ether a coefficient of 2-0 for a rise of 10'.* None of these observations have been definitely addressed to the question whether or no the pharmacodynamic action of drugs obeys the laws of chemical action in its relation to temperature , although obviously they point in that direction .
The following observations have been made as carefully as possible by methods already described in previous communications .
In preliminary experiments we determined the most convenient concentrations to afford us a sufficient number of observations at different temperatures within the range of 7 ' to 27 ' .
In all cases the effects were markedly increased by rise of temperature ; the degree of correspondence will be evident from the details of observations given below .
Within the range of 7 ' to 27 ' the temperature coefficient of increase in , e.g. , the case of quinine infra ) , comes out as 2-52 per 10 ' .
An upper limit is fixed by the heat coagulation of the muscular substance .
The lower limit appears to be that at which chemical combination of this peculiar character is suspended .
It varies for different drugs , e.g. , in the case of the powerful drug aconitine the poisonous effect is completely inhibited at a temperature of about 7 ' .
As will be shown below , this inhibition is temporary .
The question whether the acceleration and retardation of a toxic effect by higher or lower temperature are really of a chemical nature , and not merely by reason of differences of physical diffusion , is very easily answered .
Taking a strength of drug and a low temperature such that chemical action ( but not diffusion ) is practically suppressed , and subsequently placing in normal saline the muscle in which diffusion ( but not combination ) of the drug has taken place , we now find the characteristic effect of the drug to manifest itself , e.g. , No. 631 ( fig. 16 ) .
And apparently the rate of this delayed effect is not sensibly different from the rate of an undelayed effect , which goes to show that in an ordinary experiment where rate of diffusion and rate of chemical change are to be thought of , the former is negligible in comparison with the latter .
As a preliminary to the study of the effect of temperature upon the rate of action of drugs upon muscle , we naturally took observations of the effect of variations of temperature upon contraction in the absence of drugs .
This brought out one very definite and , we believe , important point .
As is well known , contractility subsists between an upper and lower limit of temperature , and it is usually considered that the upper limit is * " The Comparative Power of Alcohol , Ether , and Chloroform , etc. , " 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 81 , B , p. 545 , 1909 .
1909 .
] Observations on the Rate of Action of Drugs , etc. set by the point at which heat coagulation takes place .
But the matter is not quite so simple .
We find that with rising temperature the contractility ( as tested by induction shocks , which are the shortest possible stimuli ) vanishes before heat contraction appears .
There is , in fact , after a first augmentation , a change of an anti-excitatory or inhibitory character , a true heat paralysis of the relaxed muscle before the more profound abolition attributable to heat coagulation.* If the rise of temperature does not go beyond a certain limited point , this heat inhibition is temporarily followed by perfect recovery .
Beyond this point , i.e. if coagulation has occurred , ]* there is no recovery of contractility .
In the two examples below the temporary effect has occurred with a rise to 34 ' \#151 ; the permanent effect after a rise to 40'4 As regards the lower limit , we satisfied ourselves that the temperature could be lowered to at least 0 ' without abolition of contractility , and in \#166 ; our subsequent experiments we did not lower the temperature below 7 ' , so that in all certainty any retardation observed at 7 ' was retardation of ehemical change as regards the drug and not the simple effect of cold without drug .
Thus , e.g. , in the experiment of November 12 ( fig. 1 ) , we have an undiminished contraction at 0 ' for at least half an hour ; the muscle undrugged does not lose contractility until congelation actually sets in ; this occurs at \#151 ; 0o,6 to \#151 ; 1 ' .
The variation of chemical change with temperature is most simply expressed by Esson 's formulaS KTo/ KTl = ( Tx/ To)- , ( 1 ) which for our purposes becomes Lo/ Lx = ( Tx/ T0)m , ( 2 ) nr simply log L0\#151 ; log Lx = m ( log Tx \#151 ; log T0 ) , ( 3 ) in which L0 and Lx are the lengths of time required for the abolition of * " The Effect of Heat upon the Electrical State of Living Tissues , " ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 81 , B , p. 303 , 1909 .
t We do not commit ourselves to the statement that heat-coagulation is an entirely irreversible change .
On the contrary , we think that slight degree of such change in the living body can be entirely effaced .
+ B has been observed that the contractility of a frog 's muscle , suspended in saline ( 0 5 per cent. ) solution increases rapidly with rise of temperature from 28 ' up to 45 ' , the maximum point . .
If the muscle be immersed directly in saline solution at 45 ' , the contraction is instantaneous .

This takes length of time as expressing the rate of chemical change , the rate with which the drug reacts upon the living muscle .
The shorter the time , the greater the rate .
Put into words , formula ( 3 ) !
states that the logarithmic increment of chemical change ( which in our observations is represented by the logarithmic decrement of time of complete intoxication ) varies as the logarithmic increment of absolute temperature ; the graph of this relation is a straight line , which affords a convenient means of representing a series of results ; for this purpose we have taken time along the abscissa , temperature along the ordinates .
We have selected as typical substances of widely differing toxicities : ethyl alcohol , chloroform , quinine hydrochloride , and aconitine hydrochloride , taken of concentrations such as to bring about the abolition of muscular contraction within convenient lengths of time at temperatures ranging from 7 ' to 27 ' .
( According to our preliminary observations , the relative toxicities of these substances taken on the molecular scale are : Alcohol = 1 , Chloroform = 100 , Quinine = 2000 , Aconitine = 20,000 .
) The accuracy of our time-measurements was always subject to an error of about half a minute by reason of the difficulty of determining the end-point of the abolition of contractility ; this error was aggravated in observations taken at low temperatures .
( 1 ) Ethyl Alcohol .
Alcohol , sold as " pure absolute , " was purified as follows : A stick of sodium hydrate was dissolved in the spirit and the whole heated in a reverse condenser for one hour in order to saponify the esters , and resinify the aldehydes ; it was then fractionated , the middle portion , boiling at 781 * * * * * 0,9 ( corr .
) , being retained .
Two density determinations gave the following results : S.G.15/ 15 = 0-81046 and 0-81045 respectively , which corresponds to 94'5 per cent , per weight alcohol .
It has been shown in previous investigations that this method of purification removes all impurities other than water , which for our purpose is not material .
The alcohol was made up to normal solution : 46 grammes per litre of 0'6-per-cent .

Aconitine Hydrochloride .
We selected aconitine as being the most powerful poison known to us , acting upon muscle at a dilution reaching w/ 100000 .
In our first trials at strengths of w/ 1000 and n/ 2000 we found that it was necessary to cleanse the vessels with great care , otherwise an evident aconitine effect might present itself as a fallacy .
The effect of low temperature was particularly striking .
The toxic action of solutions w/ 10000 , and even of 2000 and 1000 , was completely suspended , while the temperature of solution , and presumably of muscle , was at 7 ' to 8 ' , but made its appearance as soon as the temperature was raised .
We have already commented on this remarkable result as affording evidence of the chemical factor as distinct from the diffusion factor .

After alcohol , chloroform , and quinine , at the concentrations we used , recovery always took place sooner or later ; but after aconitine , even at its lowest active concentration , no recovery was ever observed .

physical and Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane , etc. 217 the toxic action had been more profound at high than at low temperature .
But the recovery , having once commenced , proceeded more rapidly at high than at low temperature .
We have not attempted to trace any quantitative relation between temperature and rate of recovery ; we content ourselves with noting in this connection that after , e.g. , quinine 2000 , recovery began at once at 19 ' , but was delayed for five minutes at 25 ' , in another case , after alcohol n/ 1 at 20 ' , recovery began after 1 minute , and at 24 ' after 4 minutes .
With a given toxic solution at a given temperature , the degree and completeness of recovery in saline were influenced by the previous duration of exposure to the action of the drug .
Thus , in alcohol n/ 1 the delay of recovery was 6 minutes after immersion for 12 minutes , and 10 minutes after immersion for 25 minutes .
An Examination of the Physical and Physiological Properties of Tetrachlorethane and By Y. H. Veley , F.R.S. ( Received November 23 , 1909 , \#151 ; Read January 20 , 1910 .
) ( From the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , South Kensington .
) Introductory.\#151 ; Within the last few years chloroderivatives of the aliphatic hydrocarbons , other than the familiar chloroform , have been used for various purposes , occasionally with fatal results .
It would , therefore , appear desirable to apply physiological tests , in the first instance , to such compounds to ascertain whether they might reasonably be scheduled as poisons , before they are entrusted to the hands of unskilled and ignorant persons .
As two such substances , namely ( 1 ) one of the isomeric tetrachlorethanes , and ( 2 ) trichlor-ethylene , came into my hands through Dr. Willcox , they were compared with chloroform ( taken as a standard ) by the muscle method ; further , as the physical data at least of the latter compound have been curiously overlooked , the opportunity was taken of determining certain of these by instruments , calibrated for previous investigations .
