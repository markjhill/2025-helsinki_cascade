One of the chief results which , in my opinion , would be secured by the use of the prismatic camera in eclipse work was the differentiation between chromospheric and coronal phenomena .
The photographs taken during the eclipses of 1893 , 1896 , and 1898 all enabled this distinction to be made very clearly , and various radiations formerly attributed to the corona have been shown to belong to the chromosphere alone .
The photographs taken in Africa in 1893 showed eight rings in the spectrum of the corona ; in Novaya Zemlaya , in 1896 , with a less powerful instrument , a smaller number was secured ; but those taken with increased dispersion in India , in 1898 , show a much greater number .
I have already given the results of .
an inquiry into the wave-lengths of two of the chief coronal rings ( 5303-7 and 4231-3 ) as determined from photographs taken in 1898 with the 6-inch prismatic camera ; * and as the results of the continued investigations may be of service to intending observers of the eclipse of next May , I give a short abstract of them in the present note .
Eight photographs were obtained during the time the spectrum of the corona was least admixed with that of chromosphere ; of these , three taken with instantaneous exposures show only two or three of the brighter rings , so that five , showing many coronal rings , are suitable for measurement .
The exposures of the photographs used for measurement were as follows , the ratio of focal length to aperture being 15 :\#151 ; No. 2a ... ... ... ... .

of the stronger chromospheric arcs appear , together with the coronal rings , in the corresponding parts of the images .

coronal rings ; but , as I pointed out in the preliminary report on the observations at Viziadrug , the arcs and rings are readily distinguished.* The coronal rings which have been noted on the photographs may be divided into three groups , defined by the position-angles in which they have their greatest brightness .
The typical rings are ( 1 ) the green ring at X 5303'7 ; ( 2 ) a violet ring at X 3987 , near He ; and ( 3 ) a blue ring at X 4359-5 , near Hy .
The structure and brightness of these are shown in the accompanying diagram , but it may be remarked that the fainter members of the three groups do not exhibit the differences of structure so clearly .

The attempts which have so far been made to trace the origins of the rings , however , have led to no very definite results , and the coincidences with lines in the spectra of stars and nebulse which were formerly suspected have not yet been completely established .
Special interest is attached to the question of the presence or absence of carbon flutings .
There is a possible trace of the fluting , , Mr. W. C. D. Whetham .
commencing at X 4736*18 , which so far has not been observed in the chromosphere .
The other flutings of carbon which are present in the chromosphere do not appear in the coronal spectrum .
The reductions indicate that there may be feeble indications of the presence of some of the chromospheric gases in the inner corona .
Thus in photograph 3d , on the north-eastern edge , fragments of rings corresponding to lines of helium at 4472 , 4714 , and 4922 have been recorded ; these occur also on the south-western limb , where the chromosphere itself is coming into view , but as the chromosphere was completely eclipsed in the north-east at this stage , the radiations mentioned as occurring there perhaps belong to the inner corona .
A very interesting result of this detailed examination of the photographs is that the chief coronal ring in the green is very closely associated with the form of the inner , and appears to have no distinct connection with the outer , corona .
This suggests that the green line of the coronal spectrum is not produced in the outer corona , and that the indications of its presence there on previous occasions , as obtained by slit spectroscopes , were simply due to glare , as in the case of hydrogen and calcium .
So far as the photographs taken with the prismatic cameras are concerned , the spectrum of the outer corona gives no indications of bright rings .
The measurements of the coronal rings and the diagram which accompanies this paper have been made by Mr. Fowler .
Dr. Lockyer has investigated the coronal spectrum in relation to carbon , and Mr. Baxandall has made comparisons with the spectra of stars and nebulae .

( Abstract .
) It is known that the depression of the freezing point of water , produced by dissolving molecularly equivalent amounts of different acids .and salts in a given quantity of it , is approximately proportional to the number of ions which these substances must be supposed to yield in order to explain their electrical conductivities .
Again , as the concentration of a solution of one such substance is gradually increased , .the molecular depression of the freezing point , and the equivalent electrical conductivity , both vary , and vary by amounts which seem in .some cases to correspond , but in others to differ considerably .
There appeared reason to suppose that it was desirable to increase
