] On the Deportment of Alkalized Urine .
457 IY .
" Note on the Deportment of Alkalized Urine A By Professor Tyndall , P.R.S. Received December 18 , 1876 .
The communication " On the Influence of Liquor Potass\#174 ; and an Elevated Temperature on the Origin and Growth of Microphytes , " which , at Dr. Roberts 's request , I have had the pleasure of presenting to the Royal Society , causes me to say earlier than I should otherwise have done that the subject w'hich has occupied Dr. Roberts 's attention has also occupied mine , and that my results are identical with his .
In some of the experiments the procedure described by Dr. Roberts was accurately pursued , save in one particular which has reference to temperature .
Small tubes with their ends finely drawn out were charged with a definite amount of caustic potash , and subjected for a quarter of an hour to a temperature of 220 ' Pahr .
They were then introduced into flasks containing measured quantities of urine .
The urine being boiled for five minutes , the flasks were hermetically sealed during ebullition .
They were subsequently permitted to remain in a warm place sufficiently long to prove that the urine had been perfectly sterilized by the boiling .
The flasks were then rudely shaken , so as to break the capillary ends of the potash-tubes and permit the liquor potass\#174 ; to mingle with the acid liquid .
The urine thus neutralized was subsequently exposed to a constant temperature of 122 ' Pahr .
, which is pronounced by Dr. Bastian to be specially potent as regards the generation of organisms .
I have not found this to be the case ; for ten flasks , prepared as above described towards the end of last September , remained perfectly sterile for more than two months .
I have no doubt that they would have remained so indefinitely .
Three retorts , moreover , similar to those employed by Dr. Bastian , and provided with potash-tubes , had fresh urine boiled in them on the 29th of September , the retorts being sealed during ebullition .
Several days subsequently , the potash-tubes were broken and the urine neutralized .
Subjected for more than two months to a temperature of 122 ' Pahr .
they failed to show any signs of life .
These results are quite in accordance with those obtained by Dr. Roberts .
His potash-tubes , however , were exposed to a temperature of 280 ' Pahr .
, while mine were subjected to a temperature of 220 ' only .
With regard to the raising of the potash to a temperature higher than that of boiling water , M. Pasteur is in advance both of Dr. Roberts and myself .
In a communication to the Prench Academy , on the 17th of last July , M. Pasteur showed that when due care is taken to add nothing but potash ( heated to redness if solid , or to 110 ' C. if liquid ) to sterilized urine , no life is ever developed as a consequence of the alkalization* .
* That alkaline liquids are more difficult to sterilize than acid ones was announced by Pasteur more than fourteen years ago .

Presents .
[ Dec. 7 , M. Pasteur has quite recently favoured me with sketches of the simple but effectual apparatus by means of which he has tested the conclusions of Dr. Bastian .
Since his return from his vacation at Arbois , he has carefully gone over this ground with results , he reports to me , not favourable to Dr. Bastian 's views .
I may add that I have by no means confined myself to the thirteen samples of urine here referred to .
The experiments have already extended to one hundred and five instances , not one of which shows the least countenance to the doctrine of spontaneous generation .
It gives me pleasure to refer to the skill and fidelity with which here , as in other cases , Mr. Cottrell has carried out my directions .
The Society then adjourned over the Christmas Recess , to Thursday , January 11 , 1877 .
