( Abstract .
) In Grunert 's " Archiv der Mathematik und Physik , " vol. xxxvi ( 1861 ) , pp. 125-176 , Baebr has given the formulae for sn cn dn nuin terms of sum for the cases 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 .
These expressions are reproduced in a tabular form in Cayley 's " Treatise on Elliptic Functions , " Art .
109 .
The present paper contains the corresponding formulae for the case of n\#151 ; 8 .
Denoting the numerators and common denominator of sn 4m , cn 4 u , dn 4m by P , Q , R , S respectively , then the numerators and common denominator of sn 8 cn dn 8 are respectively 2PQRS , S4\#151 ; 2P2S2+7\lt ; ;2P4 , S4-2\amp ; 2P2S2 + \amp ; 2P4 , S4- \amp ; 2P4 ; and the paper contains the values of these quantities and also of P2 , S2 , P4 , S4 in terms of sn u , arranged in a tabular form .

( Abstract .
) The memoir relates chiefly to the different forms of the particular integrals of the differential equation ... ... ( i ) , and to the evaluation of certain definite integrals which are connected with this equation .
Transforming ( 1 ) by assuming u=x~Pv and putting 1 , it becomes cfiv cTa ?
2 x dx and this may be transformed into Riccati 's equation , ( 2)\gt ;
