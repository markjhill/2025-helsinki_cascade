] Anniversary 47 1 double-image prism was placed between the eyepiece and the eye .
The i prism was brought into four different positions 90 ' apart .
At each posi-\ tion of the prism an attempt was made to estimate the relative brightness | of the two images .
The power of the prism was just sufficient to give two d images of the comet without their overlapping .
The difference in bright-d ness of the images was exceedingly small ; I could not be certain that any appreciable difference really existed .
However , I attempted in each case || to select one of the two images as the brighter one .
Afterwards I deterii mined the position of the prism at the four different estimations , and I !
j then found that three of the estimations were in accordance with a portion j of the comet 's light being polarized in a plane passing through the sun , | and One in opposition to that supposition .
I hesitate to attach any positive value to these observations ; but they may perhaps he taken as showing that no considerable part of the comet 's light is polarized .
J The foregoing observations appear to show that the spectrum of this i comet is identical with that of Comet II .
1868 , a description of which I i had the honour to present to the Royal Society* .
It is worthy of notice that the cometary matter appears drawn out and j diffused towards the sun , and that it has not yet come under the influence of the force , or been subjected to the conditions , whatever they may be , by which in most cases cometary matter appears to be powerfully repelled from the sun .
The observations were made with the telescope belonging to the Royal Society , of 15 inches aperture .
The spectroscope contained one prism with a refracting angle of 60 , and the small observing telescope magnified six times .

] President 's Address , The President then addressed the Society as follows j\#151 ; Gentlemen , Br the publication of Volume V. of the Catalogue of Scientific Papers , the alphabetical list of titles according to authors ' names is brought down to the letters T I Z. The remainder of the series , with the supplementary matter , will fill one more volume , thus making six volumes for the completion of this part of the work .
The preparation of Volume VI .
is in a forward state , some sheets are printed , and its publication may be confidently looked for before our next Anniversary .
We have to regret that , in consequence of Dr. Carus having been for some time incapacitated by illness , but little progress has been made this year with the 1 Index Rerum .
' We have lost this year three distinguished Fellows of our Society , \#151 ; Sir I John Herschel , Mr. Babbage , and Sir Roderick Murchison .
Of the first-named , and most illustrious , Sir John Herschel , you might well expect from me a much more than ordinary notice ; but , happily , nich a notice ( at once far more worthy of the occasion than any thing which I could have been competent to furnish , and more full than could have fallen within the limits of an Anniversary Address ) will be in your hands within a few days in our Obituary Notices .
I would only add my own most warm and cordial assent to every part thereof which falls within my capability of judgment .
The deaths of Mr. Babbage and of Sir Roderick Murchison are more recent ; but we maybe sure that the care of our excellent senior Secretary will , at the proper time , supply suitable obituary notices of their scientific achievements , \#151 ; perhaps , in the case of Mr. Babbage , obtaining such a notice from some eminently qualified member of the great University to which he belonged .
All these three gentlemen were of advanced age , and the health of all three had been failing for a more or less considerable interval ; yet it is comparatively but a short time since the last departed ( Sir Roderick Murchison ) still displayed such an energetic and vigorous activity as will make his loss severely felt , most especially by the Royal Geographical Society , from whom and from the Geological Society large and worthy notices may doubtless be expected in their respective obituaries ; while our own obituary may contain such a brief but valuable statement of the wider bearings of his geological labours as may still come appropriately from the Royal Society .
It might be an indulgence to myself , but perhaps scarcely appropriate from this Chair , if , in speaking of Sir Roderick Murchison , I were to permit myself to advert to our long , joint , and friendly labours together at the British Association for the Advancement of Science .
By the munificence of one of our Fellows , Mr. John Peter Gassiot , the Kew Observatory has taken its place amongst the permanent in- 50 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , 1 stitutions of our country .
Mr. Gassiot has transferred to the Royal 1 Society , in Trust , certain securities , producing a net income of \lt ; \#163 ; 500 1 per annum , towards the cost of carrying on and continuing magnetical 1 and meteorological observations with self-recording instruments , and any 1 other physical investigations that may from time to time be found praeti- 1 cable and desirable , in the present building at Kew belonging to Her 1 Majesty 's Government ; or in the event of the Government at any time I declining to continue to place that building at the disposition of the Royal S Society , then in any other suitable building which the Council of the 1 Royal Society may determine .
It is further provided that , " in the event j of the Royal Society at any future time declining to continue such an 1 observatory , either , as at present , at Kew or elsewhere , the securities pro- 1 ducing the income shall be transferred to another corporation for educa- 1 tional purposes .
" The cost of the meteorological observations by self-re- | cording instruments at Kew is at present defrayed from public funds | placed at the disposal of a Committee nominated , at the request of Her Majesty 's Government , by our President and Council , and consisting of Pellows of the Society serving gratuitously .
Carrying out Mr. Gassiot 's views , the Council of the Royal Society has formed the same individuals into a " Kew Committee , " also serving gratuitously , and having the proceeds pf the Gassiot Pund at their disposal , and applying them to the maintenance of magnetical observations by self-recording instruments primarily ; and secondarily , as far as may be practicable , to aiding any other suitable physical investigations for which it may be possible to find space and adequate supervision .
Among the first duties which have required the attention of the Kew Committee has been the agreeable one of responding to an application made to them by Dr. Jelinek , Director of the Central-Anstalt fur Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus , to procure for that establishment a set of self-recording magnetographs similar to those at Kew .
The request has been of course complied with ; and it is hoped that the apparatus will be ready for transmission to Vienna in March next , being the time named by Dr. Jelinek as that at which the new building in course of erection in that city is expected to be completed .
The Committee has also been apprised by a letter ( dated in June last ) from Mr. Stone , Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope , that he had at that date applied to the Admiralty ( being the Department of Her Majesty 's Government under which the Cape Observatory is placed ) for a set of magnetographs , similar to those at Kew , to be employed at the Cape .
The Kew Committee hold themselves in readiness to supply the desired apparatus when they may receive directions to that effect from the Admiralty ; such directions , however , have not yet been received .
If Mr. Stone 's request is granted , the Cape Observatory will be the third in the British Colonial Dominions employing such instruments , ..the other two being the Colaba Observatory , under Mr. Chambers , at Bombay ( for which our thanks are due to Sir Stafford North- President 's Address .
1871 .
] cote , when Secretary of State for India ) , and the Mauritius Observatory , under Mr. Meldrum ( that establishment itself , as well as its magnetographs , being mainly due to the action of Sir Henry Barkly , F.R.S. , when Governor of that colony ) .
The care of our Foreign Secretary in watching scientific proceedings in other countries has recently called our attention to the investigation of a new feature in the cosmical connexions of terrestrial magnetism , in a paper by Professor Hornstein , of Prague , entitled , " On the dependence of the Earth 's Magnetism on the Rotation of the Sun " * .
From an examination of the magnetic records at Prague and Vienna , Professor Hornstein infers the existence of a periodic magnetic disturbance in very close accord with the synodic period of the rotation of the sun-spots in the sun 's equator .
As the existence of the Great Melbourne Telescope is in no small degree owing to the exertions of Members of this Society , and to their influence , you will be glad to hear that it is now in regular and successful work , after several difficulties and misadventures , such as often occur in the early trials of uncommon instruments or new sorts of observations .
Some of these will he found in the volume of correspondence which your Council has thought it desirable to publish , both as containing a complete history of this great work from its first conception to its complete execution , and also as presenting a collection of the opinions of persons whose knowledge of large telescopes must make these opinions specially valuable to any who may hereafter he engaged in similar undertakings .
In particular one matter , about which considerable apprehension was entertained , the repolishing the specula at Melbourne , has been well performed .
The speculum , described as A in the correspondence , which had become tarnished ( under circumstances described there ) , has been repolished , and Mr. Ellery reports that " its performance is highly satisfactory .
" In a subsequent part of his last Report , he thus summarizes his estimate of the instrument:\#151 ; " Further experience with the Great Telescope , and of " the conditions which affect its performance , have very much enhanced " our opinion of it ; and the drawings and other results obtained unmis- " takahly show that excellent work can be done with it .
On really " favourable occasions the performance , even with very high powers , is " exceedingly good .
It is evident , however , that a telescope of such " large dimensions requires a very long practice before it can he fairly or " successfully used .
The mechanical arrangements are all in perfect order j " and the moving and setting the telescope from one object to another is " performed almost as quickly and easily as with a five-feet equatorial .
" The clock has worked well and with great regularity from the first .
" This is in full accordance with the Reports of the Telescope Committee and of Mr. Lassell : the chief remaining difficulty is how the results * Vide suprp , 31 .
5.2 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , \#166 ; may best be published , especially the drawings of nebulae ; but there is no I doubt that this will soon be overcome .
In my Address of 1869 I had the pleasure of announcing to the Society 1 the advanced state of the fine equatorially-mounted telescope , fitted more .1 .
especially for spectroscopic research ( therefore rather for celestial physics 1 than for more strictly astronomical work ) , which , while it was to remain 1 the property of the Royal Society , was intended by the President and Council to be placed in the able and zealous hands of Mr. Huggins , who 1 was preparing at his own expense a suitable building for its reception .
J The necessary spectroscopic apparatus for use with it has not been long I completed ; but some of our Fellows are aware that Mr. Huggins has been I already doing work with this fine instrument in his observations of the | spectrum of Uranus , and in his quite recent examination of the spectrum of Encke 's Comet , which he finds to agree with that of carbon , and to be apparently identical with that of Comet II .
1868 , of which a description j appears in the Phil. Trans , for 1868 , p. 555 .
His other observations have been hitherto mainly confirmatory of those he had previously obtained of j the spectra of the nebulae and stars ; but he hopes for more definite results regarding the approach or recession of stars , and in particular the rate of the recession of Sirius .
In my last Address I spoke with pleasure of the approaching completion , of the fine series of Pendulum Experiments extending throughout the continent of India , from Cape Comorin to the high tablelands of the Himalayas ( to which it was further proposed to add two stations on the homeward route , i.e. Aden , and a station near the " Bitter Lakes " ) .
Of this magnificent series , designed to comprise thirty Indian stations , twenty-five Indian stations had then been completed by the skilled and indefatigable exertions of Captain Basevi of the Loyal Engineers .
Only five more remained , one on the Indus , and four in the higher Himalayas ; but , alas !
while engaged on these , Captain Basevi 's health yielded to the combined effects of arduous exertion , of .
climate , and finally of mountain exposure .
His last completed station ( to the south of Leh , in lat. 33 ' ) .was at an altitude of 15,500 feet .
He then proceeded to one still higher , closely approaching 17,000 feet , which was to be the last of all , and there died .
His character , services , and the sacrifice of his valuable life have received a fitting tribute from his immediate chief , Colonel Walker , head of the Trigonometrical Survey of India .
We may securely anticipate that , Under the superintending care of Colonel Walker , not only will the programme of operations in India be carried out with entire satisfaction , but .also that effectual provision will be made for that repetition of the determinations in England which is essential to the completion and full assurance of the scientific results of Captain Basevi 's labours in this great undertaking .
President 's Address .
1871 .
] The existence of a Lunar Atmospheric Tide , as indicated by differences of barometric pressure corresponding systematically to differences of the moon 's position relatively to the meridian , has received a further confirmation by the discussion by Mr. Bergsma , of the Royal Netherlands Observatory at Batavia , of a series of hourly observations of the barometric pressure at that Observatory , extending ( Sundays excepted ) from January 1866 to January 1869 , made specially with a view to this investigation .
The discussion is on the same plan ( slightly modified and thereby improved ) as that by myself of the observations at St. Helena , from October 1843 to September 1845 inclusive , in the Phil. Trans , for 1847 ; and that by Captain Elliot of the observations at Singapore , from 1841 to 1845 , in the Phil. Trans , for 1852 .
The results , as regards the existence of the periodic tide , are substantially the same in the three cases , but may probably be more approximatively exact in value in the more recent investigation .
Prom the observations of the three years at Batavia , Mr. Bergsma finds that the Lunar Tide has at that station two maxima and two minima .
The two highest barometric pressures are those for the lunar hours 1 and 13 , being the hours following the two passages of the moon through the meridian .
The two lowest pressures are those for the lunar hours 7 and 19 , being those following the two passages of the moon through the horizon .
The means found for each of the years 1866 , 1867 , and 1868 show nearly the same features as the means for the three years .
The difference between the mean of the two maxima and the mean of the two minima is 0*107 millim. at Batavia : this difference was found for St. Helena 0*094 millim. , and for Singapore 0*145 millim. The Fellows will remember that in my two last Addresses ( for 1869 and 1870 ) I referred to the valuable memoirs of Professor Heer , of Zurich , on the fossil plants brought of late , at various times , from the Arctic regions .
Professor Nordenskiold revisited the shores of West Greenland in 1870 ; and on learning that he had given the principal geological facts and fossils collected in that expedition to Professor Heer , I lost no time in communi- .
eating with the latter gentleman , and received from him ( through Mr. Robert Scott , F.R.S. , Director of the Meteorological Office ) a reply , which appeared to me so interesting that I placed it in the hands of Sir Charles Lyell , asking him , if he would be so kind , to furnish me with a notice sufficiently brief to be included in this Address .
He has done so , and I subjoin it in his own words :\#151 ; \#163 ; f The first voyage of Parry in 1819-20 made the naturalist acquainted with the marvellous fact that plants similar to " those of our ancient coal once flourished in Melville Island , lat. 75 ' N. ; 41 and now we learn more exactly , from the fruits of Nordenskiold 's late " Expedition , that the arctic plants of that early Palaeozoic period are not " only traceable over a wide area , but that not a few of them are identical " with European species ; and it is remarkable that the specimens which " have been brought from these high latitudes are equal in size and show 54 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30,1 " as vigorous a growth as those found fossil in Europe .
Plants that are \#171 ; comparatively modern , of Miocene date , discovered by various explorers " in Greenland and Spitzbergen , had already testified to the existence of a 1 " mild climate in Tertiary times , such as formerly prevailed in Central h Europe , and which , according to Heer , had probably reached to the pole ; " itself .
Now we learn , from the same eminent botanist , that the fossils f\lt ; brought in 1870 from Atarne and Atarnekerdluk , in Greenland , by Nor- " denskiold and his companions , throw light on the flora of a geological * " period , the Cretaceous , intermediate between the Carboniferous andMio- " cene ; for among these newly found fossils are plants referable both P to the Lower and Upper Cretaceous formation , which prove , says Pro- i " fessor Heer , that in these high latitudes , as in Central Europe , the ] P Lower Cretaceous flora consisted principally of Eerns , Conifers , and '\#163 ; Cycads ; while in the Upper Cretaceous , Dicotyledon es appear ; and both " these great divisions of the Upper Mesozoic flora show a warmer climate than the Miocene .
" It is satisfactory to learn that there is a probability that these researches will be resumed in 1872 by a second North-German Expedition to East Greenland .
The Scientific Institutions and establishments of our country have been honoured this summer by long and careful visits from His Majesty Pedro II .
, Emperor of Brazil , whose remarkable competence to appreciate such Institutions may be said to be universally recognized .
At a recent Meeting of the Royal Society , we have had the pleasure of enrolling His Majesty 's name in the List of our Eellows .
We have only to regret the Emperor 's unavoidable absence from our Meetings ; unavoidable because the Society having been in recess during his visit to England , the election could not have taken place until the new Session , when he had quitted our shores .
It was pleasing to hear on this occasion , from Eellows distinguished in different branches of science , the warm and competent testimony borne to his Majesty 's acquirements and to his rare scientific intelligence .
As your President , I have been called upon , by the Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science , to give evidence regarding the assistance which , in the course of the last fifty years , has been rendered from time to time by Her Majesty 's Government in the advancement of science , on the recommendation of the Scientific Institutions of the country , and especially on the recommendation of the Royal Society .
The evidence thus given has been printed by the direction of the Commission , and is procurable in the usual manner .
I proceed to the award of the Medals .
The Copley Medal has been awarded to Dr. Julius Robert Mayer , of Heil-bronn , for his researches on the Mechanics of Heat , including essays on:\#151 ; 1 , The Forces of Inorganic Nature ; 2 .

The Mechanical Equivaj lent of Heat .
_ '* .
^ I may presume that the last named , viz. the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat , though not the sole , is yet the principal ground on which the award of the Copley Medal was made ; and , so far as this may have been the case , the award may perhaps be considered to require some explanation on the part of the President and Council , inasmuch as this is the second of two Copley Medals awarded ( and , I believe , in each case rightly awarded ) for what may , perhaps , be mainly regarded as one and the same discovery , \#151 ; the later ( which is the present award to Dr. Mayer ) being for investigations earlier in date than those of our countryman Mr. Joule , to whom the first Medal of the two was awarded .
This seeming inconsistency can , I believe , be fully justified .
Seeing also the scientific interest of the history of the double investigation , I have thought it desirable to obtain a short but comprehensive notice on the subject from the able hands of our junior Secretary , Professor Stokes ; it is as follows:\#151 ; " In a paper published in 1842 , Mayer showed that he clearly conceived " the convertibility of falling force , or of the vis viva , which is its equiva- " lent or representative in visible motion , into heat , which again can dis- " appear as heat by reconversion into work or vis viva , as the case may be .
" He pointed out the mechanical equivalent of heat as a fundamental " datum , like the space through which a body falls in one second , to be " obtained from experiment .
He went further .
When air is condensed " by the application of pressure , heat , as is well known , is produced .
" Taking the heat so produced as the equivalent of the work done in com- " pressing the air , Mayer obtained a numerical value of the mechanical " equivalent of heat which , when corrected by employing a more precise " value of the specific heat of air than that accessible to Mayer , does not " much differ from Joule 's result .
This was undoubtedly a bold idea , " and the numerical value obtained by Mayer 's method is , as we now " know , very nearly correct .
Nevertheless it must be observed that an " essential condition in a trustworthy determination is wanting in Mayer 's " method ; the portion of matter operated on does not go through a cycle of " changes .
Mayer reasons as if the production of heat were the sole effect " of the work done in compressing air .
But the volume of the air is " changed at the same time , and it is quite impossible to say " whether this change may not involve what is analogous to the statical " compression of a spring , in which a portion , 'or even a large portion of the " work done in compression may have been expended .
In that case the " numerical result given by Mayer 's method would have been erroneous , " and might have been even widely erroneous .
Hence the practical cor- " rectness of the equivalent obtained by Mayer 's method must not lead us " to shut our eyes to the merit of our own countryman Joule , in being the " first to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat by methods which " are unexceptionable , as fulfilling the essential condition that no ultimate " change of state is produced in the matter operated upon , " QG Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30,1 Professor Miller , \lt ; As Dr. Mayer 's health and the inclemency of the weather , combined J with the length of the journey , deprive us of the pleasure of his presence 1 at our Meeting , I will request you to transmit this Medal to him , and with j it the assurance of our cordial respect and regard .
The Council has awarded a Royal Medal to Dr. John Stenhouse , F.E.S. , 1 for his researches on the Lichens and their proximate constituents and 1 derivatives , including erythrite , and for his researches on the action of -charcoal in purifying air .
Dr. Stenhouse , I have great pleasure in delivering to you this Medal , awarded to you 1 by the Eoyal Society for the long , laborious , and valuable researches with 1 which from time to time you have enriched our Transactions .
The Council has awarded a Eoyal Medal to Mr. George Busk , F.E.S. , | for his researches in Zoology , Physiology , and Comparative Anatomy .
Mr. Busk , I present you with this Medal in testimony of the appreciation by the 1 Eoyal Society of the results of your researches in Zoology , Physiology , and 1 Comparative Anatomy .
In conclusion , X desire to avail myself of this occasion to express my 1 warmest acknowledgments to the Fellows of the Society for the kind con- j sideration which I have received from them at all times and in all circum- 1 stances , and , in particular , for their attendance at , and thereby their sup- I port of , the President 's soirees , in which I have attempted to follow in the 1 footsteps of my predecessors .
Since the date of Sir Joseph Banks 's Presi- j dency , at the close of the last century , it has been regarded as the privilege j of the President to receive the Fellows , either at his own house or at that 1 of the Society , together with others whom he might think it would be 1 agreeable to them to meet .
There has thus been afforded to persons j engaged in mechanical or other inventions , auxiliary to science or other- | wise Connected therewith , a convenient opportunity for the exhibition J and discussion of their various apparatus .
The soirees have also been de- 1 scribed , and I believe justly so , as affording suitable opportunities for 1 the interchange of kindly feeling and good companionship between the 1 President and .
the Fellows .
I may venture to say that I have found I them thoroughly so in the ten years during which I have had the honour 1 of the Presidency ; and I beg to express my grateful acknowledgments J accordingly to the Fellows , collectively and individually .
