An Account Of Dr. Sydenham 's Book , entitled , Methodus Curandi Febres , Propriis observationibus superstructa .
This Book undertakes to deliver a more certain and more genuine Method of curing Fevers and Agues , than has obtained hitherto : And it being premised , First , that a Fever is Natures Engine , she brings into the field , to remove her enemy ; or her handmaid , either for evacuating the impurities of the blood , or for reducing it into a New State : Secondly , that the true and genuine cure of this sickness consists in such a tempering of the Commotion of the Blood , that it may neither exceed , nor be too languide : This , I say , being premised by the Author , he informs the Reader ; In the First Section , of the different Method , to be employed in the cure of Fevers , not only in respect of the differing constitutions and ages of the patients , but also in regard of the differing seasons of one and the same year , and of the difference of one year from another .
As to the Former , he shows , in what sorts of Patients , and at what time of the Fever , Phlebotomy , or Vomiting , or both , are to be used ; and when and where not : In what space of time the Depuration if nature be not disturbed or hindred in her work , will be performed : When Purgatives are to be administred : How that Diarrhea 's happen , if the Patient had in the beginning ning of the Fever an inclination to vomit , but no vomit was given ; and that those symptoms , which commonly are impured to a malignity , do , for the most part , proceed from the Relaxation of the tone of the Blood , caused by Medicines too refrigerating , or by the unseasonable use of Glisters in the declination of the disease .
As to the Latter , he observes , that one of the chief causes , rendring the Cure of Fevers so uncertain and unsuccessful , is , that Practitioners do accommodate their observations , they take from the successful cure of some Fevers in one season of the year , or in some one year , to that of all Fevers in any season , or in any year whatsoever .
And here he observes , first , how vigorous the blood is in the Spring , and how dispirited in Autumn ; and thence regulates the letting of blood , and Vomiting , and the giving of Glisters .
Next , how difficult it is , to assign the cause of the difference between the Fevers of Several years ; and to prognosticate of the salubrity or insalubrity of the following part of the year : where yet he insinuates , that , when Infects do swarm extraordinarily , and when Fevers and Agues ( especially Quartans ) appear very early , as about Midsummer , then Autumn commonly proves very sickly .
Lastly , what method and Cautions are to be used in the Cure of Epidemical Fevers .
In the Second Section , he treats of the Symptoms , accompanying Continued Fevers ; as Phrensies , Pleurisies , Coughs , Hicoughs , Fluxes , &amp;c. Showing , both whence they are caused , and how they are to be cured : Where having inserted a considerable Paragraph , touching a certain Symptomatical Fever in the Spring , to be cured like Plurisies ; he mentions among many Observables , this , as a chief one , that Laudanum , or any other Narcotick given against the Frenzy , in the beginning , progress , or height of a Fever , does rather hurt , than good , but in the declination thereof , is used with good success .
To all which he subjoins a particular account count of the Iliac Passion ( esteemed by him to be sometimes a Symptom also of Fevers ; ) not only discoursing of its cause ( a preposterous inversion of the Intestins , proceeding either from Obstruction , or Irritation , ) but adding also a very plain way of Curing the same ; and that not by the use of Quick-silver or Bullets ( by him judged to be frequently noxious ) but only by Mint water ; and the application of a Whelp to the Patients stomach ; to strengthen the same , and to reduce it again to its natural motion .
In the Third Section , he treats of Intermittent Fevers , or of Agues : Where he discourses of the times of the Cold and Hot fits , and of that of the Separation of the subdued aguish matter : Finds difficulty in giving a satisfactory account of the return of Fits : distinguishes Agues into Vernal and Autumnal : Takes notice , that as there are few Continued Fevers , so generally there are only Quotidians and Tertians , in the Spring ; and only Tertians and Quartans in Autumn ; Of which having offered Reasons , that seem considerable , he proceeds to his Method of curing them ; and , laying much weight upon the said difference , he prescribes and urges different ways to be used in that cure : Interserting among other things these notes ; First , that the Period of Fermentation in Fevers , both Continued and Intermittent , is ( if left to Natures own conduct , and well regulated , if need be , by Art ) performed in about 336 .
hours or 14 days ; subducting in Intermittent ones , the hours of intermission , and counting 51/ 2 hours for every Paroxism ; and imputing the excursion beyond that time to the disturbance given to nature by the error of Practitioners .
Secondly , that whoever hath had a Quartan formerly , though many years be passed , shall , if he chance to have another , be soon freed from it ; and that a Physician knowing that , may confidently predict this .
In the Fourth Section , the Author , in conformity to the Custom of those that write of Fevers , discourses of the Small-pox ; and First , examining the cause of this sickness and its universality , delivers his peculiar opinion of the bloud 's endeavouring a Renovation or a New Texture ( once at least in a Mans life ) and is inclined to prefer the same to the received doctrine of its malignity .
Then , having laid down , for a foundation of the Cure , the two times , of Separation and Expulsion , he argues as well against too high an Ebullition or too hasty a separation ( by a hot diet or high Cordials ) as against too languid a one ( by Blooding , Purges , and Cooling medicines .
) The like he does to the Time of Expulsion , forbidding both immoderate Heat(whereby Nature 's expelling operation is disturbed by a precipitated and too thick a crowd of the protruded pustuls , ) and too much Cooling , whereby due Expulsion is hindred .
In short , he advises , to permit Nature to do her own work , requiring nothing of the Physician , but to regulate her , when she is exorbitant , and to fortify her , when she is too weak .
He concludes all , with delivering a Model of the Method , he would use for his own only Son , if he should fall into this Sickness .
