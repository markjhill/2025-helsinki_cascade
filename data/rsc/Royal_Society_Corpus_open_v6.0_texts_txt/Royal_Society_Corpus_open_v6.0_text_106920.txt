V. A Supplement to the Measures of Trees , printed in the Philosophical Transactious for i7Sg .
By Robert Marsham , Esq. F. R. S. Read December 22 , 1796 .
THESE measures were all taken by myself , except the second , of the ash in Scotland ; and that I believe is fair .
As that is the largest ash , and as thriving as any I had seen , I was desirous to procure a second measure of it .
The measures ( where there was no impediment ) were taken at five feet from the earth , as the easiest height to run the line even , and a fair height for the bulk of the body .
For most trees ( at least oaks and chesnuts ) are frequently found to be one-third more in circumference at one foot than at five .
Where I have measures of more than one tree of the same kind , I give the largest and a smaller , to show the different proportion of the increase of their different sizes : and as trees standing single generally increase more than those in groves , I mark them with an S. and a G. as the difference is more than would be expected by those that think little of trees .
In 1719 I had about two acres sowed with acorns , and from 1729 to 1770 I planted oaks from this grove , always leaving the best plants standing for the future grove : but most of the transplanted trees are already larger than those that were not removed ; the largest of which is now ( 1795 ) but five feet 6 inches 8 tenths in circumference ; and the ktrgest trans. .
" planted , tree ( which was planted in 01:735 is 8 ft. 8 in .
7 tenths , viz , near 38 inches gained by transplanting in,6o year .
And in beeches : fromseed , in 1733 , the Iargest is now ( 1795 ) but 6 feet : inches ; Ad and the as largest transplanted 7beech -i 7 set H inches i tenth , viz. 8 inches larger , although the transplanted beech is eight years younger than that ; from the seed .
This proves that it is better to plant a grove , than to raise one from the seed .
The expense of plantingis -inconsiderable , and the planted trees are full as good and handsome ; and many years are saved , beside , thetextra:growth of planted tres .
Bt this extra growth will not prove near so great in:-groves as in single trees .
The first grove I planted from these sacornsof 1719 was in 1731 .
In 1732 I made another grove from them ; and in 1735 I planted a third grove from them ; and in 1753 the last considerable number of plants:v were : taken from ; the grove , and these are very good trees : so 34 years may be saved .
But I would by no means advise the planting trees so large , as the trouble and expense will be too much , unless where a shelter or screen is wanted .
Whether , a grove is to be raised from seeds , or planted , it is advisable to shelter it round ; if from the seed , with such sorts as will grow quicker ; and if by planting , with larger and , taller trees .
The soil in Norfolk is unfavourable to elms therefore in planting I will venture to recommend hornbeams , as they may be planted large trees .
I planted some hornbeams ( rather large ) in I 7y , and disliking their situation , in 1792 1 removed them when they were about three feet in circumference , and did not lose one tree ; and they made shoots of near half a yard that year ; but I ought to say I cut off their heads .
BeforeI quit this subject , Iwill presume to recommend , if ' young oaks are unthriving , -there is reason to hope they may be helped by cutting them down to a foot or six inches : for in 1750 I planted some oaks from my grove of 171g into a poorer soil , and although they lived , they were sickly ; so in 1761 I cut most of them down to one fot , and then by cutting off the side shoots , in three or four years led them into a single stem , and most of them are now thriving and handsome trees ; and you can hardly see where they were cut off , and some are four feet round and I have used the -same method , with un.healthy chesnuts , beech , hornbeam , andwych elm , and with the same success R.
