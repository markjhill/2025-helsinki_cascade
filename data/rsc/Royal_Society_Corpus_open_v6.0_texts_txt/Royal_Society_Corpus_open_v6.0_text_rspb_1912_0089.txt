19 Some Experiments ivith Arsenphenylg and Trypanosoma gambiense inGlossina palpalis .

( Communicated by Sir John Rose Bradford , K.C.M.G. , Sec. R.S. Received September 28 , \#151 ; Read November 14 , 1912 .
) The experiments detailed below were devised with a view to investigating the action of arsenic in the form of arsenphenylglycin upon Trypanosoma gambiense as carried by Glossina palpalis .
It was found convenient to deal with the subject under four separate enquiries\#151 ; I. Does the presence of arsenic in the blood ingested by a positive fly destroy the trypanosomes in that fly ?
II .
Does preliminary feeding of flies on blood containing arsenic have any effect on the subsequent development of trypanosomes in their interior ?
III .
If flies are fed on blood containing arsenic shortly after the infecting feeds on a gambiense monkey , are the flagellates still capable of development in the fly ?
If they can still develop , is the resultant strain arsenic-resistant in the blood ?
IV .
Has arsenphenylglycin any prophylactic action against the bite of a fly infected with T. gambiense , and , if so , what is the extent of this protection ?
In all these experiments it was deemed advisable to feed each box of flies for two consecutive days on the monkey in order to make certain , if possible , that each fly fed .
For the same reason special attention was given to each box of flies handled , with the result that it was found that flies reluctant to feed in the morning would often , if given another opportunity some hours later , bite with greater readiness .
In spite , however , of all precautions , it is impossible to be absolutely certain on this point .
In the great majority of cases the flies fed readily every day .
I. Does the Presence of Arsenic in the Blood imbibed clean an Infected Fly of its Flagellates ?
To answer this query boxes of laboratory-bred G. palpalis , known to be infective with T. gambiense , were placed upon monkeys which had previously received a subcutaneous dose of arsenphenylglycin , OT grm. per kilogramme body weight .
The experiments were commenced 24 to 48 hours after the administration of the drug , and subsequently the period of time was increased .
No change in the flagellates was discernible if the interval between the giving of the arsenic and the feeding exceeded 72 hours .
The flies were dissected by Miss Robertson at c 2 Dr. H. L. Duke .
Experiments with [ Sept. 28 , varying periods after the feeds upon the arsenic monkey .
I have here to express my indebtedness to her for the description of the flagellates found .
It was constantly noticed in the case of flies which had fed upon a recently inoculated monkey that the walls of the intestine were unduly brittle and friable , and clean dissection very difficult .
This was to a great extent avoided by starving such flies for several days after the ingestion of the arsenic blood before dissecting them .
In the following experiments various changes were noted in the flagellates in the fly , due presumably to the action of the drug in the blood imbibed:\#151 ; Expt. 29.\#151 ; Positive Box of Date .

It will be noted that for two consecutive days after feeding on the arsenic monkey this fly was infective to monkeys .
The condition in this fly affords strong confirmation of the theory that the salivary gland flagellates are the true infecting form .

Whether the condition of this fly is due to the original gut flagellates having escaped destruction by the arsenic , or whether in the 10 days which elapsed between the arsenic feeds and dissection the gut became reinfected from the salivary glands , cannot be decided .
In relation to the first alternative it is improbable that a fly would refuse to feed upon two successive days unless at the point of death .
The mortality after the arsenic feeds should be noted in this and other similar experiments .

Salivary gland :Numerous flagellates , but all dead ; shape perfectly normal .
Apparently this curious condition of the gland flagellates was due to the smoke .
The effect of this treatment is very marked ; the glands show a dark granular appearance very different from the clear transparent state to be observed in normal specimens .
This darkening of the glands proved by subsequent experiments to be a characteristic of smoke-killed flies .
This condition has never been observed in flies killed with chloroform .

The flagellates of these flies show less effect from the arsenic than is usual at this period .
It may be remarked , as justifying the conclusion that the above departures from the normal in the flagellates are due to the action of the drug , that such alteration in form and motility have never before been seen in positive flies .
The dead flies are removed every morning , and in the normal course of events the flagellates are always seen to be actively motile with no such morphological changes as those described above .
Moreover , in cases in which the normal flies have been left until the flagellates are moribund , death occurs without the characteristic swelling of the posterior part always to be observed in the presence of arsenic .

From the above experiments it will be seen that the flagellates in the gut of flies fed upon a monkey within 24 to 48 hours of the administration of arsenphenylglycin in doses of 0'1 grm. per kilogramme are markedly affected .
The flagellates in the salivary glands are apparently not injured in any way , nor does the fly lose its power of infecting .
This evidence supports the theory that the salivary gland flagellates are the normal infecting agents .
In a paper shortly to be published , Miss Eobertson brings forward a further mass of evidence to support this conclusion .
There is no reason to doubt that the secretion of the salivary gland is poured out into the wound made by the fly 's proboscis at the commencement of the act of feeding .
Whether or not this process is repeated during the course of feeding cannot well be determined .
These functions of the salivary gland and its contained flagellates are well borne out by the interrupted feeding experiment to be referred to shortly .
It is plain that any attempt to clean a positive fly of its flagellates by feeding it upon an animal whose blood contains arsenic will fail , as the gland flagellates will not come into contact with the drug .
II .
Has the Preliminary Feeding of Flies on Arsenic-containing Blood any Effect on the Subsequent Development of the Flagellates in their Interior The first pair of experiments , Nos. 336 and 337 , devised to elucidate this point proved fruitless , as no positive flies were found either in the arsenic box or its control .

This is an extremely backward state of development for the age of the fly .
From these experiments it appears that ingestion of arsenic blood immediately after the infecting feeds checks subsequent development of flagellates in the fly .
IV .
To Investigate the Prophylactic Properties of Arsenphenylglycin against the Bite of G. palpalis Infected with T. gambiense .
In a paper summarised in the ' Sleeping Sickness Bulletin/ No. 24 , vol. 13 , Mesnil and Kerandel give some experiments dealing with the prophylactic action of arsenphenylglycin against inoculation of T. gambiense into monkeys .
The following experiments were undertaken on similar lines , but only the smaller doses used by the French observers were employed .
Thus in the first series 04 grm. of the drug per kilogramme was inoculated subcutaneously ; in the second 0*05 grm. per kilogramme .
Such proportions when applied to man involve a relatively enormous dose of the arsenphenylglycin .
Nevertheless , although the practical application of the results given below may be very limited , the much greater potency of the drug against the fly infection is of considerable interest .
In undertaking such experiments with living flies an obvious difficulty arises in the uncertainty as to whether the infected fly has fed upon the experimental animal .
To insure this as far as possible without at the same time vitiating the exactness of the experiment , each box of flies was placed upon the monkey for two consecutive days , and on each day repeated efforts were made if the flies showed reluctance to feed .
In the great majority of Dr. H. L. Duke .
Experiments ivith [ Sept. 28 , cases a day 's starvation before the experiment commenced insured vigorous feeding of all the flies .
Again , considerable time must often elapse before an infected box of flies is obtained , a large number of boxes having to be rejected after some 30 days ' observation , owing to the flies proving non-infective .
It was thus found necessary on several occasions to employ a positive box for several different experiments .
Also , owing to the great sacrifice of experimental animals involved in testing the infectivity of each box , it was sometimes found necessary to employ untested boxes , relying on the ultimate dissection of the flies to prove their infectivity .
Fortunately two monkeys were available which proved highly infective to flies .
Thanks to a large number of experiments carried out by Miss Robertson , m which these two animals were employed for the infecting feeds , it became evident that flies infected from either of these monkeys were invariably infective bj the 30th day of the experiment , and often several days earlier .
This fact , together with the observation derived from Miss Robertson 's experiments that the infectivity of the fly coincided with the invasion of the salivary glands by the flagellates\#151 ; made it possible to employ untested boxes as above described .
All such boxes were kept until the 32nd day , and then assumed to be infective .
If on subsequent dissection no + flies were found , then the box was ignored .
In the following tables it is stated whether or not a tested box was employed .
It will be noted that in positive Experiment 757 only untested boxes were used .
The following facts must also be considered as having an important bearing on the present series of experiments :\#151 ; 1 .
The mere introduction of the proboscis of a positive fly into the skin of its victim can produce infection .
This was proved by Fraser and myself by an experiment in which interrupted feeding was employed , and is in agreement with the contention that the salivary gland flagellates are responsible for infection .
Thus a fly need not have actually extracted any blood to have infected the monkey .
2 .
A single positive fly can infect a clean monkey on three consecutive days .
This experiment was reported by me to the Royal Society in April , 1912 .
This applies to the occasional employment of the same box in different experiments on consecutive days .

In many cases boxes had to be ignored owing to their proving negative on dissection .
Each monkey was kept under observation for a considerable time in consideration of the enormous incubation period reported in certain experiments byMesnil and Kerandel where trypanosomes appeared only after 39 days .
No such phenomenon occurred here .
Thus a dose of arsenphenylglycin of 01 grm. per kilogramme will protect a monkey against infection by positive palpalis if given within 12 days before exposure .

Using the inoculation method of infection , Mesnil and Kerandel proved that 0'05 grm. of this drug per kilogramme was capable of protecting a monkey from infection up to within three days of the administration of the drug .
Conclusions .
I. By feeding a G. palpalis which is infective with T. gambiense on an animal whose blood contains arsenic administered within 24 to 48 hours , the gut flagellates in the fly may be destroyed .
Those of the salivary glands , however , which are the infecting forms , are unaffected .
It is highly probable that the gut may become repopulated with flagellates from the salivary glands .

III .
The feeding of flies on arsenic-containing blood immediately after the imbibition of T. gambiense usually prevents further development of the trypanosomes in the fly .
In the event of development occurring the strain produced is not arsenic-fast .
IY .
Arsenphenylglycin exerts a prophylactic effect in a monkey against infection with T. gambiense by positive ; this effect varies with the dosage employed , and is considerably greater than when the trypanosomes are introduced by direct inoculation of infected blood .

] The G-regarine described in the following account was first observed by one of us , in autumn , 1909 , in the alimentary canal of fleas\#151 ; Rothschild\#151 ; from a sand-martin 's nest.* We have since collected , from several localities in the Scottish Lowlands , numerous larval , pupal , and adult specimens of C. styx , in which we have observed the various phases of development of the parasite .
We have also dissected about 500 fleas of other species , in order to determine whether they also harboured the Gregarine which we had found in C. styx .
The species examined were C. farreni , Rothsch .
, from nests of the house-martin ; C. Schrank , from nests of the blue-tit , f the blackbird , the thrush , and the robin ; * The Rev. J. Waterston had previously reported that he had noticed in a specimen of C. styx , mounted whole , after having been partially cleared in caustic potash , a rounded body of doubtful nature .
He kindly obtained for us other examples of C. styx from the locality in which he had collected the specimen referred to .
These proved to contain the vegetative phases of the parasite described in this account .
t Most of the batches of C. gallince examined were from the nests of the blackbird and the thrush , and were found to be either free from Gregarines or infected in very small degree only .
But a heavily infected colony was found in the nest of a blue-tit , taken
