( Abstract .
) The class Sphenophyllales , of which the fossil described is a new representative , shows on the one hand clear affinities with the Equise-tales , while on the other it approaches the Lycopods ; some botanists have endeavoured to trace a relation to the Ferns .
The nearest allies among recent plants are probably the Psilotacese , which some writers have even proposed to include in the Sphenophyllales .
The new strobilus appears to find its natural place in the type-genus Sphenophyllum , as at present constituted , but it possesses peculiar features of considerable importance , which may probably ultimately justify generic separation .
The specimen , of which a number of transverse and longitudinal sections have been prepared by Mr. Lomax , is from one of the calcareous nodules of the Lower Coal-Measures of Lancashire , and was found at Shore Littleborough , a locality rich in petrified remains , now being opened up by the enterprise of the owner , Mr. W. H. Sutcliffe .
The close affinity of the strobilus with Sphenophyllum is shown by the anatomy of the axis , which has the solid triarch wood characteristic of that genus , and by the fact that the whorled sporophylls are divided into dorsal and ventral lobes , as in all other known fructifications of this class .
But , whereas , in all the forms hitherto described , the lower or dorsal lobes are sterile , forming a system of protective bracts , while the ventral lobes alone bear the sporangia ; in the new cone , dorsal and ventral lobes are alike fertile , and no sterile bracts are differentiated .
On this ground the name Sphenophyllum fertile is proposed for the new species .
Each lobe of the sporophyll divided palmately into several segments , the sporangiophores , each of which consisted of a slender pedicel , terminating in a large peltate lamina , on which two pendulous sporangia were borne .
In the bi-sporangiate character of the sporangiophores , and in other details of structure , Sphenophyllum fertile approaches the Bowmo/ nites Romeri of Count Solms-Laubach , while in the form and segmentation of the sporophylls there is a considerable resemblance to the Lower Carboniferous genus Cheirostrobus .
The wall of the sporangium has a rather complex structure , the most interesting feature in which is the well-defined small-celled stomium , marking the line of longitudinal dehiscence .
Convergence of Infinite Series of Analytic Functions .
315 The spores , so far as observed , are all of one kind ; they are ellipsoidal in form , with longitudinal crests or ridges ; their dimensions are 90\#151 ; 96 g in length by 65\#151 ; 70 g in width .
The most characteristic point in the structure of the new cone\#151 ; the fertility of both dorsal and ventral lobes of the sporophyll\#151 ; is regarded as more probably due to special modification than to the retention of a primitive condition .
