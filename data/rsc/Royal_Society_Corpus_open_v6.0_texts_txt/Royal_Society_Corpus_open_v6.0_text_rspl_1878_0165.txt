On the spi , wl centre e:chai1stell by the effects of operative procedure , exposure , etc. Restoration to activity fol]ows the passage up or own the cor\lt ; l of a current for 1-2 Gro , \#183 ; c 's cells .
Such restoration the author does not think it possible to attribute in every case to the presence of fa , vouring katelectrotonus ; it must be set down to a stimulation by the current per se .

On the spinal ce11ires of hearts inhibited by stimulating with strong NaCl solutions the upper exposed end of the cord of a decapttated frog .
The electrodes were inserted into the spinal canal through windows in the 5th and 7th or 8th vertebraJ arches .
Under these circumstances the hearls cannot be sot going ; by passing a current through the spinal centres , unless , perhaps , when the current is very strong ( from 5-6 Grove 's ) ; and then only when the anode is ubove the spinal centres , and , therefore , in a position to intercept the descending inhibitory stimulus by means of the aneleotrotonic state which it induces .
