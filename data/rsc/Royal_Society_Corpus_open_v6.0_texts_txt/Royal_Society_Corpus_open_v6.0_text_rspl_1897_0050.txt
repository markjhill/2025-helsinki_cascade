In continuation of our examination of the dielectric constants of frozen electrolytes at very low temperatures , we have subjected to of Frozen Electrolytes at very Low Temperatures .
381 test ( in the manner described in a former abstract)* another large series of electrolytes .
Referring to the above-mentioned abstract for an account of the details of the method , we merely give in the following Tables the results of our observations on the dielectric constants of many aqueous solutions of metallic salts , which have been taken with the object of determining if possible the causes which create high or low dielectric values at low temperatures .
The dielectric observations were all taken at a frequency of electro-motive force reversal of 120 .
We have taken , in the first place , a large series of observations on electrolytes with the same base ( sodium ) , but different acid radicles , and then a number with the same acid radicle but different bases .
Also , we have examined normal and corresponding acid salts , double salts , and many salts taken in such proportion with water as to yield the so-called cryohydrates .
The following tables give the details of the dielectric measurements .

303 The whole of the observations in the foregoing tables are delineated graphically in the charts in figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Jn the case of each dielectric measurement a preliminary resistance measurement was generally made to determine the electrical resistance of the frozen electrolyte .
It wras invariably found that in the case of all the true electrolytic solutions , the electrical resistance of the dielectric at the temperature of liquid air was exceedingly large , generally exceeding many thousands of megohms .
As the temperature of the dielectric rose the electrical resistance fell down , often very quickly , to a fraction of a megohm , and , long before the melting point of the electrolyte was reached , quite considerable conductive power always made its appearance in the frozen electrolytic solution .

-175-2 7-0 0-5 The observations in the last table show the rapid rate at which a frozen alcoholic solution of potash increases in conductivity between very narrow limits of temperature , whilst the experiments with the frozen solutions of sodic chloride and potassic iodide show the same kind of change , but less rapid , in the case of aqueous electrolytes .
In each case we have very considerable conductivity in a solid condition far below the melting point of the electrolyte , but , at the same time , exceedingly high resistance at the temperature of hqmd On looking at the chart of curves it will be seen that the general of Frozen Electrolytes at very Low Temperatures .
395 form of the dielectric temperature curve is not unlike the magnetisation curve of a ferro-magnetic body or a vapour tension curve .
In most of the curves there is within a certain range of temperature a fall more or less sudden from a high value of the dielectric constant to a low value .
As regards the value of the dielectric constants of frozen electrolytes at the temperature of liquid air , the salts employed by us may be divided into three broad classes:\#151 ; I. Those which , when added to water in percentages from 5 to 50 , do not much affect the dielectric constant of the water when it is frozen ; and which , at the temperature of liquid air , have dielectric constants not far from 25 , or lying between 2 and 3 .
Such salts are sodic bicarbonate , sodic potassic bichromate , potassic bicarbonate , sodic chloride , baric chloride , potassic iodide , sodic nitrite , sulphide , cupric carbonate .
These include the acid salts and halogen salts .
II .
Those salts which , when added to water in percentages from 5 to 50 , raise the dielectric constant of the water somewhat and which yield frozen electrolytes , having , at the temperature of liquid air , dielectric constants lying between 3 and 10 , that of pure ice at the same temperature being 25 .
Such salts are potassic chromate , sodic sulphate , sodic chlorate , cadmic boro-tungstate , sodic acetate , potassium sulphate , plumbic nitrate .
These are all highly oxygenated salts .
III .
Salts which , when added to water in percentages from 5 to 50 , yield electrolytes which , if frozen , have immensely dielectric constants , than pure ice at the temperature of liquid air , viz. , values from 30 to 70 .
, Such salts are sodic carbonate , sodic biborate , sodic hyposulphite , sodic silicate , hydrodiso phosphate , potassium ferro-cyanide .
it will be noticed that whenever we have tested a normal salt and an acid salt of the same base , such as a carbonate and a bicarbonate , a chromate and a bichromate , a sulphate and a bisulphate , the acid salt always has the lower dielectric constant of the two at the temperature of liquid air .
With the exception of sodium carbonate , potassium ferrocyanide , and hydrodisodic phosphate , the whole of the dielectric curves seem to be tending downwards in such a way as to show that at somewhat lower temperatures than we have at command , the whole of these frozen electrolytes would have dielectric constants not far from that of pure ice .
In other words , would be reduced to values probably near 2 or 3 .
There seems now a fair amount of evidence to show that with a 396 Proceedings and List of Papers read .
few exceptions all frozen electrolytes would , in all probability , if reduced to temperatures not far above the absolute zero , have their dielectric constants approximately equal , and reduce to a value not far from 2 or 3 .
At the same time the electric resistivity of such frozen electrolytes would tend to become infinite as the temperature is continuously reduced .
In the very great labour of taking and reducing the above numerous observations , Mr. J. E. Petavel has rendered us much valuable service .
