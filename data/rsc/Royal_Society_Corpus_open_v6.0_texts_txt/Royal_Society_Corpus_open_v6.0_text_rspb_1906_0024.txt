A study of variation and correlation in conjugating and non-conjugating specimens of the common ciliate infusorian , Paramcecium was undertaken for the purpose of obtaining answers to the following questions:\#151 ; a. Is the portion of the Paramcecium population which is in a state of conjugation at a given time differentiated in respect of type or variability or both from the non-conjugating portion of the population living in the same culture at the same time ?
b. Is there any tendency for like to pair with like ( " homogamy " ) in the conjugation of Paramcecium , and if so , how strong is this tendency ?
The material on which this paper is based is comprised in eight series , taken from three different cultures at different times , and includes altogether the measurements of 1894 individual Paramcecia .
The characters studied were length and greatest breadth of the body , length-breadth index , and the difference in length between the two individuals of a pair of conjugants .
In the measuring conjugant pairs were taken quite at random , and then in each case the two undistorted non-conjugant individuals which were lying-nearest in the field of view of the microscope to the conjugant pair were measured .
This procedure was followed to avoid any sub-conscious bias in choosing non-conjugants .
The cultural history of the different series may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; .
Series A , C , D , and E.\#151 ; These series all came from a single culture in the Zoologisches Institut , at Leipzig .
This culture was set with dry hay and pond water , July 25 , 1905 .
The dates of collection and measurement and number of individuals in each series are given in the table on p. 378 .
SeriesB.\#151 ; This series came from another culture at Leipzig set in the same manner as the one just mentioned .
Conjugants were found on August 22 , but in very small numbers .
On the next day only two pairs of conjugants were found , and after that none at all .
So that , all told , Series B included only 12 pairs of conjugants and 24 non-conjugants .

Au examination of the variation constants shows that Paramaecium is relatively slightly more variable in breadth than in length of body , though the difference is not large .
For the variation in length the coefficients of variability for different series ( including several other long series besides those collected in this work ) are found to cluster well together about a value of 8 to 9 per cent. This is a much lower value than has been found by other workers- !
- for variation in similar size characters in organisms with firm exoskeletons .
In the characters studied Paramsecium follows the same general laws which have been shown to hold for continuous variation in higher forms .
3 .
It was found that conjugants are markedly differentiated from non-eonjugants living in the same culture in both type and variability .
This differentiation includes all the characters studied .
An idea of its extent and direction may be gained by an examination of the following table .
In it are given ( a ) the absolute differences between conjugants and non-conjugants in respect to the character and constant designated ; the probable errors of these absolute differences ; ( c ) the relative differences defined as the percentage which the absolute difference is of the non-conjugant constant in each case .
The absolute differences are taken as positive when the non-conjugant constant is greater .
Only two series ( A and C ) are taken here as illustrations .

The same is true for the organic correlations between length and breadth .
The conjugant individuals , when compared with non-conjugants , are found to be shorter and narrower , and less variable in both length and breadth .
The conjugants have a lower mean index\#151 ; or , in other words , are relatively more slender\#151 ; and are more variable in shape of body , as indicated both by length-breadth index and by the organic correlation between length and breadth .
The conjugants have the length and breadth less highly correlated than the non-conjugants .

To determine whether there was any definite tendency for like to pair with like ( homogamy ) in the conjugation of Paraniaecium , the correlation between the two members of conjugant pairs was determined for ( a ) the * The higher variability of the length-breadth index in the eonjugants really arises from the fact that the organic correlation between length and breadth is much lower in conjugants than in non-conjugants .

The only quantitative determinations of the degree of homogamy in any organism which have hitherto been made , are those for assortative mating in man , made by Pearson and his collaborators.f For the characters so far investigated in man , the coefficients of direct homogamy fall uniformly below 0*3 .
It is evident that we are dealing here with a much more intense assortative pairing .
For the other characters , breadth and index , the direct homogamic correlations are not so high as for length , though still relatively large .
Taking the means of the results for the different series , I find for the direct homogamic correlation of breadth with breadth r \#151 ; 0-3028 , and for the correlation of index with index r = 04291 .
The cross homogamic correlations ( length of A with breadth of B and vice 'versa ) were found to be low in all cases .
The average value of the coefficients for these cross correlations was 0-1082 .
It will be noted that the homogamic correlations are in all cases positive .
5 .
In order to test whether the observed homogamic correlations were real or spurious , various sorts of random pairings were tried .
The first question which might be raised is as to what would be the value of the coefficients measuring homogamy , provided we experimentally paired together conjugants or non-conjugants quite at random .
This has been done several times loi * A and 15 refer respectively to the iirst and second individuals of a conjugant pait to be measured .

381 each series of measurements with entirely uniform results .
The coefficients , measuring direct homogamy in random pairs of ( a ) conjugants ; ( b ) non-con jugants ; or ( c ) pairs in which one member is a conjugant and the other a non-conjugant , are uniformly zero within the limits of the probable errors .
It might be maintained that since at different points in the culture and at different times the environment no doubt differs slightly , there would be a corresponding differentiation of the Paramtecia in each local unit of the culture .
Then even though the pairing were really quite at random in each locality , yet if the records for several such localities were mixed , a spurious homogamic correlation would arise .
Now it is clear that if the observed homogamic correlations were spurious and due to this " local differentiation " factor , we ought to get sensibly as high values if we consider as a pair the two individuals lying nearest in the field of view to each pair of conjugants measured .
Such pairs will have come from the same environment and have been killed at the same instant as the actually conjugated pairs .
The homogamic correlations for these pairs of individuals , lying nearest to conjugant pairs , have been determined and found to be sensibly zero , taking into account their probable errors .
This I take to prove that the observed homogamic correlations are not to be explained as due to local differentiation within the culture .
G. The existence of a high degree of assortative pairing with respect to length can be shown in another way .
We may consider as a character of conjugant pairs the difference in length between the two members .
Forming frequency distributions of this difference for ( ) conjugated pairs ; ( 6 ) random pairs of conjugants ; and ( c ) random pairs of non-con jugants ( the two individuals lying nearest each conjugant pair measured ) , I find that the mean difference in microns is from two to three times greater in the random pairs\#151 ; whether of conjugants or non-conjugants\#151 ; than it is in the actually conjugated pairs .
In more than 60 per cent , of the conjugated pairs , the two members differ in length by less than 8 microns .
There is a much greater " scatter " of the variates about the mean in the case of the random pairs as compared with the conjugated pairs .
These results for the difference distributions are , of course , what would be expected if there is a high degree of homogamy in respect to length .
7 .
In order to determine whether the observed homogamic correlations are due to a real " assorting " in the pairing , or , on the other hand , arise from some process of equalisation in size occurring after union has taken place , the following test was made :\#151 ; Two series of conjugants were measured and the homogamic correlations calculated .
In the first of these series were included only pairs which were known , on the basis of their nuclear condition , Dr. R. Pearl .
A Biometrical [ Nov. 15 , to be in very early stages of the conjugation process .
In the second series were included only pairs which , on the same basis of nuclear condition , were known to be about to separate shortly .
Now if the observed homogamy is a result of an equalisation of the members of the pairs in size during the conjugation process itself , clearly the second of these two series ought to show the higher homogamic correlations , because the individual pairs are in late stages , and we should expect to get the maximum effect of any equalisation which had occurred .
As a matter of fact the coefficients of direct homogamy in length are 0-6797 + 0-0307 for the " early " series and 0-6212 + 0-0334 for the " late " series .
The coefficients are sensibly equal for the two , with what advantage there is in favour of the " early " rather than the " late " series .
From this it is concluded that the observed homogamy is not due to an equalisation in size during the conjugation process itself .
8 .
From evidence which is discussed in detail in the complete paper , it appears probable that the observed homogamic correlations arise as the result of a process , the essential factors in which may be outlined as follows : ( a ) At the periods of conjugation the individuals which are to conjugate are in a so-called " miscible " condition in which the oral surfaces are adhesive ; ( b ) as a result of the action of the currents , produced by the oral groove cilia , two individuals which by chance happen to be swimming parallel and close to one another are drawn together and their oral surfaces adhere in whole or in part ; ( c ) the extreme anterior ends of the oral grooves firmly adhere to one another first ; ( d ) if the two individuals are so nearly the same size that the mouths approximately coincide when the anterior ends are together , firm union occurs at the mouth regions , and definite conjugation follows ; ( e ) if , on the other hand , the mouths do not approximately coincide , the individuals separate again or die and no conjugation results ; ( / ) the homogamic correlations arise then as a result of the necessity for the mouths of the two individuals to come together ( or " fit " ) when the extreme anterior ends are united .
Individuals in which the distances from the anterior end to the mouth are approximately equal , will not be greatly different in total length , and hence their lengths will be correlated .
The direct homogamic correlations for breadth and index , and the cross homogamic correlations , are held on this view to have arisen because of the organic correlation between length and breadth in the individual .

In concluding , some of the theoretical bearings of the work are discussed .
It is pointed out that if the results obtained in this work with reference to the existence of a differentiated " conjugant type " are true , they 1905 .

are of considerable significance in connection with current views regarding the theoretical relation of the Protozoa to evolutionary problems .
The results show clearly that , so far as the present material is concerned at least , ( a ) there is a differentiated " conjugant type " of Paramaecium ; and ( b ) that this " conjugant type " is relatively fixed and constant under varying environmental conditions , as compared with the type of the general population in fission generations .
If the individual Paramaecia of a given race must conform to a definite and relatively fixed morphological type every time they conjugate , what they may acquire during fission generations is clearly of no particular account to the evolutionary history of the race in the long run .
Real evolutionary progress will depend on changes in the " conjugant type , " just as in the Metazoa real evolutionary progress depends on changes in the germ cells rather than in the soma .
Attention is called to the significance which a high degree of homogamy , whenever it exists , must have as a factor in divergent evolution .
A high degree of homogamy furnishes at once the means whereby a new variety or species may be differentiated from a parent species , though both continue to live together in the same area or environment .
Because , if like mates with like , with any considerable regularity or uniformity , whenever individuals appear showing deviations from the general population , those which have on the whole like deviations will tend to mate together rather than with individuals imlike themselves belonging to the parent stock .
Hence , the variations will not be " swamped by intercrossing " before natural selection has an opportunity to act on them .
Hitherto , the existence of a high degree of homogamy has not been demonstrated quantitatively in any organism living in a state of nature .
The results of the present work show that not only is such a degree of homogamy possible under natural conditions , but that it actually exists in one case of what must be considered as the simplest forerunner of the sexual processes of higher organisms , namely , the conjugation of a protozoon .
