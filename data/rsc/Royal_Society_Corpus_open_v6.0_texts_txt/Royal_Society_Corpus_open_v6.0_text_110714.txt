Description of a Percussion Shell to explode at the bottom of the Sea .
By Captain J. Norton .
Communicated by S. Hunter Chris ?
the , Esq. , M.A. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. An iron tube , like the barrel of a musket , is screwed into a shell of any size , water-tight .
A rod of iron , about half a pound in weight and a foot in length , is suspended within the tube , by means of a split quill passing through a hole in the upper end of the rod , the other end being armed with a percussion-cap .
The mouth of the tube is closed with a screw lid also water-tight .
Tin or brass wings being attached to the upper end of the tube will keep it in a vertical position during its descent to the bottom of the sea ; and the shock on its striking the bottom will cause the bar of iron within the tube to fall , and produce the percussion and explosion .
Should it be found difficult to make the shell water-proof , I am satisfied that percussion powder made from silver will explode by friction or percussion even when mixed with water .
