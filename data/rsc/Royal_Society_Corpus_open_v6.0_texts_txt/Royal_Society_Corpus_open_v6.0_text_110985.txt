" On the Heat disengaged during Metallic Substitutions .
" By Thomas Andrews , M.D. , M.R.I.A. , Vice-President of Queen 's College , Belfast , &amp;c. Communicated by Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. &amp;c. In a paper which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1844 , the author deduced from the experimental inquiry there recorded the general law , that when one base displaces another from any of its neutral combinations with an acid , the heat evolved or abstracted is always the same , whatever that acid element may be , provided the bases are the same .
Extending a similar inquiry to salts with metallic bases , he establishes , as the result of the investigation of which an account is given in the present paper , the general principle that when an equivalent of one and the same metal replaces another in a solution of any of its salts of the same order , the heat developed is , with the same metals , constantly the same , the expression " of a solution of the same order " being understood to mean a solution in which the same precipitate is produced by the addition of an alkali , or , on one view of the composition of such salts , in which the metal exists in the same state of oxidation .
The metallic salts , in the precipitation of which by other metals the evolved heat was ascertained , were those of copper precipitated by zinc , iron or lead ; of silver , precipitated by zinc or copper ; and of lead , mercury , and platinum precipitated by zinc : and the acid elements were either the sulphuric , hydrochloric , acetic or formic acids .
From the last series of experiments the author deduces , that if three metals A , B , and C , be so related that it is capable of displacing B and C from their combinations , and also B capable of displacing C , then the heat developed in the substitution of A for C will be equal to that developed in the substitution of B for C ; and a similar rule may be applied to any number of metals similarly related .
