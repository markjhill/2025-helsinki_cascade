From the circumstance that azotic gas is frequently evolved from thermal springs , the author infers that this phenomenon is in some way connected with volcanic action ; and this he considers to be the case in the instance observed by Dr. Davy , although referred by him to the decomposition of atmospheric air during putrefaclive processes going on at the bottom of the sea .
Dr , Daubeny offers objections to the theory of that gas rising to the surface in consequence of the high temperature to which it has been subjected .
He conceives that the air which Dr. Davy examined cannot have been derived from seawater , but must have originated from the atmosphere itself , with which the volcano communicated .
The author is disposed to attach great importance to the accurate examination of the gases given out by warm springs , and recommends the prosecution of the inquiry .
