Remarks on the Extractive Material of Urine , and on the Excretion of Sulphur and Phosphorus by the Kidneys in an unoxidized state .
" By Edmund Ronalds , Ph. D. , Giessen .
Communicated by Golding Bird , M.D. , F.R.S. In the course of an experimental inquiry in which the author was engaged with a view to ascertain whether larger quantities of carbon were discharged by the kidneys in cases in which the functions of the lungs or liver were imperfectly performed , he was led to the result , that sulphur , not combined with oxygen in the form of sulphuric acid , existed in the urine to the amount of from three to five grains in the course of a day ; and also that phosphorus , not in the state of phosphate , was in the same period excreted by the same channel , to the extent of nearly six grains .
