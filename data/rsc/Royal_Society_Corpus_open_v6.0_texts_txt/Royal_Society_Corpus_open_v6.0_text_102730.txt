T ) Y the Eqble Evolatio7s of a Circle , I mean such a gra- D dual approach of its Periferie to ReAitsde , as ehat all its parts do together , and equally cvolve or llnbend : or fo that the fatne Line becomes fuccefIively a leSs and less Arc of a reci- procally greater Circle .
2 , Let AHKA ( Fig. 6 .
) be the Periferie of a Circle .
AEa Tangent to the poine A. Let this Circular Line be luppos 'd cut or divided ar A , and rhen to unbend ( like a Spring ) its upper end remaining fixt to its Tangent AE , whil{ } the other parts do Equally Etaolve or extend themielves thorougll all the degrees ot less Curvature ( as in ABD , ANIC .

) till they become firaight in coincidence with the Tangent AE .

Joyn the fixt end A , and the mo- -ving end G by che Chord-line AC , interfeEting the firR Cir- cle at El .
I fiy that AMC is a like Segment tO An H ) cut off in the firi } Circle by the Chord A H. For , by the fuppo- fition of AMC is the Arc of a Circle &gt; having AE a Tangent cotemorl both tO i-t and An H , and both A-rcs are terminated in the fame Right-line AC .

Hence the Curv ADCE ( defcrib 'd by the moving end of the Periferie in its Evolution ) may be thus conrfrubted .
Let the Circle AHKA be by biCedions divided into any num- ber of equal parts .
Let H be one of the points of such divi- from .
Then fay , as the number of equal parts in the Arc A-t1A : istothe-number of parts in the wholePeriferie ^9^ HK A : : fo is the Chord A H : to a fourth Line , which let be AC in AH produc 'd .
