[ May 15 , thermo-electric and voltaic action at the cathode and external junction , very different amounts of resistance , large in some cases , remain , and are exercised by different metals as cathodes , and those differences of resistance are only to a small extent due to heat and current absorbed in liberating hydrogen , and can only in a few cases be partly accounted for by chemical action , films , or absorption of gases at the cathode .
I am now investigating the nature of this resistance , and the relations of the resistance to various circumstances .

" By Sir John Conroy , Bart. , M.A. Communicated by Professor G. G. Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received May 6 , 1884 .
Professor Stokes recently communicated to the Royal Society ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 36 , p. 187 ) an account of some determinations I had made of the amount of light reflected by steel and speculum metal mirrors when polarised light was incident upon them .
I have repeated these experiments with films of silver chemically deposited on glass , as such films approximate more closely to theoretically perfect metallic surfaces than any metallic mirror , however carefully polished , and also because very different statements have been made as to the reflective power of such films ; one observer having said that silvered glass mirrors reflect about 90 per cent , of the light incident upon them , whilst another made their reflective power only equal to that of speculum metal .
1884.1 Some Experiments on Metallic Reflection .
'6l I had hoped to have made some observations of the amount of light reflected by films of different thicknesses , which I had proposed to obtain in the same way as those used in the experiments of which an account was given in the " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 31 , p. 486 , but after numerous trials , extending over a period of nearly two months , failed to obtain any suitable films .
Although the same process was used ( Martins , " Ann. de Chim .
, 4th series , vol. xv , p. 94 ) the silvered surfaces were never perfectly bright when removed from the solution , as had been the case with those prepared for the experiments already referred to .
A few minutes ' rubbing with a chamois leather was sufficient to render the mirrors perfectly bright , but the thin deposits of silver obtained by removing the glass plates from the solution before the action is at an end , are not sufficiently coherent to withstand the necessary amount of friction .
The first set of photometric determinations were made with a silver film deposited on a flat and well-polished glass plate 76'5 millims. long and 51 millims. wide ; after being rubbed with a piece of chamois leather the surface was perfectly bright , and when compared with the speculum metal mirror in the way suggested by Professor Stokes ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 35 , p. 36 ) the silvered surface appeared slightly the best of the two .
The glass plate was weighed before and after being coated with silver , and the weight of the film was found to be 0*0035 grm. ; assuming the density of the silver to be 10*62 , that being the value for silver finely divided by precipitation given in " Watts 's Dictionary , " vol. v , p. 277 , the thickness of the film calculated from the area and weight was 0*00008447 millim. , or about the same as the thickest of the films used in the experiments already referred to .
The film appeared opaque by ordinary daylight , but when examined with sunlight was seen to be slightly transparent and of a deep blue colour .
The photometrical determinations were made in exactly the same way as those with the speculum metal and steel mirrors ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 36 , p. 187 ) , and the observations were about as concordant as those contained in the Tables I and II of the paper giving an account of the- experiments .
Two complete series of observations were made with light polarised in , and perpendicularly to , the plane of incidence , and the results are given in Tables I and II .
The angles of incidence are given in the first column , the per- ?
centage amount of light reflected in the second and third , the means of the two sets of observations in the fourth , and the amount of light which ought to have been reflected according to Cauchy 's formulae in the fifth .

Soc. , " vol. 31 , p. 486 , and vol. 35 , p. 32 , and the means of two sets of eight observations each are given below .
The values of the principal azimuths are higher than any obtained before in the course of these experiments , whilst those of the principal incidences are nearly the same as those obtained with the silver plate polished with rouge ( " Proc. Roy : Soc. , " vol. 31 , p. 493 ) , but considerably in excess of the determinations previously made with silver films .

39 The calculated and observed values for the light polarised in the plane of incidence agree very fairly , the calculated values being slightly the lowest .
For light polarised perpendicularly to the plane there is considerable difference between the two sets of numbers , the calculated values being considerably the highest .
As has already been stated the silver film was , to some extent at least , transparent , and it was found that when a Nicol was held between the eye and the silvered glass , and sunlight was incident obliquely upon the film , the brightness and colour of the transmitted light varied with the position of the Nicol ; the image of the sun being brightest when the short diagonal of the Niool was in the plane of incidence , and darkest , and of a deep blue colour , when the long diagonal was in that plane .
Hence it would appear that at oblique incidences light which is polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence penetrates to a greater depth in the film than that polarised in the plane , a result that is in accordance with the conclusion drawn from the experiments with silver films already referred to , and one that may account for the difference in the observed and calculated intensities of light polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence reflected by the silver film.* In order to ascertain whether the difference between the observed and calculated results was really due to this cause or not , a thicker film was prepared by depositing a second coating of silver on a freshly-prepared film .

[ May 15 , its thickness was therefore 0-0001737 millim. , or as nearly as possible double that of the single film .
The thick film was not absolutely opaque , as the disk of the sun on a clear day could just be seen through it , but it transmitted much less light than the film previously used .
Tables IY and Y give the results of two series of observations made with it , and also the theoretical amount of light which should have been reflected , calculated from the values of the principal incidence and principal azimuth given in Table YI .

44 0 The values of the principal incidence and azimuth are slightly higher than those obtained with the thinner film , and therefore the percentage amount of light which , according to theory , should be reflected by the silver , is also higher .
The tables show that both for light polarised in and perpendicularly to the plane of incidence the observed intensity exceeds the calculated intensity , in the former case by about 1 , and in the latter by about 2 per cent. , except at incidences of 30 ' with light polarised in the plane , and 70 ' and 75 ' for light polarised perpendicularly to the plane , for which angles the observed and calculated intensities agree closely .
Curves were drawn to show the calculated and observed intensities , 42 Mr. W. Galloway .
On the [ May 15 , the angles of incidence being taken as abscissae , and the intensities as ordinates ; those representing the calculated intensities being drawn with dotted lines .
The inequalities in that for the observed value with light polarised in the plane of incidence , and the thin silver film ( Fig. Ia ) would probably have disappeared if a larger number of observations had been made , the curve for the calculated value , however* corresponds very nearly with the line which would have been obtained had a smooth curve been drawn between the points given by observation .
Fig. lb gives the results with the thick silver film .
Figs. II and III represent the observations made with the steel* and speculum metal mirrors .
( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 36* p. 187 .
) These diagrams appear to confirm the general conclusion arrived at in the former paper , that although the received formulae for metallic reflection are approximately correct , they are not a complete expression of the facts of the case .

" On the Influence of Coal-Dust in Colliery Explosions .
No. V. " By W. Galloway .
Communicated by R. H* Scott , F.R.S* Received May 8 , 1884* At the beginning of the first paper on this subject , which I had the honour of reading before the Fellows of the Royal Society now somewhat more than eight years ago ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 24 , p. 354 ) , I gave a short account of what appeared to-me to be a rational mode of explaining the occurrence of all great explosions in dry and dusty collieries ; and since then I have had opportunities of studying several remarkable instances of this class of phenomena , with the result that I am now more than ever satisfied with the correctness of the views which I then expressed .
It is true , as some subsequent writers , amongst whom I may name Sir Frederick Abel , F.R.S. , have observed , that coal-dust had been previously recognised as a factor in * The value of I2 for steel at an angle of 50 ' is 46 ' 14 ' , and not 42 ' 09 ' , as given in the table on p. 196 , an error for which , I regret to say , I am responsible .
