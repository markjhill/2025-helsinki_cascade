[ Phil. Trans. 1807 , p. 57.1 The Professor observes , that Sir Isaac Newton was the first mathematician who endeavoured to estimate the quantity of the precession from the attractive influence of the sun and moon on the spheroidal figure of the earth .
His investigations relating to this subject evince the same transcendent abilities that are displayed in other parts of his Principia ; but it is admitted , that , from a mistake in his process , his conclusion is erroneous .
The investigations of other mathematicians in attempting the solution of the same problem are arranged by the author under three general heads .
The first arrive at wrong conclusions , in consequence of mistake in some part of their proceedings ; the second obtain just conclusions , but rendered so by balance of opposite errors ; the third approach as near the truth as the nature of the subject will admit , but , in the author 's estimation , are liable to the charge of obscurity and perplexity .
The defects in all their investigations Professor Robertson ascribes to the same cause the uncultivated state of the doctrine of compound rotatory motion .
The author 's endeavours are , consequently , first directed to the investigation of the principles of compound rotatory motion from principles which he considers clear and unexceptionable .
He next proceeds to calculate the disturbing solar force on the spheroidal figure of the earth , and thence the angular velocity which it produces .
The quantity of annual precession is then computed ; and , lastly , that of nutation , as far as these are produced by the disturbing force of the sun .
A similar deviation , the author observes , is produced by the action of the moon ; but a minute investigation of the deviation from that cause is foreign to the design of the present communication .
