I. " On the Calculus of Symbols."-Second Memoir .

( Abstract .
) This memoir is the continuation of one on the calculus of symbols which I had the honour to lay before the Society in December 1860 , and which has since been published in the 'Philosophical Transactions .
' I commence this paper with some extensions of the method given in the former memoir for resolving functions of non-commutative symbols into binomial factors .
I then explain a method , analogous to the process for extracting the square root in ordinary algebra , for resolving such functions into equal factors .
I next investigate a process for finding the highest common internal divisor of two functions of non-commutative symbols , or , in other words , ol finding if two linear differential equations admit of a common solution .
After this , I give a rule for multiplying linear factors of non-commutative symbols , analogous to the ordinary algebraical rule for linear algebraical factors .
I then resume the consideration of the binomial theorem explained in the former memoir .
Two new forms of this binomial theorem are here given ; and the method bywhich these forms are proved identical will , I hope , be considered an interesting portion of symbolical algebra , and as exhibiting in a remarkable manner its peculiar nature .
