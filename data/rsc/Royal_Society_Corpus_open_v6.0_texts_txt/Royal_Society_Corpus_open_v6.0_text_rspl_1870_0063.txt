The following communications were read :\#151 ; I. " Note on the circumstances of the Transits of Venus over the Sun 's Disk in the years 2004 and 2012 .
" By J. R. Hind , F.R.S. Received March 1 , 1871 .
While preparations are being made by astronomers of various nations for the observation of the approaching transit of Venus over the sun 's disk in December 1874 , it may be of interest to know under what conditions the pair of transits in the twenty-first century will take place .
This consideration has induced me to make a careful calculation of the circumstances of the transits in 2004 and 2012 , from M. Leverrier 's Tables of the Sun and Planet , which at present are extremely accurate , and which , there can be little doubt , will closely represent the phenomena to be witnessed in those years .
The calculations have been made entirely by myself , but with every precaution to avoid error , and I have confidence in the results .
The following are the resulting elements of the transit in 2004 :\#151 ; Greenwich mean time of conjunction in right ascension 2004 , June 7d 20h 51m 28s*8 .

" On the Existence and Formation of Salts of Nitrous Oxide .
" By Edward Divers , M.D. Communicated by Professor W. Odling , M.B. , F.R.S. Received March 2 , 1871 .
1 .
Metallic sodium thrown on a solution of an alkali nitrate was found by Schonbein * to reduce it to nitrite .
He contented himself , however , with merely detecting the nitrite by the iodide and starch test .
By using the sodium in the form of amalgam the complete reduction of the nitrate to nitrite can be readily effected , and silver nitrite freely precipitated from the solution by first neutralizing it with an acid and then adding silver nitrate .
2 .
But so soon as nitrite is thus formed by the sodium , it itself begins to suffer reduction , as well as the remaining nitrate , by the action of more sodium .
This reduction of the nitrite is rendered evident by the effervescence which attends it , the gas given off consisting of pure nitrous oxide .
If excess of sodium amalgam be gradually added to the nitrate solution , and its action moderated by keeping the vessel containing the mixture in a stream of cold water , the effervescence only becomes very lively when the sodium added has nearly reached the proportion of two atoms to one of the nitrate used .
When four atoms of sodium have been oxidized by the solution , the further addition of it is without effect ; no more effervescence takes place , and the sodium remains unchanged in the mercury .
3 .
The very alkaline liquid which is left by the reaction contains a new salt , though in relatively small quantity\#151 ; the salt of nitrous oxide .
The action of sodium on sodium nitrate may therefore be thus formulated:\#151 ; 1st stage : j 0 + Naa=*J ' j 0+Na20 .
2nd stage j 0 + Naa=*Ja j 0+Naa0 .
As regards the escape of nitrous oxide during the reduction , this is explained by the reaction on each other of two molecules of the new salt , under the influence of the heat produced by the oxidation of the sodium , thus:\#151 ; * Erdmann 's Joum .
