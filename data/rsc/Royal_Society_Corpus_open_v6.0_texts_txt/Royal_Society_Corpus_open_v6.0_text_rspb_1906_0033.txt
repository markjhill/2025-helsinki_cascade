442 The Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man.\#151 ; No. I. By Leonard Hill , F.E.S. , and M. Greenwood , Jun. , M.R.C.S. Research Scholar of the British Medical Association .
( Received January 16 , \#151 ; Read February 15 , 1906 .
) Introduction .
The classical researches of Paul Bert , ( 1 ) confirmed in recent years by v. Schrotter ( 2 ) and his co-workers , and also by Leonard Hill and J. J. R. Macleod(3 and 4 ) , have demonstrated beyond question that the ill results observed in caisson workers and divers are to be attributed entirely to injudicious rapidity of decompression .
Experiments on animals have shown that every 100 c.c. of blood or tissue fluid dissolve , at body temperature , about 1 c.c. of nitrogen under one atmosphere of air ; 2 c.c. under two atmospheres ; 3 c.c. under three atmospheres , and so on ( Hill and Macleod , Hill and Ham ) .
( 5)* This nitrogen is set free as bubbles in the capillaries and tissue spaces when the decompression period is made too short , and by the embolism of some vessel , may produce symptoms varying in kind and severity .
One of us ( L. H. ) having determined , by numerous experiments on animals , that no ill effects follow exposure to pressures up to + seven atmospheres , if 20 minutes be allowed to each atmosphere for decompression , we determined to investigate the effects of high pressures of air upon ourselves .
The records of caisson works and the operations of deep sea divers show that owing to the rapid rates of decompression at present employed by engineers and divers , very great risk is incurred by workers in caissons at pressures of +3 atmospheres , and by divers at depths of from 100 to 150 feet .
As , however , divers usually stop a very brief time , while caisson workers outstay a shift of from 2 to 4 hours , the body fluids of the latter become saturated with nitrogen , hence their greater danger at lower pressures .
The limit for practical diving work is fixed by the great increase of mortality and illness which occurs at depths much exceeding 100 feet , while at less depths than this , accidents are by no means infrequent ; being occasionally very severe or fatal in character .
The Admiralty set 120 feet as the limit of work for their divers , while the most daring pearl and sponge fishers sometimes reach depths of 145 feet ; in * Bohr ( ' Nagel 's Handb .
d. Physiologic , ' 1905 , vol. 1 , p. 117 ) gives the coefficient of absorption of arterial blood exposed to an atmosphere of N2 , at body temperature as 1'26 .
The Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man .
443 this latter group accidents are numerous .
Lambert , the famous diver employed by Messrs. Siebe and Gorman , salved \#163 ; 100,000 at a depth of about 160 feet .
On each descent he passed about 20 minutes below , and about the same time in ascending .
On the last journey he stayed longer and became affected on his return to the surface , permanently losing the power to retain his urine .
Lambert was the man who stopped the flooding of the Severn Tunnel , going through the tunnel ( dark and full of water ) in a Fleuss dress to a distance of a quarter of a mile from the shaft , and closing the flood gates , which had been left open ; his courage deserves to be recalled .
Another diver , Erostabe , salved treasure from a depth of 171 feet , and yet another , Bidyard , from 160 feet .
These three divers of Messrs. Siebe and Gorman hold the record for successful work carried out at great depths .
Two other divers of the same firm , in order to test a patent kind of diving apparatus , descended to 189 and 192 feet respectively .
One of these divers ( Walker ) tells us he was about 50 minutes over the job , taking 30 minutes to ascend .
He ascribes his immunity from accident throughout his career as a deep diver to his habit of slow ascent .
The deepest dive on record is one of 204 feet ( + 88| lbs. pressure ) ; the diver who made this record died from the effects of too rapidly mounting to the surface .
In 1894 , at Bordeaux , H. Hersent , ( 7 ) an engineer in charge of caisson works , having first experimented on animals , found three workmen willing to submit themselves to high pressures of air .
These men were enclosed in a steel chamber , and the experiments were conducted under the observation of a commission composed of five members of the Bordeaux Faculty of Medicine .
Two of the workmen had had previous experience of compressed air .
In one experiment the subject was compressed to + 4*800 kilos , per square centimetre ( + 68*27 lbs. per square inch ) in 35 minutes , remained under this pressure 1 hour , and was decompressed in 2 hours 3 minutes .
On quitting the chamber the man experienced a few " picotements , " which lasted for half-an-hour , but no other unfavourable symptoms .
In a second experiment , a pressure of + 5*000 kilos .
( + 71*16 lbs. per square inch ) was attained , without any subsequent ill effects beyond a few " picotements .
" Finally , the same subject was compressed to +5*400 kilos .
( + 76*81 lbs. per square inch ) in 45 minutes , remained under the pressure 1 hour , and was decompressed in 2 hours 25 minutes .
The effects are recorded in these words : " Aressenti peu de picotements , cela tient aux bains sulfureux pris les jours precedents .
" ( 8 ) .
Hersent 's experiments justify his conclusion that " avec quelques precautions en sus de celles qu'on prend ordinairement , les hommes peuvent etre comprimes et decomprimes sans danger pour leur vie , et que meme leur 444 Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood , Jun. [ Jan. 16 , sante n'est pas menacee quand on atteint des pressions allant jusqu'\amp ; 5 kg .
400 .
" ( 9 ) Hersent and his medical colleagues do not appear to have entered the pressure chamber themselves , so that we are not in possession of an accurate record of the subjective effects as noted by trained scientific observers .
One of our objects therefore has been to study in detail the subjective and physiological changes induced by greatly increased barometric pressures ; another object has been the investigation of the respiratory exchange under the same conditions .
In the present memoir we shall communicate the results already obtained .
| Part I. Our experiments have been carried out in a steel cylinder kindly placed at our disposal by Messrs. Siebe and Gorman , the eminent firm of naval engineers , to whom we are further indebted for much valuable assistance .
This cylinder { videphotograph , p. 446 ) had a capacity of 42'2 cubic feet , and was provided with a mattress , blanket , and pillows , enabling the subject to adopt a comfortable attitude .
Compression was effected by means of a two-cylinder motor-driven pump , which could raise the pressure to -f 6 atmospheres in about 40 minutes .
Two decompression taps were provided , with fine bores , permitting very careful adjustment of the rate of escape .
The chamber was also fitted with electric light , bell , telephone , and a thick glass observation window ; the latter , however , was subsequently covered with a steel shutter for greater security .
The pressure was measured by a Bourdon spring gauge , which had been tested for correctness .
We shall now give an account of a typical experiment .
The description is reproduced from notes taken at the time :\#151 ; Experiment II .
29.11.05 .
The subject* ( M. G. ) entered the chamber at 10.40 a.m. In order to avoid any accumulation of C02 ) a constant ventilation at the rate of 25 litres per minute was maintained .
* The measurements , etc. , etc. , of the two subjects were : L. H. , age 39 , weight ( in clothes ) 87^ kilogrammes , height 1 '81 metres , vital capacity 3500 c.c. , tidal air 510 c.c. ; M. G. , age 25 , weight 53 kilogrammes , height T65 metres , vital capacity 4000 c.c. , tidal air 300 c.c. Both were in good physical condition .

On quitting the chamber some itching was perceived in both forearms , , especially the right .
In about 20 minutes neuralgic pains were felt , localised in the radial side of the left forearm .
These pains gradually increased in intensity , spreading up the arm ; then , after remaining moderately intense for five minutes , they gradually subsided .
Several minutes later ( about one hour after leaving the chamber ) similar pain was experienced in the right forearm .
This however did not spread upwards , was less severe and quickly subsided .
An hour and a half after leaving the cylinder the subject felt quite well and no subsequent ill effects resulted .
As will appear later , there is good reason to suppose that the slight discomfort present at the conclusion of this experiment is attributable to the fact that the subject remained almost completely at rest during decompression .
We may therefore conclude that an adult may be safely submitted to a total barometric pressure of at least 7 atmospheres , which is , we believe , a limit higher than any previously reached .
In the course of our investigation the following pressures have been attained:\#151 ; Subject , L. H. 75 lbs. , once .

Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood , Jun. [ Jan. 16 , 1906 .

447 In no case have any severe after effects resulted .
The maximum pressure in our series corresponds to a water depth of 210 feet , which is 90 feet beyond the limit fixed by the Admiralty for their divers .
Supposing the special diving bell designed by one of us ( L. H. ) for the slow decompression of divers were employed , it seems quite possible that work might be carried out safely at a depth of 210 feet .
Even a greater depth than this might be attained by an intrepid man , for the limit appears to be fixed by the pressure at which the toxic effects of high tension oxygen become an immediate danger .
These effects have been studied by Paul Bert , Lorrain Smith ( 10 ) and Hill and Macleod ( 3 ) .
When the partial pressure of oxygen reaches 2 atmospheres ( corresponding to 10 atmospheres of air , or a depth of about 350 feet of water ) convulsions may occur in animals within 20 minutes .
The limit of possible safe working is therefore about 250 feet .
Conceivably this limit might be extended by diluting the air with nitrogen so as to lower the partial pressure of the oxygen , but we do not claim more than that our experiments show the safe diving depth may be increased up to 210 feet .
The responsibility of those who allow short decompression periods in caisson works is clear ; every death or case of paralysis from air embolism must be set down to the negligence of the contractor .
Next , as to the sensations we felt under pressure : the feeling of discomfort in the ears and deafness , due to a difference in air pressure within and without the tympanum , is too well known to need description .
Owing probably to a catarrhal condition , we were unable to open our Eustachian tubes by merely swallowing , and were compelled to resort to a forced expiratory effort with mouth and nose shut , the latter being held tight by the finger and thumb .
To one of us ( L. H. ) who had not practised beforehand the opening of his Eustachian tubes , the first stance was most disturbing .
The sensation of increasing deafness and discomfort , more than discomfort , in the ears , with no obvious cause , and the inability to gain relief by the recognised method of swallowing , produced a feeling of mental distress which led to his signalling to terminate the experiment .
Once having learned the method of opening his tubes , no such trouble resulted on subsequent occasions .
As to whether one possesses any real sense of the amount of pressure , the answer must be in the negative .
V. Schrotter arid his co-workers ( 11 ) , who made observations in caissons sunk in the Danube at from -f 0-5 to +2*65 atmospheres , say that : " Bleibt nun der Druck stationar , verweilt die Person auf langere Zeit unter einem bestimmten Drucke , so hort mehr oder minder rasch , oft mit einem Schlage , jegliche unangenehme Sensation im VOL. lxxvii.\#151 ; b , 2 X 448 Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood , Jun. [ Jan. 16 , Ohre auf , nur das Gefiihl von Dumpfheit , das Gefiihl eines vermehrten Widerstandes im Ohre , wird in der Mehrzahl der Ealle , besonders von Ungewohnten , wahrgenommen .
" We found that all distinct sensations of pressure in the ears were relieved immediately the pump ceased its strokes , and the pressure in the chamber became constant .
Our hearing was as acute and , in the opinion of L. H. , more acute than normally .
The signal of a tap with an iron spanner on the outside of the chamber was , to L. H. , painful in its intensity .
Apart from the feelings of nervousness at being exposed to so high a pressure ( which at times were somewhat acute , especially when we were not engaged in analytical work ) , we could not detect any real sense of pressure , and certainly noticed no abnormality in our bodily functions , with the trifling exception of the voice .
Thus during Experiment XY the subject ( L. H. ) when at +60 lbs. , wrote : " Very nervous all through experiment ; whenever time for thought , the feelings of pressure , if any , due to non-equilibration of ears when pressure is rising .
" During the same experiment , when the subject learnt he was at +55 lbs. , he wrote : " Thought one was lower until told .
No real sense of pressure except lip and voice change .
" In another experiment , M. G. was nearly two atmospheres too low in his estimate of the pressure , while in a third experiment made at a period when custom had lessened the nervous effect , he replied to a question at + 60 lbs. , " no sense of pressure .
" The voice changes , observed in all caisson workers , were well marked in ourselves .
The alteration is distinct at +1 atmosphere , and very marked at + 3 atmospheres .
The voice has a peculiar nasal and metallic quality , losing the individual characteristics of the speaker .
Thus to L. H. , when speaking in the chamber , under pressure , his voice appeared like that of M. G. under pressure .
So close was the resemblance that L. G. could fancy himself outside and listening to M. G. through the telephone .
At +3 atmospheres the power to whisper or whistle is almost entirely lost .
L. H. , who retained the power somewhat longer than M. G. , could just make an audible whistling note at this pressure .
This loss of the fine vibratile movements of the tongue and lips , a loss probably resulting from the damping effects of the dense air , leads to a false sense of anaesthesia in the former parts .
This conception of anaesthesia is interesting , as being solely excited by a lack of normal movement .
Y. Schrotter and others have laid stress on the diminished frequency of the pulse and lowered blood pressure of caisson workers .
Our observations are not sufficiently extensive to permit of any final pronouncement ; but , so far as they go , we are unable to detect any definite change in the pulse 1906 .
] Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man .
449 frequency .
For instance , in Experiment II , M. G. 's pulse was at the rate of 40 per minute at +70 lbs. , and 42 at +63 lbs. In Experiment XIV , it was 41 per minute , at +50 lbs. , 30 at +30 lbs. , 42 at +10 lbs. , and 41 at + 2'3 lbs. This subject 's pulse is normally slow , being rarely above 60 per minute in the sitting posture ; hence although there appears to have been a diminution in frequency , the change is not nearly so striking as in the cases tabulated by V. Schrotter ( 12).* L. H. found no alteration in his pulse-rate at + 5 atmospheres .
Our observations on the blood pressure have not been at all complete .
The Hill and Barnard pocket sphygmometer , depending as it does upon a column of air acting as an elastic spring , is not a satisfactory instrument for high pressure work , the viscosity of the dense air lessening the excursion of the pulse very greatly .
" We came to the conclusion that it was an important matter during the decompression to move in turn every muscle and joint of the body , and to change one 's position frequently , so as to keep the capillary circulation active in every part .
In the brain , spinal cord , and abdominal organs this circulation is kept active by the work of the respiratory pump .
In the limbs , muscles , fat of the back and chest , on the other hand , the movement of the blood and lymph back to the heart depends mostly on changes of posture and the expressive action of contracting muscles .
The following observations support these views .
In Experiment XIII M. G. was decompressed from +75 lbs. in 95 minutes .
During decompression he flexed and extended all the limb joints at frequent intervals , with the exception of the knees .
Subsequently pain and stiffness were detected in the knees and nowhere else .
In Experiment XIV the same subject was decompressed from + 5 atmospheres in 120 minutes .
During the compression all the limb joints , including the knees , were repeatedly moved .
No after effects of any kind were experienced .
A further difference between the two experiments was that in the second a pause of about five minutes was made at each atmosphere for analytical purposes .
As in each of the experiments followed by pain ( in the case of M. G. ) no such pauses occurred , it is possible , but we think not probable , that these may also play a part in hindering the development of after effects .
The most interesting experiment in this connection is No. XV .
L. H. was decompressed from +5 atmospheres in 105 minutes , a pause of five minutes being made at each atmosphere .
During the decompression movements of * In Schrotter 's cases there was no direct relation between barometric pressure and pulse frequency .
450 Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood , Jun. [ Jan. 16 , the joints and muscle of the limbs and hack were carried out regularly .
On emerging from the cylinder , beyond a few " picotements , " no unpleasant symptoms were noticed .
On the next day the subject wrote as follows : " The only place I did not move and massage was the front of the chest , where I have plenty of subcutaneous fat .
In the evening painful places were felt in the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior thoracic region ; one spot under each nipple , one across the right side of the chest about the level of the ensiform cartilage , another above the left axilla in front , and one over the right upper arm in front .
A red or purplish rash appeared over these tender places .
They felt like a spot in which a subcutaneous injection of water has been made .
Next morning the tenderness was better but still evident , and the rash was subsiding .
" Forty-eight hours after the experiment this purpuric rash was still discernible , and was shown to Dr. W. Bulloch and other pathologists .
An eruption occurred in a very severe case of caisson illness seen by Heller Mager and v. Schrotter ( 13 ) .
They give a plate of the eruption , which is described in these terms : " Haut der linken Schulter und des linken Armes an der Aussenseite , besonders in der Gegend des Olekranon und des ausseren Condylus sowie in der Gegend des Biceps mit lividen , blaulich-rothen netzformig verzweigten , inselformigen Flecken bedeckt , ebensolche auch am Handriicken .
" The arm of this sufferer was much swollen and intensely painful .
These observations then show the extreme importance of active movement and massage during decompression ; instructions should be given to all caisson workers to perform such movements while in the air lock .
We believe the tenderness and the rash were caused by small bubbles embolising the vessels of the subcutaneous fat in the case of L. H. The pair felt by M. G. was probably due to small bubbles in the nerve sheaths in the first case , in the knee joint in the second .
Part II .
The next stage of our investigation was devoted to an inquiry as to the changes in the percentage of alveolar COs under the altered conditions .
We have employed the method described by Haldane and Priestley ( 14 ) The subject breathes through a wide-bored rubber tube ; after a normal expiration he expires deeply and then closes the end of the tube with his tongue .
A sample was taken from the wide tube into Haldane s portable CO2 analyser , and examined .
A bench fitted up in our cylinder enabled the subject to collect and examine samples with ease .
It may be remarked that 1906 .
] Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man .
451 it is necessary to replace the corks at the bottom of the water bath in Haldane 's apparatus by well-fitting rubber ones , as the air is compressed in the corks , which leak at high pressures .
Owing to the loss of the water jacket some of our earlier experiments were unsuccessful .
Great care is also necessary in readjusting the potash levelling tube , as when the chamber is closed a slight fall of pressure is almost inevitable owing to escape round the washer of the door .
Haldane and Priestley have shown that the respiration is so regulated as to maintain a constant tension of C02 in the alveolar air , which is generally about 5 per cent , of an atmosphere .
How supposing the metabolism to be unaffected by changes of pressure , and the regulation of respiration to continue the same , the amount of C02 in the alveolar air must vary inversely as the pressure attained .
Thus if p be the percentage of C02 at normal pressure , then we should have , at two atmospheres , p/ 3 per cent , of C02 in the alveolar air .
It will be seen that these conditions were almost exactly realised by us .
The following table gives the result of two typical experiments .
The figures in brackets give the percentages reduced to + 0 lb. in accordance with the above principle .
Strictly speaking , the exact height of the barometer should have been recorded , and another correction ought to have been made for charges of temperature in the cylinder .
As there is however a necessarily large experimental error , we think it needless to allow for these minor differences , and have accordingly assumed the normal atmospheric pressure to be 15 lbs. to the square inch , and neglected the temperature:\#151 ; Experiment XIV .

No increase or decrease in the pulmonary output of CO2 occurs .
Metabolism , then , in so far as it can be determined by an investigation of the alveolar air , is not affected by increasing the barometric pressure .
It is scarcely necessary to add that this criterion is by no means adequate to sustain the final conclusion that metabolism is , in fact , unaltered by the atmospheric condi1906 .

453 tions ; so far as it goes , however , it is in favour of such an inference .
Summing up the results of the present investigation :\#151 ; It is proved that\#151 ; ( 1 ) A man can be submitted to a total pressure of seven atmospheres without untoward effects , provided decompression be affected gradually , and the capillary circulation be aided by repeated contractions of muscles , joint movements , and charges of posture .
( 2 ) We have no sense of increased barometric pressure so long as the former is constant .
It is probable\#151 ; ( 1 ) That the subjective effects of increased pressure , apart from voice changes and lip amesthesia , depend upon psychical conditions such as anxiety and excitement .
( 2 ) The changes in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air are conditioned solely by physical variations , and not by any increase or diminution in the respiratory metabolism .
In conclusion we would remark that we are unable to find any evidence in support of Snell 's ( 15 ) opinion , that the presence of C02 in the respired air exercises a peculiarly unfavourable influence under increased pressure .
Thus in one experiment the percentage of C02 in the chamber air , at + 31 lbs. was 062 ( equivalent to over T8 per cent , at -f 0 ) , and no untoward results occurred on decompression .
These researches were carried out with the aid of a grant from the Royal Society Government Grant .
