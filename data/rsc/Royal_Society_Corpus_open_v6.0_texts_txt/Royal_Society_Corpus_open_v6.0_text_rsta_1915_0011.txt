Heats of dilution have been exhaustively studied by Prof. Julius Thomsen for a very large number of aqueous solutions.* His method chiefly consisted in taking some concentrated solution and diluting it considerably .
The total amount of heat generated or absorbed in this process was thus found and quoted against the final concentration expressed in molecules of water to one molecule of solute .
It is to be noted that during the process of dilution most of the thermal change occurs in the early stages , and that after the first ten molecules of water are added the total heat generated or absorbed increases but slightly .
The probable reason for this procedure is , that the experimenter finishes the operation with a dilute solution , so that starting with various initial concentrations , he may need only a few specific heats of certain dilute solutions .

remembered that only the final .specific heat of the solution need be known in order to measure the heat generated .
This process of largely diluting a solution , .
, in all cases using a larger bulk of solvent than solution , has been employed also by Berthelot , * Steinwehr , t and Bishop .
] : Very few experimenters quote results sufficiently numerous to establish any relation between heat of dilution and concentration .
Thomsen , from results on solutions of nitric acid and sulphuric acid , deduces a hyperbolic relation between the total heat of dilution and the final concentration N in molecules of water per where a and are arbitrary molecule of solute .
It is of the form Q N + constants .
The equations admit of no simple interpretation .
For hydrochloric acid solutions , he employs the different type of equation n b Q - \lt ; *\gt ; Thomsen obtained a large number of readings for sodium hydroxide solutions .
At low concentrations the heat of dilution changes sign , and no attempt was made to give a relation between Q and N. Acetic acid also changes the sign of its heat of dilution .
It is negative for strong solutions and positive for weak ones .
A great number of results were published by Thomsen for many salts , but not sufficient in any one case for the purpose of deducing a Q and N relation .
BumelinS has more recently found heats of dilution for phosphoric acid solutions , but only for four concentrations .
Lemoine|| also examined lithium chloride solutions , but quoted results in which no high order of accuracy was suggested .
These methods differ from those previously quoted , for here the diluting was done in stages .
Summing up all the results and the conclusions derived from them by the various authors , there seems to be no simple law which can be applied to all satisfactorily .
The author in previous work with concentrated solutions ! !
has obtained evidence in certain cases of those solutions being simpler in character than weaker ones .
The present paper deals almost entirely with the thermal effects in what may be called concentrated solutions , and a sufficient number of observations are taken to get a good concentration relation with heat of dilution .

DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .
the concentrated solutions without making them dilute in the process ; thus about 20 gr. of water were added to 300 gr. of solution .
The heat generated or absorbed in this case divided by the number of gr. molecules of water added , givesuthe differential heat of dilution sufficiently accurately for a concentration which is the mean of the initial and final concentrations .
The differential heat of dilution d Q/ dN may be defined as the quantity of heat liberated or absorbed per molecule of water added to an infinite quantity of solution , whose concentration will thereby be unaffected .
This condition can only be approximated to , hut the error in the above estimate will be small .
Thomsen added large quantities of water and so obtained a total heat .
\lt ; fiST .
This involved a N2dN temperature .
By the method here described the thermal capacity is kept sufficiently low to give a fair rise in temperature on dilution , and the relatively small quantity of water employed can be placed in a vessel completely immersed in the solution .
Temperatures can thus be well equalised before dilution takes place .
The following record describes work extending from October , 1912 , to December , 1914 .
The accurate determination of heat of dilution is necessarily a tedious business , owing to the fact that only one observation can be taken in an ordinary working day of six hours .
large thermal equivalent and a small rise in ( 2 ) Description of Apparatus .
( Diagram I. ) Measurement of Temperature .
In most of the previous researches on heat of dilution a mercury thermometer was employed .
Here temperature changes were measured with certainty by a platinum thermometer with fundamental interval of 12'8 ohms\#151 ; mounted in a very thin-walled cylindrical bulb , whose length is not far short of the depth of the solution .
Long experience with the working of this thermometer in other researches and careful application of all the corrections peculiar to it , enable the author to guarantee its readings .
( Diagram I. , T. ) Importance of One of the most important features of the experiment is the stirrer .
Different types were tested , and the most efficient one was found to be of the screw propeller type turned by a high speed motor .
The process of mixing was rapidly performed even with some of the very viscous solutions employed , and a careful experiment was performed to see if any appreciable temperature rise was indicated during the process .
After long periods , less than XJ(\gt ; ' 0 .
rise was noticeable .
( Diagram I. , S. ) 2 u 2 The Choice of a Calorimeter .
Radiation is another factor which becomes important when very small temperature changes are produced .
A very well made Dewar cylinder was employed .
( Diagram I. , AA .
) Its walls were well silvered , and during the experiments its contents , together with stirrer thermometer and other adjuncts , were shut in by a wTell-fitting cork stopper , which again was covered with a layer of cotton wool .
Curves were plotted when the contents had varying thermal capacities , and these were found to be perfectly smooth and enabled one to estimate with certainty the rate of cooling at any temperature .
The cubical capacity of the vessel was about 400 c.c. , and in no case did it contain more than 300 c.c. of solution .
For 20 degrees excess of temperature in the contents over that of the room , a rate of cooling of about 0'038 ' C. occurred per minute .
Each series of observations was accompanied by its own radiation experiment and complete consistency was given throughout .
The Mixing Pipette .
It is highly important that the water added should have the same temperature as the solution .
A thin walled glass pipette was employed of the form shown in the diagram .
( I. , P. ) Its bulb passes throughout the length of the cylindrical mass of solution , and parallel to the bulb of the thermometer .
Two such pipettes were employed\#151 ; one with a capacity of about 25 c.c. , the other about 45 c.c. The water was weighed out in these , the former being used when the solutions were strong , the latter when weak .
The walls were of thin glass , and the syphon tube was of such length as to introduce the water at the bottom of the vessel containing the solution .
The water , being of course less dense than the solution , would rise , and the process of mixing would be assisted in consequence .
Before mixing , the glass bulb with its contents was left immersed in the solution for some hours , and the stirrer was worked continuously .
In this way error due to temperature difference was brought to a minimum .
The upper end of the pipette is then connected by a thin rubber tube with the rubber ball , such as is used for a scent DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .
spray , and the water is projected out .
( Diagram I. , P. ) The process of mixing is then carried out , and after a sufficient time the temperature change is noted .
Some estimate is made of the water in the pipette which has not been driven out , viz. , that wetting the walls of the tube .
For this purpose , the tube being removed , dried externally and weighed , allowance is now made in the amount of water quoted .
Thermal Capacity of Vessel and its Contents .
The thermal capacity of the vessel and its contents must be very carefully determined , a process which is always difficult .
When a glass mixing vessel is employed special care has to be taken in the determination , as glass has a high specific heat .
Moreover , its low conducting power involves the temperature not being so nearly equal throughout its mass .
Thus it was found that the thermal capacity differed with the amount of solution taken .
In all cases quantities of solution taken were of either 250 , 275 or 300 c.c. , the amounts being measured by standardised measuring vessels .
Thermal capacities were found for the vessel and its contents also , when the mixing pipettes were present or absent .
To ensure accuracy experiments were repeated .
Consistent values were obtained .
Roughly speaking the thermal capacity was of the order of one-tenth that of the total thermal capacity .
Mode of Heating .
The method of determining the thermal capacity of the vessel under the varying conditions , was that of heating by a known electric current a weighed quantity of water contained in the vessel .
Some difficulty was experienced in the construction of a satisfactory heating coil .
The difficulty was solved by selecting a piece of glass tubing of very thin walls , and elliptical in section .
( Diagram I. , H. ) Manganin wire was wound upon a flat strip of mica and inserted into the tube , one end of which was sealed .
Good thermal contact between the coil and the walls of this tube was ensured by filling up the tube with the best lubricating oil , and the upper end was lightly close with glass wool .
The coil so made was thus perfectly insulated , and yet presented a large heating surface .
There was found to be very little lag in the taking up of the heat by the solution .
The length of the coil was so taken as to extend throughout the depth of the solution .
The heat generated was measured by the products GEt 4*185 where C is the current , E the volts , t the time in seconds , and 4*185 the mean value of Joule 's equivalent .
A Weston ammeter and a Weston voltmeter were employed having ranges from 0 to 5 in both cases .
It was found possible to read to 0*005 ampere or volt with fair accuracy .
Both instruments were calibrated against standards and the observations quoted are those observed , to which the requisite correction is applied .
The instruments employed showed an accuracy to within 0*02 of a volt or ampere almost throughout their whole scale .
The heating coil was of about 0'9 ohm resistance , and such a current was employed as to give readings nearly at the middle of the scales in each instrument .
The steadiness of the current was determined by the condition of the secondary cells employed .
Such variations as there were , however , were eliminated by readings of each instrument during each minute of heating .
To find the Thermal Capacity of the Apparatus .
One typical set of observations may be quoted .
May 8 , 1913 .
250 gr. of water were heated for 940 seconds , and the following readings of voltmeter and ammeter were taken alternately\#151 ; at minute intervals .

The heat supplied is 1696*4 calories .
Initial temperature 15*37 ' C. Final temperature 21*22 ' C. The mean radiation at the final temperature is 0*0072 ' C. per minute , and the correction for the whole period 0*06 ' C. Hence , the corrected temperature rise is 5*91 ' C. , and the water absorbs 1477*5 calories .
The heat absorbed by the apparatus is thus 218*9 calories , giving a water equivalent of 37*0 gr. For 275 gr. of water , the water equivalent was found to be 42*5 gr. When the mixing pipettes were employed , values of 44*75 and 45*6 gr. were obtained respectively .

10*45 0*855 LUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .
In order to obtain their values of heat of dilution a series of specific heat values must he found for varying concentrations .
As all the experiments were to be performed at air temperatures , varying from 15 ' C. to 20 ' C. , the method of heating was adopted as described above .
Only a short range of temperature rise was permitted as the specific heat may change rapidly with temperature .
For this reason , such heat was supplied as to keep this rise of temperature to about 5 ' or 6 ' C. The time chosen for the heating process was 1000 seconds , for some solutions , but in the case of hydrochloric acid solutions which have a low specific heat at high concentrations , periods of 10 , 11 , and 12 minutes were employed .
In order to show the manner in which the observations were taken the full details for hydrochloric acid solutions are given .
Eight solutions are taken and are distinguished by numbers , the strongest being solution 1 .
The acid employed was the purest obtainable , and the more dilute solutions were obtained from the stock solution by adding distilled water .
Observations of specific heat determinations were taken from May 15 to June 6 , 1913 , and are quoted in Tables I. and II .
Some preliminary experiments with concentrated solutions showed that the gas was driven off to an appreciable extent when the temperature exceeded air temperature .
For this reason the solutions were cooled about 8 ' below air temperature , so that their mean temperature is about 5 ' below that of the air .
Later experiments show that the specific heat alters very little with temperature for these solutions , hence no appreciable error is introduced into the heats of dilution as calculated from these specific heats .
Table I. , p. 325 , shows the relation between the specific heat and the concentration , expressed as molecules per 100 molecules of water , the molecular weight being taken as 36*5 .
The concentration was obtained from density tables supplied by Lunge and Marchlewski .
The final temperature is corrected for radiation , and the mean temperature of these is nearly that of the solution for the given determination .
275 c.c. of the acid were employed throughout , and the water equivalent is 42*5 gr. The first three solutions were heated for 600 seconds , the fourth for 660 seconds , and the remainder for 720 seconds .
For the purpose of interpolation many attempts were made to get an equation connecting specific heat and concentration .
No simple equation appears to satisfy the condition for dilute as well as strong solutions .
The author 's interest , however , is chiefly in the concentrated solutions , and for solutions whose strengths lie between the limits of 7*7 and 22*8 molecules of the solute to 100 molecules of water it was found that an equation of the type sna = was suitable , where s and n are specific heat and concentration respectively , while a and b are constants .
Tn the case of hydrogen chloride the equation takes the simple form snu =1*277 .

The value of the constant b changes with the temperature .
Heat of Dilution .
All the observations were taken with the initial temperature of the solution and the water that of the air .
No radiation correction need be applied , since the process of mixing was very rapid .
In the first six experiments the smaller pipette was employed , and the water equivalent 44 '75gr .
; for the next two experiments , the larger pipette was used with water equivalent 4 5'6 gr. The last two experiments were performed by a pipette which was not immersed in the solution .
The solution and distilled water were brought to the same temperature ( that of the air ) by enclosing the latter in a vessel immersed in the former .
Quantities of each were measured out in turn\#151 ; in experiment ( IX .
) , 200 c.c. of solution to 100 of water , and in ( X. ) , 150 c.c. of each .
The mixing process was performed in the same vessel , and the water equivalent was 46'0 gr. As a check on the concentration the densities of the solutions were obtained before and after.mixing , and the new value of concentration after the process of mixing was found by application of the expression c , =__________1800 Q ___________ ( 1800 +cm ) ( Qd+a ?

( 4 ) Study of the Results Obtained .
In the above table a column gives Thomsen 's values and the results are calculated out from the relation , Q = 17,340-12,000^ n JN where Q is the heat generated per n gr. molecules of solute dissolved in N molecules of solvent .
The heat of dilution is given by dQ dN 12,000 2x2 It will be seen that the results derived from his equation lie considerably below those obtained by experiment .
The discrepancy between Thomsen 's values and those here obtained does not appear from the value of total heat of dilution quite so obviously .
Thus on diluting a solution from HC1.2'6H20 to HC1 .
10H2O , nearly the same quantity of heat appears to he generated .
The reason for this is that Thomsen 's dQ/ c\#163 ; N exceeds the values here obtained for solutions of strength exceeding HC1.4H20 .
In order to obtain a measure of the total heat generated , values of can be plotted against number of molecules of water per molecule of solute , i.e. , the abscissae would read " dilution " instead of concentration .

It will be seen that the curves cross at N = 4 , and that the total areas from the two curves are nearly equal .
The curve connecting heat of dilution and concentration for hydrochloric acid , should , by Thomsen 's theory , be parabolic .
The results of the above experiments show that with concentrations exceeding HC1 .
10H2O the values lie very nearly on a straight line , which however , for lower concentrations , bends round and approaches the origin .
If the straight portion be produced it cuts the axis of concentration at DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .

This may be best expressed by the equation If c is expressed in gramme-molecules of solute per molecule of solvent , and a is the tangent of the angle of slope of the portion referred to ( 4082 ) , taking N as 1 , ^ = a ( n\#151 ; 0-0666 ) .

For concentrations below 10 molecules of water the two curves nearly coincide , so that the total heat obtained by diluting very largely would be nearly the same .

333 ( 5 ) Lithium Chloride .
( Molecular weight 42'5 .
) The solutions of lithium chloride were treated in precisely the same way as those of hydrogen chloride .
The solutions when concentrated , possessed a much greater viscosity and greater care had to be taken in stirring .
Also the solutions were very hygroscopic and the experiments were performed , as far as possible , in an air-tight vessel .
The following tables ( Tables V. and YI .
) summarise the observations .
As the same mixing vessel was used and the same quantities of solution , the same water equivalents were employed .
In the specific heat determinations the current and voltage employed are the mean of sixteen observations for each solution .
The specific heats were obtained for nearly the same range of temperature as that employed for the heat of dilution determinations , hence no temperature correction for specific heat need be applied .
Seven specific heats were found and 300 c.c. of each solution were taken .
The curve connecting heat of dilution and concentration shows a more gradual increase of the former with increase of the latter .
The same peculiar property , however , is shown for concentrations exceeding LiCl .
6H20 above this value to concentration LiCl .
3H20 , the truest representation for this portion is a straight line which cuts the concentration curve at LiCl .

( Diagram II .

Their method was only approximate , as they did not attempt high accuracy .

( Molecular weight 40 .
) With solutions of sodium hydroxide the same processes were employed .
It was found more convenient to take 250 c.c. of the solutions for the specific heat determinations .

DILUTION OF CONCENTEATED SOLUTIONS .
The gilded brass stirrer with its glass insulated shaft was replaced by a glass one , the shaft and the propeller blades being fused together .
Some slight modification of the water equivalent was made to suit the new conditions .
The strong solutions were very viscous and the rate of stirring was increased .
Some slight change in the heating coil due to a short circuit of a few turns altered the resistance of the heating coil\#151 ; but errors were eliminated by taking readings of both ammeter and voltmeter each minute .
The heating occupied a thousand seconds in all cases .
Table VII .
gives the data from which the variation of specific heat with concentration was obtained .
Table VIII .
gives the data for the heats of dilution of the solutions at various concentrations , and at the temperature of the air .
One of the curves in Diagram II .
shows the nature of the relation between heat of dilution and concentration .
The points do not lie so evenly on the curve as in the case of hydrochloric acid , and this is doubtless due to the greater difficulty of experimenting with a highly viscous solution .
It is , however , interesting to note that the points for higher concentrations lie most nearly on a straight line , which passes through the axis of concentration at 12'5 molecules per 100 molecules of water .
This would correspond to a concentration of NaOH .
8H20 .
The equation most nearly expressing this part of the curve is = 7840 - 0125 ) cZN \N / and this may be considered to hold while the concentration changes from NaOH .
6H20 to NaOH .
3H20 ; within the same range the heat of dilution changes to five times its value at the lower concentration .
A curve ( fig. 7 ) may be plotted connecting heat of dilution and the inverse of concentration , and from it the total heat of dilution as found by Thomsen can be estimated from the relation |Nl kdN The relation between Q and N for concentrations below NaOH .
6H20 is very uncertain .
Both Thomsen and Berthelot found the heat of dilution to become negative for high dilutions , and this also was observed in the above experiment for concentrations below those recorded above .
The effect , however , was very small .
Thomsen gives the number of calories evolved in changing the composition of the solution from NaOH .
3H20 to NaOH .
5H20 as 2131 calories .
Integrating the above equation between these limits we get Q = 7840 loge S \#151 ; 7840 x 0T25 x 2 , which gives 2083 calories .
Thus although a quite different interpretation of the experimental results is given , the results are in good agreement .
By reference to the curve it is seen that a further dilution of four molecules of VOL. CCXV.\#151 ; A. 2 Y Table YII .

0-844 Radiation corrections were made and are included in the final temperature above quoted .
Other specific heat determinations were made with more dilute solutions , but as they do not come within the range of the heat of dilution experiments , they are not quoted .
The initial temperature was always the air temperature , thus simplifying radiation corrections .

9H20 , 979'2 calories are produced .
For the same range Thomsen gives 962 .
This agreement is as good as the difficult nature of the experiment will allow , under the conditions chosen .
( 7 ) Heat of Dilution of Calcium Chloride Solutions .
All the above solutions yield two ions to the molecule .
A fourth solution , that of calcium chloride , was chosen , not only because of its existence in a high condition of concentration , but also because it yielded three ions to the molecule .
The concentrations were obtained from the density table given by Pickering , and the molecular weight is taken as 111 .
Tables IX .
and X. give the data obtained in experiments in which the procedure was very much the same as in the above solutions .
The curve for calcium chloride is of a different character .
A small change of slope occurs for all concentrations .
For a limited distance at high concentrations the curve appears to be nearly a straight line which would cut the axis of concentration , if produced at about 7'69 molecules per 100 molecules .
This would make a limiting concentration of CaCl2 .
13H20 .
Many attempts were made to get an equation connecting dQfdN and ft/ N , but without satisfactory result .
The total heat of dilution can , however , be obtained graphically by plotting dQ/ dN and N / n , as in the case of hydrochloric acid , when the total heat is measured by area .
The recorded temperature changes on dilution were smaller than in the above solutions , and the degree of accuracy was consequently not so high .
( 8 ) Variation of Heat of Diluton with Temperature .
The above heats of dilution were determined under nearly isothermal conditions and at air temperatures .
Very little work has been done to determine the variation of heat of dilution with temperature .
Colson* lias obtained a so-called " dead point " for various solutions .
He found certain temperatures at which the heat of dilution vanishes for certain solutions .
Taking one of these solutions he found the dead point the same for all concentrations .
Later on , however , when experimenting with sodium sulphate , he found the dead point to vary with varying concentration .
He concluded that those solutions giving a constant dead point contain solutes in which the state of aggregation is independent of the concentration , and cited sodium sulphate as a substance whose composition varies with concentration .
MagieI found a change in heat of dilution for barium chloride from positive to negative , giving a zero effect at temperatures which decrease as the dilution increases .

The results give good agreement with the determinations of Dickinson , Mueller , and George ( 'Bureau of Standards , Bull .
, 6 , pp. 379\#151 ; 40b , February , 1910 ) .
By interpolation their result for experiment ( 5 ) would be O'696 , and for experiment ( 6 ) 0*753 .
For the purposes of interpolation the relation SN1/ * = 0*9952 was found to hold with remarkable accuracy between the concentrations 11*36 and 4 molecules to 100 molecules of water .
This equation is very similar to that for lithium chloride .

No record is given of a systematic study of the variation in heat of dilution by either of these investigators .
In order to obtain numerical results , the manner in which the specific heat varies with temperature must first be found .
The temperature effect on the heats of dilution of hydrogen chloride and lithium chloride were investigated .
The experiments were more difficult to carry out owing to radiation corrections which now become a greater consideration .
Also the range of temperatures for which the heat of dilution experiments were possible is limited .
With concentrated hydrochloric acid no temperature above 20 ' C. could be attempted , and below 0 ' C. the water employed would , of course , freeze .
With lithium chloride solutions the maximum concentration employed at air temperatures could not be employed at 0 ' C. owing to the much smaller solubility of the salt .
Since , therefore , only moderately strong solutions could be taken much smaller temperature changes were observed on dilution .
Attempts were made to get the heat dilution of these solutions at temperatures above 30 ' C. , but without success , owing to the small heating effect and the large radiation .
To eliminate the radiation loss the heating coil employed for the specific heat experiments was tried , but it was found impossible to regulate the temperature of the coil with sufficient delicacy .
Observations were made , but failed to give consistent results on repetition .
In each specific heat and heat of dilution experiment , separate radiation-loss experiments were made , and these were checked in the following manner .
The quantity of solution to be experimented with was introduced into the vessel and its temperature raised from about \#151 ; 10 ' C. ( to which it had been previously cooled ) , by means of the heating coil , by steps of about 5 ' C. to about 50 ' or 60 ' C. The rate of cooling was then plotted against temperature , and gave a curve which closely approximated to a straight line , within the range 10 ' C. on either side of air temperatures .
The points all lay perfectly on the curve , and the curve cut the axis of temperature at a point which was found to coincide exactly with air temperature .
The regularity of this effect , and the certainty with which it could be measured , made experiments with a relatively large radiation loss quite satisfactory .
Thus , in the specific heat determination of lithium chloride solution at a temperature of about 70 ' C. , a rise in temperature by heating of 10'21 ' C. is observed , while the radiation loss is about 2 ' C. For lithium chloride only one concentration of solution was attempted , as the results only showed a small change in heat of dilution ; and moreover with the concentrations less than that employed the heating effect is so small , since in both solutions it falls off very rapidly as the concentration is diminished .
The following specific heats were obtained for hydrochloric acid :\#151 ; Concentration molecule per 100 molecules .

Even allowing for possible errors of experiment there is evidence of a minimum value whose position lies between 5 ' C. and 15 ' C. The above results are consistent with those previously obtained at an average temperature of 9*92 ' C. Thus for concentration 2375 the specific heat by interpolation is 0'583 ; for concentration 14'9 the value is 0'648 ; and for concentration 10*44 it is 0711 .
The values employed in the subjoined table of heats of dilution were derived from the above tabulated values by interpolation .
The process of equalisation of temperatures before mixing water with the solution was performed as nearly as possible before the pipette was immersed in the solution .
After immersion the pipette was left for some hours and the solution was continuously stirred by the propeller stirrer , driven at a high speed .
The process of mixing of water and solution was allowed five minutes to complete , and during this interval the radiation correction was applied .
It was always found that after that period the temperature changes were always those which would be foretold by the previous radiation experiments .

Lithium Chloride .
The specific heats of a solution of lithium chloride were found in the same manner as those of hydrogen chloride .
It is possible , however , to employ higher temperatures than in the above case .
On the other hand , the strongest solutions could not be used at the low temperatures owing to the solution becoming saturated .
At the highest temperatures radiation becomes far more prominent , and larger heating currents were employed .
The solutions were heated for 1000 seconds .
The following table gives the specific heats of a solution of lithium chloride ( concentration 18'8 ) at various temperatures :\#151 ; Temperature .

It is evident that although the thermal capacity of the solution may change rapidly with temperature the heat of dilution suffers very little change .
( 9 ) Examination of Thomsen 's Besults.* In most of Thomsen 's experiments the ranges of concentration are not such as make the results comparable with those quoted above .
There are , however , a few substances such as sulphuric acid , nitric acid , and hydrobromic acid , other than the above substances , in which a series of results are obtained at high concentrations .
Thomsen finds a hyperbolic relation between total heats of dilution and concentration .
With the first two acids named this relation is of the form Q aN N + 6 where a and b are constants and N = number of molecules of water to one molecule of acid .
The heat of dilution at any given concentration then becomes dQ _ ah dN _ ( N + 6)2 ' This form of relation cannot be applied to other substances such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide .
In the latter case the heat of dilution changes sign when the solution is very dilute .
The varying thermal changes observed at higher dilutions for several substances , suggests that these solutions are more complex than the stronger ones .
Moreover experimental difficulties prevent the measurement of these quantities with sufficient accuracy to warrant their use for deriving a general equation to represent the thermal changes for all concentrations .
An attempt is therefore made to analyse the results for stronger solutions only , and it will be found that the relation Q == alog^N + frN + c holds well under these conditions .
( l ) Sulphuric Acid .
From Thomsen 's values of Q for N = I , N = 2 and N = 5 respectively , the equation is Q = 4666 log , N \#151 ; 196 N + 6595 , * ' Thermochemische Untersuchungen .
' ' DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .
The accuracy with which this can be applied is comparable with that of Thomsen 's formula\#151 ; in fact the accuracy is greater if the most dilute solution is ignored .

dN " N Plotting dQ/ dN and l/ N thus gives a straight line which cuts the axis atN = 23'8 , which is nearly H2S04.24H20 .
( Diagram II .
) The suggestion might be made , therefore , that accepting the linear relation between Q and l/ N , the heats generated were such as if the true solvent were H2S04.24H20 instead of pure water .
( 2 ) Nitric Acid .
Thomsen gives six results for Q with solutions diluted down to five molecules of water .
Taking three of the values N = g- , N = 2'5 , and N = 5 , the equation derived is Q = 2099 log , N \#151 ; 18 N + 3437 .
By reference to the preceding equations the low value of the coefficient of N corresponds to .2t|-9- molecules of water in the limiting case where dQ/ dN vanishes .
A further equation derived from N = j , and N = 5 , which assumes the coefficient of N to vanish , gives quite as satisfactory a relation , if allowance for experimental errors is made .
Here Q = 2020 log , N +3406 .

Referring to the simpler equation here adopted good agreement is obtained except for N = 1 where an error of about 3'5 per cent is shown .
The heat of dilution at any given concentration is now given by dQ =2020 dN " N * i.e. , with slight error the heat of dilution is proportional to the concentration .
( Diagram II .
) Developing a similar argument to that employed for sulphuric acid , there will be no limiting hydrate formed .
( 3 ) Hydrobromic Acid .
Thomsen gives six values for total heat of dilution for various concentrations of hydrobromic acid .
The last of the series is for a weak solution , and is ignored .
The equation is derived from the concentrations N = 3 and N = 6 , is Q = 3356 loge N +12,222 .

It is seen as before that the above type of equation gives good agreement over those ranges in which heat is most generated , and therefore most accurately measured .
As with nitric acid , no limiting hydrate appears to be formed since dQ 3356 dN " N The graph for this relation is shown in Diagram II .
( 4 ) Acetic Acid .
This solution differs from all the others since the heat of dilution for the highest concentrations is negative , acquires a minimum value , rises to zero and for dilute solutions becomes positive .

The limiting concentration is in this case well within the range over which the linear relation holds .

Dunnington and Hoggard 's Results.* A series of determinations of heats of dilution for different strong solutions , were made by the above investigators .
They made saturated solutions of various salts , and then added water until some whole number of molecules of water was associated with each molecule of the salt .
Then one or two molecules of water were further added , and the heat generated or absorbed quoted .
A solution of ammonium acetate was taken in three molecules of water .
Heat was generated throughout the process of dilution .
The results quoted show a distinct break in continuity between solutions containing from six to eight molecules of water .
Lithium chloride is the only other solution which generates heat to any extent on dilution .
These results have already been compared with those obtained above .
One solution only is given with values extending over a range of concentrated solutions , in which heat is absorbed .
This is ammonium nitrate solution .
The initial and final concentrations are quoted in columns I. and II .

Here we have a case of a solution giving negative heats of dilution ; yet the same relation may still be applied .
The extrapolated value of dQ/ dN vanishes when N = 24'01 , suggesting a solution of limiting concentration NH4N03 .

This may be interpreted in a similar manner suggesting that the first effect of adding water is to produce this solution , and that we are really diluting solutions , with another weak solution , not water , of strength NH4N03 .

The following general conclusions may be drawn from the above facts :\#151 ; ( l ) That , in spite of the varying thermal effects obtained on diluting different solutions , these effects may be expressed in a simple manner for the range over which the solutions may be considered concentrated ; DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS .
( 2 ) That when the solutions become more dilute they , at the same time , become more complex ; ( 3 ) That those thermal changes occur in strong aqueous solutions , which suggest that the solute is dissolved , not in water , but in some definite hydrate of the solute , in general containing a large number of molecules of water .
In special cases , however , such as that of acetic acid , the water molecules may be few in number , while with nitric and hydrobromic acids the solvent becomes pure water .
( 4 ) That calcium chloride does not show the effect in so marked a degree , probably because it is impossible to work with solutions of the same relative strength .
