A Letter to James West , Esq ; President of the Royal Society , containing the Investigations of Twenty Cases of Compound Interest , by J. Robertson , Lib. R. S. SIR , IT is well known that the consideration of Compound Interest is of great utility in the Computations respecting the values of Pensions , Annuities , Reversions , and other affairs relating to Money concerns ; and therefore , many Mathematicians have bestowed some time on this useful subject , and have endeavoured to discover practical methods for solving the various cases that might occur : And in these inquiries , the use of Logarithms has been found of singular service in facilitating the operations .
Read Dec. 13 , 1770 .
The late William Jones , Esq ; F. R. S. among the variety of Mathematical matters to which he gave attention , considered the business of Compound Interest fully , and did , many years ago , cause to be engraved on a Copper-plate , more cases in Interest than had been exhibited before that time : Several copies of impressions from that plate were distributed among his friends ; to whom it appeared that he had treated this subject in a more extensive manner than had been done by other Mathematicians .
The Theorems , or Rules , for the Cases of Compound Interest , without their investigations , were inserted by Mr. Jones , in the quarto edition of Logarithms , published by Gardiner ; and the Rules were also communicated to Mr. Dodson , who published them , by Mr. Jones 's leave , with examples to illustrate the use of his Antilogarithmic Tables : But the investigations of these Theorems not having yet been made public , it is apprehended that Gentlemen curious in these speculations would be pleased to see them : And should the following Essay be approved of by you , who have been for many years acquainted with the Finances of this Nation , and the importance of a ready knowledge in computing the Interest on the National Loans , you will be pleased to communicate it to the Royal Society .
I am , SIR , Your most humble servant , John Robertson .
In this subject five particulars are taken into consideration .
1st , The Annuity , Rent , or Pension .
2d , The Times that Annuity , Rent , or Pension is to continue .
3d , The Rate of Interest used in the computation .
4th , The Amount of those Rents , and their Interest , when they are forborn to be received any times after they are due .
5th , The present worth of those Rents , some times before they are due ; or , of a Sum to be received before it is due , Discount being allowed .
And And the investigations naturally fall under two heads .
First , The Consideration of Amounts .
Secondly , The Consideration of Discounts .
Under the first head an Equation is to be obtained between the Annuity , Time , Rate and Amount , from the known proportion that subsists between sums of money put to interest , during the same length of time , and the amounts of the principal and interest together .
Under the second head another Equation is to be formed between the Annuity , Rate , Time and present Worth , from the known proportion that subsists between the sums discounted , and their present worths , when done for the same time .
As these Equations involve quantities common to both of them , therefore other Equations may be thence deduced , containing all the five terms before specified .
And hence , any three of the five terms being given , the other two are to be found , which admits of 20 Cases .
Some of these Cases will produce Adfected Equations , where the index of the highest power of the unknown quantity will be the number of times the Rent is to continue , or to be paid : Therefore , the solution of those Cases will be given by a method of Approximation , as no better way has yet been discovered for the solution of Adfected Equations , in numbers , above the third or fourth degree .
In the following investigations , Let a= Annuity , Rent , or Pension .
n= Number of times that interest is to be paid for the annuity , or sum lent .
r= Rate of interest of 1 ~ .
for 1 time .
m= Amount of the annuity , or sum lent for n times , at r interest .
p= Principal sum used , or present worth of a sum before it is due .
Of Compound Interest .
First , In Amounts , Let q=1+r= Amount of 1 ~ .
for 1 time .
Now , a= last year 's amount .
And 1 : q : : a : aq = last but one year 's amount .
1 : q : : aq : aq2 = last but two year 's amount .
1 : q : : aq2 : aq3 = last but 3 .
And so on to aqn-1 = first year 's amount .
Therefore a+ aq + aq2 + aq3 &amp;c. + aqn-1 = m. But a : aq : : m aqn-1 : m a. Euc .
12 .
v. Then ma= mq aqn Or ma=m+ mr aqn Therefore aqn a= mr Put A= qn .
Then A1Xa= mr Therefore A= mr + a/ a Hence a= mr/ A 1 m=A1X a/ r r=A1X a/ m. Second , In Discounts .
Since q : 1 : : a : a/ q = 1st year 's present worth .
q : 1 : : a/ q : a/ q2 = 2d year 's present worth .
q : 1 : : a/ q2 : a/ q3 = 3d .
And so on to a/ qn = nth years present worth .
Therefore a/ q + a/ q2 + a/ q3 + , &amp;c. to a/ qn = p. But a/ q : a/ q2 : : p a/ qn : p a/ q. Euc .
12 .
v. Therefore pqn-a/ qn = pq a. Or pqn-a/ qn =p+ pr a. Therefore aqn a= prqn .
Or A1xa= prA .
Therefore A= a/ a rp Hence A1xa= mr = prA .
Therefore A= mr+a/ a = a/ a-rp = m/ p =1+ rn .
Case I. Given a , m , p : Required r. Since A= m/ p. Therefore r=A1x a/ m. Case II .
Given p , m , n : Required r. Since ~r + 1n = m/ p. Therefore r= ~m/ p1/ n 1 .
Case III .
Given a , m , n : Required r. Since A1xa= mr .
Therefore ( A 1/ nr = ) m/ na = ~1 + rn 1/ nr .
Now ~1 + rn =1+ nr +nxn 1/ 2 r2 +nxn 1/ 2 xn 2/ 3 r3 , &amp;c. Therefore m/ na =1+ n-1/ 2r + n-1/ 2 x n-2/ 3r2 , &amp;c. And ~m/ an2/ n-1 = ~1 +n 1/ 2r +n 1/ 2 xn 2/ 3 r2 2/ n-1 ; which , by the Binomial Theorem , will become =1+r+n+ 1/ 12 r2 ( nearly ) .
Let D= ( ~m/ na 2/ n-1 = ) 1+r+n+ 1/ 12r2 , Then r2 + 12/ n + 1r =D1x 12/ n + 1 , Let 2E= 12/ n + 1 , Then r+E= ( ~2 xD1+ExE = ) F. Therefore r=F E. In this Solution , 1st , find D= ~m/ na 2/ n 1 , 2d , find E= 6/ n + 1 , 3d , find F= ~2 xD1+Ex E , 4th , find r=F E. Case IV .
Given a , p , n ; Required r. Since A1xa= Apr. Therefore p/ na =A 1/ Anr=1 A -1/ nr=1 ~1 +r -n/ nr .
Now , ~1+r-n= 1-nr+nxn+1/ 2r2 nx n+1/ 2 x n+2/ 3r3 + &amp; c , Therefore p/ na =1 n+1/ 2r + n+1/ 2 x n+2/ 3r2 , nearly .
Then ~p/ na-2/ n+1 = ~1 n+1/ 2r + n+1/ 2 x n+2/ 3r2-2/ n+1 ; which , by the Binomial Theorem , will become =1+r n-1/ 12rr , nearly .
Now , ~p/ na-2/ n+1 = ~na/ p2/ n+1 .
Let G= ( ~na/ p2/ n+1 = ) 1+rn 1/ 12r2 .
Therefore rr 12/ n 1r =G1x 12/ n 1 .
Let 2H = 12/ n 1 .
Then rH= ( ~H 2 .
G1xH = ) K. Therefore r=H K. Case V. Given a , n , r ; Required m. Since A1xa= mr .
Therefore m=A1 xa/ r. Case VI .
Given p , n , r ; Required m. Since A= m/ p. Therefore m=p A. Case VII .
Given a , p , r ; Required m. Since m/ p = a/ a rp .
Therefore m=a p/ a r p. Case VIII .
Given a , p , n ; Required m. Find G=n a/ p 2/ n+1 ; H= 3/ 1/ 2 n 1 ; K=~H2G1x H. Now , HK=r by 4th .
But r+1n= m/ p. Therefore m=r+1nx p. Case IX .
Given a , n , r ; Required p. Since A1xa=pr A. Therefore p=A1x a/ A r. Case X. Given m , n , r ; Required p. Since A= m/ p.Therefore p= m/ A. Case XI .
Given a , m , r ; Required p. Since mr+ a/ a = m/ p. Therefore p=m a/ m r+a Case XII .
Given a , m , n ; Required p. Find D= m/ na 2/ n 1 ; E= 3/ 1/ 2 n+ 1 ; F=~ 2D 1+ExE Now , FE= r , by 3d .
But 1+rn= m/ p. Therefore p= m/ 1 +r n. Case XIII .
Given p , n , r ; Required a. Since A1xa=pr A. Therefore a=pr A/ A 1 .
Case XIV .
Given p , m , n ; Required a. Since A=r+1n= m/ p. Therefore r+1= m/ p 1/ 1 .
Hence A 1 , and B1 ( = r ) are known .
Therefore a=mxB 1/ A 1 .
Case XV .
Given m , n , r ; Required a. Since A1xa=m r. Therefore a=m r/ A 1 .
Case XVI .
Given p , m , r ; Required a. Since A= m/ p , A1 is given .
Therefore a=m r/ A 1 .
Case XVII .
Given m , p , r ; Required n. Put L , for logarithm ; and L~ , for arith .
comp .
of a log .
Since 1+rn= m/ p. Therefore n= L , m+ L~ , p/ L , r+ 1 .
Case XVIII .
Given a , p , r ; Required n. Since 1+rn= a/ a p r. Therefore n= L , a L , ap r/ L , r+ 1 .
Case XIX .
Given a , p , m ; Required n. Since A= ( r +1n = ) m/ p , Then ( L , r+1n = ) L , m L , p= L , A ; Hence A , and A 1 , are known .
Also L , A1+ L , a+ L~ , m= L , B1 ( by Case 14th ) : Hence r= ( B 1 ) , and r+ 1 , are known .
Therefore n=L A/ L , r+ 1 .
Case XX .
Given a , m , r ; Required n. Since ( A = ) mr+ a/ a =1+r n. Therefore n= L , mr+a L , a/ L , 1+ r.
