The Similarity in Nature of X- and Primary y-Rays .
489 through matter , always assuming that the / 3-rays had passed through enough matter to nullify the effects of scattering .
If we assume such a distribution and from it plot the number of / 3-rays against the velocity , there will be a certain velocity for which the number of / 3-rays is a maximum .
We will call this velocity the mean velocity , the / 3-rays with a smaller velocity the slower / 3-rays , and those with a greater velocity the faster / 9-rays .
The exponential law would probably mean that the very slowest / 3-rays were absorbed , while the faster / 3-rays simply lost energy , ' the distribution keeping the same .
This hypothetical distribution , however , cannot be kept indefinitely , as the faster / 3-rays must ultimately have a smaller velocity than the mean velocity , and so , as we have seen above , the exponential law can only be approximate , and after a certain thickness the / 3-rays must become more and more absorbable .
Similar results to those obtained above can be deduced from a table given in a paper by H. W. Schmidt* on the absorption ( in aluminium ) of the / 3-rays of radium E. The Similarity in Nature of X- and Primary .f By J. A. Gray , M.Sc .

) Introduction .
It has generally been supposed that X- and primary 7-rays are of the same nature .
Both radiations are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields , and both excite cathode or / 3-rays in materials in which they are being absorbed , the velocities of these cathode or / 3-rays being independent of the material in * Schmidt , 'Phys .

t The term X-rays is arbitrarily limited to the X-rays excited by cathode rays in vacuum tubes or to the scattered and characteristic radiations formed from these X-rays in suitable radiators .
The most penetrating X-rays so far experimented on are a little more penetrating than the X-rays characteristic of cerium .
We keep the term y-rays for y-rays excited by / 3-rays .
Primary y-rays are y-rays emitted from radioactive atoms .
[ Sept. 26 , 490 Mr. J. A. Gray .
The Similarity in which they are excited , and increasing with the penetrating power* of the X- and 7-rays.f These mutual properties , combined with the facts that / 3-rays can excite y-rays , !
and that primary 7-rays are emitted by / 3-ray products , leave little doubt of the identity in nature of X- and primary 7-rays , although penetrating 7-rays , like those of radium , possess many properties apparently different from those of X-rays .
Further and practically conclusive proof , however , of the similarity in nature of X and 7-rays has been found by the writer in the course of some experiments on two types of very " soft " 7-radiation , viz. , the primary 7-rays of radium E , and the 7-rays excited by the / 8-rays of radium E in lead .
The experiments show , for example , that the " softer " the 7-rays , the more nearly do their properties , with respect to absorption and scattering , approach those of X-rays .
Further , the primary 7-rays of radium E excite the characteristic X-radiations of silver , tin , and other metals .
A description of these experiments is given below , together with a comparison of some properties of X- and 7-rays .
It is convenient to divide the description into the following sections :\#151 ; S 1 .

In these circumstances , the 7-rays coming - through the graphite consist mainly of primary 7-rays , as the following ; experiment shows ( see fig. 1):\#151 ; The active material A was placed 5 cm .

] Nature of X- and Primary graphite plate 3*2 mm. thick placed above it .
The electroscope was a cube of 18 cm .
length , and the bottom of it was formed by cardboard 2'5 mm. thick , covered with aluminium foil .
This thickness of cardboard is sufficient to cut off / 3-rays excited by 7-rays in the absorbing sheets , and , together with the graphite , is sufficient to cut off the / 3-rays of radium E. Readings were taken with and without a lead radiator under the active material .
Absorbing sheets could be placed above the graphite plate .
Readings in divisions per minute are given in Table I. From previous work , we know that the increase is mainly due to 7-rays excited in the lead radiator by / 3-rays .
Without the radiator , the reading is due to primary 7-rays and 7-rays excited by the The latter part is small in amount compared with the intensity of the y-rays from the lead .
The table therefore shows that , with no radiator under the active material , most of the 7-rays coming through the graphite are primary 7-rays .

/ 3-rays in the graphite .
To measure the absorption of these 7-rays , the active material was kept in the same place , and absorbing materials were placed directly above the graphite plate , the reading through the latter being taken as the initial reading .
Carbon , aluminium , iron , tin , and lead were used as absorbing materials .
In the curves ( figs 2a , 2b ) the intensity of the 7-radiation ( measured by ionisation ) is plotted against the mass per unit area of the absorbing sheet .
Mr. J. A. Gray .
The Similarity in [ Sept. 26 , MASS OF ABSORBER IN GRAMMES PER 0-30 0-20 0-10 MASS OF ABSORBER IN GRAMMES PER CM Aii analysis of the curves gives the following results:\#151 ; ( 1 ) There is a very soft type of 7-rays present .
Aluminium 0*5 mm. thick cuts the whole radiation down to 40 per cent. , whereas it takes a sheet of aluminium 6 mm. thick to cut the radiation passing through 0'5 mm. of aluminium down to 40 per cent. ( cf. Table I ) .
The average mass absorption 1912 .
] Nature ofX- and Primary coefficient in the first ^ mm. of aluminium is approximately 8*3 and as the radiation coming through this thickness of aluminium is so much more penetrating , a considerable portion ( about half ) of the total radiation must consist of rays which , in aluminium , have a mass absorption coefficient much less than 8*3 .
Barkla and Sadler* have found that the X-rays characteristic of molybdenum have a mass absorption coefficient 4*8 in aluminium .
The X-rays characteristic of cerium have a mass absorption coefficient in aluminium = 06 .
It is , therefore , apparent that in the 7-rays we are examining there are present some 7-rays much less penetrating than some types of X-radiations .
It is not improbable that these very soft rays come from radium D. ( 2 ) After passing through 2 cm .
of carbon , after the soft radiation referred to above has been cut out , the rays are absorbed very nearly exponentially by carbon , the mass absorption coefficient being = 0116 approximate .
( 3 ) Lead absorbs the more penetrating part of the radiation 28 times as much as aluminium and four times as much as iron .
Otherwise , these substances absorb and " harden " the rays similarly .
This has been shown by testing the radiation coming through different thicknesses of aluminium , iron or lead by an aluminium screen .
Between 0*0462 and 0*0924 mm. of lead , the absorption is approximately exponential , the mass absorption coefficient being 11*2 .
After traversing 0*132 mm. of lead , the mass absorption coefficient is approximately 8 , and after 0*264 mm. 5 .
( 4 ) Tin absorbs the radiation abnormally .
With only the cardboard above the absorbing sheets , tin lets through , apparently , more radiation than lead ( see fig. 2b ) , but the radiation coming through the tin is less penetrating , so that when 3*3 mm. of aluminium is placed above the absorbing sheets , there is a smaller reading with tin absorbers .
Normally tin absorbs less radiation than lead .
It will be seen later that the primary 7-rays of radium E excite the characteristic radiation of tin .
This explains the abnormal absorption of tin and the smaller penetrating power of the radiation coming through the tin .
( b ) Absorption of the 7 -Raysexcited by the / 3-Pays of Radium E in Lead.\#151 ; For these experiments the active material was placed between two lead sheets ( 0*1 mm. thick ) and then on the same position as before , the graphite plate , 3*2 mm. thick , being placed above the upper lead sheet .
The absorption experiments were carried out as before except that 2 mm. of graphite were placed above the absorbing sheets to be sure of cutting off all the / 8-rays from them .

Mr. J. A. Gray .
The Similarity in [ Sept. 26 , The initial reading was 15 divisions per minute and the previous results ( fig. 2b ) show that primary 7-rays can only form about 20 per cent , of this .
The same absorbing materials were used as before , and in fig. 3 the intensity of the radiation is plotted against the mass per unit area of absorbing material .
The rays are much more penetrating than the primary 7-rays .
MASS OF ABSORBER IN GRAMMES PER CM2 ^Compared with the results of the previous experiments , carbon absorbs more , relatively , than the other absorbing materials , aluminium more than iron , tin , and lead , but iron and tin less than lead .
Carbon absorbs the radiation very nearly exponentially , the mass absorption coefficient being 0- 074 approximately .
Other substances " harden " the radiation .
The initial mass absorption coefficient of the radiation in lead is 3*7 ; at 0*2012 mm. , 1- 88 ; and at 0*67 mm. , 1*1 .
Some of the rays are still more penetrating and about 1 per cent , of the radiation passes through 1 cm .
of lead .
The radiation coming through lead has been examined by an aluminium screen in order to compare the relative penetrating powers of the radiation in aluminium and lead .
Tin absorbs decidedly less than lead and the radiation coming through small thicknesses of tin is just as penetrating as that coming through lead .
For example , a sheet of tin of mass per unit , area 0*311 grm. reduces the reading to 6*95 , lead of mass per unit area 0*300 grm. to 6*39 .
12*15 mm. of aluminium reduce the respective readings to 5*21 and 4*59 .

Barkla and Sadler measure absorption by the diminution in intensity of a parallel beam of X-rays , allowing for scattering and the production of characteristic radiations .
In these experiments we have not used a parallel beam and cannot allow for all scattered radiation .
The effect of not using a parallel beam is to obtain too large a value for the absorption coefficient .
Compared with Barkla and Sadler 's values , the effect of the scattered radiation is to decrease the absorption coefficient , but this matters little when the scattering is small compared with the absorption , as the following considerations show .
Suppose a parallel beam of X-rays passes normally through a plate in which its absorption coefficient is n , and that its intensity at a depth x of the plate is I. Then , if the intensity of the emergent scattered radiation from a layer of thickness is aldx , and we measure emergent scattered radiation as well as the initially parallel radiation in taking an absorption curve , the apparent absorption coefficient will be approximately / x \#151 ; a. * Barkla and Sadler , loc. cit. t Russell , ' Jahr .

496 Mr. J. A. Gray .
The Similarity in [ Sept. 26 , In the case of the primary 7-rays of radium E , the scattering is small compared with the absorption except in the case of absorption in carbon ( see p. 500 ) .
In the case of absorption in other substances , the values given for the absorption coefficient are probably too high , owing to the fact that we have not used a parallel beam of rays .
It will be seen from the table that the 7-rays of radium E are absorbed somewhat similarly to Ag X-rays , iron absorbing the latter seven times as much as aluminium , and gold nearly twenty-five times as much .
On the other hand , tin absorbs the primary 7-rays of radium E 28 times as much as aluminium , but Ag X-rays only 5'32 times as much .
This again shows the abnormal absorption by tin in the former case .
The table also shows that the less penetrating 7-rays excited by the / 3-rays of radium E in lead are absorbed similarly to the primary 7-rays of radium E , while the more penetrating 7-rays are absorbed similarly to the 7-rays of actinium .
The absorption experiments show , therefore , that there is no discontinuity , with respect to absorption , between X and 7-rays .
The reason that the rays we have examined are absorbed exponentially by carbon , while hardened by other substances , is due to the fact that for large changes in penetrating power of the rays in these substances there are only small changes in penetrating power in carbon .
Comparing the 7-rays excited by the / 3-rays of radium E in lead with the 7-rays of actinium and radium , it will be seen that absorption increases with the atomic wreight , the less penetrating the radiation .
This gives the main explanation of the " hardening " of the 7-rays of radium by elements of high atomic weight .
S S 2 .
Scattering of the Primary y-Rays of Radium E and Excitation of Characteristic Radiations by them .
In a previous paper attention was drawn to an effect observed when the primary 7-rays of radium E fell on radiators of low7 atomic weight ( see fig. 4 ) .
It was found that radiators E of low atomic weight produced a marked increase in the reading when placed just below the active material A , which was surrounded by graphite thick enough to cut off the / 3-rays of radium E. For example , a " thick " carbon radiator increased the reading 25 per cent. , a " thick " sulphur 5 per cent. , whereas iron and lead radiators increased the reading less than 1 per cent. It was thought at the time that the radiation from the carbon was too large in amount to be due to scattering , but that it might be due to the excitation of a characteristic radiation .
This , however , is not the case , as further experiments showed that the effect was due to scattering .
On the Nature of X- and Primary 1912 .
] other hand , it has been found that the primary 7-rays excite the characteristic radiations of silver , tin , and other metals .
In these experiments the active material was placed in the same position as in the previous absorption experiments , and a measure of the absorption in aluminium of the radiations returned from the different radiators used was found by placing aluminium above the active material , and taking-readings with and without the radiators .
Readings in divisions per minute of the electroscope are given below in Table HI .
The mass per unit area of the absorbing materials is given in the table .
It will be seen from the table that the radiation returned by the carbon is at first more penetrating than the exciting radiation .
This is due to the presence in the latter of the soft 7-radiation referred to above .
After this soft 7-radiation has been cut out , the radiation returned by the carbon is somewhat less penetrating .
The radiation returned by an iron radiator is much smaller in amount .
This is due to the fact that iron absorbs the radiation more than carbon .

/2ya , so that if the scattering per unit mass is the same for all substances P should vary inversely as the mass absorption coefficient .
Taking P for carbon as 024 and using the relative values of given in Table II , we find the following values of P for other substances ; iron , 0 01 ; tin and lead , 0,0025 .
Except in the case of tin , these numbers agree as well as can be expected with the numbers found , and we can explain the results by assuming that the radiators scatter the same amount of radiation per unit mass .
The radiations returned from silver , tin , etc. , are so much greater in intensity that the obvious assumption to make is that these radiations are those characteristic of the radiator .
The radiations are less penetrating , the lower the atomic weight of the radiator , and less penetrating than the scattered radiation from the carbon .
The table gives a measure of the penetrating power of the radiations , but from the way they have been obtained the numbers cannot be regarded as accurate enough to give the true absorption coefficients of the respective characteristic radiations .
For comparison with the known absorption coefficients , numbers have been calculated ( Table IY ) by using these absorption coefficients and the initial values of the radiation returned from the different radiators ( .
1*32 for cerium ) and then calculating the intensity of the radiation which should come through the different aluminium screens .

We have previously seen that tin absorbs the primary 7-rays of radium E abnormally .
The didymium and erbium radiators were tried some Nature of X- and Primary y-Rays .
1912 .
] time after the other radiators .
The erbium radiator behaved very much like lead , but the result from didymium shows that the characteristic radiations of both praseodymium and neodymium are excited , for praseodymium forms about one-third of the mixture , and if only its characteristic radiation was excited , the intensity of the radiation returned from didymium would only be about one-third of that returned from cerium .
These experiments , by showing that the primary 7-rays of radium E excite the characteristic radiations of various elements , give perhaps the most definite proof possible that these 7-rays are of the same nature as X-rays .
We have also seen that there are no differences to be noted in the absorption of X- and 7-rays other than those due to differences in penetrating power .
It is therefore concluded that , whatever their origin , 7-rays are of the same nature as X-rays .
It is to be expected that the 7-rays excited in lead by the / 3-rays of radium E will excite the characteristic radiations of some elements of higher atomic weight than neodymium .
So far no experiments have been made to test this point , but it is worthy of notice that , compared with iron , lead absorbs the 7-rays excited in lead by the ,3-rays of radium E more than the primary 7-rays of radium E. Further the radiation ( 7-rays excited by / 3-rays ) coming through lead absorbers appears to be somewhat less penetrating than the radiation through tin absorbers .
There is some slight evidence that the characteristic radiation of lead is being excited .
S 3 .
Comparison of the Scattering of X- and ( a ) Experiments on X-rays show that it is probable that there are two or more ways in which X-rays can be scattered .
For ' example , Crowther* has examined the distribution of scattered X-radiation from a paper radiator , and divides the scattered radiation into\#151 ; ( 1 ) The true scattered radiation , the distribution of which is given by the pulse theory .
( This distribution is given by the expression Ifl=I"/ a ( 1 + cos2 6 ) , where 6 is the angle the direction of the scattered radiation makes with the direction of the primary radiation .
The most significant feature is that the intensity of the scattered radiation is less at an angle of 90 ' from the primary radiation than in any other direction .
) ( 2 ) The excess radiation , which appears only in directions close to that of the exciting beam .
In a later paper , Crowtherf considers that the excess radiation he is * Crowther , ' Roy .

2 m 2 Mr. J. A. Gray .
Similarity in [ Sept. 26 , examining might be due to the excitation of X-rays by cathode rays , formed by the absorption of the primary X-rays .
Scattered X- or 7-rays must be partly formed in this way .
On the other hand the scattering of penetrating 7-rays like those of radium is similar to the scattering of a pencil of \#171 ; - or / 3-rays.* It is too large an amount to be due to the excitation of 7-rays by / 3-rays and is probably due to collisions with the atoms of the radiator .
We may therefore conveniently divide scattered X- or 7-radiation into three types : ( 1 ) A scattered radiation , the distribution of which is given by the ordinary pulse theory .
( 2 ) A scattered radiation , caused by a direct scattering of the X- or 7-rays , analogous to the scattering of a pencil of a- or / 3-rays .
( 3 ) X- or 7-rays formed by cathode or / 9-rays excited in the radiator during the absorption of X- and 7-rays .
With X-rays , the first and third types may be more prominent .
With the 7-rays of radium the second type is most prominent .
( b ) Prof. Barklaf has found that the lighter elements scatter X-rays differing widely in penetrating power to the same extent , mass for mass , the scattering referring to the first type noted above .
A parallel beam of X-rays , in passing through a layer dx of absorbing material , is assumed to lose a fraction S dx by scattering .
Barlda found that S/ p = 0200 ( p = density ) for all types of radiation examined .
If we introduce a coefficient , Si/ p , referring to the radiations scattered in directions between 90 ' and 270 ' from that of the primary beam , Si/ p cannot be greater than the absorption coefficient , however we measure it .
Por X-rays Si/ p = 0100 .
It is therefore obvious that Barkla 's law must break down .
In the case of the 7-rays of radium , Si/ p is very small .
For the primary 7-rays of radium E , Si/ p for carbon = 0-24 x 2 x 0116 = 056 approximately , for ? !
= ^ P ( see p. 497 ) .
P P This value is of the same order as that obtained for X-rays and shows that the scattering of the primary 7-rays of radium E is similar in magnitude and probably similar in character to the scattering of X-rays .
( c ) Iron and lead do not apparently scatter the primary 7-rays of radium E more per unit mass than carbon .

The scattering of the primary 7-rays of radium E is probably similar in character and magnitude to that of ordinary X-rays .
