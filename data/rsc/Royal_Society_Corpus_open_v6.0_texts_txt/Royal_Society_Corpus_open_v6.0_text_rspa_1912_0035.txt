) ( Abstract .
) This is a sequel to a paper on the same subject published in the ' Philosophical Transactions/ vol. 210 ( 1910 ) .
The sequences which give the principal and the sharp series are discussed as they occur in the second and third groups of the periodic table of the elements , and it is found that the sequences , or types of formulae , which in the alkalies give the principal and sharp series , here give the sharp and principal .
In order to prevent confusion the notation P and S sequence is changed to p and s sequence , the letters P , S , being reserved for principal and sharp series .
Additional evidence is afforded to show that these sequences depend on the atomic volumes of elements in a quite definite way .
An attempt is made to allot the S and D series of europium and of radium .
The spectrum of Eu affords evidence that the element fills the gap between Cd and Hg , and from the series formulae of both elements regarded as functions of their atomic volumes probable values of their densities are obtained , viz. , 12*58 for Eu and either 5*10 or 6*12 for Ra .
Further , the result obtained in Part I , that if the denominator of the p sequence be thrown into the form m + 1\#151 ; W(l\#151 ; m~r ) + fi \#151 ; am"1 the ratio a/ /x , is a constant ( 0*21520 with uncertainty in the last two digits ) , is confirmed for elements of second and third groups .
A comparison of denominators of corresponding orders of P series , and of these with those of S series , gives relations which can be used as tests for their proper allocation in doubtful cases .
In consequence slight modifications are suggested in Paschen 's lists of upper lines of HgP and CaP .
Two appendices are added , one dealing with the S and D series of Eu and Ra , the other giving lists of the S and P series lines treated of , with some historical notes .
