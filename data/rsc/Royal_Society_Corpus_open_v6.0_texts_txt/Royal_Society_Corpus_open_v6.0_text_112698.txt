In the number of the 'Proceedings of the Meteorological Society ' for February 1869 , there is a paper by Mr. Charles Meldrum , of the Mauritius , on the connexion between the rotation of the wind in the Southern Indian Ocean and the positions of oppositely directed air-currents .
In this paper the author expresses his opinion that the tropical hurricanes of the Southern Indian Ocean invariably originate between two opposite streams of air .
More than a year previous to the appearance of Mr. Meldrum 's paper my own attention had been drawn to the occurrence in these islands of some remarkable storms , which appeared to be connected with the previous existence at the earth 's surface of the two wind-currents , polar and equatorial , in close proximity to each other .
The first occasion on which this was noticed by me was on January 22 , Humidity of the Air .

The channels of the currents were so close to each other that , while at Yarmouth there was a strong easterly wind , there was a westerly gale at Portsmouth .
The contrast exhibited by the two currents as regards temperature was very marked , and a dense fog was experienced in London .
Barometrical readings were very low over the region which separated the districts of the respective currents .
Next day pressure rose very rapidly ; but this was only the precursor of an equally sudden diminution of its amount , and of the advent of the equatorial current which swept with great violence over these islands , producing a very serious southerly gale on the 24th of January .
On the 8th of December last , conditions similar to those of January 22 were observed .
Strong easterly winds were reported from Scarborough , while westerly winds of great force prevailed in the Channel and in France .
This state of things was succeeded , after an interval of two days , by a southerly storm , the whole sequence of phenomena resembling very closely what had been noticed eleven months before .
I Means In order to trace out this remarkable succession of occurrences , it was resolved to examine all the cases in which the polar and equatorial currents made their appearance at the surface of the ground within the area of the British Islands , and to record the phases of weather which ensued .
As these currents flow in opposite directions , it is evident that they must move in channels approximatively parallel to each other , so that there are only two cases to be examined .
I. The polar current flows in a latitude higher than the equatorial current .
II .
The polar current flows in a latitude lower than the equatorial current .
The daily weather reports for a period of 27 months have been examined , and the result has been that 27 instances of case I. and 30 of case II .
have been discovered .
These instances are all enumerated in two tables , which are herewith submitted * .
In accordance with the relation between the motion of the wind and the distribution of atmospherical pressure which has been laid down by Prof. Buys Ballot , viz. that barometrical readings are lower on the left-hand side of a current of air than on the right , we should expect to find that in case I. there would be a relative barometrical minimum , and in case II .
a relative barometrical maximum between the currents .
This supposition is found to be abundantly confirmed by the observations .
As regards the weather subsequently experienced , Mr. Meldrum states that when the two currents , the N.W. monsoon and S.E. trade , are noticed simultaneously over the Indian Ocean , the channel of the latter lying on the southern edge of that of the former , i.e. in a latitude higher than it , the barometer between them is low and falling .
Ultimately the reduction of pressure becomes greater at one point than at the others , and a centre of barometrical depression is formed , resulting eventually in a cyclone .
In the instances which form the subject of the present paper , we have not been able to trace the actual genesis of a storm within the limits of our area of observation .
MXost of our storms come on us from the Atlantic , and are apparently not formed in the immediate district from which our reports are derived .
The result of the investigation appears , however , to show that whereas the conditions of case I. are indicative of considerable atmospherical disturbance , those of case II .
seem to show that winds will probably be light for some days .
Case I. The polar current flows in a latitude higher than the equatorial current .
In other words , easterly winds prevail in the north , westerly in the south .
Northerly and southerly winds are nearly entirely absent .
Twenty-seven instances have been noticed of these conditions , and they IS are very generally followed after a brief interval by a serious barometrical depression , frequently resulting in a southerly gale .
In 12 instances a southerly gale followed in 2 days .
, 4 , , , , , , , 3 days .
, , 6 , , fresh southerly winds , not a gale , followed .
, , 2 , , a north-east gale followed .
, , 2 , , a southerly gale set in at once .
1 , , no change of weather ensued .
27 These facts appear to show that the conditions of case I. indicate a deep-seated disturbance of the atmosphere .
In almost every case they seem to point to the existence , or at least the formation , of a barometrical minimum over the Atlantic Ocean , which will probably advance to our coasts and result in a southerly storm .
On only two occasions did the centre of the disturbance pass to the southward of these islands , viz. the two instances in which the north-easterly gale followed .
Case II .
The polar current flows in a latitude lower than the equatorial current .
In other words , easterly winds prevail in the south , westerly in the north .
Thirty instances have been noticed .
In 11 instances no change of weather ensued .
7 , , The polar current completely displaced the equatorial current over these islands , and easterly winds set in .
7 , , This displacement was only partial , and north-westerly winds set in .
5 , , Southerly gales or fresh southerly winds followed , 30 It would appear from the foregoing that case II .
is not , as a rule , indicative of the approach of a serious atmospherical disturbance , although such did occur in five instances ( one-sixth of the total number under consideration ) .
In the great predominance of instances the weather either remained unchanged and calm , or else the polar current succeeded in displacing the equatorial more or less completely , and the winds which prevailed over these islands generally were from points between N.W. and E. It is obvious that , from the very limited area from which our observations are derived , we are at present unable to examine into the mutual action of the currents on each other ( unaffected by any influence exerted on the wind by inequalities in the earth 's surface , such as those produced by an irregular coast-line stretching out into the open sea ) , as has been done by Mr. Meldrum for the Indian Ocean ; but it is hoped that this commencement of an attempt to trace a connexion between successive conditions of weather may be deemed worthy of the notice of the Royal Society .
