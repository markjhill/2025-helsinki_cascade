of this investigation , carried out in conjunction with Professor FOSTER , it was stated that when narcotine is heated for some time with strong hydrochloric acid a new base was formed , which we called methyl-normal-narcotine , or methyl-nornarcotine , being derived from narcotine by replacing two atoms of methyl by two of hydrogen .
In continuing the research into this subject , it has been observed that when narcotine is heated with hydrochloric acid , for only a short time , one atom of methyl is replaced by hydrogen ; and further , that when narcotine is heated with fuming hydriodic acid , three atoms of methyl are replaced by three of hydrogen , thus forming two other bases , the description of the preparation and properties of which form the subject of this Memoir .

On the Action of Hydriodic Acid on Narcotine .
When narcotine is heated with fuming hydriodic acid , iodide of methyl is evolved , and on investigating the residue it was found to consist of the iodide of a new base .
To prepare this the following method was emyloyed : fuming hydriodic acid ( made by converting iodine into hydriodic acid by sulphuretted hydrogen , evaporating the solution , and , when cold , saturating it with gaseous hydriodic acid ) is made to act on narcotine in a retort at the boiling-point of the mixture , when iodide of methyl is immediately given off and a tarry mass left in the retort , which is chiefly the iodide of the new base .
In two experiments made with 50 grms. of narcotine , 45*7 and 46-2 grms. of iodide of methyl , and in a third experiment with 100 grms. of narcotine , 91-8 grms. of iodide of methyl , were obtained , 51'5 grms. and 103'1 grms. being the theoretical quantities required for the following reaction : C22 H23 NO7 + 3HI = C19 HI NO7 + 3CH3 I. If the reaction C22 23 NO7 +21 2HI 0 Hl19 NO7 + 2CH3 I took place , the theoretical quantity of iodide would only be 34'3 grms. and 68*7 respectively .
All endeavours to obtain the base in a state fit for analysis have been fruitless , owing to its rapidly oxidizing when exposed to the air ; to establish its composition the follow ing method was adopted .
After distilling off the iodide of methyl , the contents of the retort were thrown into water , the free acid neutralized by carbonate of sodium , and then water added till all the iodide was dissolved .
The iodide is much more soluble in a neutral solution than in an acid one .
To the solution of the iodide hydrochloric acid is added until no further precipitate takes place ; this precipitate consists chiefly of the chloride of the new base .
The chloride is filtered off and redissolved in water ( for it behaves like the chloride of methyl-nornarcotine , being far more soluble in pure than in acidulated water ) , and reprecipitated with hydrochloric acid .
This operation is repeated until the precipitate contains no longer any iodine .
The analysis of this chloride , dried first over lime and sulphuric acid , and then in the water-bath , gave the following results .
The substance was burnt with chromate of lead and oxygen .
The chlorine determinations were made in the usual manner .

were made from samples prepared at different times , and the portions employed for the above determinations were obtained by fractional precipitation .
The chloride when first precipitated is almost white , but soon becomes slightly yellow .
It is amorphous .
The base itself , when newly precipitated , is nearly white , but as soon as it is exposed to the air it becomes almost black ; it is soluble in carbonate of sodium and caustic soda , potash or ammonia , slightly soluble in hot alcohol , quite insoluble in ether , and nearly so in water .
All endeavours to obtain it or its salts in a crystalline state have hitherto failed .
The base may be called normal narcotine , or , shorter , nornarcotine , as it contains , in all probability , normal meconin combined with cotarnimide .
Thus in Part I. page 366 of this Memoir , carried out in conjunction with Professor FOSTER ( Philosophical Transactions , 1863 ) , it is stated that cotarnine may be written HH ( Cll Hg 2 ) " ' O , which is cotarnimide , ( Cll H9 02 ) " ' } CH3 }N H }N , in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by one of methyl ; and in the Journal of the Chemical Society we suggest that the rational formule of narcotine may be written thus : Narcotine .

On the Action of Hydrochloric Acid on Narcotine .
When narcotine is heated with hydrochloric acid for about two hours , chloride of methyl is evolved , and on examining the residue it will be found to contain the chloride of a new base .
The best method of its preparation is as follows:-Narcotine ( say 100 grms. ) is placed in a large flask with a quantity of strong hydrochloric acid ( 500 cub. centims. ) with a little paraffin , and heated on a water-bath for the space of three to four hours ; much chloride of methyl is given off , and there remains behind in the retort the chloride of a new base .
The reaction which takes place is simply that one atom of methyl in the narcotine is replaced by one of hydrogen , thus : C22 H23 NO7 + HC1 C21 H21 NO7 -+-CH3 C1 .
To obtain the base from the chloride , the following process was adopted : as soon as the contents of the flask are cold they are neutralized by carbonate of sodium ; this salt is then added in excess , which , dissolves any methyl-nornarcotine , or nornarcotine which may have been formed during the reaction , and leaves the new base and any undecomposed narcotine .
This may be separated by caustic potash , in which the new base is readily soluble , narcotine being insoluble in that reagent .
The potash solution is acidulated with hydrochloric actd , and the base precipitated fractionally by carbonate of sodium .
The solution in which the base is suspended may be heated to 50 ?
C. ( but not higher , otherwise the base is apt to get sticky ) , when it filters readily .
The separation from narcotine may also be accomplished by alcohol , in which the new base is easily soluble .
On analyzing the base the following results were obtained .
It was dried in a Leibig 's tube , first at 50 ?
C. , and then at 100 ?

3-66 The pure base forms a white amorphous powder , almost insoluble in water and ether , very soluble in alcohol .
Its salts , like those of other bases derived from narcotine , are , as far as they have been prepared , amorphous .
The base may be called dimethylnormal-narcotine , or , shorter , dimethyl-nornarcotine .
The rational formula of this base is either if narcotine be H } C13 N CIt3 , H1 ( Cll H9 02 ) } ( C Hs O ) " } ( C8 H4 )0 o ( C8 H4 O ) ( CH1)2H }03 CH0113 f0 CH N 01 }N ( CllH,9 2 ) " ' ( Cs H40 ) ( CH3)2 H }03 .
Further experiments will show which is the correct one : in the annexed Table the properties and reactions of the narcotine bases are given side by side .
Neither of the above bases have any marked physiological effects ; for in working with them , as well as in taking grain-doses , no ill effects have been observed .
It is worthy of notice that the taste of the chlorides varies so markedly by the replacement of one atom of methyl by one of hydrogen .
