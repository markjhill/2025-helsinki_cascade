( Abstract .
) This investigation is in correction and extension of Pliicker 's theory of transversals ( System der Geometry , ยง 3 , art .
64 ) , and is founded on the theories explained in the 'Proceedings , ' vol. x. pp. 415-426 .
It is shown that iff(x , y ) be an algebraical formation ( function ) of n+ 2m dimensions , such that when x is scalar ( possible)f=0 has n scalar and 2m clinant ( imaginary ) roots , and X is the coefficient of in +2m , the value off(xl , yl ) may be represented geometrically by Xt M 2Q M , Q XMn 1Q M2Q M(m)Q MM2( , )Q * OB OB o ' OB ' " OB ' where 0 is the origin , OP=x1 .
0I , PQ=y .
OB , and PQ is any straight line , cutting the curve whose equations are OM=x .
OI+y .
OB , f( , y ) = 0 , ( where a , y are scalar , OI is in the direction OP , OB is of the same length as 01 and in the direction PQ ) in the n points M1 , M2. .
M , , and where M , , M ' ... ml(m ) , M ( " ' ) are determined as follows .
Put y=r+ -1 .
s , where r and s are scalar , reduce f(x , y ) to the form F , ( , r , s)+ V-1T .

F2 ( x , r , s ) , put F1-=0 , F , =O , from which equations find by elimination F , ( xr , )= 0 , F4 ( x , s ) =0 , and construct the loci of R and S , where OR=x .
OI + r. OB , ( X , r)=0 , OS= .

Then determine the points Rt , R " ... R(iT ) in which PQ cuts the first , and the corresponding pairs of points S1S , ' , S2 ' , S 2 " , S ... Sm ) , S(m ) in which it cuts the second , and draw Rt/ M-= / -1 .

The loci of M , R , S are the principal scalar and clinant radical loci of the formation f(x , y ) .
From this it is concluded , that if 01 02 ... O , On be a completely enclosed polygon , the sides of which are taken in order , to replace PQ , first in the direction 01 02 , 02 0 , &amp;c. , and then in the direction 02 0 , , 03 02 , &amp;c. , and the points M1 , AMN ... Mn , M,1 , Mr ' ... M1(m ) , M ?
2(m ) be determined for each direction and each side , and [ Oi,2 M-O .
2,1 M ] represent the product of the ratios 01 M-r-O0 M , &amp;c. , the 01 M referring to the origin 01 and the M being determined with reference to the direction 01 0 , , and the 02 M referring to the origin O2 and the M being determined with reference to the direction 02 01 , and so on , then we shall have in all cases , [ 01,2 M-0211M ] .
[ 02,3 M. 03,2 M ] ... .
[ O , ,M 0~ , M ] = 1 , and not =+ 1 , as supposed by Plicker , whose error is traced to its origin , and displayed in all the examples he has given , where the roots off=0 are scalar .
This result is then applied to a simple case where some of the roots of f== are clinant , and a result obtained in accordance with other considerations .
