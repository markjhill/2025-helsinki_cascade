] Mr. Bevan took the opportunity of the severe frost of the last winter to determine the modulus of elasticity of ice , which he did by cutting a rectangular plate of that substance from the surface of a pond of 100 inches in length , 10 in width , and about 4 in thickness .
The deflection produced by a weight of 25 lbs. was 0-206 inches , from which he concludes the modulus of elasticity to be 2,100 , U00 feet .
The modulus for water he states at 2,178,000 feet , on a certain hypothesis respecting its cubical compression .
