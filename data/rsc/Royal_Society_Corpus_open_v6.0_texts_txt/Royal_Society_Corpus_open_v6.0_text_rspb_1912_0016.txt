A fully illustrated account of the very remarkable life-history of Astrosehra-Rhododiplobia will shortly be published , which , I trust , will furnish clear proof as to the accuracy of the statements here made .
The two organisms have become , in all reasonable probability , indispensable to each other and inseparable .
The sponge embryos , before they have left the parent , are associated with plants bearing carpogonia antheridia or stichidia , and even the youngest sponges , barely visible to the naked eye , have solid well-built skeletal walls composed of aragonite spherules each with an algal spore in its centre .
I consider that the association has become one of true symbiosis , and is not merely an instance of parasitism of the alga on the sponge , or vice versa .
