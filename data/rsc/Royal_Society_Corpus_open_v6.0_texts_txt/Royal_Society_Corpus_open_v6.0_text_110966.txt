" On Carbonic Acid as a Solvent in the process of Vegetation .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. In this paper the author describes the results of experiments made with water saturated with carbonic acid , in many instances condensed by pressure and supersaturated , on the more important inorganic elements of plants , compounds not soluble in water alone , such as phosphate of lime , silica , &amp;c. These results appear to prove that this acid performs in the econ6my of growing plants a double function ; one well-known , already carefully studied , by which , undergoing decomposition in the leaves under the influence of solar light , it supplies carbon to the growing vegetable , and restores oxygen to the atmosphere ; the other , hitherto little attended to , in which it acts as a menstruum , conveying certain compounds , insoluble in water , from the soil into the interior of plants to become constituents of their organism .
The experiments he details are of two kinds , one set being on single compounds , the other on a mixture of these compounds .
The results of the latter seem to prove that water impregnated with carbonic acid is capable of dissolving several substances at the same time , and of keeping them mixed in solution , as carbonate of lime , carbonate of magnesia , phosplate of lime , silica , &amp;c. He concludes his paper with certain remarks of a theoretical nature , founded on his experimental results , bearing on vegetable physiology , soils and their substrata , and mineral waters , --making these remarks , as he says , with the hope of drawing attention to the subject in its most interesting relations , and of exciting further and more minute research .
