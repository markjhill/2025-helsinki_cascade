GEORGE RENNIE , Esq. , Treasurer , il the Chair .
His Grace the Duke of Wellington was elected a Fellow of the Society .
Postscript to Mr. W. H. Barlow 's paper on Alternating Diurnal Currents of Electricity at the Terrestrial Surface .
The author states that since his paper was read to the Society , le had made further experiments to determine with greater accuracy the direction in which the daily electrical currents travel , and also how far the motions of the horizontal magnetic needle correspond with that of the telegraph .
With regard to the latter , he finds that although they agree as to the general character of their deflexions , there is no decided simultaneous coincidence in their movements .
