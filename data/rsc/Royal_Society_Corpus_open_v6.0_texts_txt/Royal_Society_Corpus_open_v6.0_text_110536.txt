" Researches towards establishing a Theory of the Dispersion of Light .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
The author here prosecutes the inquiry on the dispersion of light which was the subject of his former papers published in the Philo ?
sophical Transactions for 1835 and 1830 , extending it to media of higher dispersive powers , which afford aseverer test of the accuracy of M. Cauchy 's theory .
He explains his methods of calcula ?
tion and the formulae on which his computations are founded , and which are different from those employed in his former investigations : and then states the results in a tabular form .
On the whole be concludes that the formula , as already deduced from the undulatory theory , applies sufficiently well to the case of media whose disper ?
sion is as high as that of oil of anise-seed : or below it , such as nitric , muriatic , and sulphuric acids , and the essential oils of angelica , cinnamon , and sassafras , balsam of Peru , and kreosote .
It also represents , with a certain general approximation to the trutb , the in ?
dices of some more highly dispersive bodies .
The author therefore considers it as extromely probable that the essential principle of the theory has some real foundation in nature .
From the regularity which he finds in the deviation of observation from theory , he thinks it likely that the formula only requires to receive some further developement , or extension , in order to make it apply accurately to the higher cases , while it shall still include the simpler form which so well accords with the lower .
