" On the Temperature of Steam , and its corresponding Pressure .
" By John Cur , Esq. Communicated by J. Scott Russell , Esq. , F.R.S. In this paper , which is a continuation of a former paper bearing the same title , the author states that the law given in that paper , in reference to steam when superincumbent on the water in the boiler , may be rendered applicable to the determination of its pressure when insulated therefrom , as in the case of the expansive engine , of which the cylinder being in part filled with steam of the same temperature as that in the boiler , the communication is suddenly cut off , and the stroke is completed by the pressure on the piston of the steam whilst expanding within the cylinder .
He considers that the power of expansive engines has been greatly overrated , instancing those of the Great Britain , which were of the estimated power of 1200 horses , but which he states he can prove did not exceed in actual power that of 300 horses .
This he attributes to the inapplicability of Mariotte 's law without a particular limitation .
Having premised that " it is assumed that , by nature 's law in the generation of steam , of the temperature 100 ?
and of a pressure of 15 lbs. on a square inch , the density of the Matter of Heat , is to that of atmospheric air of the same temperature and pressure exactly as 1 to 2 , " he then gives general laws , by means of which , he considers , the pressure of steam when cut off from its generating source may be correctly estimated .
" In conclusion , " the author states , " it may be said that , this and the former paper , both professing to give laws relative to the pressure and temperature of steam , independently of experiment , the theories proposed must in general be accepted as absolute truths , in case of being verified by experiment , or taken as vain attempts to subvert laws already firmly or sufficiently established .
