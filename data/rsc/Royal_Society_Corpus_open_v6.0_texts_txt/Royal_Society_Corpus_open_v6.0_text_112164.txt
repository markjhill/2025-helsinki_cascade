" On New Cornish Minerals of the Brochantite Group .

In March last my attention was drawn to a very small specimen of Killas , with some minute blue crystals on it , associated with a few equally small green crystals .
The latter I proceeded to investigate with the goniometer .
They proved to have almost identical angles with Atacamite , and , presuming them to be crystals of that mineral , I neglected them in order to measure the angles of the blue crystals .
These proved also to belong to the prismatic system , and evidently were a new mineral .
The specimen had come to the Museum from Mr. Talling , of Lostwithiel , a dealer from whom the National Collection has received a very large proportion of its finest Cornish minerals , and whose attention had been called to this specimen by the novelty of its appearance .
Mr. Talling no sooner was apprised of the interest attached to his little fiagment of Killas , than he set energetically about tracing it to its locality .
After a short time he succeeded in finding this locality ; and though he has not yet divulged it , he soon forwarded other specimens to me at the British Museum .
IIe has since found fine masses of the minerals , which are described in this memoir , and they are now in the collection under my charge .
The Killas which usually carries these minerals is of a very friable texture , often occurring as a breccia cemented by the minerals themselves , and at other times coated by them as incrustations .
Sometimes , however , they are found on it as minute crystals scattered over , and in direct contact with , the rock .
or in a succession of layers deposited on it .
In the latter mode of occurrence , the stone , whether Killas or , as occasionally , a quartzose vein-stone , usually presents on its surface a very thin glaze of a greyish-white colour , and endowed with a remarkable metallic lustre .
On this a thin layer , sometimes but ith of an inch in thickness , of the blue crystals is met with , and on that a thicker agglutinated mass of the same mineral of rather a paler blue colour .
Sometimes this paler variety exhibits a very fine sky-blue colour , and assumes the form of foliations with the appearance of small and extremely thin crystals , which are , in fact , an aggregate of crystals generally twinned , and in the form of laminae .
Above the whole is occasionally seen a coating , varying in thickness from an eighth to half an inch , of a faintly bluishor greenish-white mineral with a fibrous , and sometimes a slightly foliated , structure .
The place of the blue mineral is often taken by one of a fine green colour , varying from a dark emerald to verdigris-green , and often crystalline .
Occasionally also crystals of Brochantite may be seen , sometimes in clusters , and occasionally also mixed with this green mineral .
I. On Langite .
The first of these minerals that I propose to describe is that which occurs in crystals and crystalline masses , whether of the deeper or lighter lines of blue .
I propose to call it Langite , in honour of my valued friend and late colleague Dr. Viktor von Lang , now Professor of Physics at Gratz .
Langite crystallizes in very minute generally dark and somewhat greenish blue crystals belonging to the prismatic system , the ratios of the parameters being a : b : c= 1 : 0-5347 : 0-6346 .
The forms observed are ( I 0 0 ) , ( 0 0 1 ) , ( 1 1 0 ) , ( 2 0 1 ) , and ( 0 1 0 ) .
The inclinations found between normals to thin planes being 100 001-90 t 110 1 10=56 16 001 201=51 46 O ooe 1 10 201-2 0 1=68 8 100 11 0=61 46 61 ? ?

] 393 Cleavage parallel to 001 distinct ; parallel to 100 nearly equally so .
The plane 001 is brilliant ; 100 rather less so , as is the rarer plane 01 0 ; the plane 10 sometimes exhibits hollows , the sides of which are parallel to the cleavages .
The specific gravity of the mineral is 3'48 to 3'50 .
Its hardness less than 3 .
On looking through a section of one of these microscopic crystals of Langite , ground parallel to the plane [ 0 0 1 ] in the polarizing microscope , the plane of the optic axes is seen to be parallel to 10 0 ; but though coloured rings are visible , the axes lie beyond the field , and the double refraction is weak .
Probably , however , the first mean line is the normal to 00 1 , and it is negative .
The symbol for its optical orientation would be bca The crystals present dichroism:1st .

As seen through 100 ( along axis a ) : c ( plane of polarization [ 1 to 00 1 ) darker bluish green .
a ( plane of polarization 11 to 01 0 ) lighter bluish green .
It is a fact worthy of remark that Langite is geometrically isomorphous with Leadhillite .
Langite is insoluble in water , but readily soluble in acids and ammonia .
When submitted to the action of heat , it loses its blue colour , turning at first bright green .
As the heat is increased , it passes gradually through various darker hues of this colour , till it becomes of a dull olive-green , and ultimately black .
Water is given off the whole of the time , which in the later stages of the change has an acid reaction .
Before the blowpipe , it gives off water and acid fumes , colours the flame green , and becomes reduced to metallic copper with carbonate of soda on charcoal .
The chemical composition of Langite is represented by the empirical formula , 4Cu " O 5H'2 SO4 .
which may be written as 3 { c/ 0+ Cu " S 4O -f21'2 O The copper was determined in one case ( i. ) by precipitation on the interior of a platinum crucible , by means of a cell of a Grove 's battery , a method that seems , however , to give the value of the metal in excess ; in other cases ( ii .
, iii .
, and iv .
) by means of the volumetric method , wherein the iodine set free on precipitation of copper by an iodide is determined by means of starch and hyposulphite of soda .
The sulphuric acid was determined in the usual way .
The water in two cases ( i. and ii .
) , by mixing the powdered and dried mineral with previously ignited carbonate of barium and heating the mixture in a combustion-tube in a current of dry [ 1865 .
air , the liberated water being retained by sulphuric acid in pumice in a bulbed U-tube .
In the other cases the mineral was heated with oxide of lead , and the water estimated by the loss .
From the slight differences in the numbers given by the sulphuric-acid determinations in these minerals , and from the difficulty of determining the values of traces of iron , lime , and impurities as disturbing elements in the calculation of the analysis , the water-determinations are especially important .
The following are the numbers the analyses have yielded me-Ist , crystals of Langite , carefully selected ; and 2nd , of the much paler blue incrustation or aggregation of crystalline Langite , generally showing the plane 001 largely developed on the surfaces of the incrustation : I.

The passage , then , of Langite , under the influence of heat , into a substance with the formula 3 Cu " H'202 +Cu " SO , + 2 II ' would take place at a temperature of about 180 ?
C. ; and it would further pass into a substance with the formula of Brochantite , 3 Cu " H'22 +O Cu " SO4 at a temperature of about 230 ?
or 240 ?
C. A transition , however , so effected would probably be incompatible with a new crystalline structure in the mineral resulting from it , which would be , in fact , a pseudomorph .
The high temperature requisite for the expulsion of the last three equivalents of water , which cannot be performed without decomposition , would seem to give colour to the belief that this water is in more intimate association with the oxide , and forms with it a hydrate .
It is a fact worthy of remark that I have found one old specimen in which Langite is associated with Connellite .
I convinced myself that the mineral was Langite by removing a crystal and measuring it .

II .
Waringtonite .
The mineral to which I would next invite attention is one with a colour varying from emerald to verdigris-green that occurs sometimes mixed with Langite , but more often forming with it a continuous coating on the Killas or vein-stone , one part of this coating being in such cases Langite , and another part of it consisting of the mineral in question .
At first I was in doubt whether this green body was not the result of the action of heat on Langite--in fact a pseudomorph after that mineral .
Subsequently , however , Mr. Tailing sent me some unmistakeably crystalline specimens , and as at that time I had already made its analysis , there could no longer be any doubt that it was a new mineral .
I propose to call it " Waringtonite " in honour of my friend Mr. Warington Smyth , Inspector of Mines to the Crown Lands , and to the Duchy of Cornwall , &amp;c. The crystallography of Waringtonite presents a difficult problem , for the reason that it carries only one very distinct plane .
The prevalent form of the crystals , which are almost microscopic , is that of a double curved wedge ( or , to use a familiar illustration , like a stonemason 's doubleedged hammer ) , the flat summit being formed by this distinct but narrow plane .
That plane is characterized by great brilliancy , is bounded by curved outlines , and though often fissured near its extremities by the accumulation of two or more parallel crystals in optical contact at their centres , is otherwise without striation .
If we call this plane , by its analogy to the brilliant and unstriated plain in Langite , 00 1 , and refer a very minute plane occasionally seen on the acute edges of the wedge to the form 10 0 , we find the planes 01 0 , 01 0 , and those in the zone [ 0 1 0 , 00 1 ] represented by rounded surfaces , from which it is impossible to obtain any accurate measurements ; and the prism planes in the zone [ 1 0 0 , 01 0 ] are likewise much curved .
There would seem to be two prisms in that zone , one of which forms a normal angle approximately determined as 11 0 , 11 0=28 ? ?
30 ' very nearly .
It is difficult to say whether Waringtonite is prismatic or oblique .
The plane 001 forms an angle of 90 ?
with those in the zone L0 1 0 , 100 ] ; and the principal planes indicated by the planes of polarization , as seen on looking down the normal to 01 0 , are parallel to 100 and 00 1 ; but it is very difficult to speak with certainty as to the exact directions of the planes of polarization as seen when looking through the plane 00 1 , and as to the direction of a plane of polarization really bisecting the acute angles of the wedge .
The crystals often occur in interpenetrating forms , with the appearance of being twins .
The angles , however , between corresponding planes in the two individuals are not sufficiently uniform for the establishment of a twin plane .

Like Langite , this mineral also contains traces of iron , lime , and magnesia .
Of protoxide of iron I found in a very pure crystalline specimen of the mineral 0'14 per cent. Crystals of Brochantite are often mixed with the Waringtonite , and the more amorphous forms of the green substance would seem to be mixtures of the two minerals .

Its specific gravity is 3'39 to 3'47 .
Its hardness is 3 to 3 5 .
It abrades calcite , but not Arragonite .
When a crystalline fragment is crushed between a cleavage face of celestine and a [ 1865 .
smooth surface of porcelain or chalcedony , it leaves the celestine without perceptible abrasion .
Brochantite , on the other hand , deeply cuts into that mineral .
In comparing the physical characters of these two minerals , one has furthermore to observe that , besides their differences in hardness and specific gravity ( in Brochantite G=3'87-3'9 ) , their crystallographic habits are entirely dissimilar .
Thus if we assume , for comparison 's sake , the angle obtained for the normal inclination of the planes 11 0 , 110 in Waringtonite to correspond to that between e e ' or 10 1 , 101 of Brooke and Miller in Brochantite , a point of view from which we see the two minerals in the most advantageous orientation for comparison , we shall find that the planes of the form ( 1 0 1 ) in Brochantite , like those of ( 1 1 0 ) in Waringtonite , are much curved ; the plane I 00 , however , is a well-marked plane in Brochantite , striated parallel to the zone-axis [ 0 0 1 ] .
In Waringtonite the corresponding plane , 01 0 , is a curved surface without striation .
The plane 001 is furthermore a most conspicuous plane in the latter mineral , while the analogous plane 010 in Brochantite is , I believe , unknown .

Pisani 's analysis of a green mineral which he found associated with Langite , and which was probably Waringtonite mixed with the ferruginous Killas ( on which it often occurs ) .
He assigned the mineral to Brochantite .
Berthier 's mineral from Mexico was probably Waringtonite containing hygrometric moisture , as by deducting two per cent. of water his analysis almost exactly accords with the numbers representing that mineral .
The green fibrous mineral from the Cobre mines in the Atacama desert would seem , from the description of the eminent mineralogist of Chili , to be a mixed substance .
III .
Atacamite .
I have mentioned that the first specimen of Langite that came into my hands had upon it small bright green crystals of a mineral with the angles of Atacamite .
These angles were the following : Corresponding angles Found .

It is dichroic , exhibitingc , =plane of polarization parallel to 00 1 , grass-green .
b , =plane of polarization parallel to 01 0 , more yellowish green .
There were but a very few of these minute , in fact microscopic crystals ; but two of them I dissolved in nitric acid on a watch-glass , and tested them with nitrate of silver in the field of the microscope .
A white cloud was at once struck in the solution , which , while refusing to dissolve in nitric acid , readily yielded to the solvent action of ammonia .
This mineral then is Atacamite , as .
is confirmed by its apple-green streak .
Since that time a mine in St. Just has produced this mineral , and I have from Mr. Tailing a specimen from there which contains sulphate as well as chloride of copper .
I hope soon to have the opportunity of effecting its analysis from purer specimens than such as have as yet been raised ; for these consist of an intimate mixture , in which Atacamite , indeed , seems to be the preponderating ingredient , but in which , perhaps , Langite and Brochantite will prove also to be present .
