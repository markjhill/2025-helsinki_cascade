511 1871* ] On Intensity of Daylight in Eclipse of 1870 .
but the stage of excitement , which in adult cats passed gradually off in a few hours , was followed by a condition marked by a want of coordination of muscular movements , and presenting the most grotesque resemblance to certain stages of alcoholic intoxication .
This stage was followed in turn by sleepiness and stupor , in which the kitten was left at night ; in the morhing it was found dead .
Two observations have shown that these salts paralyze ( in dogs and cats ) the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric ; they also seem to lower the internal tension , but want of material has prevented me from ascertaining how this is brought about .
On rabbits neither salt , even in doses of a decigramme , seems to have any effect , except perhaps a slight excitement .
There is no dilatation of the pupils , no flow of saliva , and , if one observation can be trusted , no paralysis of the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric .
No marked difference was observable between the two salts , except that the morphia-salts seemed rather more potent than the corresponding codeia bodies .
V The salts of deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia given by mouth or by subcutaneous injection in doses of a decigramme , produced in adult cats , almost immediately after exhibition , a series of convulsions much more epileptic in character than tetanic .
In one case there was a distinct rotatory movement .
In a few minutes these convulsions passed away , leaving the animal exhausted and frightened .
Then followed a stage of excitement with dilated pupils and flow of saliva , very similar to the effects of the tetra-codeia and tetramorphia salts , but less marked .
Doses of half a decigramme given to adult cats produced the stage of excitement only , without the convulsions .
In no case , with any specimen of product , has vomiting been witnessed ; like the tetracodeia and tetramorphia products , the deoxycodeia and deoxymorphia salts appear to paralyze the inhibitory fibres of the pneumogastric .
Trials with rabbits gave only negative results .
No marked differences could be observed between the hydrochlorates and hydrobromates of deoxycodeia or deoxymorphia .

( Abstract .
) , The following communication contains the results of a series of measurements of photochemical action made at Catania in Sicily , on Dec. 22nd , 1870 , during the total solar eclipse of that date , with the primary object of determining experimentally the relation existing between this action 512 Messrs. Roscoe and Thorpe on the Chemical [ June 15 , and the changes of area in the exposed portion of the sun 's disk .
The attempt to establish this relation has already been made by one of us from the results of observations carried out by Captain John Herschel , R.E. , F.R.S. , at Jamkandi , in India , during the total eclipse of Aug. 18 , 1868 .
Unfortunately the state of the weather at Jamkandi at the time of the eclipse was very unfavourable , and the results were therefore not of so definite a character as could be desired , and it appeared important to verify them by further observation .
The method of measurement adopted is that described by one of us in the Bakerian Lecture for 1865 ; the observations were made in the Garden of the Benedictine Monastery of San Nicola , at Catania , the position of which , according to the determination of Mr. Schott of the United States ' Coast Survey , is lat. 37 ' 30 ' 12 " N. , long .
lh 0 ' 18 " E. In order to obtain data for determining the variation in chemical intensity caused by the alteration in the sun 's altitude during the eclipse , observations were made on the three previous days , during which the sky was perfectly cloudless .
In the following Table the observations taken at about the same hours are grouped together:\#151 ; Table I. Mean Altitude , No. of Observations .

X , where CIa signifies the chemical intensity at any altitude a in circular measure , CI0 the'chemical intensity at 0 ' , and const , a a number derived from the observations .
, The observations on the day of the eclipse ( the 22nd ) were commenced about nine o'clock a.m. , and up to the time of first contact were made regularly at intervals of about an hour .
The sky up to this point was cloudless , and the measurements almost absolutely coincided wit t e mean numbers of the preceding day 's observations .
As the eclipse progressed , and the temperature of the air fell , clouds were rapidly orme \gt ; 1871.1 Intensity of Daylight Eclipse of 1870 .
and from lh 40 ' up to the time of totality it was impossible to make any observations , as the sun was never unclouded for more than a few seconds at a time .
As the illuminated portion of the solar disk gradually increased , * after totality , the clouds rapidly disappeared , the amount falling from 9 ( overcast =10 ) to 3 in about fifteen minutes .
The observations were then regularly continued to within a few minutes of last contact .
Although the disk and by far the largest portion of the heavens were completely obscured by clouds during totality , rendering any determination of the photochemical action perfectly valueless for our special object , it was yet thought worth while to attempt to estimate the chemical intensity of the feebly diffused light at this time , which certainly is capable of producing photographic action .
Immediately after the supposed commencement of totality the slit was opened , and the sensitive paper exposed for ninety-five seconds .
Not the slightest action , however , could be detected on the paper , and we therefore believe that we are correct in estimating the intensity of the chemically active light present at certainly not more than 0*003 of the unit which we adopt , and probably much less .
The Table containing the experimental numbers and the graphic representation of them are given in the memoir .
By a graphical method the relative areas of the sun uneclipsed at the times of observation were obtained ; and these are seen in column 3 of Table II .

Column 2 gives the results of the photochemical observations made during the eclipse obtained from the graphical mean , and corrected for variation in the sun 's altitude , the total chemical action immediately before first contact being taken as unity .

2 s Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher on the [ June 15 , The question of the variation of ( 1 ) the direct and ( 2 ) the diffused radiation is next discussed .
On comparing the curve representing the chemical intensity of diffused light with the curve of solar obscuration , it is found that the rate of diminution in chemical action exerted by the diffused light is up to a certain point greater than corresponds to the portion of eclipsed sun , whilst from this point up to totality the rate of diminution becomes less than corresponds to the progress of the eclipse .
The same rapid diminution in the chemical action of the diffused daylight during the early periods of the eclipse was also observed at Jamkandi ; it is doubtless due to the dark body of the moon cutting off the light from the brightly illuminated portion of sky lying round the solar disk .
The results of the observations at Catania are then compared with those made at Moita , near Lisbon , and communicated to the Society in 1870 .
This comparison shows a striking coincidence between the two sets of observations .
In each case it is seen that the relation between solar altitude and total chemical intensity is represented by a straight line , although the Catania observations slightly exceed , by a constant difference , those made at Moita in conformity with the slight difference in latitude , and with the fact that the former determinations were made at a greater elevation above the sea-level .
The Catania observations further confirm the fact which we formerly announced , that for altitudes below 50 ' the amount of chemical action effected in the plane of the horizon by diffused daylight is greater than that exerted by direct radiation , and also that at altitudes below 10 ' direct sunlight is almost completely robbed of its chemically active rays .
