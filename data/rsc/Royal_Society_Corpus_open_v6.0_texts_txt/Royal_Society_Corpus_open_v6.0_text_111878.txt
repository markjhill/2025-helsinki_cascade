( Abstract .
) Considering the equation of the fifth order , or quintic equation , ( *v , 1)v-=(v-- ) ( vx ) ( V--- ) ( X- ) )=0 , and putting as usual fI= x , + ttx2 + W2x + W3x4 + W4x , , where w is an imaginary fifth root of unity , then , according to Lagrange 's general theory for the solution of equations , fw is the root of an equation of the order 24 , called the Resolvent Equation , but the solution whereof depends ultimately on an equation of the sixth order , viz. ( fw)5 , ( fw2)5 , ( ftW)5 , ( fw4)5 are the roots of an equation of the fourth order , each coefficient whereof is determined by an equation of the sixth order ; and moreover the other coefficients can be all of them rationally expressed in terms of any one coefficient assumed to be known ; the solution thus depends on a single equation of the sixth order .
In particular the last coefficient , or ( fw f.fw'.fCw3 .
i)5 , is determined by an equation of the sixth order ; and not only so , but its fifth root , or fw.fi2.f3.fw4 ( which is a rational function of the roots , and is the function called by Mr. Cockle the Resolvent Product ) , is also determined by an equation of the sixth order : this equation may be called the Resolvent-Product Equation .
But the recent researches of Mr. Cockle and Mr. Harley* show that the solution of an equation of the fifth order may be made to depend on an equation of the sixth order , originating indeed in , and closely connected with , the resolvent-product equation , but of a far more simple form : this is the auxiliary equation referred to in the title of the present memoir .
The connexion of the two equations , and the considerations which led to the new one , are pointed out in the memoir ; but I will here state synthetically the construction of the auxiliary equation .
Representing for shortness the roots x , X2 , xa , x4 , x5 , of the given quintic equation by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and putting moreover 12345=12+23+34+45+51 , &amp;c. ( where on the right-hand side 12 , 23 , &amp;c. stand for x , x2 , x2x3 , &amp;c. ) , then the auxiliary equation , say ( *X+ , 1)6=0 has for its roots 1-=12345-24135 , - , =21435-13245 , 92=13425-32145 , -5=31245-14325 , 03- ] 4235-43125 , p6-=41325-12435 , and , it follows therefrom , is of the form ( 1 , 0 , C , 0 , E , F , G , 1 ) , =0 , where C , E , G are rational and integral functions of the coefficients of the given equation , being in fact seminvariants , and F is a mere numerical multiple of the square root of the discriminant .
The roots of the given quintic equation are each of them rational functions of the roots of the auxiliary equation , so that the theory of the solution of an equation of the fifth order appears to be now carried to its extreme limit .
We have in fact 0106 + 0204+ 0305 =(*X 1)4 , 0102 + 0304 + 0506 = ( :X2 ) 1 )4 0105 + 0203 4 0406 =(XX1 1)4 , 90103 + 0206 + 0305 =( 0X4 } 1 ) 01045 + 0205 + 0306 = ( jX^5 ) 1 ) ' % where ( *Xxl , 1)4 , &amp;c. are the values , corresponding to the roots x , ) &amp;c. of the given equation , of a given quartic function .
And combining these eqluations respectively with the quintic equations satisfied by the roots x , , &amp;c. respectively , it follows that , conversely , the roots x,1 x2 , &amp;c. are rational functions of the combinations P1~q6 + ( iP024 + 0305 , 0102+ 34 + 5030+ 06 , &amp;c. respectively , of the roots of the auxiliary equation .
It is proper to notice that , combining together in every possible manner the 6 roots of the auxiliary equation , there are in all 15 combinations of the form 0b02+0304+00q6 ' .
But the combinations occurring in the above-mentioned equations are a completely determinate set of five combinations : the equation of the order 15 , whereon depend the combinations 0902+ 0304+ 0o0q , is not rationally decomposable into three quintic equations , but only into a quintic equation having for its roots the above-mentioned five combinations , and into an equation of the tenth order , having for its roots the other ten combinations , and being an irreducible equation .
Suppose that the auxiliary equation and its roots are known ; the direct method of ascertaining what combinations of roots correspond to the roots of the quintic equation would be to find the rational quintic factor of the equation of the fifth order , and observe what combinations of the roots of the auxiliary equation are also roots of this quintic factor .
The direct calculation of the auxiliary equation by the method of symmetric functions would , I imagine , be very laborious .
But the coefficients are seminvariants , and the process explained in my memoir on the Equation of Differences was therefore applicable , and by means of it , the equation is readily obtained .
The auxiliary equation gives rise to a corresponding covariant equation , which is given at the conclusion of the memoir .
