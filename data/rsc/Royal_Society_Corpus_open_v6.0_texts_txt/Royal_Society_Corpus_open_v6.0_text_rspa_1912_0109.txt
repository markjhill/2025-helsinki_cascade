XX#.\#151 ; The Conversion of Ammonic Cyanate into Urea , especially as influenced by Alcohols .
By E. E. Walker , B.Sc. ( Communicated by Prof. H. E. Armstrong , F.R.S. Received July 29 , \#151 ; Read December 5 , 1912 .
) In view of the importance of a knowledge of the precise effects produced by ordinary alcohol and its homologues on the course of chemical change , it is remarkable that so little has been done to elucidate , by systematic inquiry , the nature of their influence .
Attention has been drawn , in earlier studies of this series ( Nos. XI , XIII , XVIII ) , to the marked difference in the behaviour of the various homologues of alcohol , especially to the fact that the higher alcohols are the more active agents .
Moreover , it is well known to physiologists that the higher alcohols have lethal properties which are scarcely met with in their lower and more soluble homologues .
Unfortunately , in many cases , the results obtained by previous workers do not afford satisfactory information on the subject , as the conditions have been such that the alcohol has not been the only variable but has been substituted for water , the amount of water being decreased as that of alcohol was increased ; the effects produced might be due to either or both of these variations .

[ July 29 , The investigation carried on by James Walker and Kay* to determine the influence of alcohol on the formation of urea from amnionic cyanate may be taken as an example .
The method adopted involved the substitution of alcohol for water in a solution of ammonic cyanate , the amount of cyanate present being the same initially in all the mixtures examined .
The change was found to be accelerated , especially in the presence of large proportions of alcohol , the rate at which the transformation took place when 90 per cent , alcohol was used as solvent being about 30 times as great as when water alone was used .
On general grounds and taking into account the fact that , as James Walker lias shown , f ammonic cyanate is a stable substance except in the presence of water , it is scarcely to be expected that alcohol would cause so great a change in the rate at which urea is formed .
The remarkable conclusion arrived at by Walker and Kay may well be a consequence of the method they used and of the manner in which the observations were reduced .
There can be little doubt , in fact , that the procedure they adopted is not one by which a proper estimate can be formed of the influence exercised by alcohol , as it involves the proportion of water present relatively to the cyanate being lowered in proportion as the amount of alcohol is increased .
To ascertain the influence of alcohol on the transformation of ammonic cyanate into urea , the alcohol should be added in increasing quantities to a solution in which the proportion of cyanate to water is kept constant .
An opinion may be formed from Walker and Kay 's data of the manner in which alcohol acts on the rate at which the transformation takes place when added to an aqueous solution , if the concentration be expressed with reference to the weight of water present , disregarding volume , by multiplying the velocity coefficient by the weight of water in 1 c.c. of solution.^ The manner in which Walker and Kay 's velocity coefficient , kp2 , varies with the composition of the solvent when recalculated by this formula is as .
follows ( Table I):\#151 ; * 'Chem .

J The argument may be given shortly as follows : \#151 ; If C be the concentration in gramme-molecular proportions per litre , v the rate of change of concentration when the concentration is C units , W the number of grammes of water in one cubic centimetre of the alcoholic solution , then C/ W is the concentration in gramme equivalents of cyanate per 1000 grammes of water v/ W is the rate of change of concentration .
The velocity coefficient is therefore 1912 .

This is shown graphically in Diagram 3 .
Walker and Kay also calculated values of k by taking into account the presumed degree of dissociation of the cyanate in the solution used , deducing this from the ratio The influence of alcohol appears to be far greater when this method of reducing the results is adopted , the rate in 90 per cent , alcohol being about 100 times that in water .
It is impossible to believe that alcohol can have such an influence .
The changes undergone by urea being of special interest on account of the behaviour of this substance towards the enzyme urease , at Prof. Armstrong 's request I undertook the extension of Walker and Kay 's work , primarily with the object of arriving at a valid method of studying such problems but with the ultimate purpose of comparing the influence of different alcohols on the formation of urea .
Walker and Hambly have shown* that the conversion of ammonic cyanate into urea is effected at a bimolecular rate and is to a slight extent a reversible change ; they observed that a subsidiary change took place at the same time which involved the formation of a small proportion of ammonic carbonate .
They explained the fact that the change followed a bimolecular law on the hypothesis that the urea is formed by the interaction of the dissociated ions , of ammonic cyanate ; on this hypothesis , Walker and Kay developed an equation to express the rate of change , involving the factor of dissociation ( p ) , by means of which they deduced what they supposed were true values , of the velocity coefficient K. Their equation is not only highly complex but also involves the introduction .

[ July 29 , of the factor p , which is of doubtful significance ; it also does not afford the means of comparing the actual velocity at particular corresponding concentrations in different experiments .
For the purpose I had in mind it was necessary to compare the actual velocities with which the cyanate is transformed into urea in the presence of alcohol and its homologues when the ratio of cyanate to water remained fixed .
The graphic method of reducing the results appeared to be particularly well adapted for the purpose , as the rate of change of concentration could be obtained from the tangent to the curve at the required point .
The points established experimentally were plotted on squared paper , a smooth curve was then drawn and the tangents determined at the desired points by means of a stretched thread , the mean of two or more readings being taken .
The numerical values thus obtained expressed the rate of change of concentration ( in gramme-molecular proportions of cyanate per 100 gramme-molecular proportions of water per minute ) ; the velocity coefficient was obtained by dividing this rate by the square of the concentration .
The rate of change of concentration divided by the concentration represents the rate at which cyanate disappears in the fractions changed per minute .
In studying the influence of alcohols , their effect on this rate was compared , the ratio of cyanate to water being kept the same in all cases .
It is claimed that the graphic method is not only very much simpler in application than that adopted by Walker and Kay but that it has other important advantages .
The actual rates of change at definite concentrations are arrived at without any assumption being made and can be compared with the concentrations of the changing substances on various assumptions ; the effect on the rate produced by added quantities of the products of change or of other substances can also be arrived at easily , which is not the case when Walker and Kay 's method is used .
Temporary divergences from the normal course of change are rendered apparent immediately by the graphic method but may escape notice if the mathematical method be used , as this involves the assumption that the action follows the postulated course of change over the entire interval considered .
The experimental procedure adopted was , for the most part , that described by James Walker and Hambly.* In preparing silver cyanate , it was found that a cleaner product was obtained by boiling the solutions of silver nitrate and urea separately and then mixing them .
To prepare the ammonic cyanate , the silver salt , in slight excess , was violently agitated , by means of a mechanical glass stirrer , with the proper amount of a solution of ammonic chloride .

The solution of ammonic cyanate was made up by weight , heated to within 0-2 ' of the temperature of the bath ( 40 ' ) and the first observation made about five minutes after it had been placed in the thermostat . .
At measured intervals of time , samples of the solution were transferred by means of a pipette to flasks containing weighed quantities of an N/ 10 solution of silver nitrate , in small , approximately constant excess of that required to precipitate the cyanate in the sample .
The flasks were then cooled as quickly as possible in running water , weighed and the excess of silver nitrate determined with ammonic thiocyanate in the manner described by Walker and Hambly .
The experiments were all carried out in a bath kept at 40 ' by means of a Lowry thermo-regulator .

The Influence of the Products of Change.\#151 ; A few preliminary experiments at various concentrations confirmed James Walker and Hambly 's observation that the rate varied nearly as the square of the concentration , the velocity coefficient being higher in dilute than in more concentrated solution .
It soon became evident , however , that the rate was controlled by some other - m Mr. E. E. Walker .

On examining the results ( Experiment 1 ) , it is seen that the velocity coefficient falls rapidly at first ( see Table III , Diagram 1 , Curve 1 ) , reaching a minimum at a concentration Diagram 1.\#151 ; Showing Influence of the Kate of Formation and Presence of Ammonic Carbonate .

The only difference between the two experiments is that the initial concentration of the first is 0*20 , whilst that of the second is 0*25 ; yet the rate at a concentration of 0*18 is 0*0754 in Experiment 1 and 0*0670 in Experiment 2 .

545 From experiments made with urea and ammonic carbonate to ascertain the nature of the influence exerted by these substances , it appears that the discrepancy under discussion is due , in all probability , to the formation and influence of the latter .
The Influence of Ammonic Carbonate.\#151 ; In the second experiment the carbonate was determined by titration with 1ST/ 20 sulphuric acid , using methyl-orange as indicator .
The solution was titrated after removing the precipitate of silver cyanate and the colour of the methyl-orange then destroyed by boiling with some of the ferric sulphate and nitric acid used as indicator in the subsequent titration with ammonic thiocyanate .
It is evident from the values arrived at ( Table IY , Column 3 ) that the formation of ammonic carbonate is comparatively rapid at first .

As the carbonate is formed very rapidly at the beginning of the experiment , it will make the velocity coefficient too high , since the rate includes the conversion of cyanate into ammonic carbonate .
Later on , as the amount of ammonic carbonate increases and that of cyanate decreases , the velocity coefficient will again be too high , as ammonic salts accelerate the change .
It thus appears that the falling off of the " constant " in the early stages of the experiment is due to the falling off in the rate at which carbonate is formed rather than to any abnormality in the rate at which the change into urea takes place ; moreover , that the subsequent rise is due to an actual increase in the amount of urea formed in consequence of the accumulation of ammonic carbonate in the solution .
Mr. E. E. Walker .
[ July 29 , This view receives some confirmation from Curves 3 and 4 in Diagram 1 .
Curve 3 represents the values of the velocity coefficient obtained by subtracting the rate at which the carbonate is formed from the rate at which the cyanate is transformed .
The greater part of the fall has been eliminated .
Curve 4 is the result of dividing the rate by the concentration of the cyanate multiplied by that of the ammonium radicle.* This last operation eliminates , to a considerable extent , the rise in value of the velocity coefficient .
The net result of the two corrections is to reduce the mean velocity coefficient from 695 to 595 .
The effect of the carbonate is shown graphically in the pair of curves from Experiment 2 , shown in Diagram 2 .
The abnormally high slope shown at the beginning of the upper curve is straightened out in the lower .
The Influence of Urea.\#151 ; Two short parallel experiments were carried out in one of which 0*05 gramme-molecular proportions of urea were added per 100 of water but none in the other .
The effect of the small addition of urea was to increase the mean velocity coefficient from 0*0698 to 0*0726 .
The work of Orme and Irvine Massonf possibly throws some light on this curious result .
These authors show that , in the case of the metallic cyanates , the urea and carbonate are formed apparently in a fixed ratio ; it is therefore reasonable to expect that the addition of urea would increase the quantity of carbonate formed and thus increase the total rate .
The case of ammonic cyanate is somewhat different but the ratio urea/ carbonate appears to fall to a constant value .
It was to be expected , therefore , that the addition of ammonic carbonate would reduce the formation of further quantities of this substance ; this was found to be the case in an experiment ( 3 ) in which about 0*01 of a gramme-molecular proportion of ammonic carbonate was added ; Table Y gives the results of this experiment .
The values in this table are arranged as are those in Table III and show ( 1 ) that , in presence of only 1/ 100th of a molecular proportion of ammonic carbonate , the rate at which carbonate is formed is diminished by one-half .
( 2 ) From the outset , the velocity coefficient in Column 6 rises instead of falling .
( 3 ) The mean value of the velocity coefficient in Column 7 ( in which correction is made for the rate at which the carbonate is formed ) is raised from 0*0644 to 0*0680 , thus showing the accelerative action of the added ammonic salt .
The value in Column 8 , however ( in which correction is made for this acceleration ) , is reduced from 595 to 558 .
, showing that the correction introduced is somewhat too high , as might reasonably be expected * Walker and Hambly have shown that this correction is applicable in the case of ammonic sulphate .

This full correction is introduced , however , in the following experiments on alcohols for lack of further data .
The error thus introduced is small .
The Action of Alcohols .
Several experiments were made with different quantities of ethylic alcohol and its homologues , propylic and isobutylic alcohol ( Table VI ) ; the curves deduced from these experiments are reproduced in Diagram 2 .

In Column 6 , the value of the rate is corrected for the formation and influence of ammonic carbonate by means of the data given in Columns 4 and 5 .

of titrating in the presence of so much alcohol , no determination of the ammonia was made in Experiment 8 .
No precipitate was formed on adding a barium salt at the end of the experiment ; the fall and subsequent rise of the velocity coefficient ( Table VIII ) , however , indicated that some such change did take place .

[ July 29 , added to the solution before titration , a blank titration with the same quantity of alcohol and water being first made and this solution then used as the standard tint .
Before titration with thiocyanate , the solution was reduced in bulk by distilling off the alcohol .
It was found that , although a considerable quantity of ammonia was formed , no precipitate was produced by a barium salt ; it is not improbable that the ammonia was present as carbamate rather than as carbonate .
It was also found that , though these corrections reduced the value expressing the rate by as much as 20 per cent. , they did not produce any great change in the final result , i.e. in the percentage acceleration , as the quantity of carbonate formed increases as the rate at which urea is formed increases .
The results obtained by the method described differ radically from those obtained by Walker and Kay .
In the first place , the increase in the rate of change is very nearly proportional to the weight of alcohol added ; in the second , the total increase , as pointed out in the introduction , is considerably less .
If the alcohol acted as a diluent , in the same manner as an equal volume of water , then the rate should vary inversely as the volume containing unit weight of cyanate .
Therefore , it can only be considered to act as a diluent if it be conceded that the molecular activity of the alcohol increases very nearly proportionally to its concentration .
It is improbable that its activity would thus increase and if we entirely neglect it as a diluent , then we find that the effect produced per molecule is practically constant for all concentrations of alcohol .
The effect of the alcohol appears rather to resemble that produced by an admixture of fine sand with a solution , the change taking place , as it were , within aqueous cells distributed throughout the liquid .
The alcohol so modifies the aqueous solution , however , that the rate of change is increased in proportion to the amount of alcohol added but even when alcohol and water are present in equal molecular proportions the transformation is effected only about five times as rapidly as in the absence of alcohol .
Ethylic alcohol , therefore , has but a very moderate effect .
It is submitted that this conclusion is rational and a justification of the method adopted .
The far higher value arrived at by Walker and Kay is due simply to the fact that when the solution is diluted with alcohol and the effect referred to the solution as a whole , the effect produced is multiplied in proportion to the volume of alcohol present .
Further , it is claimed that uniform values for the molecular effect of alcohol are obtained only when the proportion of cyanate to water is kept 1912 .

It is only this last curve ( 3 ) which clearly shows the proportionality between the quantity of alcohol added and the effect produced .

It is to be noted that the order in which the alcohols act is that observed on contrasting their activity as precipitants of salts from an aqueous solution and their physiological activity as hormones .
The opinion has already been expressed ( these studies , No. XIII ) that the action of the alcohols is largely mechanical .
It is reasonable to suppose that the tendency of the simple molecules of water to combine among themselves is decreased by the interposition of neutral molecules .
On this hypothesis it is to be expected that the larger molecules would have the 1912 .

*553 greater effect both on account of their size and their greater mobility by reason of their lower affinity for water .
In the case of the formation of urea from cyanate , the net effect of the addition of water is to increase the velocity coefficient ; whilst in the case of the hydrolysis of cane sugar the activity of the acid is diminished .
It would seem , therefore , that the effect alcohols have of rendering the water more active is comparable with that produced by adding more water .
It is probably not a mere coincidence that the retarding effect produced by one molecular proportion of alcohol on the hydrolysis of cane sugar is practically equal to the acceleration effect of the same quantity on the conversion of ammouic cyanate into urea .
( + 3-83 per cent , in the case of ammonic cyanate , \#151 ; 3'97 per cent * in the hydrolysis of cane sugar .
) The results now brought forward are probably not without value as throwing light on the process whereby urea is formed from ammonic cyanate , which was discussed in a recent communication to the Society on the enzyme urease.+ It is not improbable that initially the cyanate tends to undergo decomposition into carbamate and finally into carbonate and that a relatively large proportion of urea is produced as the influence of the ammonic salt thus formed prevails more and more .
While recognising that the fact that the formation of urea proceeds at a bi-molecular rate may be accounted for , either on the assumption that two molecules of a cyanate meet to form the urea or that the salt is resolved into cyanic acid and ammonia , Walker and Hambly have contended that these explanations must be set aside in favour of the assumption that the salt is dissociated into its ions , because the change is accelerated by ammonic salts though not by ammonia .
But this argument is not a valid one : taking into account the activity of ammonic salts in comparison with that of ammonia , whatever the explanation of this activity , it is only to be expected that the salt would prove to be the more active in promoting the change ; moreover , an increase in the total amount of either radicle of the changing substance in the solutions will necessarily be attended by an acceleration of the rate of change .
That alcohol and its homologues should somewhat accelerate the change is not difficult to understand if it be assumed that the transformation involves the formation of the hydrol 0 f(oh)2 L(nh2)2 ' * From figures given by Armstrong and Worley , these Studies No. XIII .

Whilst it is not to be supposed that alcohols promote the formation of this compound , it is probable that they would promote its resolution into urea and thus hasten the formation of the latter .
It may be added that the production of the diamino-dihydrol in question would involve the prior production , at some stage , of corresponding ammonic salts : hence the accelerative influence of ammonic salts .
Walker and Hambly and Walker and Kay have in no way taken into account the concentrating effect of the substances they added and have overlooked the circumstance that , in effect , they were using solutions that were more concentrated than they supposed in many of the cases they studied .
One result at which they arrived is very noteworthy in connexion with the results now put forward , viz. , that sugar and similar substances have an accelerating influence on the transformation of ammonic cyanate into urea .
Whilst the influence of sugar is to be accounted for on the assumption that it combines with a certain amount of the water and therefore concentrates the solution , the effect produced by alcohols , especially in the case of the less soluble , must he mainly of a different order ; it cannot well be accounted for , except on the assumption that the water is modified by their presence and that they are probably in some way active mechanically in reducing the extent to which the water can enter into association with the substances that are present in solution .
