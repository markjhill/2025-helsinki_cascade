475 Similar experiments made with oil of turpentine entirely confirmed the view of Soret as to the amount of contraction which the gas undergoes when acted upon by this substance , the mean of eight experiments giving 2 02 as the value of the contraction .
The investigation of the effect due to the action of the electrized gas upon protochloride of tin is attended with considerable difficulty , from the circumstance that a solution of protochloride of tin is readily oxidized by the action of pure oxygen .
The difficulty was met in two ways , both of which led to the same conclusion , \#151 ; namely , by applying a correction for the oxidation effected by the oxygen with which the ozone was associated , and by using very dilute solutions of the protochloride of tin in which this oxidation is reduced to a minimum .
In two experiments conducted on the latter principle , and in which the oxidation , as well as the contraction , was experimentally determined , the value of the contraction was found to be 219 and 2-33 , while the oxidation in the two experiments respectively was 3-12 and 3-07 .

476 Mr. W. Crookes on the Atomic Weight of Thallium .
[ June 20 , characteristics and chemical properties ; also I discussed the position of thallium among elementary bodies , and gave a series of analytical notes .
In the pages of the ' Journal of the Chemical Society ' for April 1 , 1864 , I collated all the information then extant , both from my own researches and from those of others , introducing qualitative descriptions of an extended series of the salts of the metal .
I propose in the present paper to lay before the Royal Society the details and results of experiments which have engrossed much of my spare time during the last eight years , and which consist of very laborious researches on the atomic weight of thallium .
SECTION I. On the Determination of Atomic Weights .
In determining accurately the atomic weight of a metal that stands so high in the scale as thallium , difficulties and sources of error which are comparatively small with elements of low atomic weight are magnified to serious proportions , and require more than ordinary care foi their elimination .
When so large a proportion of the compound under analysis or .
synthesis consists of the body itself whose atomic weight is the one unknown quantity , it is evident that the almost unavoidable errors occasioned by impurity in the materials employed , the losses incident to imperfect manipulation , or the inaccuracies arising during the weighing from the omission of the corrections required by temperature , pressure , \amp ; c. , will all find their way into the number which is finally considered to represent the atomic weight of the metal .
I have attempted two entirely different methods of arriving at the atomic weight of thallium .
Had the results of these determinations differed materially , I should have extended the research to other methods ; but as they so nearly agree , it appeared unnecessary to incur so great an additional expenditure of time and material with no reasonable prospect of getting any but confirmatory results .
The first method , and that which I shall describe , consists in taking a known quantity of metallic thallium , dissolving it in nitric acid , and weighing the nitrate of thallium produced .
The second method consists in dissolving known quantities of sulphate of thallium in water , and ascertaining how much nitrate of barium is necessary to precipitate the sulphuric acid as sulphate of barium .
SECTION II .
Apparatus employed .
The absolute weight of any substance may be found from its apparent weight in an atmosphere of 30 inches of mercury , and from its apparent weight under , say , 25 inches of mercury .
But the best weighings are undoubtedly one in air at ordinary pressure and temperature , and one in a 1872 .

477 highly rarefied atmosphere , \#151 ; it cannot be said in vacuo , owing to the diffibetween the atrnoThe Balances .
Two balances were used .
That which I shall call the mr-balance was made by Messrs. Keissler and Neu expressly for this work , and will clearly indicate a difference of O'OOOl of a grain when loaded with 1000 grains in each pan .
The second balance , which I shall call the tfacwim-balance , is almost a duplicate of the first , of 14-inch beam , with agate knife-edges and planes , made by ( Ertling .
It is enclosed in a cast-iron case connected with an air-pump , and so arranged that I can readily weigh any substance in air of any desired density , the rarefaction being measured by a barometer-gauge .
At first it was attempted to put nearly the correct weight into the pan , and then make the final adjustment by means of the rider .
It was , however , soon found that a nearer approach to accuracy is to introduce a certain weight , and then to alter the pressure of the air until the balance shows equilibrium .
Two weighings at different degrees of atmospheric pressure , varying by a considerable interval , give data upon which to calculate what the weight would be in a perfect vacuum .
The Weights .
A set of weights as ordinarily supplied by even the best instrument-makers is never absolutely exact ; however carefully they may be adjusted , the pieces of metal which respectively represent 1000 grains , 100 grains , 10 grains , \amp ; c. are only more or less approximations to the true weights .
In most chemical analyses , the error arising from such inaccuracies in the weights used is so small in comparison to errors of manipulation , or to imperfections inherent in the chemical processes adopted , that it may generally be disregarded ; but when the chemist has for his object the determination of an atomic weight , or is engaged in other researches demanding the highest refinement of accuracy which chemistry and physics can supply , then he is bound to neglect no correction which will increase the precision of the results .
he weights I employed were of platinum , made expressly for these investigations by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey .
The platinum was quite pure ; it was fused , cast , and then well hammered .
The weights were , |(ijnsted by myself during May , June , July , and August 1864 : they " ere first roughly adjusted , and then the specific gravity of each weight " us taken .
The weights were heated to redness in a bath of magnesia previous to ascertaining their specific gravity .
The density of the larger " eights was ascertained to the second place of decimals , and that of the smaller ones to the first place .
The following are the results of the final a(ijustment , the weight in vacuo being calculated by the formula : \#151 ; culty of working under such a difference of } sphere of the balance and that surrounding it .

The Glass .
The flasks and vessels used were of the hardest Bohemian glass , and as thin as they could be employed .
When practicable , vessels ot old green German glass were used ; neither this nor Bohemian glass is practically affected by reagents .
No cork or luting was employed in the distillations \amp ; c. ; in most cases the apparatus was blown in one piece , and the operations performed in a vacuum .
The apparatus , which was weighed , was entirely composed of glass suspended with platinum-wire loops : fingers were never allowed to touch it after the first weighing .
The weight of tubes , bulbs , and flasks , even of hard Bohemian glass , constantly diminishes when the glass is long heated in a spirit- or gftS ' * Riders .

Following the suggestion of Professor Stas , I have obviated this source of error by employing a bath of pure magnesia ; and I find that the weight remains constant even at a nearly white heat .
I have likewise employed baths of lime with similar satisfactory results .
The special apparatus that I have used are described in the processes in which they were required ; I need scarcely say that in no case were materials of untried purity employed .
Improved Sprengel Vacuum-pump .
Before detailing the processes of the determination , it will be requisite to describe the means of producing a vacuum in the flasks and bulbs employed .
In proceeding with the determinations , several additions and improvements have been made to the Sprengel pump as generally found in the laboratory .
The apparatus , as thus arranged , is readily manageable , with certainty of obtaining a Torricellian vacuum .
SECTION III .
The Chemicals .
The detail of the processes of preparing the thallium and the reagents in a chemically pure state is too necessary to admit of useful abstraction .
SECTION IV .
Processes and Results .
The processes and manipulation necessary to the determination of an atomic weight are at all times difficult and delicate , but especially in the case 'f a metal such as thallium , so readily oxidizable .
This strong tendency to combine with oxygen , renders the ordinarily exact processes of weighing out pure metals inapplicable to the present purpose .
The chances of contact udth the oxygen of the atmosphere must be reduced to a minimum , and to 1 18 en^ ^ was found desirable to work i vacuo .
For this purpose the series of bulbs shown in fig. 11 have been blown .
Pure thallium is introduced , nto a\gt ; the upper end of which is then sealed .
The end c is also sealed up , and ^e horizontal tube e is connected to the Sprengel pump , and a 'acuum obtained , the tube being then sealed at/ .
The thallium in a is vow heated on a magnesia-bath to its point of fusion ( 561 ' F. ) , and when ten caused , by gently tilting the vessel , to flow by the narrow channel into the lower bulb b , all oxide remaining in a. The channel d is ^'W contraeted before the blowpipe , and a removed .
The bulbs then ^Ppear as in fig. 12 , and after cooling are carefully weighed in air and end^f*0 ^ne P'intof a blowpipe-flame , caused to impinge upon the 0 the tube at g , softens the glass , and the air , endeavouring to force Mr. W. Crookes on the Atomic Weight of Thallium .
[ June 20 , its way into the bulbs , forms a capillary orifice .
By heating the bulb , and immersing the orifice in the pure nitric acid , the acid is introduced into the bulb^ hand the globe b until all the thallium has been dissolved .
The most tedious part of the process then commences , the evaporation of the excess of free acid .
For this purpose an apparatus is used of the form represented in fig. 13 : a is the apparatus , connected by a wide tube ( 6 ) and a narrower glass tube with a Woulfe 's bottle ( c ) ; this is in connexion with a Bunsen 's water-pump ( d ) , having 15-feet fall of water , and capable of producing an exhaustion equal to 10 inches of mercury .
In the course of time the nitrate of thallium is left in the form of dry white crystals .
The pump is then stopped , and air allowed to enter the apparatus by opening the pinch-cock , e , connected with the chloride-of-calcmm tubes , J The nitrate of thallium is then treated with a solution of oxalic acid to reduce any pernitrate that may be formed , the crystals dried , fused , dissolved in water , again allowed to crystallize , the evaporation of the water being repeated under diminished pressure .
When there is no longer a loss of weight , the nitrate of thallium is finally weighed , the air being exhausted from the apparatus .
The apparatus is now of the form shown in fio- 14 , and is weighed at two different atmospheric pressures , he nitrate of'thallium having been afterwards removed , the apparatus is alone weighed at two different pressures .
There have thus been obtained : a. The weight of the glass+thallium .

The weight of the glass + nitrate of thallium .
y. The weight of the glass alone .
Particulars of these weights are given in the next section .

The reduction of the atomic weight from these data becomes a case of simple proportion ; but the values found are absolute in so far only as the atomic weights of nitrogen and oxygen are correct .
The atomic weights of nitrogen and oxygen have been usually represented by the numbers 14 and 16 ; but Professor Stas found these elements represented , according to observation , by Oxygen ( 03 ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..=47*880 Nitrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .= 14*009 or nitric acid N03=6l*889 .
According to the old equivalents , NOg=62 .
Taking as data the series of weighings in vacuo , the quantity of nitric acid required to convert the thallium into nitrate is ( 239*646066-183*790232 = ) 55*855834 grs. We have , then , with Professor Stas 's determination of the atomic weights of nitrogen and oxygen , the following proportion :\#151 ; Weight of Weight of Atomic weight of Atomic weight nitric acid .

Let us see what would be the atomic weight of thallium if one or other of the corrections introduced into the above determinations had been omitted .
The use of the old equivalent ( =62 ) for nitric acid , with the data derived from the weighings in vacuo , gives 55-855834 : 183*790232 : : 62 : 204*007 as the atomic weight ; but I cannot admit this number to be so nearly correct as 203*642 .
If we take the corrected weighings in air of ordinary density , we have , with N03=61*889 , 203*738 .
With NO0=62 , 204*103 .
Accepting the uncorrected weights , observed in air , we have , with NQ3= 61*889 , With N06=62 , 203*162 .
204*165 .
The error of the last deduction , +*523 , is sufficiently large to show the Necessity of neglecting no precaution in chemical manipulation , especially !
n a determination of this character .
The largeness of these errors have an immediate bearing upon quantitative analysis ; for they show that from , ata ordinarily given , very varying results may be obtained .

In ordinary analysis chemists are satisfied to take 5 or 10 grains of the substance under investigation : here I have gone to the very highest weight that can be entrusted , with safety , to the balance .
The lowest weight of thallium taken is 183-790232 grains , the heaviest 497-972995 grains , the remaining determinations varying between these limits .
It is hardly necessary to say that the purpose has been to eliminate the error arising from manipulation with small quantities , and to produce such variety in the results as renders the chances of coincidence ot very small value .

Let me now tabulate the results of the determinations , with the view to ascertain severally their degree of approximation to the arithmetic mean : A. 203-666 + *024 B. 203-628 \#151 ; *014 C. 203-632 \#151 ; *010 D. 203-649 + *007 E. 203-642 + *000 F. 203-636 \#151 ; *006 G. 203-639 \#151 ; .003 H. 203-650 + *008 I. 203-644 + *002 K. 203-638 \#151 ; *004 The arithmetic mean of the ten observations is 2036*424_ 203*642 .

483 The probable error is 0*0022 ; and the probability that the true value lies between 203*632 and 203*652 is 0*99808 , certainty being represented by unity .
I may therefore conclude that the atomic weight of thallium is , within the limits of error ( as small as possible ) of observation , \#151 ; 203-642 .
Professor Stas has shown the hypothesis of Prout\#151 ; that the atomic weights of the elements are severally multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen\#151 ; to be without the corroboration of experimental result .
This view of the hypothesis is further borne out in the present investigation ; for the number 203-642 cannot , within the limit of what has been shown to he the probable error , by any liberty be made to follow the hypothesis .
Without doubt , when the atomic weights of all the metals are redetermined according to the standard of recent scientific method , it will be found that there are more exceptions to the hypothesis than commonly considered .
Marignac gives , in his confirmatory discussion of Stas 's experiments , and in his own results with calcium ( 40*21 ) , lanthanum ( 94*13 ) , strontium ( 87*25 ) , analogous opposed evidence , as in the case of the weight found for thallium .
I have thus striven to eliminate all erroneous influence in the number I submit to the Royal Society as the atomic weight of thallium ; and I shall be amply rewarded for my long labour if I can know that the determination has secured to researches of this character a nearer approach to the standard of truth .
