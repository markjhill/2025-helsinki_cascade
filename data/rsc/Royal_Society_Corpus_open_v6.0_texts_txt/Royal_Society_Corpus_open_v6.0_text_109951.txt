On the Mode of Formation of the Canal for containing the Spinal Marrow , and on the Form of the Fins ( if they deserve that name ) of the Proteo-Saurus .

] The structure of the vertebrwe of the Proteo-saurus is intermediate between that of the lizard tribe and cartilaginous fishes , and they have so close a resemblance to the vertebrw of the shark , as often to have been mistaken for them .
They are composed of bone , and have a body and canal for the spinal marrow , and a process for the attachment of muscles ; but the body is made up of one piece , while the spinal process , and two lateral branches which belong to it , are made -up of another ; between these there is no union but a species of joint peculiar to themselves ; the hole in the middle thus formed appears unusually small .
In the specimen from which the above description is taken , there is also a fore foot , paddle , or fin , --for it is difficult to say which it should be called , and which , though not quite perfect , is more so than in any other extant specimen .
It presents nothing like the thumb or claw for laying hold , which distinguishes the animals that occasionally inhabit the sea , and come ashore to lay eggs or deposit young .
If it be called a fin , it is to be understood as made up of bony materials , the joints of which are extremely numerous , so that it may possibly perform the same office .
