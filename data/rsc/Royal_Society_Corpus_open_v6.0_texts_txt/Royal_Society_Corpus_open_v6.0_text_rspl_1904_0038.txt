Electric Eesistance Thermometry [ Feb. 251* " On Electric Eesistance Thermometry at the Temperature o Boiling Hydrogen."* By Professor James Dewar , M.A LL. D. , F.E.S. Deceived February 25 , \#151 ; Bead March 10,1904 [ Plate 10 .
] In my paper entitled " The Boiling Point of Liquid Hydrogen determined by Hydrogen and Helium Gas Thermometers , " communi cated to the Society in 1901 , I detailed means taken to determine th* temperature in gas thermometer degrees at which liquid hydroger boils .
The experiments clearly proved that the constant-volumt hydrogen gas thermometer is reliable under varying conditions , dowi to a temperature some degrees below the boiling point of hydrogen .
20'-5 absolute , on the Centigrade scale .
In the course of making low temperature determinations , a number !
of thermometers of different kinds were employed , some being !
constant-volume gas thermometers , others in the form of thermoelectric junctions , and a set depending on change of electric resistance with temperature .
The group of thermometers depending upon the assumed relation between electromotive force and temperature broke down about the temperature of liquid oxygen , while those based upon the ordinary law correlating change of electric resistance with temperature failed for all the metals and alloys somewhere above the boiling point of liquid hydrogen .
In the first experiments made to ascertain the boiling point of liquid hydrogen under a pressure of 30 to 60 mm. a platinum resistance thermometer was used , with the result that only V of reduction of temperature in the boiling point was recorded instead of some 5 ' indicated by theory .
This result suggested that in all probability the rate of change of resistance with the pressure became gradually smaller under very low temperatures .
In the Bakerian Lecture I adverted shortly to some results obtained in low temperature resistance thermometry , and gave a tablet of numerical values deduced from experimental observations for some of the more prominent metal resistance thermometers .
In the present communication the experimental records of eight additional electric resistance thermometers are given , and the results of the observations on all the resistance thermometers used during the investigations are collected and compared .
Two facts seem to result from this inquiry , viz. : ( 1 ) That the resistance of an unalloyed metal continually diminishes with temperature and in each case appears to approach to a definite asymptotic * In continuation of Art .

245 alue below which no further lowering of the temperature seems ,0 reduce it ; and ( 2 ) that the parabolic connection between temperature and resistance is no longer tenable at very low temperatures .
Of the different thermometers constructed on the electric resistance Principle , fifteen were serviceable throughout the investigations ; the thers broke or failed from various causes .
The metals employed were platinum , gold , silver , copper , palladium , iron , nickel , and two alloys , platinum-rhodium , and German silver .
The metals were supplied by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey , and the late Sir W. C. Roberts-Austen of the Mint .
Every endeavour was made to attain the highest purity in the samples .
In the Bakerian Lecture a table* was given containing the constants of seven of these thermometers , and in the annexed Table I similar results are given for the remaining eight .
The observed resistances , after all corrections were made , were ; reduced both by Calendar 's and by Dickson 's methods , and the close accord of their results is apparent .
When these temperatures are c compared with the results given by the hydrogen thermometer , they .
confirm the general inferences above refeired to .
In the Callendai method the a was determined from the resistances at 100 ' C. and 0 ' C. , and the 8 was then obtained from the resistance and corre-q sponding observed temperature of liquid oxygen boiling under atmospheric pressure .
The same data were used in the Dickson formula , except in a few cases where it was thought worth while to employ the method of least squares , imwhich cases these data were included .
In Table I the suffix number attached to the name of each metal | indicates a particular thermometer in my notes of the observations , and l may be taken as a rough index of the chronological order in which the t observations were made . .
Platinum , gold , silver , and copper show a remarkable agreement ( between the two methods of reduction .
The later specimens of the j metals of each of these groups are purer than the earlier ones .
In the platinum and gold groups we notice that the Centigrade tempera-t ture 12 , at which the resistance would vanish , rises with the purity .
This is still seen in copper , but something of the reverse appears I in the case of silver ( perhaps this may be explained later ) .
However , | the general rule is again apparent in palladium .
With regard to 1 Callendar 's coefficients , the temperature coefficient a increases with the purity of the metal , while the difference coefficient diminishes ; nevertheless some uncertainty is apparent in the platinum thermometer .
Alloys appear to have much smaller values of a and much larger values of 8 .
On the other hand the magnetic metals have greater a 's and very much increased S 's .
A marked peculiarity in the magnetic metals is that the difference coefficient 8 is negative , that is , the temperatures in metal-degrees # Loc .

Electric Resistance Thermometry [ Feb. 251 , 904 ] at the Temperature of Boilinq Hydrogen.247 \#166 ; e algebraically higher than in Centigrade degrees , a peculiarity which I shared with them by gold .
It is also remarkable that in the cases of 31 the purest metals examined , their resistances calculated by either ethod of reduction vanish at temperatures above - 273 ' C. ( Au33 as not so pure as Au4o , which was electrolytic gold .
) / As measurers of temperature gold and silver seem to be the best , * no prominent characteristic associated with them is , that their 8 's re the smallest .
Clearly those metals ( if there are any ) are accurate fbmperafcure measurers for which 6 vanishes , so that we expect those \gt ; be best in which this constant is least .
There is a further Characteristic displayed by the best metals as shown in Table I , W hich may be ' explained thus : both methods of reduction rely on .(he parabola , and the farther away the representative arc of the narabola is from the vertex of the curve , the more nearly straight does Hhis arc become and the smaller will be .
Now in both metals referred to , especially in the purer specimens , this characteristic is dost marked compared with the other metals employed.* It is Avorthy of note that for these pure platinums the average value )f 8 is very nearly 2-5 , while Callendar 's platinums , also pure , gave 1-5\#151 ; 1-6 .
Is the parabola determined by the resistance at 4440,53 C. , *100 ' C. and 0 ' C. , different from that determined by the resistances at ( 100 ' C. , 0 ' C. , and - 1820,5 C. ?
In the sequel I shall show that these must be different , and , in fact , that we must look for an entirely 1 different hypothesis to correlate'resistance and temperature .
As a matter of interest , in the last line of Table I , I have noted the ratio in which the resistance of each metal at 0 ' C. is reduced on ( cooling it to the boiling point of hydrogen .
This seems to be a quantity showing no connection with other properties of metals , t So far we have looked at the results rather from the point of vieAv of metals as thermometers .
But a much more important question is , What is the relation between resistance and temperature in metals 1 We are entitled to consider the temperatures at Avhich liquid oxygen a and hydrogen boil under atmospheric pressure as being knoAvn to within one- or two-tenths of a degree , namely , \#151 ; 182''5 C. and - - 252''5 C. Further observations made with the constant-volume hydrogen gas thermometer lead to the conclusion that hydrogen * In the Callendar parabola ( A \#151 ; T)2 = P(B \#151 ; R ) , the Aralues of A for Au40 and Ag43 are \#151 ; 27,053 ' and 14,520 ' ( the only other one greater than 10,000 ' being - \#151 ; 18,087 ' for Au33 ) , and the corresponding values of B are \#151 ; 598 ' and 177 ' ( the only other one greater than 100 being 135 ' for P27 ) .
Similarly in the Dickson * parabola ( a +\#166 ; R)2 = p ( b + T ) the values of a for Au40 and Ag43 are \#151 ; 1080 ' and \gt ; 339 ' ( the only other two greater than 100 being 251 ' for P2- and \#151 ; 129 ' for Au33 ) , 1 and the corresponding values of b are \#151 ; 11,841 ' and 7319 ' ( the only others greater I than 2000 ' being \#151 ; 8100 ' for Au33 and 2881 for Ag34 ) .
This characteristic comes '\lt ; out equally strongly when the curves are reduced to a common resistance of ( say ) 1000 ohms at 0 ' O. 248 Prof. J. Dewar .
Electric Resistance Thermometry [ Feb. 251 ' freezes about 5 ' below its boiling point .
In the present experiments 1 f \#166 ; have been able to get eight observations in liquid hydrogen boilin ' under pressures varying from 5\#151 ; 50 mm. , and it will not lead m appreciably astray to take the temperatures of these observations as ( say ) 4 ' below the boiling point .
If the law connecting resistance with temperature be parabolic , the very gentle curvature at the boiling ^ point of hydrogen will allow us to consider the rate of drop in resistance per degree of temperature for the 4 ' below the boiling iJ point of hydrogen as roughly the same as that between the boilingjr'1 points of oxygen and hydrogen ( 70 ' ) , so that the ratio of these two !
3 ' drops on this supposition should be about 4:70 , or say one-eighteenth These ratios are given in Table II .

On Plate 10 the observed resistances are displayed graphically .
For convenience I make seven groups , namely platinum , gold , silver , , copper , palladium , magnetic metals , and alloys ; and in order to bring the characteristics of these groups into comparison , each metal is supposed to have the resistance of 30 ohms at the freezing point .
This number was chosen to suit the scale\#151 ; the intention being that , roughly , the " plot " of resistance and temperature should be a line equally inclined to the two axes of resistance and temperature .
This has been accomplished by taking a centimetre to represent 20 ' C. in temperature , and 2 ohms in resistance .
The diagram for each group has the reading at 0 ' C. placed 2| cm .
higher than that of the group below it , in order to obviate confusion among so many approximately coincident lines .
Attention paid to this will enable each group of curves to be clearly seen and compared with the others .
The first noticeable peculiarity is the close coincidence of the two silver curves .
For them , Callendar 's a 's , the fl 's , and the ratios of the resistances at 0 ' to that at the boiling point of hydrogen are almost the same , although the S 's differ much .
In like manner the Dickson constants for Ag43 are all in the same ratio ( about 5 : 2 ) with those for .
Ag34 .

Next , the curves for Pr , AU46 , the two silver , and Pd46 , are very mroximately parallel .
Of the two palladiums , Pd35 would appear to iv contained so much impurity as to have behaved almost like an alloy .
.he two alloys take up quite independent positions compared either ith the purer metals , or with themselves , tending more to parallelism iththe axis of temperature .
In this connection I may mention that constructed and used once or twice a carbon thermometer ; in its case ie resistance diminished as the temperature rose ( a result already inown ) , and its " plot " departed still farther from the pure metals han the alloys do , its a being - -08048 .
I The magnetic metals present the most striking curves , being at first ight quite unlike any of the others .
But on closer inspection we shall hid that this is not so , and in fact they give the clue to the general Connection between resistance and temperature in metals .
The nagnetic metals and gold were found to have negative values of \tow , if we examine the curves of the other metals , they will all be found concave towards the axis of temperature , for the arcs extending from the boiling point of water , through the freezing point , down to the boiling point of oxygen ; while below the boiling point of oxygen these carves are convex to this axis .
On the other hand , gold and the magnetic metals are already convex to this axis from the boiling point of water to the lowest temperature reached .
This leads me back to the research made by Professor Fleming and myself in 1896* on the electric resistance of mercury , in which we were able to observe the resistance of the metal from far below its melting point , and considerably above it when in the molten state .
1 The curve connecting the resistance of mercury with temperature , throughout this range , including the change of state , was somewhat like the disused old English f the temperature being measured hori-e zontally to the right , and the resistance vertically upwards .
In the present instance , though in different circumstances , this same curve t reappears .
For platinum , silver , copper , palladium , and the alloys these experiments include a part of the curve ( fig. 1 ) starting from ( say ) P , passing through I , the point of inflexion , and through Q down towards the absolute zero ; whereas , in the case of .
gold and the magnetic metals , the corresponding part of the curve begins below I , ( say ) at Q , and proceeds thence towards the absolute zero .
Professor Callendar , from former experiments of Professor Fleming and myself , had noticed this behaviour in the case of platinum . !
The eight observations below the boiling point of hydrogen are shown in Plate 10 .

It is clear that in no case can anything parabolic connect resistance and temperatures ranging from the boiling point of water to that \lt ; j hydrogen .
Just as we seek for a circle of curvature at any point of curve , so in the present case we may , at a point , or over a short rang of the f , seek for an approximate parabola ; but any such parabol will be of no , or little , use for extrapolation .
I have mentioned thal the value of \lt ; 5 for my platinum ( Callendar ) parabola is about 2'5 !
whereas observers at high temperatures finds its value about 1*5 fo j pure platinum .
Such differences have been found by others also , bu j they do not seem to have attracted attention .
On looking at fig. 2 , wi shall find the discrepancy easily accounted for .

251 If parabolas with vertical axes ( Callendar ) be described through the points ( 1 ) B , C , D ; ( 2 ) C , D , E ; ( 3 ) C , D , F , they will be different , since the curve of observation is not itself parabolic .
In the case of these parabolas , where the resistances at C and D are common to all , the product of 8 and the parameter ( P ) of the corresponding parabola is constant ; hence the smaller 8 becomes , the more open\#151 ; or less curved__will be the parabola along the arc we have to deal with .
This result is in accordance with the curve in fig. 2 , and explains why , as I have already pointed out , the two parabolas for high and low temperatures are not only different , but also may .
differ from each other by any amount , within certain limits depending on the nature of the unknown curve of temperature and resistance .
I am greatly indebted to Mr. J. D. H. Dickson , M.A. , Fellow of Peterhouse , for help in the calculation and reduction of the observations .

The following experiments on the solid densities of oxygen , nitrogen and hydrogen were carried out as part of a former investigation dealing with gaseous densities at low temperatures.* The method adopted was to measure the volumes of the gases sucked into a cooled space of known capacity , when the temperature was such as in the first place to induce liquefaction and finally solidification .
For such experiments to be successful the rate of liquefaction and the cooling must be under thorough control , otherwise the cooled space may not get completely filled with solid .
Further , the volume of gas condensed ought to be as large as possible , in any case about 20 litres , in order to diminish errors inseparable from the mode of manipulation .
The inertia of the bell-jars of the large gas-holders causes some variation in the pressure ; and errors of their calibration , and want of uniformity of temperature in the mass of gas , are all important factors .
As my object was to ascertain experimentally the limiting density in the solid state , the elimination of these variations was not so important as it would have been for the study of fluid density .
The dry purified gas was contained in a gas-holder connected by a pipe with a glass bulb of 20 or 30 c.c. capacity , sealed to a narrow tube some 10 cm .
long , with a glass stop-cock at the end .
