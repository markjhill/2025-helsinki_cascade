417 Comparison of Oxygen w Helium Stars , phalic and more variable than the men .
This is in accordance with e general conclusion reached in a paper on " Variation in Man and oman , " # namely : " The lower races give ns results in sensible accordance with those j have drawn from the data for ancient civilisations , namely , the omen are on the whole more br achy cephalic and slightly more , riable than the men .
" ( e ) The younger generation is more brachycephalic and more unable than its parentage .
The whole of this difference can hardly be due to any change of ape of the skull with old age , for the majority cf parents had in is case not passed the prime of life .
It may be due to ( i ) a corre-tion between dolichocephaly and fertility or between dolichocephaly id philogamy , or ( ii ) more probably to the action of natural lection ( results obtained , but not yet published , by the present liters show a correlation between physique and cephalic index ) , .
( iii ) to a greater or less admixture of white blood in the younger jneration .
( / ) Parents of sons are significantly less variable than parents of iughters .
This is in accordance with the result previously ob-ined that mediocre fathers are likely to have sons , !
but disagrees ith the result for stature\#151 ; based on a far smaller probability\#151 ; that '.ediocre mothers are likely to have daughters .
The conclusions of this paper , while appearing to the writers of iterest , are to be taken , in the first place , as suggestions for much larger iries of measurements and for new lines of investigation .
Comparison of Oxygen with the Extra Lifies in the Spectra of the Helium Stars , $ Crucis , \amp ; c. ; also Summary of the Spectra of Southern Stars to the 3^ Magnitude and their Distribution " By Frank McClean , F.R.S. Received January 12 , \#151 ; Read February 3 , 1898 .
[ Plate 6 .
] In a previous paper read before the Society on April 8 , 1897 , I uggested that the special lines present in spectra of the first iivision of helium stars ( Type I , Divison la ) might possibly be clue to xygen .
These stars are associated by their position and distribu-ion with the gaseous nebulae , and some of the lines in their spectra orrespond with bright lines observed by Campbell in nebulae .
The iuggestion from this was that these stars are in the first stage of itellar development from gaseous nebulae .

Comparison of Oxygen with the The special lines referred to are the extra lines which distingui these spectra from those of the remaining helium stars of Dh sion I b. The indications in the spectra of the northern stars that the extra lines are due to oxygen are slight , as the lines at best a indistinct .
Among the southern stars , however , there are several , the spectra of which these lines are better defined , and there is on viz. , p Crucis , in which they are very fairly defined .
The following stellar spectra are mounted on the accompany !
plate , viz. , k Orionis , p Scorpii , Canis Majoris , p Centauri , a pCrucis .
These photographs are intended to show the gradual ii provement in the definition of the extra lines , between a Orionis a PCrucis , and to indicate their identity of origin throughout .
The extra lines in the spectrum of p Crucis are singled out comparison with another helium star , viz. , k Argus , of Division 1 in which the extra lines do not appear .
The lines are drawn out themselves below the spectrum of p Crucis .
They are then coi pared directly by juxtaposition with a drawing of the spectrum oxygen as tabulated in the spectrum of air by Neovius ( Stockhol 1891 , and Appendix E , 1894 , of 'Watts 's Index ' ) .
_ This comparison shows a close correspondence in the grouping the extra lines with the spectrum of oxygen .
The most remarkal correspondence is in the case of the large group on either side Ho. A slight shift of about a tenth metre is required to bring t groups into identical positions .
However , the close similarity the whole grouping of the two spectra as they appear on the pk admits of little doubt that the extra lines actually constitute t spectrum of oxygen .
If this be established the spectrum of t first division of helium stars would be due to hydrogen , helium , a The scale attached to the spectra is based on standard lines tfc can be identified with certainty in the stellar spectra .
It is in \lt ; pointed between the standard lines .
Its position in relation to spectra is determined by the hydrogen lines .
The wave-lengths ployed are in accordance with Angstrom 's scale .
On the original negatives the distance between ( H ) and ( J measures about 1 inch .
The negatives are enlarged about ; e.gM \#187 ; \#166 ; a half times .
It is difficult to fix the position of the line a especially of the hydrogen lines-on these enlargements with m cient accuracy .
A further correction than this would account fo dence I believe it should be sought to some extent n\gt ; \#187 ; * examination of the adopted wave-lengths of the hydrogen and ^:%ZZTot\Argus is given on the plate in order to identi extra Lines in the Spectra of the Helium Stars , Sfc .
419 as a helium star .
It contains two crucial lines of helium .
The rolf-Rayet stars , of which it is the principal example , are thus assified as helium stars .
There are also some coincidences between ie bright lines of 7 Argus and the spectrum of oxygen , which iggest a possible connection . .
The spectrum of / i Centauri is also given as a bright line helium are The bright lines in this case are due to hydrogen , and the Mctrum resembles that of 7 Cassiopeite .
The spectrum of S Centauri ( 'take'this opportunity of presenting a summary of the spectra of 16 stars to the 31 magnitude in the Southern Hemisphere .
They \#166 ; ere photographed between May and October , last by means of my wn object-glass prism , mounted in front of the Cape astrograph.c elescope .
This instrument , which is similar to my own telescope at tusthall , with which the spectra of the northern stars were photo-\#166 ; raphed , was kindly placed at my disposal by H.M Astronomer Jr. Gill .
It may be a little time before the actual photographs of he stellar spectra are ready for presentation , and meanwhile the .esults are of interest .
In my previous paper I divided the sphere into eight equal areas :onsisting or two galactic equatorial areas and two galactic po are ireas , situated on either side of the galactic equator .
The northern stars already given occupy the upper or northerly lateral areas A , B , 0 , and D , also the southerly area AA .
The southern stars now given occupy the lower or southerly lateral areas BB , CC , and Their photographic spectra are distributed into these areas , and are classified on the same system as in the previous paper .
The table o distribution for the whole sphere by areas and classes is given below .
There are in all 89 helium stars ( Division T ) , distributed 71 in e galactic zones and 18 in the galactic polar areas , the areas being equal There are 29 in the upper galactic zone ( B and BB ) , and 42 in the lower galactic zone ( C and CC ) .
There are 9 m the upper polar areas ( A and AA ) , and 9 in the lower polar areas ( D and DD ) .
There are 23 in the northerly halves of the two galactic zones ( B and C ) and 48 in the southerly halves ( BB and CC ) .
The 81 stars in Division II , the Sirian stars , and Division 111 , the Proeyon stars ( which along with Division I constitute Secchi s Type I ) are rather irregularly distributed throughout the sp ere .
There are 40 in the galactic zones and 41 in the galactic polar areas .
There are 18 in the upper galactic zone ( B and BB ) and 22 in t e lower ( C and CC ) .
There are 29 in the upper polar areas ( A and A A ) and 12 in the lower ( D and DD ) .
To the extent of the o sei vations there is no condensation of stars of Divisions II anc m the galactic zones as there is in the case of stars of Division I. The 106 stars in Divisions IV and Y ( II and III of Secchi 's types ) 420 Mr. F. McClean .
Comparison of Oxygen with the are fairly evenly distributed throughout the sphere .
There are in the galactic zones and 54 in the galactic polar areas .
There a 22 in the upper galactic zone ( B and BB ) and 30 in the low ( C and CC ) .
There are 27 in the upper polar areas ( A and Aj and 27 in the lower ( D and DD ) .
The general distribution of the types of spectra throughout f sphere to the extent of the observations bears out generally t conclusion that stars with spectra of the more advanced types , order of development , are evenly distributed in space .
Also th stars with spectra more recent in order of development are most congregated in the galactic zones .
The helium stars of Division are predominant in the Southern Hemisphere , being congregatt in the lower or southerly halves of the galactic zones ( BB and CC They include 48 stars out of a total of 94 stars in those area They are also more closely congregated in the vicinity of the gala ?
, than is the case in the northerly halves of the galactic zones .
1 the contiguous constellations of Musea , Crux , Centaurus , Lupu and Scorpio there are 27 helium stars out of a total of 36 sta included in the tables .
( The distribution of the helium sta throughout the sphere was illustrated by two small hand chart not reproduced , on which these stars are coloured red .
) Appi rently the region in which the first stage of stellar development now most active lies in the southerly half of the galaxy .
