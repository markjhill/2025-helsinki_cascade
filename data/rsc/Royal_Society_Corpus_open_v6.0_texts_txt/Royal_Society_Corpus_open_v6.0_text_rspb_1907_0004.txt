) In a paper which appeared recently in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society/ Messrs. Bateson and Punnett and Miss Saunders showed that the 'visible appearance of certain characters in Sweet Peas and in Stocks was due to the association together in the same zygote of factors belonging to independent but complementary allelomorphic pairs .
If both the complementary factors were not simultaneously present , no hint of the presence-of the characters in question was to be detected without breeding tests ; nevertheless , the presence and absence respectively of such a factor constitute a pair of allelomorphs , and segregate in complete accordance with Mendel 's law .
The present communication deals with a similar but somewhat simpler phenomenon exhibited by certain colour characters of the testa of the ordinary field or garden pea\#151 ; the species to different cultivated varieties of which the names Pisum sativum and P. arvense have been given .
The case is simplified by the fact that here only one of *the two complementary factors-is by itself invisible .
The presence of the second factor is invariably accompanied by the appearance of a definite visible character , whether the invisible factor is present or not .
The present examples of " latency " are of special interest on account of the classical nature of the material , as well as because it has been suggested that Mendel was in error in his own account , of the characters of the testa in peas .
It may be stated at once that this is not the case .
Mendel 's account is perfectly correct so far as it goes .
The-grey colour of the testa , constantly associated with coloured flowers and coloured axils , is a simple Mendelian dominant to colourless testas coupled with white flowers and green axils .
The testa may , however , show other colours in addition to the well-known grey .
In Ceylon , in 1902 , the writer found in cultivation a pea , the appearance of which strongly suggested that it came very near to the primitive ancestor of cultivated peas .
We are concerned here only with the characters-of the testa .
This showed an essentially grey ground colour ( greenish or yellowish ) , and , in addition , two distinct sorts of coloured markings:\#151 ; ( 1 ) small specks of a very deep purple colour , the presence of which may be briefly denoted by the letter p. ; and ( 2 ) a mottling or marbling of brown , On the Inheritance of Certain Invisible Characters in .
29 very distinct , and closely resembling the pigmentation which is characteristic of the cultivated variety known as " maple " ; the presence of this character will hereafter be referred to as m. The grey ground colour may further be denoted as g. In the absence of these three characters the testa of a pea is commonly nearly colourless , and this absence of colour in the testa is constantly associated with white flowers and unpigmented axils .
The latter group of characters we shall call w. The native pea with which the following experiments were made bears , then , the characters Its flowers were purple and its axils coloured .
At a recent meeting of the Eoyal Horticultural Society , Messrs. Sutton exhibited a cross between a white seeded variety and what was described as a possible wild type of P. sativum , seeds of which had been obtained from a plant found in Palestine by Mr. Arthur Sutton .
On examining the seeds of this cross , I found , as I had expected , that they showed both the purple spots and the maple marking on a grey ground colour .
Of the colour characters referred to , the grey is determined by a greenish insoluble pigment contained in all , or almost all , the cells of the testa .
The purple pigment exists in the form of a coloured cell sap , confined to certain large cells of the subepidermal layer .
The brown pigment seems to exist chiefly in the cell walls of the outermost layer of I-shaped cells .
Early in 1903 the Ceylon variety , already described , was crossed with an English pea known as " Sutton 's Satisfaction , " having colourless testas .
The testas of the seeds borne by the resulting plants were all precisely like those of the native parent\#151 ; m. , p. , and g. are all dominant .
In E2 only 25 plants were raised , which showed the following characters:\#151 ; m.p.g. m.g. p.g. g. w. In the case of one of the four plants with white flowers , the nearly colourless testas exhibited a very faint brown marbling , like the " ghost " of a maple character .
These few plants were clearly insufficient to allow of any deduction being made as to the characteristic proportion of F2 .
Three of the above m.p.g. plants , however , yielded once more all the different types in F3 , being , therefore , clearly of the same heterozygous constitution as their parents ; 169 plants of this description included the following:\#151 ; rnp.g .
m.g. p.g. g. w. And the offspring of the remaining plants showed nothing to contradict the Mr. R. H. Lock .
On Inheritance of [ Oct. I* following theoretical explanation , which was published as a provisional hypothesis in 1904* I regarded m. , p. , and g. as each depending on the presence of the dominant member of a separate pair of allelomorphs A\#151 ; a , B\#151 ; b , and C\#151 ; c respectively , C representing the grey character .
And I further supposed that A and B , though present , were unable to lead to the appearance of m. and p. in the absence of C. B ( p. ) was totally inhibited in this way , whilst A might just make its presence known by the appearance which we have described as that of " ghost " maple.f In the accompanying diagram the combinations of the three pairs of allelomorphs are set down at length , and it will be seen that , on the above hypothesis , they lead to the proportion\#151 ; m.p.g. m.g. p.g. g. w. 27 9 9 3 16 with which the result actually obtained and given above is in very fair agreement .
The expectation is 71.3 , 23.8 , 23.8 , 7.9 , 42.2 , and the observed numbers were 82 , 20 , 21 , 9 , 37 .

t Subsequent experiments showed that the non-appearance of the " ghost " maple did not necessarily imply the absence of A. The degree of development of this faint brown nigmentation on the testas of plants with white flowers seemed to depend to some extent on the manner of ripening , and to vary from complete invisibility up to a fair degree of brightness , and this sometimes in different seeds of the same plant .

] others again contain both m. and p.\#151 ; ABc .
Finally , one white out of 16 contains neither\#151 ; abc .
It seemed so certain that this was the true explanation that , in spite of the fact that no case of the kind had then been worked out , I ventured to predict , in the summer of 1904 , that , when crossed with the simple grey type , some ot ' these whites would yield plants bearing purple spotted seeds\#151 ; ; others seeds with the full brown marbling\#151 ; m.g. ; others again with both\#151 ; m.p.g. ; whilst some I expected to give only grey , like the grey parent used to render visible the hidden factor , if present .
The actual crosses were carried out in 1905 upon plants of the fourth generation ( derived from heterozygotes in F2 ) with the result set down in Table I. One or more plants were raised successfully from each of 62 crosses , one of the parents having in each case exhibited grey testas and the other white ( with or without the " ghost " maple ) .
Each cross is entered twice , once according to the presence or absence of the purple character among the offspring , and once according to the presence or absence of the full maple character .
Considering first the purple character , nine of the white-flowered plants examined are found to have been heterozygotes in respect of the hidden factor , whilst 51 plants gave rise to offspring showing only the dominant or only the recessive character .
The offspring were too few in number to allow of exactly determining how many of the parents were truly homozygous , but it is clear that a considerable majority must have been of this nature .
The Mendelian expectation in the second generation of descendants from a heterozygote is a ratio of 3 homozygotes to 1 heterozygote .
In the case of the presence and absence of the maple character the result was closely similar .
Thus the latency of m. and of p. in white flowered plants is demonstrated on a considerable scale , and the proportions in which they appear is not inconsistent with precise Mendelian segregation .
A similar result was obtained in the case of the offspring of a cross made by Mr. Bateson between Maple ( m.g. ) and Victoria Marrow ( w. ) .
On learning that I was engaged upon the experiments already described , Mr. Bateson very kindly handed over to me the crop obtained from this cross in F2 .
In Fi the maple character was described as being simply dominant .
In F2 there appeared , m.g. 38 , g. 12 , w. 19 , which is very clpse to the expected ratio of 9:3:4 .
Some of the seeds produced by two of the white flowered plants showed just the faintest possible trace of " ghost " maple .
In this particular instance the " ghost " maple made its appearance , even in later generations , in only a small number of those plants which could be Mr. R. H. Lock .
On Inheritance of [ Oct. 1 , ' shown to bear the latent factor for maple marking ; m. is in fact almost , but not quite invariably , completely latent .
Offspring of all the 19 white plants were crossed with members of various pure strains of grey and purple seeded peas , in all of which maple marks were wanting .
Table II shows that seven of the F3 plants examined were heterozygous in respect of the hidden factor , whilst 22 yielded only dominant offspring , and seven only recessive .
In the light of these experiments it becomes extremely probable that the hidden factor\#151 ; the cryptomere\#151 ; comes always from the white flowered parent and not from the coloured , as Tschermak supposed* in the case of several pea crosses where reversion occurred in Fi , followed by the appearance of the ratio 9 : 3 : 4 in Fg .
To the behaviour of the maple character as thus described I know of no exception .
The purple character , on the other hand , does not , as it would appear , invariably follow the simple rule obeyed by this character as exhibited by the coloured native pea of Ceylon .
Hitherto among extracted whites derived from the cross between the Purple Sugar Pea and different white strains I have been able to find no example which does not yield exclusively purple offspring when crossed with grey .

It will be seen that some such families include all dominant members , others all recessive , and others again a mixture .
