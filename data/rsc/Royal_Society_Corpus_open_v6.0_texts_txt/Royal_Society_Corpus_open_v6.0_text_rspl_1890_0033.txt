The main part of Helmholtz 's paper is taken up with the con-sideration of experiments on the oscillations of an accurately worked sphere .
It is remarkable that he deduces a value for the coefficient of viscosity which is about a quarter greater than that given by Poiseuille .
This seems to suggest that a slight change in the application of theory to the results of experiment is needed , which will reduce the coefficient for the viscosity of the liquid , and increase the value for its adhesion to the walls of the vessel to that required for the condition of no slip .
The existence of any effect approaching in magnitude that given by Helmholtz would produce , as I have shown , such an enormous change in the time of flow through a silvered tnbe , that the result of my experiments must be considered quite conclusive .
The argument from the differences in friction due to differences in surface , in favour of the contact theory of E.M.F. is now seen to be worthless ; and it must be admitted that no slip occurs , at any rate with solids that are wetted by the liquid .

" Re-determination of the True Weight of a Cubic Inch of Distilled Water .

( Abstract .
) Recent investigations as to the value of the metric unit of volume \#151 ; the cubic decimetre\#151 ; appear to show , indirectly , that the present weight of a cubic inch of distilled water ( 252*458 grains , t = 62 ' F.\#187 ; 5 = 30 in.)\#151 ; the hitherto accepted unit of volume in this country\#151 ; * is appreciably too high .
This weight ( 252*458 grains ) is based on weighings made by Shuckburgh in 1798 , and on linear measurements by Kater in 1821 ; but their results are affected by uncertainty as to thermometric and linear measurements , and as to the condition of the water used .
Hence a direct re-determination of the unit of volume in this country appeared now to be desirable .

] True Weight of a Cubic Inch of Distilled Water .
Methods and Apparatus Employed .
The weight of a given volume of water is best determined by ascertaining the weight of water displaced by a body or gravimeter , whose weights in air and in vacuo , and external linear dimensions , may be precisely determined .
For the purpose of the present experiments three such gravimeters were used C. A platinised hollow bronze circular cylinder , 9 inches in diameter and height .
Q. A quartz cylinder , 3 inches in diameter and height .
S. A hollow 6-inch brass sphere .
The dimensions of C , Q , and S were measured by two comparators , designed for these measurements , geometric lines being traced on C and S for this purpose ; to To'oVoo^'h part of an inch .
The actual rate of expansion of each gravimeter by heat was not separately determined , as the probable errors which arise in ascertaining the rates of expansion of bodies of the particular sizes and forms of C , Q , and S , would be larger than the probable errors which arise in applying the rates of expansion obtained from experiments made by the Fizeau optical method on smaller cubes of similar materials .
Water.\#151 ; For the rate of the expansion of water the mean corrected observations of Despretz , Kopp , and Pierre , as taken by W. H. Miller ( 1856 ) , and Foerster ( 1864 ) , have been followed .
If those of Hagen and Mathiessen had been included , the weight of the cubic inch would have been affected by + 0'0009 grain .
For the normal temperature to which we wish to reduce the cubic inch ( i = 62 ' F. ) , the maximum density of water to its density at t \#151 ; 62 ' F. is\#151 ; at 4 ' C. = 1-000000 ' ' .
*62 ' p. = 0-9y8881 ' The water was in each case twice distilled ; no chlorine , carbonic acid , lead , or lime , being traced , in any quantity to affect the weighings .
No correction for the absorption of air was applied , as the distilled water was so far deprived of air , by boiling , and under an air-pump .
Thermometers.\#151 ; Six standard thermometers , verified both before and after the experiments were used , viz. , Centigrade 4517 , 4518 ( Tonnelot ) ; Fahrenheit 430 ( Kew Committee ) , 12765 ( Negretti and Zambra ) , and 20065 ( Hicks ) ; the verifications being based on the two thermometers 4517 and 4518 , the values of which had been expressed by Dr. Rene Benoit and Dr. Pemet in relation to the ydrogen thermometers to + 0*001 ' C. , each thermometer being corrected for exterior pressure , and its readings reduced to the orizontal position. .
The experiments were made as nearly at 62 ' as 232 True Weight of a Cubic Inch of Distilled Water .
[ June 19 might be ; an uncertainty of 0*2 ' F. making a difference in tV weight of the cubic inch of 0*003 grain .
Weighings.\#151 ; The weighings were made in three sensitive balances by Borda 's method ; the gravimeter being suspended in water to a fixed depth , by a platinum wire .
The largest errors in such weighings are those likely to arise from minute bubbles of air carried down by the body which is suspended in water ; and as it is impracticable to keep the gravimeter in boiling water , such hubbies must be looked for , and the gravimeter repeatedly re-immersed .
The normal air adopted in these weighings is that at f = 62 ' F. b =30 inches , containing four volumes of carbonic-anhydride in every 10,000 volumes of air ; and also containing two-thirds of the amount of aqueous vapour contained in saturated air ; weighed at Westminster , latitude 51 ' 29 ' 53 , r , at 16 feet above sea-level ( g Westminster = \#163 ; 45'\#151 ; 1*00057704 ) .

Received June 12 , 1890 .
In accordance with a plan suggested in a memorandum drawn up by Professor Darwin , I have made the following experiments upon this subject , using for the purpose the large whirling machine of 56 feet diameter erected at Hersham .
The apparatus was made by Mr. Munro , and the general arrangement is shown in figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Fig. 1 gives a view as seen from the point towards which the pressure plate P is moving ; fig. 2 as seen from the centre of the whirling machine ; and fig. 3 as seen from a point vertically above it .
