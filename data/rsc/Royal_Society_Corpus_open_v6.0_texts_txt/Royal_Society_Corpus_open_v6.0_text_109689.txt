An Account of a Calculus from the Human Bladder of uncommon Magnitude .
By Sir James Earl , F.R.S. Read June 15 , 1809 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1809 , p. 303 .
] This calculus , which is considered as the largest on record , weighs 44 ounces avoirdupois .
It was taken after death from the bladder of Sir James Ogilvie , who had submitted to a fruitless attempt to remove it by the usual operation of lithotomy , rather than prolong an existence extremely miserable from this among other consequences of a blow on his back thirty years before .
The stone so completely filled the cavity of the bladder , that it was with difficulty taken out , although there was no real adhesion .
Its texture was less compact than that of calculi in general , but agreed in appearance with that species which has been called the Fusible Calculus ; and it was ascertained by Dr. Powel to contain the same ingredients as it was composed of , the ammoniacal phosphate of magnesia , with phosphate of lime .
