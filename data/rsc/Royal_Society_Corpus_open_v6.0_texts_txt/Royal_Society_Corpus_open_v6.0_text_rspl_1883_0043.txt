" Examination of the Meteorite which fell on the 16th February , 1883 , at Alfianello , in the District of Verolan-nova , in the Province of Brescia , Italy .
" By Walter Flight , D.Sc .
, F.G.S. Communicated by Professor G. G. Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received May 17 , 1883 .
I gather from a short preliminary notice , which has been sent by M. Denza to Professor Daubree , and has been published in a recent number of the " Comptes Rendus , " a few particulars respecting the fall of this stone , and its general appearance .
The fall took place , with a loud detonation , at 2.55 p.m. on the day above mentioned ; it was heard in the neighbouring provinces of Cremona , Verona , Mantua , Piacenza , and Parma .
In Alfianello it is described as " epou van table .
' " It descended from N.N.E. to S.S.W. , at a distance of about 150 metres from a peasant , who fell fainting to the ground ; telegraphic wires were set in motion , and the windows were shaken .
It struck the ground about 300 metres south-west of Alfianello , in a field on an estate called Frosera , penetrating the soil , in the same direction as it passed through the air , from east to west , to a depth of about 1 metre , the path through the soil being about 1*50 metre .
When taken out of the ground it was still a little warm .
It fell complete , but was at once broken to pieces by the farmer of the estate .
The stone is oval in form , and somewhat flattened in the centre , the lower part being larger and convex , like a kettle , the upper part being truncated .
The surface is covered with the usual black crust , and strewn with little cavities , now met with as individuals , now in groups , and in the eye of some people bearing a resemblance to the impression of a hand or the foot of a she-goat .
The stone weighs about 200 kilos .
In structure this meteorite belongs to the group Sporadosideres oligosideres , and resembles Aumalite , being almost identical with the meteorite of New Concord , Ohio .
The substance is finely granular , of ash-grey colour ; a polished surface appears to be finely grained and breccia-form , with the elements offering different gradations of colour .
Metallic grains are disseminated , and little nests are noticed , of iron with one of the compounds , of a yellowish-white or bronze .
In one place where the metallic grains are numerous they appear to bear to the stony portion the ratio 68 : 1000 .
The density of the stone is 3*47 to 3*50 .
The meteorite was dried at 120 ' , and treated with solution of mercury chloride , and thus there were dissolved the troilite and nickel-iron .
The troilite constituted 6'919 per cent , of the meteorite , and the nickel-iron forms 2*108 of the stone , with the composition\#151 ; \#166 ; 1883 .

It agrees most closely yith that which occurs in the meteorite of Ensisheim , the first ecorded fall which has been preserved in any collection ; it fell 17th November , 1492 .
The latest analysis of that stone is by Frank \gt ; rook , of Baltimore , made in Gottingen in 1868 , and he found in the pluble portion of that stone 52*90 per cent , of iron oxide .

[ May 24 which forms the insoluble portion of the meteorite of Ensisheim What was supposed to be alumina was further examined , and wai found to be almost entirely chromium oxide , doubtless present ixi combination with some iron protoxide , alumina , and magnesia ai chromite .
And it appears not improbable that this part of tb meteorite contains some tridymite , ' a few per cent. , in fact .
V. " Circular concerning Astronomical , Photography .
" From E C. Pickering , Director of Harvard College Observatory Cambridge , Mass .
, U.S.A. Astronomical Photography .
The important part that photography is likely to play in the futurtj of astronomy renders it desirable that an opportunity should bj afforded to astronomers to acquaint themselves with the .
improve ments continually made in this branch of their science .
This couli best be done by the establishment at convenient places of collection designed to exhibit the progress of photography as applied to astro nomical observations .
The Harvard College Observatory has some special advantages fo forming such a collection , since it already possesses many of tb early and historically important specimens which would natural !
form part of the series .
Among these may be mentioned four serie of daguerreotypes and photographs of various celestial objects take* at this Observatory .
These series were respectively undertaken v 1850 , 1857 , 1869 , and 1882 .
At present , the astronomers of the United States , have no .read ) means of comparing\#187 ; their photographic work with t that done ii Europe , or even with that of their own countrymen .
The propose* collection of photographs , so far as it could be * rendered complete would greatly reduces the edifficulty .
It is therefore desired ; to form , at the Harvard ^College Observe tory , a collection of all ^photographs of the heavenly bodies and o their spectra which can be obtained for the purpose ; and it is ho|Jj0 that both European and American astronomers will contnbut specimens to this collection .
Original negatives would be particul^H valuable .
It may happen that " some such negatives , having slig\amp ; j imperfections which would limit* their value for purposes of engraY ing , could be spared for a collection , and would be as imporJH ( considered as astronomical observations ) as others photographica j more perfect .
In some cases* astronomers may be willing to^ dep negatives taken ?
for .
special purpose , and no longer required w study , in a collection inhere they ' would retain a permanent value .
