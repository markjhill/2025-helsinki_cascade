On Circulating Functions , and on the Integration of a Class of Equations of Finite Differences into which they enter as Coefficients .

] The subject of recurring series , says the author , has been almost exhausted ; but there is a class of series nearly allied to them , which contain a species of functions , which he calls circulating functions , which have never beenx systematically considered .
Mr. Herschel proceeds to explain a direct method of solving all equations containing this kind of functions ; and in the course of his investigation remarks a curious formula , which expresses the integer part of the quotient arising from the division of any one number by any other , -a circumstance which he observes may prove of considerable use in the theory of numbers .
