In the preparation of my course of lectures , I have found it necessary to re-investigate much of the above-named branch of mechanics , and I have now a paper in preparation on the subject , which I propose to offer to the Royal Society when it is ready .
In the meanwhile , it appears to me that the two fundamental principles on which my researches are based are of such a nature , that they may very properly be communicated to the Royal Society at once .
They are as follows : I. Principle of the Stability of Earth .
At each point in a mass of earth the directions of greatest and least compressive stress are at right angles to each other ; and the condition of stability is , that at each point the ratio of the difference of those stresses to their sum shall not exceed the sine of the angle of natural slope of the earth .
II .
Principle of the Transformation of Structures .
Let a structure of a given uniform transverse section be stable under a system of forces represented by given lines in the plane of section:-Then will any other structure whose transverse section is a projection by parallel lines of that of the first structure upon any other plane , be stable under the system of forces represented by the projections , upon the new plane , of the lines representing the first system of forces .
Example of the application of this principle .
Let fig. 1 be an equilibrated arch with its abutments of the form ( for example ) proposed by M. Yvon-Villarceaux , suited for a horizontal extrados OF .
OK , OA , and AB being given , all the dimensions of the arch and abutments are functions of those three quantities .
It is required to design an arch , fig. 2 , for an extrados of , at any given inclination , of any given span cd ( measured parallel to the extrados ) , and in which oke=OK , oa=OA , and ab=AB , are the same as in the primitive arch fig. 1 .

Solution .
On any vertical plane passing through BK , and not coinciding with the plane of fig. 1 , draw cod of the given length and inclination , intersecting COD in O. Join Cc , Dd , and project the whole of fig. 1 on the new plane by lines parallel to Cc , I)d .
The projection so obtained will be the figure of the arch and abutments required .
Moreover , if the lines R , R , fig. 1 , represent in length , direction , and position , the resultants of the pressures of the abutments on their foundations in the original arch , then will r , r , fig. 2 , the projections of R , R , represent the corresponding resultants in the new arch ; and in like manner , the thrust at a is the projection of the thrust at A.

Note .
The horizontal foundation courses in fig. 2 do not form part of the projection of fig. 1 , but are supposed to be added after the completion of the projection .
