) The investigations were undertaken at the suggestion of Major R. Ross , under funds allotted by the Tropical Diseases Research Committee in the case of one of us ( H. B. F. ) and under the Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence Fund in the case of the other ( J. G. T. ) .
The researches were necessary in order to determine whether a regular periodic increase in the trypanosomes in the peripheral circulation of subinoculated animals occurred , like that found by R. Ross and D. Thomson ( 1910)* in a case of Rhodesian Sleeping Sickness , and whether this numerical cyclical development had a definite significance in the life-history of the parasite , which it would be necessary to consider in the case of treatment by drugs or other methods .
Our work was done in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine .
The trypanosome from the patient suffering from Sleeping Sickness contracted in Rhodesia was found by Stephens and Fantham ( 1910)f to exhibit a marked morphological peculiarity in the presence of a posterior nucleus , and for this parasite the name T. rhodesiense was suggested by them .
We have also used an old laboratory strain of T. gambiense .
In all cases a definite number of trypanosomes were inoculated .
The inoculation was made subcutaneously in rats , intra-peritoneally in guinea-pigs and rabbits .
The peripheral blood of these animals was then examined daily at the same hour , that is to say at regular intervals of 24 hours .
The technique employed was that elaborated by R. Ross and D. Thomson in their study of the patient W. A. , namely , that a known quantity of blood ( 1 cubic millimetre divided into quarters ) was taken and the parasites therein very carefully counted .
In counting the thick films , an Ehrlich eyepiece was used , after the films had been dehmmoglobinised , fixed with absolute alcohol , and stained by the Romanowsky method .
When the parasites were very numerous , it was necessary to spread the quarter cubic millimetre of blood over a larger square area than usual , and to use a small diaphragm in the * ' Roy .

The parasites were then counted in three or four bands across the film , which had been previously examined in order to ascertain an even distribution of the parasites therein .
Rats.\#151 ; In the case of both strains it was found that the inoculated rats tended to fall into one of two main categories , exhibiting either ( 1 ) a periodic increase and decrease in the number of parasites in the peripheral blood ( see Chart 1 ) , or ( 2 ) a more or less continuous rise in the numbers of parasites until the animal died ( see Chart 2 ) .
Daily counts were made of 17 rats exhibiting periodic variation , and of five rats exhibiting continuous increase in the case of T. rhodesiense .
Further , similar counts were made of seven rats exhibiting periodic variation after inoculation with T. gambiense ( see Chart 3 ) and of four showing continuous increase in the case of T. gambiense .

The average incubation period in rats in the case of T. rhodesiense was 2-9 days , whereas in the case of T. gambiense it was 4'4 days .
The average 1910 .
] T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense Eats , etc. number of parasites inoculated in the case of each strain was approximately the same .
The average life of rats inoculated with rhodesiense was 113 days , whereas the life of rats infected with T. was 13*8 days .
( The average weight of the rats inoculated with rhodesiense was 138-8 grammes , of those infected with T. gambiense , 137 grammes .
) The number of divisions of parasites occurring in the first 24 hours in both strains averaged 6 , and varied in each case from 2 to 10 divisions , being most frequently about 8 .
There is a shorter period between the crests of the waves in the graphs denoting the number of trypanosomes in the Rhodesian strain ( about three to four days ) than in the laboratory strain of T. gambiense ( namely , four to six days ) .
The Rhodesian strain , then , was the more virulent .
Guinea-pigs.\#151 ; Daily counts were made of five guinea-pigs inoculated with T. rhodesiense ( see Chart 4 ) , and of five guinea-pigs inoculated with T. gambiense ( see Chart 5 ) .
The duration of life ( averaging 59 days ) of those inoculated with the Rhodesian strain was shorter than in those inoculated with T. gambiense ( averaging 111 days ) .
In guinea-pigs the disease tended to run a chronic course .
The periods between the crests of the waves in both strains in guinea-pigs were longer than in rats , namely , five to eight days , and the initial rise was slower .
Babbits.\#151 ; Two rabbits were inoculated with T. rhodesiense .
They lived 29 and 24 days respectively .
Periodic variation occurred in the numbers of the parasites , especially in one case .
These animals exhibited an affection of the eyes and skin , there being a white purulent discharge from the eyes , and the skin at the roots of the ears became encrusted with scabs .
The periodicity in the numbers of the parasites in the peripheral circulation of infected animals is to be explained by ( a ) variations in resistance on the part of the host , probably due to the formation of anti-bodies ; accompanied by ( b ) the formation on the part of the trypanosomes of rounded , latent , non-flagellate ( relatively resistant ) forms in the internal organs of the host during the fall in numbers of the parasites in the peripheral blood .
There is , therefore , a life-cycle of trypanosomes in the vertebrate host , in addition to stages of the parasite in the invertebrate carrier ( e.g. ) .
