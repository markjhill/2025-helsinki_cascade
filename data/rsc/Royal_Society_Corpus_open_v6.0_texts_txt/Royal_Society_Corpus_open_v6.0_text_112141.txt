Adopting the notation in Table 1 .
( p. 284 ) , and the data of M. Mathieu ( Annuaire dut Bureau des Longitudes , 1865 , p. 321 ) , Laplace 's hypsometrical formula , after some easy transformations , becomes h-H11= [ log B-log 6-00007 .

The values assigned to z by different writers vary conisiderably .
Laplace makes z= 002837 , and M. Mlathieu ( Annuair e , 1 .
c. ) gives z-00265 .
I have thought it , therefore , advisable first to consult the authorities who have calculated y directly from pendulum experiments , next to calculate y from the compression deduced from measurements of arcst , and them , having determined z for each of these values of 3x , to take the mean result to five places of decimals .
The penduluim reductions are taken from Bailey ( Mern .

This differs from Laplace 's value by *000207 , and from that of M. Mathieu by *00002 .
Viewed in relation to the possible errors which may arise from other sources this correction is slight , but it should be made , on the principle advocated by Laplace , that it is assignable ( MGc .

vol. iv .
p. 292 ) .
Adopting this value of z and reducing the formula ( a ) to English feet and Fahrenheit degrees , I have constructed Tables I. and II .
, which give formulae and figures for calcuilating heights with every correction of Laplace , more readily than any other that I have seen .
As there is no necessity to initerpolate , the Tables are evenl simpler to use than MI .
Mathieu 's ( Annuaire , 1 .
c. ) or Loomis 's ( Astronomy , p. 390 ) , and they are not only simpler but more complete than Baily 's ( Astronomical Tables , 1827 , p. 111 ) , which do not give the cor* The term 1z cos 2L represents the ratio of the gravity at latitude L ' , to the gravity at latitude 450 , which on the spheroidal theory of the earth 's shape is [ l+y * ( Siii L)2 ] rection for the variation of gravity on the vertical .
They have the further advantage of being applicable to both English and colntinlental measures .
The unavoidable uncertainities of the theory make it useless to consider more minute quanitities than a foot , or the huLnidredth of a metre or of a toise .
Ilence oiily five-figure logaritlins are required .
The following examples will show the use of these Tables .

If this coefficient were adopted the values of log G in Table II .

This would increase the results in the foregoing examples by 4 feet , 2-8 metres , and 1-3 toise respectively .
Verification of these numbers by actual levelling is much needed , but it is rendered difficult by the uncertainty attending the correction for temperature* .

eq. 5 ) , and consequently to know the relation between E and X. Laplace then says ( I. c. ) , " comme les iiteSgrales no s'etendent jamais qn'h no intervalle peu considerable , relativement a la hauteur entiilre de l'atmosphere ; toutefotnetion qui represent a-la-fois les temperatures des deustations inf6rieure et sup'rieure , et suivant laquelle la temperature diminue a'-peu-pres en progression arithmet &amp; ique de l'uune 'a l'autre , est adnmisible , et l'on peut choisir celle qui simplifie le plus le calcul .
" Bessel ( 1 .
c. ) says " we are entirely ignorant of this relation , and have therefore no reason to assume the alteration of temperature as otherwise than proportional to the alteration of height .
" Laplace and Bessel then imake an assumption which approximatively fulfils this condition and is equivalent to taking E'+k .
X= a constant , k being determinied by the observed temperatures at the two stations .
This makes the integration easy , but it is evident that the result should not be applied in cases where the difference of level is not small in relation to the extent of the appreciable atmosphere , or where the temperature does not diminish approximately as the height increases .
Now Mr. Glaisher , as the result of his observations 'i Tho errors in determ-ining the actual temperatutres of the air in miountain ascents , arisin-g from the radiation of the grounid , are not considered , bocause they are rather error s of obervation tCan of theory .
on the diminution of temperature with increase of height , gives a series of average decrements such that on assuming the temperature to decrease m degrees Fahrenheit for an elevation of n thousand feet , and representing a degree Fahrenheit and a thousand feet , by a horizontal and a vertical unit of length respectively , we shall find that the resulting curve approaches to a rectangular hyperbola mn + am + bn = 0 , referred to axes parallel to its asymptotes .
We may then by the principle of least squares determine the values of a and b from his Tables* .
But on comparing such a curve with the curves of alteration of temperature really observedt , the deviation from the average appears so great in particular cases , that no advantage would accrue from complicating the integration by the introduction of such a law .
The only course that appears open to pursue is to confine the limits of the integration to those small amounts which Laplace contemplated in the passage cited , and calculate the height by sections .
For it also appears from Mr. Glaisher 's curve , that for small alterations of height the alteration of temperature varies approximately as the alteration of height , that is , that the curve does not deviate materially from its tangent for comparatively considerable distances .
When the difference of level is many thousand feet the difference of temperature is generally large , and the curve consequently differs materially from a straight line .
No dependence can then be placed on the result .
It would appear that we should be more likely to obtain correct results by dividing the whole height into a number of partial heights , not exceeding 1000 metres or 3000 feet , and taking fresh observations whenever the temperature altered abnormally .
To have a rough notion of when this occurs , an aneroid barometer and common thermometer should be watched on the ascent .
Mr. Glaisher 's observations tend to show that we may expect on an average a fall of very nearly 40 Fahr. for each inch of depression of the barometer under a cloudy sky , the first inch , and the 11th to the 16th inch of depression being accompanied by a slightly more rapid fall of temperature .
Under a clear or nearly clear sky , there is a fall of about 50 Fahr. for each of the first 4 inches of depression of the barometer ; then about 40.2 per inch from the 5th to the 13th inch , and about 40.5 per inch from the 14th to the 16th incht .
This may therefore be considered as the normal alteration of temperature .
In order to secure simultaneous observations at both stations for each section , it would be necessary to have two ascending parties , one for each variable station , each of which should be able to signal to the other .
A stationary observer at the lowest station would serve as a check on the other two .
This method introduces many practical difficulties , but the reduction of the observations is rendered very easy by Tables I. and II .
The great importance of thus calculating heights by sections will be rendered evident by the following examples .
Taking the data in the Ann. Mete'or .
de F. for 1852 , p. 70 , we have for Geneva as the lower and St. Bernard as the upper station , L 46 , B ' 0'72643 Al 8*97 Hi 408 , 6 ' 0'56364 at -189 h1 2463 .
Again , for St. Bernard as the lower and Mont Blanc as the upper station , B ' 0-56803 A ' 7'6 Hi 2463 , 6 ' 0A42429 a ' -9l1 h1 47877 ; which has been calculated as Ex. 2 above .
But taking the data from the Annuaire du B. des L. , 1865 , p. 324 , we have for Geneva as the lower and Mont Blanc as the upper station , B 729-65 Mf 18-6 A ' 19-3 Hl1 408 , b 424-05 mt -4-2 a ' -7-6 A1 4815 9 .
That is , the height of Mont Blanc above the sea , when calculated from observations at Geneva , St. Bernard , and the summit , is determined as 478717 metres , but when calculated from observations at Geneva and the summit only , is determined as 4815 9 metres , or 28 2 metres more .
This is striking enough , but it is by no means clear that even the smaller amount may not be too large* .
station B ' 30 , A 60 , H 0 , L 45 , and supposing the temperature to decrease according to Mr. Glaisher 's Tables .
The increase of height for each inch of depression was then divided by the number of feet of ascent in which , according to Mr. Glaisher , the temperature falls one degree at the height reached .
Mr. Glaisher 's balloon ascents offer a very convenient series of examples on account of the comparative closeness of his observations .
I have therefore calculated two , Tables III .
and IV .
, p. 286 , which are important from their height or remarkable changes of temperature , first , by determining the height of each station from the lowest ( which I call the total method ) ; and secondly , by calculating the height of each station from the height of the next lower station ( which I call the gradual mnethod ) .
I have added the differences of level between the stations as determined from both methods and the differences between them , which are important for discovering how the discrepancies between the two results are produced by temperature .
Each station is lettered .
Two letters against a number , as ah 5720 , show that the height of the station h above the sea is found as 5720 feet , when station a is taken as the lower station with the height assignied to it in the same column .
The distance ah is termed an interval .
A careful examination of these results will show that the gradual method is probably the most trustworthy .
In Table III .
up to station i , both results substantially agree , but in the interval ij there is a sudden increase of temperature , which is quite abnormal* .
The total method , from omitting all considerations of the preceding lower temperatures , makes the height of the interval ij exceed its value as determined by the gradual method by 59 feet , an enormous amount in a total height of 7518 or '579 feet .
The temperature again decreasing from j to k , the difference is not so great , but the total method is 8 feet in defect for this interval .
Again , for mn there is only a slight fall of temperature , and consequently the total method , ignoring the low absollute temperatuire of the interval , makes the difference of level greater than the gradual method by 27 feet .
In pq there is absolutely a rise of temperature , and for the reason last stated , the total method makes the interval 73 feet greater than the gradual .
The interval qr is a great contrast to this .
The temperature falls very rapidly , 70.1 for a barometric depression of *79 inch , which is nearly double the normal amount as previously determined for the 14th inch of depression .
Hence the total method , by distributing the cold over the warm parts , makes the interval qr 73 feet less than the gradual method .
Again , rs shows an excess of 103 feet in the total method for a steady temperature , and sta defect of 100 feet for a sudden fall of temperature .
Mr. Glaisher 's observations show that there was a rise and fall of temperature between r and s , but as there were no simultaneous observations of barometer and thermometer , I have not been able to initroduce them into the calculation .
The results after r are therefore very doubtful .
The interval vw is liable to grave suspicionl , not only from the great length of the interval , but the imperfect manner in which the observations were unavoidably made .
Supposing the observations to be correct , the total method makes the interval vw greater than the gradual by no less than 610 feet , owing to its distributing the warin tempelatures over so large an interval of extreme cold .
If we then omit the interval vw , we find 359 feet for the sum of all the cases in which the total method was in excess of the gradual , and 201 feet for the cases of defect , leaving a total excess of 158 feet in 26450 or 26292 feet , which is thus slhown to be a very inadequate measure of the degree of nncertainty due to the total method .
In Table IV .
the results to c , or evein d , substantially agree ; but at d the temperature decreases very slowly , and soon becomes absolultely stationary .
Great differences immediatelv appear .
From I to r the temperature increases , and the total method gains greatly on the gradual till at r it is 541 feet in advance .
At stations s , t the total method indicates a descent with a falling barometer , whereas the gradual method gives a very slow ascent .
Air .
Glaisher 's observations show that for the same barometric pressure of 14 637 inches , as at r , the temperature varied successively through 360.1 , 380.2 , 380.1 , 420.2 Fahr. , which on the total method indicate different heights , whereas the gradual methods cannot admit any variation of height without a variation of pressure .
The rapid fall of the thermometer from u to w causes the total method to give very much smaller intervals than the graduial , but the nearly stationary temperatulres of x , y , z turn the balance the other way .
Oni the whole , the total method gives 686 feet in excess , and 335 feet in defect of the gradual method , remaining 351 feet in excess .
The temperatuire varied so abnormally in this ascent that little confidence can be reposed in either result after station h. , when the total method is only 32 feet out of 9411 or 9379 in advance of the gradual , which is still a large amount .
It may be objected to the gradual method that , by multiplying stations , it multiplies errors of observation .
But even when the stations are so unnecessarily multiplied as in Tables III .
and IV .
( in which nearly every recorded case of a simultaneouis observation of barometer and thermorneter has been admitted ) , the error is not likely to approach that arising from the total method .
We may , however , calculate the ascent of Table 111 .
as far as r , beyond which , as already remarked , the variation of temperatures renders the results uncertain , in six instead of sixteen stations , as follows .

This difference may be easily accounted for .
Up tofboth results substantially agree .
Between f and k there was first a rise and then a fall of temperature , which are overlooked in the abridged calculation , and it consequently loses 8 feet .
In the interval 1j r there was a steady temperature during 1400 feet , which disappears in the abridgement , and consequentlv it againi loses 11 feet .
It is evident , therefore , that the sections in this abridgement have been badly selected , and the importance of determining them rather by change of temperature than by height ascended becomes apparent .
A better result is obtained by means of the seven sections ai 6327 , ij 7520 , jk 9887 , lcn 13649 , nip 17 568 , pq 18963 , qr 20366 , determined with reference to the chanoge of temperature .
The result , r 20366 , is only 9 feet more than that of the gradual method in Table III .
, but is 104 feet less than that of the total method .
If / 3 , / , / 3 be the barometric readings reduced to 320 F. , and a , ct , all the corresponding temperatures of the air for any three stationis , then the formula ( a ) shows that , rejecting the small corrections v , V1 , the height , as determiiined by the total method , will be the same as that determined by the gradual method when ( a + a " ) .

p. 516 , the above condition becomes very nearly , that the decrement of temperature should vary as the decrement of pressure , and this is the case for the normal decrements .
Thus in Table III .
the intervals a i , j Ac , Im , np give for the quiotienits of the decrements of temaperature divided by the decrements of pressure 4 635 , 4 07 , 3 26 , 3 92 respectively , and the differences of the lengths of these intervals , as determined by the total and gradual methods , are only 2 , -8 , 13 , 13 respectively .
But for the intervals ij , mn these quotients are -3 55 , 1 27 , and the differences 59 , 37 .
Similarly in Table I-V .
, for the intervals a d , a e , ah the quotients are 41 8 , 3 91 , 3 97 , and the differences -9 , 31 , 32 .
These results conifirm the above conclusion , and also tend to show that the niormal quotient is 4 , and to explainv why the gradual method is the most generally trustworthy .
Since , them , it is advisable to caleulate by such short sections , the practical rules which I gave in a former paper ( ' Proceedings , ' March 26 , 1863 , vol. xii .
pp. 513 , 514 ) may be condenised into one , which will enable ainy traveller to calculate heights without the assistance of any tables whatever .
I concliude this paper , therefore , by annexing it in its improved form , to0 ether with a rule calculated on the saame principles for foreiga data , alt an examplo of each to show the mehlodI of workilg .
