[ June 16 , similar to that of those from ordinary air .
Fifth , the state of filthiness of a sewer seems to have no perceptible effect on the number of micro-organisms .
Sixth , the view that the micro-organisms in sewer air chiefly come from outside , is in perfect agreement with what is known as to the distribution of bacteria in air .
Seventh results obtained in the laboratory with an experimental sewer prove that the micro-organisms present in air are diminished to nearly one-half in passing along a moist tube 5 feet long and If inch in diameter at a rate of nearly 1 foot per second .
Although most of the micro-organisms in sewer air come from outside , yet there was distinct evidence of their occasional dissemination from the sewage itself .
This is the case when splashing occurs , owing to drains entering the sewer at points high up in the roof .
It is , therefore , of great importance that drains should be so arranged as to avoid splashing as much as possible .
In view of the fact that ordinary sewer air is to all appearance comparatively\#166 ; innocent as regards its micro-organisms , experiments were also made to see whether it contained any poisonous volatile base of the nature of a ptomaine .
These experiments so far as they went had negative results .
Experiments as to the efficacy of ordinary water traps in preventing the escape of sewer gas into houses confirmed and extended the results previously obtained by Fergus .
Though the authors do not discuss the effect of the inhalation of sewer air on health , yet the results of tho above investigation are clearly such as to make one much more suspicious as to supposed evidence of the bad effects of ordinary sewer air ( at least when not vitiated by splashing ) , such as that examined by them .

" On the Composition of Water by Volume .
" By Alexander Scott , M.A. , D.Sc .
Communicated by Lord Rayleigh , D.C.L. , Sec. R.S. Received May 23 , 1887 .
In 1805 Gay-Lussac and Humboldt published their classical researches on the composition of the atmosphere , and to them we are indebted for our knowledge of the proportion by volume in which hydi'ogen and oxygen combine to form water .
Without this knowledge the determination of the relative densities of the two gases would be of no use in fixing or checking their atomic weights .
This is often overlooked , and Avogadro 's law taken as absolutely true for these gases at ordinary temperatures and pressures .
That this cannot safely be assumed is conclusively proved by the researches of Regnault , Amagat , and others on the effects of change of temperature and pressure upon them .
Rot only do they not follow Boyle 's law as usually 1887 .

understood , but their deviations from it are in opposite directions ; hence it can only be by the merest chance that at our ordinary temperatures and pressures the combining volumes should be exactly two of hydrogen to one of oxygen .
Moreover , when we consider that it is more than eighty years since these researches were carried out , that the instrument used in all the measurements was Volta 's eudiometer , and that the gases were collected and measured over water and so contained impurities to the extent of 0'4 per cent , in the oxygen and 0'6 to 0'8 per cent , in the hydrogen used , a redetermination of this ratio with the greatly improved means for attaining accuracy now at our command seemed to be of extreme importance .
The exact ratio as given in the memoir referred to is 199'89 volumes of hydrogen to 100 volumes of oxygen , and this the authors say is almost exactly as 2 : 1 .
To arrive at greater accuracy the author of this note has given especial attention to the following points :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) The preparation of purer gases .
( 2 .
) The use of larger volumes .
( 3 .
) The measurement of both gases in the same vessel .
( 4 .
) The analysis of the residue after explosion and determination of the impurity in each experiment .

These ends were more or less satisfactorily attained by the use of the apparatus employed , which was entirely of glass with the excep tion of the junctions at H and 0 .
The gas generators contained only small volumes of gas , and could easily he exhausted by means of the apparatus itself .
It is evident that by filling A and B with mercury completely closing all the stopcocks , and then lowering M and open ' mg e , the air in the oxygen generator would be in great part drawn into A ; on now closing e and raising M this air could be expelled by opening / .
By repeating this several times an almost perfect vacuum could be produced .
Before collecting the gas for the experiments , after exhausting the air gas was evolved and exhausted^ and this again repeated .
The gases were measured saturated with moisture , and after measurement were expelled into G ; from this they were drawn into E and exploded , and the residue measured in a small tube and analysed by explosion with either hydrogen or oxygen as re-quired .
The results of every experiment made are given in the following table , from which it will be seen that in no case , even when the maximum value is given to it , does the ratio exceed 2 vols .

" On Muscle Plasma .
" By W. D. Halliburton , M.D. , B.Sc. , Assistant Professor of Physiology , University College , London .
Communicated by Prof. E. A. Schafer , F.R.S. ( From the Physiological Laboratory , University College , London .
) Received May 24 , 1887 .
The facts described by Kiihne relating to the properties of the muscle plasma of cold-blooded animals are true in great measure for that of mammals .
Admixture of muscle plasma with solutions of neutral salts prevents the coagulation of the latter .
Dilution of such salted muscle plasma brings about coagulation ; this occurs most readily at 37\#151 ; 40 ' C. Saline extracts of rigid muscle differ from salted muscle plasma in being acid , but resemble it very closely in the way in which myosin can be made to separate from it ; myosin in fact undergoes a recoagulation .
This is not a simple precipitation ; it is first a jellying through the liquid ; the clot subsequently contracts , squeezing out a colourless fluid or salted muscle serum .
This does not take place at 0 ' C. ; it occurs most readily at the temperature of the body , and is hastened by the addition of a ferment prepared from muscle in the same way as Schmidt 's ferment is prepared from blood .
The ferment is not identical with fibrin ferment , as it does not hasten the coagulation of salted blood plasma ; nor does the fibrin ferment hasten the coagulation of muscle plasma .
The recoagulation of myosin is also accompanied by the formation of lactic acid .
The proteids of muscle plasma are\#151 ; 1 .
Paramyosinogen , which is coagulated by heat at 47 ' C. 2 .
Myosinogen , * which is coagulated at 56 ' C. 3 .
Myoglobulin , which differs chiefly from serum globulin in its coagulation temperature ( 63 ' C. ) .
4 .
Albumin , which is apparently identical with serum albumin \#171 ; , coagulating at 73 ' C. 5 .
Myo-albumose ; this has the properties of deutero-albumose , and is identical with , or closely connected to , the myosin ferment .
The first two proteids in the above list go to form the clot of myosin ; paramyosinogen is , however , not essential for coagulation ; the three last remain in the muscle serum .
* It is on the presence of this proteid that the power of fresh muscle juice to hasten the coagulation of blood plasma depends .
