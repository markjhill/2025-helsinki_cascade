" On the Repulsive Power of Heat .
" By the Rev. Baden Powell , M.A. , F.R.S. , Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
The expansion of bodies by heat appearing to imply a mutual re ?
pulsion of their particles , it becomes a question whether such repul ?
sive power may not be excited by it between particles or masses of matter , at sensible as well as insensible distances .
After noticingthe partial investigations of this question by Libri , Fresnel , Saigey , and Professor Forbes , the author describes the methods he has employed with a view to its solution , and which consisted in applying heat to two lenses of glass , pressed together so as to exhibit the colours of thin plates ; the variation of the tints furnishing exact indications of the most minute changes of distance between the surfaces , by what ?
ever causes they may be produced .
The conclusion he deduces from his experiments , conducted on this plan , is that the separation of the surfaces is of a different character , and is greater than can be accounted for by the mere change of figure produced by the heat ; and is therefore in part to be ascribed to a real repulsive action between the surfaces of the glasses derived from the power of heat .
He also found , on trying similar experiments with glass in contact with a metallic surface , that the results were considerably influenced by the radiating power of the latter ; the effect being increased when this power was greater , and also by all other causes tending to the more rapid communication of heat .
This is still more apparent when the coloured rings are formed in a thin plate of water interposed between the lenses , and where the effects are independent of radiation .
