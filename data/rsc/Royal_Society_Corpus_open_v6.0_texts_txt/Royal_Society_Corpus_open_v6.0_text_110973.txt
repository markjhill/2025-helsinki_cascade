' " On the Value of Absolute Alcohol in Spirits of different Specific Gravities .
" By George Fownes , Esq. , F.R.S. , Professor of Practical Chemistry in University College , London .
Having been recently engaged in a series of experiments on the fermentation of sugar and molasses , which rendered it necessary to refer to a table of the value in absolute alcohol of spirits of different specific gravities , the author found himself comapelled to construct for this purpose a newr table , which he lays before the Royal Society in the present paper .
The table was formed by weighing out absolute alcohol and distilled water in fixed proportions , mixing them , and after allowing time for condensation , determining with suitable precautions the specific gravity of each mixture at the temperature of 60 ?
Fahrenheit .
Each alternate number in the table was so obtained ; the rest being interpolated .
The alcohol employed was prepared by digesting the strongest rectified spirit , first with dry carbonate of potash and afterwards with powdered quicklime and distilling .
It had the specific gravity -7938 at 600 , and boiled at 177 ?
Fahr. The table is followed by a diagram for the purpose of contrasting the actual specific gravities found by experiment with the calculated mean specific gravities of the various mixtures of alcohol and water , in which the specific gravities are indicated by horizontal lines and the proportions of the two liquids by vertical lines .
The mean specific gravities of course run straight across the diagram from corner to corner , while the actual specific gravities form an irregular curve with upward convexity , rising rapidly to near its maximum deviation at 30 per cent. , proceeding nearly parallel with the other line to 50 per cent. , and thence declining until it reaches the extremity of the scale .
