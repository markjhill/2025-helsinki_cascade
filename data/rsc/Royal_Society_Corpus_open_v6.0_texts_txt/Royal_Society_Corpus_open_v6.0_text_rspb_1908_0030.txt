] In a previous communication of this series ( vol. 74 , p. 191 ) , * it is pointed out that the various glucosides are hydrolysed by acids at very different rates , the relative values being approximately of the order shown in the following table:\#151 ; a-Methylglucoside ... ... ... ... ... ... .
100 # / 3- " ... ... ... ... . .
180 a-Methylgalactoside ... ... ... ... ... .
540 / 9- " 880 Salic in ( a / 3-glucoside ) ... ... ... .
600 Milk-sugar ( a / 8-galactoside ) ... .
720 Maltose ( an a-glucoside ) ... ... ... . .
740 Cane-sugar , it is to be remembered , is hydrolysed at a rate vastly more rapid\#151 ; at least 1000 times as rapidly as maltose , in fact .
These differences , taking into account the peculiar specific behaviour of enzymes as hydrolytic agents , raise questions of interest from the chemical side and they are of no slight significance perhaps also from a biological point of view .
The two stereo-isomeric methylglucosides are represented by the following formulae:\#151 ; H OH H OH JL JL 4 4 H H \#151 ; C\#151 ; C.OH .

It will be seen that the two radicles H and OCH3 shown as attached to the one carbon atom merely occupy different or reversed positions relatively to the two other radicles with which the carbon atom is connected .
As to the manner in which the hydrolytic attack takes place , two views are possible : the one being that the compound behaves much as the simple ether CH3.O.CH3 would and that the hydrolyst becomes associated with the oxygen atom to which the CH3 group is attached ; the other being that the attachment is to the oxygen atom in the ring .
On the former view , it is to be supposed that the two isomeric compounds would be hydrolysed with equal readiness , as the CH30 groups are equally weighted ; but on the latter , it is conceivable that the methoxy-group is less easily accessible to hydrolysis in the one case than it is in the other ; or it may be that an inductive effect is exercised by the one oxygen atom upon the other which renders the oxygen atom in the ring either more or less attractive of the hydrolyst , as the case may be .
In the galactosides , the CH30 group occupy the same relative positions as in the two glucosides ; but the contiguous oxygen atom in the pentaphane ring must be supposed to occupy a position slightly different from that which it occupies in glucose , its connection with the carbon atom on the right being slightly different , as shown in the two following formulae:\#151 ; OH z , , , H H / OH H \ 11 CH , O.C.H / 3H.C\#151 ; C\#151 ; C.OH .
\ / 11 \ / OH H \ / \#171 ; 'O ' a-Methylglucoside I \#166 ; COH 1 -Os / Y Y\ H H CH3O.CJI 0H H XC\#151 ; 6\#151 ; C.OH .
\ OHH \ / \amp ; \o/ a-Metliylgalactoside Apparently , seeing that the galactosides are the more easily hydrolysed , this difference is sufficient to render the hydrolyst\#151 ; the attack of which in all probability is directed from the oxygen atom in the ring\#151 ; more accessible to the neighbouring CH30 group than it is in the glucosides .
The behaviour of the glucosidic acetates appears to be in accordance with such an interpretation.* In models of glucose and galactose constructed with tetrahedra to represent the carbon atoms , if these atoms are arranged in a vertical plane the oxygen atom in the ring occupies somewhat different positions more or less outside this plane ; the difference in the relative positions of the OCH3 group and the oxygen atom in the ring , according as the position of these on either side of the ring plane is varied , then becomes apparent .

[ Apr. 2 , There can be little doubt that considerations of the order here pictured are more or less applicable to the explanation of differences such as those under discussion and that it may be possible eventually , proceeding on these lines , to discriminate between alternative formulae applicable to compounds such as glucose and galactose .
It is from this point of view that the study of hydrolytic changes is of supreme importance .
Enzymes probably act much in the same wTay as acid hydrolysts ; the attachment of the enzyme , however , appears to be more general and thorough , so to speak , than that of the acid hydrolyst and presumably extends over a large part of the molecule ( compare III and X , B , vol. 79 , p. 361 ) .
But in both cases the attack is directed , it may be supposed , from the oxygen atom in the pentaphane ring adjoining the group which undergoes hydrolysis .
In the hope of obtaining further information bearing on this refined problem , the behaviour of raffinose towards acids and enzymes has been studied in comparison with that of cane-sugar , raffinose being a triose formed of cane-sugar vjeiglited by the attachment of a molecule of galactose .
Kaffinose is a reserve material which accompanies cane-sugar in the sugar beet , in cotton seed , in barley and in wheat , for example .
It can either be resolved into galactose and cane-sugar by a special enzyme or it can be resolved into fructose and a biose isomeric with cane-sugar\#151 ; \#151 ; by the action of invertase , the enzyme which resolves cane-sugar into glucose and fructose .
Hydrolysis of Cane-sugar and Raffinose with the aid of Acids .
Raffinose is easily hydrolysed with the aid of acids at ordinary temperatures , the products being fructose and melibiose , the latter , like maltose and milk-sugar , undergoing change only at higher temperatures .
The experiments with acids were carried out at 25 ' C. in the manner described by Caldwell ( A , vol. 78 , p. 285 ) , with an improved apparatus an account of which will be given at an early date by Messrs. Caldwell and Whymper .
Except where stated otherwise , the polariscope readings were taken with the aid of a spectroscopic eyepiece , using a mercury lamp as the luminous source , the light being of the refrangibility of the dominant line in the green .
As raffinose is less soluble than cane-sugar , solutions of quarter molecular strength were used .
A complete record of two experiments is given on the left-hand side of Table I. The columns on the right contain the values of the velocity constant deduced by means of the formula Table I\#151 ; Hydrolysis of Cane-sugar and of Kaffinose by Acids at 25 ' in Solutions containing 1000 grammes of Water + 0-25 gramme molecular proportion of Carbohydrate +1 gramme molecular proportion of Acid .

[ Apr. 2 , The values deduced for cane-sugar are in fair agreement with those obtained by other workers in our laboratory .
Contrasting the mean values , they are as follows:\#151 ; Nitric acid .
Chlorhydric acid .
Sulphuric acid .
Cane-sugar ... ... . .
464 500 549 Eaffinose ... ... ... 390 419 446 The three acids differ in their activity towards both sugars : the cause of this difference will be discussed in a separate communication , dealing with the sucroclastic action of acids generally .
It is clear that raffinose is less easily hydrolysed than cane-sugar , at a rate nearly one-fifth less than that at which the latter undergoes change .
The ratios for each acid are nearly the same in the case of nitric acid and chlorhydric acid , but sulphuric acid is relatively less active towards raffinose \#151 ; a result not without interest , the significance of which , however , need not be discussed here .
Hydrolysis of Cane-sugar and Rafinose by In contrasting their behaviour towards invertase , comparative experiments were carried out simultaneously with the two sugars under similar conditions .
A known volume of a very weak solution of invertase at 25 ' C. was added to a known volume of the sugar solution of definite concentration , also at 25 ' , contained in a Jena-glass flask ; after adding a few drops of toluene , the flask was corked tip and placed in an incubator kept at 25 ' .
At stated intervals , 20 c.c. samples were withdrawn from the flask by means of a pipette and run into small Jena-glass flasks , each containing a single drop of a strong aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide .
By this means the action of the enzyme was at once arrested and equilibrium established between the stereo-isomeric forms of the sugars in solution .
The final values were obtained by keeping part of the solution at 25 ' C. during 24 hours , at the end of which time a drop of sodium hydroxide solution was added as before .
In order to obtain the initial values , a drop of sodium hydroxide solution was added to a known volume of the enzyme solution , which was then mixed with the sugar solution in the same proportion as in the experiment .
In the preliminary experiment the raffinose used was that supplied by Kahlbaum .
The rotatory powers of the solutions were determined in sodium light . .

For the following experiments the raffinose was purified by dissolving it in hot water , filtering the hot solution , adding a large bulk of alcohol to the filtrate and allowing it to stand during several days .

carried out , side by side , with the two kinds of raffinose and with cane-sugar ; moreover , with the object of ascertaining the effect of further purification on the stability of the sugar in presence of the enzyme , the recrystallised raffinose was dissolved in " conductivity " water , the solution was mixed with alcohol and a stream of carbon dioxide passed through it during 30 minutes , this artifice having been found to be of service in purifying galactose ; the solution was then filtered and a large bulk of alcohol added to the filtrate .
The material obtained by this method is the " Raffinose III " in the following table .
It was again recrystallised from a mixture of alcohol and " conductivity " water ; the material thus obtained is marked " Raffinose IV .
" Equimolecular proportions of these samples of raffinose having been dissolved , the liquids were boiled to drive off any alcohol present , and were then diluted to the proper volume .

Probably , the greater activity of the invertase in the case of commercial raffinose was conditioned by the presence of traces of " acid " impurity ( cp .

The results afford clear proof that .

Two explanations of the difference seem possible : either that the weighting has had the effect of twisting the oxygen centre or centres from which the hydrolytic attack proceeds somewhat further away from the junction at which the breakdown takes place on hydrolysis ; or that the galactose interposes what is commonly known as steric hindrance , more or less blocking the way , as it were , to the hydrolytic agent .
Unfortunately , we have no certain knowledge at present of the structure even of the biose cane-sugar , and that of derivatives such as raffinose is altogether problematic .
Cane-sugar is so different from other bioses with which it is isomeric that its constitution must be peculiar .
The most probable structural and functional formula which can be devised at present is that proposed by Emil fischei , when written in the following manner:\#151 ; ( HO)HC------CH(OH ) ( HO)HC---------CH(OH ) ( HO)H2C\#151 ; HC CH2(OH ) / -o- -CH CH\#151 ; CH(OH)\#151 ; CH2(OH ) Studies on Enzyme Action .
The two arrows are introduced to indicate the direction from which hydrolytic attack may be supposed to proceed : a molecule open to attack in such manner would , doubtless , be far less stable than one in which only a single contiguous oxygen centre serves to direct the attack .
The hydrolysis of melibiose and of raffinose by emulsin lactase will be considered in a later communication ; the hydrolysis of melibiose by acids and by melibiase will also be dealt with separately .

Emulsin has frequently been the subject of discussion in this series of studies : thus the rate at which it hydrolyses milk-sugar was considered in No. II ( vol. 73 , pp. 507 , 515 ) and its action contrasted with that of Kephir-lactase , which was shown to act more rapidly than emulsin .
In No. Ill ( vol. 73 , p. 518 ) it was pointed out that whilst Kephir-lactase is controlled by galactose and scarcely at all by glucose , emulsin is controlled by glucose gmd only to a minor extent by galactose .
These conclusions were confirmed by experiments with the methyl-glucosides and galactosides ( p. 523 ) .
In No. V ( vol. 74 , p. 188 ) the question was discussed whether emulsin proper hydrolyses milk-sugar or whether , as Bourquelot and Herissey have contended , emulsin contains a small proportion of lactase : against this assumption it wras argued that the curve was not of the form to be expected if only a small quantity of lactase were present ; that whereas Kephir-lactase was controlled by galactose alone , emulsin was most retarded by glucose and only to a slight extent by galactose , also that the curves for emulsin differed in Q 12301 " ^jac^'ose ' hydrolysis
