[ Nov. 18,1 From these it is gathered that sodium vanadate causes\#151 ; ( 1 ) A diminution of blood-pressure which is not continuous , 1 but intermits during the operation of the poison ; ( 2 ) A disappearance of respiration-curves ; ( 3 ) A diminution and irregularity of pulse , which is also intermittent .
The results are discussed and considered to be due to an action of the poison on the vaso-motor centre and on the intracardiac | nervous mechanism .
( iv ) On the function of respiration .
Subcutaneous or venous injection was again employed in the cases of seven rabbits , normal or with divided vagi .
The results show that sodium vanadate causes\#151 ; ( 1 ) A stimulation , followed by ( 2 ) A depression , of respiration , the latter being not continuous but intermittent ; they are discussed and considered to be due to an action of the poison upon the respiratory nervous centre .
( v ) On the functions of muscle and nerve .
Subcutaneous injection was employed in the nineteen experiments described , which were performed on frogs , guineapigs , and rabbits .
Tables are inserted illustrating diagrammatically the action of the salt .
The results of these experiments are found to be the same as those given under A , where the general symptoms of poisoning by sodium vanadate are enumerated ; and it is concluded , from the facts here stated , that the cause of the nervous symptoms is an action of the vanadate upon the central system of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata , and not upon nerve-trunks of peripheral terminations or upon muscle .
In the fourth section the chief results of the research are gathered up and briefly enumerated .

The Law of Fatigue .
" By the Rev. Samuel Haughton , M.D. ( Dubl .
) , D.C.L. ( Oxon .
) , F.R.S. , Fellow of Trinity College , Dublin .
Received June 21 , 1875 .
The approximate law of muscular action , which I have called the law of fatigue , is thus expressed:\#151 ; " When the same muscle ( or group of muscles ) is Icept in constant action until fatigue sets in , the total work done multiplied hy the rate of work is constant .
" The following experiments , in illustration of this law , were performed in Trinity College during the spring of the present year .
I instructed a number of medical students , chosen at random , to raise dumbbells of varying weight , one in each hand , in the tranverse plane , with hands supinated , raising and lowering the weights in equal times regulated by the beat of a pendulum .
This process was continued until 71875 .
] Rev. S. Haughton on the Law of Fatigue .
ah distress of the fatigue produced became intolerable , and the number bf times each weight was lifted was noted .
The students were required to count " one\#151 ; two " in time to the beat of the pendulum , so as to prevent ( them from counting the total number of lifts of the weight .
Professor JMacalister assisted me in these experiments ; and one of us counted the number of lifts , while the other compelled the experimenters to observe the conditions of the experiment , which were :\#151 ; 1 .
To keep time with the pendulum .
2 .
To raise the weight in the transverse plane .
3 .
To supinate the hands .
4 .
To abstain from all bending of the knees or spinal column .
The last three conditions are essential , in order to confine the work done strictly to the same muscles , which , in this case , are the acromial deltoid and supraspinatus muscles , whose average weight in the living subject is about 5*5 oz. av .
The experimenter must be carefully watched , in order to ensure the observance of these conditions ; for he is impelled instinctively and unconsciously , by pain , to bring in other muscular fibres to aid those which are suffering from the constrained and regulated motion .
If this be permitted , the law of fatigue will appear to be violated ; for of the muscular fibres actually employed in doing work , some are quite tired out and others not ; whereas the law of fatigue applies only to groups of muscles all of which are completely exhausted .
For each experiment I chose twenty students at random , using altogether about fifty different students ; and no individual was experimented upon again until an interval of forty-eight hours had elapsed .
The object of this arrangement was to avoid the effects of " training .
" In my first Table I give the mean result of twenty different students ; and in my second Table I have selected one student , set aside for the purpose , and experimented upon once a week , so as to prevent the influence of " training .
" In all cases there were three well-marked stages :\#151 ; 1 .
The work done with ease .
2 .
Accompanied by respiratory distress .
3 .
Accompanied by pain in the muscles used .
During the last stage great care must be taken to prevent changes in the posture and mode of motion , by which additional muscular fibres may come in aid of the fibres nearly fatigued .
Let W denote the total work done , and T the time of doing it ; then , by the law of fatigue , W2 as constant ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . . .
( 1 ) If tv be the weight held in the hand , and a be half the weight of the arm , and n the number of times the weights are lifted j since the time of Rev. S. Haughton on the Law of Fatigue .
[ Nov. 18 , , raising and lowering the arms is constant , n is proportional to T , and the law of fatigue gives the formula ( w-\-oCfn\#151 ; A , ... ... ... ... ... ... ( 2 ) where A is an unknown constant .
In the following Table I give the values of w and the mean value of n for twenty distinct persons .
The time of lift is in all cases one second .

These values were obtained by finding the value of a , which renders A most nearly a constant , or BA .
A minimum .
This Table gives 7 lbs. for the mean weight of the arm of all experimented on , a result which accords with the known facts .
In Table II .
I give the results obtained from a single student , as already described , each value of n being a mean of several experiments , closely concurrent .

The calculated values of n were found from equation values [ Nov. 18J ( 2 ) , using the ) a=3*9 lbs. , A=5737 , which were obtained from the principle of least variation of A , or A = minimum .
In the accompanying diagrams I. \amp ; II .
( p. 45 ) I have plotted the cubical I hyperbola represented by equation ( 2 ) , and also the several observations ] !
which lie sufficiently near the curve to justify me in considering the law I of fatigue to be a first approximation to one of the fundamental laws of I muscular action .
I have elsewhere* shown that the law of fatigue correal sponds with other experiments based on different data .
If we consider the useful worlc only , we have , from equation ( 2 ) , useful work =wn=________ ( \#166 ; w + a)2 ( 3 ) This equation represents a cuspidal cubic , whose ordinate has a maximum value , when w\#151 ; a , = half the weight of the arm .
The foregoing observations are in accordance with this deduction , as may be seen from Table III .
