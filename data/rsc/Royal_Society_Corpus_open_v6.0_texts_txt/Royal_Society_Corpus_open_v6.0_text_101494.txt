Transact N 13th E AH D A new Contrivance of Wheel-Barometer , much more easy to be prepared , than that , which is described in the Micrography ; imparted by the Author of that Book .
This is only an easy way of applying an Index to any Common Barascope , whether the Glass be only a Single Cane , or have a round Bolthead at the top .
And by the means thereof , the Variation of the Altitude of the Mercurial Cylinder , which at most is hardly three Inches , may be made as distinguishable , as if it were three Foot , or three Yards , or as much more , as is desired .
The manner hereof is visible enough by Figure I : where A BC represents the Tube , which may be either Blunt , or with a Head , as ABC ( by which latter shape , more room is allow 'd for any remainder of Air , to expand the better .
) This is to be filled with Quick-silver , and inverted as commonly ; but into a Vessel of Stagnant Mercury , made after the fashion of I K , that is , having its sides about 3 or 4 inches high , and the Cavity of it equally big both above and below ; and if it can be ( besides that part , which is filled by the end of the Mercurial Tube , that stands in it ) of equal capacity with the hollow of the Cane about B : For then the Quicksilver rising as much in the hollow of I , as it descends at B , the difference of the height in the Receiver I , will be just half the usual difference .
And if the receiving Vessel IK have a bigger Cavity , the difference will be less , but if less , the difference will be greater : But , whether the difference be hereby made bigger or less , it is no great matter , since by the contrivance of the Wheel and Index ( which is more fully described in the Preface to the Micrography ) the least variation may be made as sensible as is desired , by diminishing the bigness of the Cylinder E , and lengthening the Index F G , according to the Proportion requisite .
