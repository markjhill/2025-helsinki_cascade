IT has been shown that when narcotine is treated with hydrochloric and hydriodic acids , chloride or iodide of methyl and a series of new bases are formed homologous with narcotine , each containing CH2 less than the preceding one ; thus : Ordinary narcotine or trimethyl-nornarcotine. .

C19 H17 NO7 .
In order to gain further insight into the constitution of these bases , endeavours were made to study their decompositions under the influence of reagents known to act upon narcotine ; the unsatisfactory nature of the results thus obtained led to the trial of new reactions , the effects of which were first studied upon ordinary narcotine .
In the majority of cases the results were , however , extremely unsatisfactory , owing to the tendency of these bases to yield either tarry or humus-like uncrystallizable products .
When ordinary narcotine is treated with oxidizing agents such as binoxide of manganese and sulphuric acid , or bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid , nitric acid , or platinic chloride , it takes up an atom of oxygen and splits up into opianic acid and cotarnine ; it was hoped that under similar circumstances the new bases would undergo analogous decompositions , yielding bodies homologous with these two products ; in nearly every case , however , for the reasons above stated , the bodies produced could not be isolated in sufficient quantity and purity for examination and analysis .
Before stating the results of the few experiments , which are of a positive character , it may be as well to mention those obtained with ordinary narcotine . ?
I. Decompositions of Ordinary Narcotine .
1 .
Action of Water.-When narcotine is submitted to the action of water , either by boiling in open vessels or by heating to above 100 ?
C. in sealed tubes , it splits up into meconin and cotarnine , C22 H23 NO7 =C0o H10 04 + C12 H13 NO3 .
This reaction takes place much more readily under the latter circumstances .
Owing to the ease with which cotarnine itself is thus decomposed , it is somewhat difficult to obtain it in a sufficiently pure state for analysis ; hence , when this is the object in view , the reaction must be stopped long before the whole of the narcotine has been decomposed ; meconin , on the contrary , undergoes no change under these circumstances .
As has been previously observed , when crystallized narcotine is heated in sealed tubes together with water , it gradually disappears , yielding a slightly coloured solution ; on repeating this experiment , an oily liquid sinking to the bottom of the tube was formed , and on continuing the heat , this gradually disappeared .
This liquid , when examined , appeared to be simply a solution of unaltered narcotine in the melted meconin : no permanent gas was formed when the temperature did not rise above 160 ?
C. , but the smell of methylamine was always perceptible , and the more so the longer the time of heating ; this was found to be due to the partial decomposition of the cotarnine .
On opening a tube where all the narcotine had disappeared , the yellow liquid was found to be strongly alkaline , and on being acidified with hydrochloric acid , deposited crystals of meconin on cooling after evaporation .
The meconin from a series of tubes , when purified by successive recrystallizations , presented all the physical characters of ordinary meconin , viz. melting under boiling water , solubility in hot water alcohol , and ether , and comparative insolubility in cold water and dilute acids and alkalies , and yielded the following results on analysis , after complete desiccation at 100 ?

64 33-00 CoH 04 ** 194 100-00 To obtain the cotarnine , the acidulated liquors from which the meconin had been obtained by crystallization , or extraction with ether , were supersaturated with ammonia , which threw down the unaltered narcotine and tarry matter , and acetate of lead was added ; the filtrate from the dense precipitate of hydrated oxide and tarry matters thus produced was concentrated by evaporation over sulphuric acid after addition of a considerable quantity of caustic potash ; cotarnine was thus gradually precipitated , and was purified by solution in hydrochloric acid and reprecipitation by excess of caustic potash ; after washing until the filtrate was no longer alkaline , it was converted into platinumsalt , well washed with alcohol and ether , and dried over sulphuric acid .

16-0 23-2 22-9 Owing to its easy decomposition , the quantity of cotarnine found was much less than the amount of meconin simultaneously produced ; the products of its decomposition could not be isolated .
Narcotine boiled per ascensunu with water for fourteen hours did not perceptibly alter in bulk or appearance ; the aqueous liquor on concentration deposited crystals of meconin , recognized by their physical characters .
This splitting up of narcotine under the influence of heated water may explain the occurrence of meconin in opium and opium-residues , as probably the small amount of meconin always found is simply due to the partial decomposition of the narcotine during the processes of extraction of morphia .
As narcotine is considerably more soluble in alcohol than in water , it was thought that the decomposition in sealed tubes with the former reagent might take place more readily than with the lattet ; in two comparative experiments , however , the reaction was found to occur more readily with water than with weak alcohol .
The addition of a small amount of caustic potash to the water used in the sealed-tube experiments did not appreciably modify the result , saving that rather more methylamine was produced .
Boiling with dilute potash even for twenty hours was not found to produce any meconin ( or opianic acid ) ; the potash liquor , however , was found to have dissolved a considerable quantity of unaltered narcotine ; under ordinary circumstances narcotine is almost absolutely insoluble in potash solution .
2 .
Action of Heat.-As formerly observed , when narcotine is heated to temperatures short of 180 ?
, no action is perceptible beyond a slight yellowish coloration ; at about 210 ?
it swells up , emitting a fragrant odour and combustible gases , and leaving a pasty carbonaceous mass .
A portion of narcotine was cautiously heated to 205 ?
-208 ?
, and the heat withdrawn when the decomposition was just commencing ; on extracting the mass with hot water , a liquor was obtained from which meconin crystallized out on cooling , identified by its peculiar physical characteristics ; the other products of decomposition could not be isolated .
3 .
Action of Perric Chloride.--When hydrochlorate of narcotine is heated with a moderately concentrated solution of ferric chloride , the latter is reduced and a considerable quantitity of opianic acid formed : to convert the whole of the narcotine employed , several days ' successive ebullition is necessary , the opianic acid obtained being thus approximately equal to the theoretical amount ; thus in two experiments the opianic acid obtained ( partly by crystallization , partly by extraction with ether ) amounted to 48 and 47 per cent. of the narcotine employed , the theoretical yield being 50-8 per cent. This acid possessed all the properties of opianic acid .
After purification by successive recrystallizations , it gave the following numbers on analysis : I. 0'4410 grm. , dried at 100 ?

Decomposition of the Narcotine Bases .
1 .
Dimethiyl-Nornarcotine.-As narcotine under the influence of heat and water has been shown to split up into meconin and cotarnine , it appears probable that this base under the same circumstances would split , either into methyl-normeconin and cotarnine , or into ordinary meconin and a body containing CH2 less than cotarnine ( i. e. cotarnimide ) .

C19 H15 ( CH3)2 NO7 C8 H4 ( CH3)2 04 + C , , HIl NO3 On heating the base with water in sealed tubes , there were produced small quantities of a body having the characteristic property of methyl-normeconin and methyl-noropianic acid , viz. of yielding a blue colour with ferric salts , becoming light red with ammonia ; but however the conditions of the experiment were varied , the yield of this substance was too small ( even from moderately large quantities of base ) for analysis and investigation .
The action of certain oxidizing agents also , tends to prove that the former of the two last reactions takes place .
The action of ferric chloride on narcotine has been shown to be Narcotine .
Opianic acid .
Cotarnine .
C19 H14 ( CH3)3 NO7 +0=C H4 ( CH3)2 05 + C11 Hlo ( CH3 ) NO3 .
( BLITHE has also obtained the same reaction with platinic chloride .
) Hydrochlorate of dimethyl-nornarcotine , boiled with either ferric or platinic chloride for many hours , gives rise to the production of methyl-noropianic acid and cotarnine , not of opianic acid and cotarnimide .

The yield of methyl-noropianic acid by either process is much less than the theoretical amount , probably from a secondary decomposition ; it may be obtained from the iron or platinum liquors by simple extraction with ether and purification by recrystallization from water ; if undecomposed narcotine is present in the base , opianic acid is likewise produced , and the two may be separated by fractional crystallization , the latter being much less soluble in cold water than the methyl-noropianic acid .
A portion thus purified presented the physical characters of methyl-noropianic acid obtained by the action of hydrochloric on opianic acid , and gave the same reactions with ferric solutions : it contained no water of crystallization , and after drying at 1000 , yielded the following numbers on analysis : I. was made with a specimen prepared by the action of ferric chloride ; IL and III .

196 100-00 All attempts to procure the cotarnine formed in sufficient quantity and purity for analysis were fruitless .
No other means of oxidation or decomposition tried were successful ; the above reactions , however , tend to show that dimethyl-nornarcotine is derived from narcotine by the substitution of H for CH3 in the meconin radical , and not in the cotarnine , its rational formula being as follows , that of narcotine being* Narcotine .

Hence either of the two following reactions with heated water might be anticipated Monomethyl-nornarcotine .

On trying the experiment it was found impossible to obtain anything but tarry masses : the fact that methyl-normeconin was not obtained would tend to show that the former reaction takes place , the normeconin immediately becoming decomposed ; the cotarnine , however , could not be got sufficiently free from tar for analysis .
Similarly , with oxidizing agents either of the following reactions appears probable : Monomethyl-nornarcotine .
Noropianic acid .
Cotarnine .
C,1 H16 ( CH3 ) NO7 +0 C8 H6 0 , + Cl1 Ho , ( C H3 ) NO3 , or Methyl-noropianic acid .
Cotarnimide .
C19 H16 ( CH3 ) NO7 +O C8 H5 ( CH3 ) 05 + Cl1 HI NO3 , The non-oxidizing agents , and ferric chloride , only gave rise to the formation of tarry masses ; but on boiling platinic chloride with hydrochlorate of monomethyl-nornarcotine , and extracting the liquor with ether , there was obtained a body which it was found impossible to obtain in a state of sufficient purity for analysis owing to its instability ; it had an acid reaction , was very soluble in water , ether , and alcohol , but could be obtainable only as a tarry granular mass from any of these solvents ; it gave only a very slight purplish coloration with ferric salts .
Since its reactions , therefore , did not all correspond with those of methyl-noropianic acid , it appears probable that it was the noropianic acid formed according to the first of these two equations .
These results point to the constitution of methyl-nornarcotine as being narcotine , where H2 replace ( CH3)2 in the meconin radical ; or , as before , Narcotine .

Cotarnine.-When narcotine is oxidized by sulphuric acid and binoxide of manganese , and the resulting opianic acid separated by crystallization , and the manganese and cotarnine ultimately precipitated by excess of carbonate of sodium , on leaving the alkaline filtrate to spontaneous evaporation , long needle-shaped crystals of an inch or more in length occasionally form ; these dissolve readily in alcohol , but only come out of the alcoholic solution as globules of oil and not as ' crystals .
These crystals , after drying on blotting-paper , were found to lose 4'16 per cent. of water at 100 ?
; having previously melted , the analyses of the residue led to the conclusion that these crystals were simply cotarnine with half a molecule of water of crystallization , C12 H13 NO3 + H2 O , this formula requiring 3-95 per cent. of loss at 100 ? .
Converted into platinum-salt , these crystals gave 23*08 and 23*00 per cent. of platinum ; the cotarnine-salt requires theoretically 23*18 per cent. All attempts to get oxidation products with certainty from cotarnine by various agents have failed ; once only was cotarnic acid obtained by the action of dilute nitric acid ( Part I. Phil. Trans. for 1863 , p. 359 ) .
When cotarnine is evaporated with strong nitric acid on the water-bath to dryness , apophyllic acid was always found in the residue ; the product , however , was always very small .
Miscellaneous Observations on Opianic Acid , Meconin , and Hemipinic Acid .
1 .
Opianic Acid.-When opianic acid is treated with bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid in a dilute solution , hemipinic acid is formed , which may be obtained by extraction with ether , and may be separated from unaltered opianic acid by crystallization .
In one experiment the water of crystallization was determined , and the purified acid converted into silver-salt .

C. ) loses moisture ; the residue left is insoluble in cold water and dilute alkalies , but slowly dissolves on boiling , yielding opianates ; it is nearly insoluble in cold alcohol , but little soluble in boiling alcohol ; from a hot solution it separates on cooling in small shining crystals .
These , when analyzed , led to the formula C40 138 019 , being apparently formed thus : 4(C10 Ho 05O ) = H20 + C40 H38 019 .
The loss of weight on heating also confirms this reaction .
2 .
Ieconin.-Meconin is apparently unaffected by heating in presence of water under pressure .
Attempts to oxidize it by the following reagents all yielded negative results , however the conditions of the experiment were varied : Binoxide of manganese or bichromate of potassium and sulphuric acid .
Permanganate of potassium , in acid and alkaline solutions .
Binoxide of barium alone and with sulphuric acid .
Ferric and platinic chlorides , &amp;c. The action of nitrous acid gas on fused meconin gave rise only to the formation of nitro-meconin , which , when purified by recrytallization , gave the following numbers on analysis .

p. 82 ) .
Thus it was found to be almost insoluble in cold water , and only slightly soluble in boiling water , alcohol , ether , ammonia , potash , and soda ; acids caused no alteration in the alkaline solution ; aqueous and alcoholic solutions were not changed by ferrous , ferric , or cupric solutions : Instead of : soluble in water , alcohol , and ether ; very soluble in ammonia and alkalies , producing a red coloration ; precipitable by acids from alkaline solution ; its solutions yielding a precipitate with salts of iron and copper .
Attempts to form dinitromeconin were fruitless .
Addition of sodium to fused meconin causes a copious evolution of hydrogen .
The resulting compound when put into water reforms meconin and caustic soda .
3 .
Heminpinic Acid.-When hemipinic acid , dried at 100 ?
, is heated , it melts at about 175 ?
, and if kept at that temperature loses water ; at higher temperatures the mass becomes slightly coloured , and at about 300 ?

As formerly observed , ethyl-hemipinic acid may likewise be formed by passing dried hydrochloric acid gas into a solution of hemipinic acid ( dried at 100 ?
) in absolute alcohol ; the substances prepared by these two methods are identicalin physical properties , each having a strong tendency to separate from a hot aqueous solution on cooling in oily drops , and sometimes in feathery crystals containing half a molecule of water of crystallization .

Conclusion.-It may be as well to sum up as briefly as possible what has been done in the four portions of this research .
1st .
It has been proved , from the analyses of various samples of narcotine derived from various sources , that narcotine has always the same composition , viz. C22 H23 NO7 ( Part 1 .
p. 346 ) .
2nd .
As stated by former observers , narcotine under the influence of oxidizing agents splits up into opianic acid and cotarnine .
C22 H23 N07 +O C1 H1o 00 + C12 H13 NO3 .
3rd .
When heated a long time with water , or per se at 200 ?
, narcotine splits up into meconin and cotarnine ( Part IV .
p. 667 ) .
C22 H23 NO7 = C,1 Hlo 04 + C12 H13 NO3 .
4th .
When narcotine is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid for a short time ( about two hours ) , chloride of methyl is formed , and one atom of H substituted for one of CH3 in the narcotine ; if heated for a long time ( some days ) , two atoms of H are substituted for two of CH3 ; when heated with fuming hydriodic acid , iodide of methyl is formed in such quantities as proves that three atoms of H are substituted for three of CH3 .
A series of homologous bases is thus formed ( Rational formulae , Part IV .
) , whose decompositions are analogous to those of narcotine .
5th .
Cotarnine has been shown to have the formula C12 H13 NO3 , and not C13 H13 NO3 , and is capable of crystallizing with half a molecule , or with a whole molecule of water ( Part I. p. 349 , and Part IV .
p. 673 ) .
6th .
When cotarnine is heated with dilute nitric acid , under certain not clearly understood conditions , cotarnic acid is produced together with methylamine , C12 H13 NO3 + 2H2 O= Cll H12 0+ C3 HI N ; with strong nitric acid , as stated by previous observers , apophyllic acid is produced ; other oxidizing agents give no definite results ( Part I. p. 359 , and Part IV .
p. 673 ) .
7th .
When cotarnline is heated with strong hydrochloric acid , chloride of methyl is formed and hydrochlorate of cotarnamic acid , C12 H13 NO3 + H2 + 2H Cl CH3 Cl + Cll H13 NO4 , H Cl. Hydriodic acid produces a similar reaction , only one equivalent of CH113 being eliminated for one of cotarnine ( Part I. p. 360 ) .
8th .
Opianic acid treated with bichromate of potassium and dilute sulphuric acid becomes oxidized to liemipinic acid ( Part IV .
p. 673 ) , GC , H1l 05 +O= Clo HIl 069th .
Opianic acid under the influence of nascent hydrogen ( as with sodium-amalgam or zinc and sulphuric acid ) is reduced to meconin ( Part I. p. 354 ) .
C10 HO 05 + H2 = CIo H10 04 + H2 0 .
10th .
Opianic acid heated with caustic potash splits up into meconin and hemipinic acid ( Part I. p. 352 ) .
2 C0o H1o 05 = C1o I1 04 + C1 HIo 06 .
11th .
When opianic acid is heated with excess of hydrochloric acid , chloride of methyl is formed , and hydrogen substituted for methyl in the opianic acid : it appears probable that two distinct substances are thus produced , noropianic acid and methyl-noropianic acid the former by substitution of H2 for ( CH3)2 , and the latter of H for CH03 ; only the latter has been isolated in a pure state , the former decomposing spontaneously , CIo Hlo 0s +2 HC1 = C8 H6 05 + 2CH3 C1 , C10 o 05 + HC1 =-C H8 05 + CH3 C1 .
Hydriodic acid apparently produces similar decompositions .
; like opianic acid , methylnoropianic acid is monobasic ( Part II .
p. 657 ) .
12th .
All experiments to oxidize meconin to opianic or hemipinic acids or any other product have proved failures .
13th .
Meconin treated with excess of hydrochloric or hydriodic acid forms chloride or iodide of methyl , and a body derived from meconin by substitution of H for CH .
( methylnormeconin ) : C0o H1 04 -+ HC1 =C H8 04 + CH3 C1 .
Attempts to substitute H2 for ( CH3)2 did not yield anything capable of isolation in a pure state ( Part II .
p. 660 ) .
14th .
Hemipinic acid treated with reducing agents has in no case been reduced to opianic acid or meconin ; nor have experiments to form opianic acid by the union of hemipinic acid and meconin proved successful ; nor has hemipinic acid been oxidized to any other compound .
15th .
When hemipinic acid is heated with excess of strong hydrochloric acid , chloride of methyl and carbonic acid are formed , and a new acid , methyl-hypogallic acid , in accordance with the following equation : Clo Hl 06 + HC1 = CH3 C1 + C02 + Cs H8 04 .
When heated with hydriodic acid , hypogallic acid is formed , together with iodide of methyl and carbonic acid , Cl0 H106 21 2C C0 + -2CH3 + CO +C 04 ( Part II .
