] The following experiment is so complete in itself that no apology is offered for publishing it by itself .
In 1903 the Sleeping Sickness Commission of the Royal Society came to the conclusion that the carrying of infection from a sleeping sickness patient to a healthy person by the Glossina palpalis was a mechanical act , and required no previous development of the parasite within the fly .
The Commission also held that the power of transferring the disease was lost to the fly 48 hours after it had fed on an infected person .
Koch and Stuhlmann , in German East Africa , described developing forms in Glossina , but did not succeed in infecting healthy animals by the injection of these forms .
Kleine , in German East Africa , at the end of 1908 , succeeded first in showing that Glossina palpalis could convey Trypanosoma hrucei some 50 days after the fly had fed on an infected animal .
It seems , at first , strange that this fact should have escaped notice for 15 years , and can only be accounted for by assuming that it is an event of the rarest for a fly to be found which fulfils the unknown conditions necessary for the development of the trypanosomes in its interior .
If we assume that it is only one fly in a hundred or in a thousand in which this VOL. LXXXI.\#151 ; B. 2 H 406 Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .
Development of [ July 5 , development takes place , then the difficulty of observing the phenomenon can be understood .

242 ** 99 30 11 56 99 232a \gt ; \gt ; 99 50 15 34 99 These experiments seemed to show that if flies caught in a highly infected district , into which a horse could not he taken even for a few hours without contracting nagana , are kept without food for a few days\#151 ; say three to five\#151 ; they are then incapable of conveying infection .
This appeared to be a strong proof that the duration of infectivity in the fly was a short one , since , if this were not the case , 1 of the 85 flies ought to have been in a condition capable of infecting , having , of course , been infected at some previous date in the " fly country .
" It may be repeated , that these flies were caught in a most highly infected district , so that if Glossina morsitans can remain infective for 50 or 60 days , 1 at least of the 85 ought to have been in the condition which made it capable of conveying the disease .
This development of the trypanosomes in the fly is strikingly like what occurs in the test-tube with Novy 's medium .
A thousand tubes are inoculated with Trypanosoma brucei : the trypanosomes all appear to die off , but 20 days afterwards a peculiarly resistant individual is found in one tube of the thousand , who has adapted himself to the new enviroment , and soon multiplies into myriads .
What it is which enables this particular individual to adapt itself to such altered conditions is unknown .
It is the merest speculation to call it a sexual act and pick stout forms as females and slender forms as males .
Again , because this late development of the trypanosomes enables a particular fly to remain infective for 100 days , or even possibly for the remainder of its life , it by no means follows that this is the usual method of infection .
The mechanical transference of the disease is proved up to the hilt , and for every case which falls a victim to the rare late-infected fly , a thousand must be infected by direct mechanical transference .
Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis .
Summary of the Experiment which forms the Subject of this Paper .
Before describing at length the experiment which forms the subject of this paper , we may summarise it as follows:\#151 ; 1 .
On March 5 , 1909 , 60 Glossince palpalis caught on the lake shore were placed in two cages , 30 in each .
The flies were fed on two infected monkeys for 2 days .
They were then starved for 72 hours to get rid of mechanical transference .
The following 5 days they were placed on a healthy monkey , and every successive period of 5 days , or thereabouts , on a fresh monkey , up to 86 days , when the experiment came to an end .
The result was , that the first two monkeys remained healthy , but that all the following monkeys , up to 75 days , became infected with Trypanosoma gambiense .
2 .
If 7 days be deducted for the incubation period , then the flies first became infected 18 days after their first feed on an infected animal .
3 .
There is some evidence that among the 60 flies only 1 was infective .
Eifty-four days after the beginning of the experiment each cage was placed on a separate monkey .
Up to that time both the cages of flies had been fed on the same animal .
Cage A contained , after 54 days , 11 flies .
Cage B , 4 flies .
Cage A continued to infect monkeys for 21 days more , making a total of 75 days .
Cage B did not infect .
Again , as was natural , the flies gradually died off during the experiment , and as each fly died it was carefully dissected and examined for trypanosomes .
Not a single trypanosome of any kind whatever was seen in any dissected fly up to 75 days , when a fly died in Cage A which was found to be swarming with trypanosomes similar to Trypanosoma gambiense .
After the death of this fly , Cage A ceased to be infective , and when the experiment was stopped ' the remaining flies were killed off and dissected , but among them not a sign of a trypanosome could be seen .
In the same way the flies remaining in the non-infective Cage B were examined , with a similar negative result .
4 .
Here follows an interesting and unique observation .
A tiny drop of fluid taken from the gut of the 75-day fly injected under the skin of a monkey gave rise to Sleeping Sickness after an incubation period of eight days .
This , so far as we are aware , is the first time this has been recorded .
5 .
It will be seen from the detailed experiment that the flies were starved for three days between several of the experiments .
This , of course , was to get rid of the fallacy of mechanical transference .
6 .
It may be said that perhaps these monkeys became infected by some other means than the flies in the cage\#151 ; for example , by other biting flies , or by contact .
To this it may be answered that there are more than 200 2 h 2 408 Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .

They are all examined twice a week , but during the last eight months not a single case of accidental infection has taken place .

Experiment 663 .
To ascertain if development of Trypanosoma takes place in the interior of Glossina palpalis , and if so , how long does the fly remain infective .
March 5 , 1909.\#151 ; Two batches of Glossina palpalis caught on the Lake shore , consisting of 30 flies in each batch , were fed on monkeys , Experiments 568 and 214 , whose blood contained numbers of Trypanosoma gambiense .
March 6.\#151 ; The flies again fed as on the 5th , to ensure that as many as possible should get a feed of the infected blood .
Nearly all the flies fed on one or other occasion .
The flies are kept in a moist atmosphere at 22 ' C. The following table gives the principal details of the experiment:\#151 ; Table II .

Development of [ July 5 , Remarks on the Experiment .
Everyone will agree that this is a most interesting experiment .
It is evident that a single infected fly did all the mischief , and by good luck this fly was detected .
Captain A. E. Hamerton , D.S.O. , had charge of the experiment at first , and on his leaving Mpumu about the beginning of May , it fell to Sergeant A. Gibbons , Eoyal Army Medical Corps .
Both are to be congratulated on the results , which are the outcome of care and thoroughness .
Captain F. P. Mackie had the good fortune to dissect the fly which did the injury , and which will be fully described later .
Incubation Period .
From the experiment may be drawn the incubation period in monkeys bitten by a late-infected fly .
It is remarkable how regular this is in those monkeys which gave a positive result .
This shows how very infective Fly 866 was .
Apparently each time it bit it infected .
The following table gives the period of incubation in each case :\#151 ; Table III .

It would therefore appear that Fly 866 probably infected each animal on the first day it bit it , showing how dangerous such an infected fly is .

] Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis .
Description of the G-lossina palpalis , Fly 866 , which was dissected 75 Days after having fed on a Monkey whose Blood contained Trypanosoma gambiense .
Experiment 866 .
May 19 , 1909.\#151 ; Dissected a Glossina palpalis , which was found dead to-day in Cage A of Experiment 663 .
On removing the viscera by the usual method , the mid-gut was seen to be of a pale salmon-pink .
A small quantity of its contents , examined in the fresh condition , was found to contain enormous numbers of trypanosomes .
The tube of this part of the intestine was absolutely crammed with active , seething masses of these flagellates .
In regard to the other parts of the fly , nothing was seen in the proboscis .
In the proventriculus one trypanosome only was found .
The salivary glands contained large numbers of altered-looking trypanosomes , the fore-gut many large stout forms , with bright granules .
The crop was empty and showed nothing .
The Malpighian tubules , hind-gut , and proctodaeum also were drawn blank .
In addition to examining these organs in the fresh condition , smears were made and stained .
The examination of these stained specimens gave the following results:\#151 ; The salivary glands.\#151 ; These had been carefully removed before the intestine was opened , and therefore had no chance of being fouled .
As will be seen from the coloured drawing ( Plate 10 , fig. 1 ) , the trypanosomes found in these glands differed from those seen in the -intestine .
The bodies are very irregular in shape , and contain , besides a reddish-stained nucleus , dark deeply-stained coarse chromatin granules .
The other cell contents remain unstained .
Free chromatin granules and flagella are to be seen scattered over the field .
Sometimes the bodies are definitely pear-shaped , with a flagellum coming from the narrow end , and rarely a more definite trypanosome shape can b seen ; but never a true trypanosome .
[ It is a matter of deep regret that an inoculation experiment was not made with an emulsion of part of the salivary glands .
] The fore-gut.\#151 ; The fore-gut contained many trypanosomes .
The cytoplasm stains a pale blue , and the nucleus a reddish-purple .
The micronucleus is not distinctly seen in some of the trypanosomes , but when it is , it is always distinctly posterior to the nucleus .
The protoplasm contains many coarse darkly-stained chromatin granules .
The undulating membrane is less marked than in the normal blood trypanosome , and the flagellum , which usually springs from a micronucleus-like body , is less deeply stained ( Plate 11 , figs. 6\#151 ; 13 ) .
412 Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .
Development of [ July 5 , The mid-gut.\#151 ; The mid-gut contained innumerable trypanosomes of the gambiense type .
Some are dividing , and all have a well-marked nucleus and micronucleus , the latter at or near the posterior extremity .
The protoplasm contains many chromatin granules , and an undulating membrane and flagellum are present ( Plate 10 , figs. 6\#151 ; 16 ) .
Many groups , or rosettes , composed of 15 to 20 individuals , occur , the flagella pointing outwards ( Plate 11 , fig. 1 ) .
The proboscis , proventriculm , thoracic gut , crop , hind-gut , and Malpighian tubes contained no trypanosomes .
The most interesting thing in this description of the examination of Fly 866 is the condition of the salivary glands .
How these trypanosomelike bodies , or derivatives of trypanosomes , got into them is a mystery , and we will content ourselves at present with merely placing the * bare fact on record until the salivary glands of similarly infected flies are examined .
There is one fallacy which might be pointed out .
It is assumed that Fly 866 became infected on the first or second day of the experiment .
It is possible that it became infected when feeding on the fifth day on an animal which showed trypanosomes in its blood a day or two later .
This , however , is unlikely , as no other fly showed trypanosomes on dissection .
In order to make the story more complete , on Plate 10 , figs. 1\#151 ; 5 , is represented the Trypanosoma gambiense from the blood of one of the monkeys on which the flies were fed at the beginning of the experiment , and on Plate 11 , figs. 2\#151 ; 5 , are shown Trypanosoma gambiense from the monkey which became infected from the contents of the mid-gut of Fly 866 .
Proportion of Infected Flies to Non-Infected in Nature .
In the experiment under consideration it is seen that , in artificially-infected flies , only 1 in 60 showed the phenomenon of late infectivity .
In nature the proportion must be less , as many of the flies , in many places at least , can never have fed on an 'animal whose blood contained Trypanosoma gambiense .
That there can be but few under natural conditions Table IV shows .
The table is made by subtracting the flies fed on the animal during the last seven days , before trypanosomes were found in the blood , this being the incubation period , from the total number .
The experiments consist in catching tsetse flies in the infected area , bringing them to the laboratory and placing them straightway on healthy animals .
The first two experiments were made with Trypanosoma brucei and Glossina morsitans , and it would appear from them that 104 and 108 flies 1909 .

were used respectively before an infective one was found .
This perhaps explains why Bruce 's 85 flies failed to infect .
In the experiments with Trypanosoma gambiense and Glossina palpalis the average is 2-5 per thousand .
It is , of course , impossible to tell how many of these positive experiments were infected by mechanical transference or by a late-infective fly ; but , in any case , the proportion is small .
If this were not so , all the native population of the Lake shore , and most of the Europeans in Uganda , would long ago have been blotted out .

A Note on the Occurrence of Trypanosome in the African Elephant .

[ Plate 12 .
] As trypanosomes have never been reported as having been observed in the blood of the African Elephant , the Commission thought it would be of interest to note this observation .
In Laveran and Mesnil 's book on trypanosomes , translated by Nabarro , on p. 261 it is stated that " the occurrence of Surra ( evansi ) in elephants in India and Burmah is practically proved .
In this connection we have only the statement of G. H. Evans that , in 1893 , 14 out of '32 elephants died of the disease in Burmah .
" The year 1893 is almost prehistoric for trypanosomes .
At that time observers had even failed to distinguish between the common rat trypanosome\#151 ; Trypanosoma lewisi\#151 ; and that of Surra .
It may well be , then , that Evans was mistaken in his diagnosis of the species causing this large mortality in elephants .
The African elephant , in whose blood this trypanosome was found , was Roy .
