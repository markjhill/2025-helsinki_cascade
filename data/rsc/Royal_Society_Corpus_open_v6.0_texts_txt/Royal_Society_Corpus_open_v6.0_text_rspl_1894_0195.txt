128 The Root of Lyginodendron Oldhamium , Will .
[ May 31 , the water value gives an expression for the sensitiveness of the instrument .
In Table VI the particulars of several air thermometers which I have had made are given .
As they are made of lead glass , both the density and the capacity for heat are higher than in the case of German glass .

Received March 14 , 1894 .
During a re-investigation of the structure of the results of which we hope to lay before the Royal Society on a future occasion , an important fact has come to light , which we desire to place on record without delay .
A carboniferous fossil , with the structure perfectly preserved , has been described in previous memoirs , under the name of Hooheri , Will.f We have now established the fact that Kaloxylon was not an independent plant , but was the root of Lyginodendron Oldhamiiom .
Specimens , presenting in every respect the typical Kaloxylon structure , have been found in actual continuity with the stem of Lyginodendron , arising from it as lateral appendages .
Their structure and mode of origin prove that they were adventitious roots .
These organs branched freely , and we have roots and rootlets of all sizes , and at all stages of development .
This discovery enables us to give a complete account of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron , as we are now fully acquainted with the structure , not only of the stem and foliage , but also of the adventitious roots .
