210 Messrs. Warren De La Hue , Stewart , and Loewy [ Mar. 1^ ( 5 ) It appears not improbable that codeia and morphia may contain in their molecules benzene residues .
Schiff has pointed out* that phenols give colorations with ferric chloride , whereas the corresponding ethers or anisols do not do so ; the well-known distinction between morphia and codeia in this respect , therefore , gives some support to the idea that both may be benzene derivatives .

On the Physiological Action of some of the foregoing Derivatives .
By Reginald Stocker , 31.B .
, Pathologist in St. Mary s Hospital 31edical School .
Doses of 1 decigramme of the compound CesH811 N4O10 , 4HI from codeia , and of the similar compound from morphia , were given to an adult terrier by the mouth without producing any perceptible effect whatever ; when the dose was increased to 3 decigrammes , in each case repeated defsecation in the course of a few hours was produced , the stools being more loose than ordinarily and frequently of a dark greenish colour ; no other symptom was noticeable , and no appreciable difference in the action of the two compounds was perceptible .
Doses of 5 decigrammes of the compound CC8 H8212N4 O10 , 4III from each of these sources were given to the same dog by the mouth , with the result of producing similar repeated defsecation in the course of two or three hours ; the sole difference discernible between these and the former experiments being that the effect was produced somewhat sooner and was of longer continuance in the latter cases , a result probably pro-duced solely by the larger dose .
No material differences were observed between the codeia and morphia derivative .
The same dog was employed throughout , two or three days being allowed to intervene between each experiment , so that the animal had recovered from the effects of a former dose before the administration of another .
t 1 It would hence appear that the derivatives of polymerized C1tII211nU3 are less active than those of polymerized Cl7H19 N03 ; and also that there is no reason for considering the derivatives from codeia as different from those of morphia , the corresponding bodies having respectively the same quantitative composition and the same physical , chemical , and phy siological properties .

211 grounds for believing that the behaviour of sun-spots with regard to increase and diminution , as they pass across the sun 's visible disk , is not altogether of an arbitrary nature .
From the information which we then had , we were led to think that during a period of several months sun-spots will on the whole attain their minimum of size at the centre of the disk ; they will then alter their behaviour so as on the whole to diminish during the whole time of their passage across the disk ; thirdly , their behaviour will be such that they reach a maximum at the centre ; and , lastly , they will be found to increase in size during their whole passage across the disk .
These various types of behaviour appeared to us always to follow one another in the above order ; and in a paper printed for private circulation in 1866 , we discussed the matter at considerable length , after having carefully measured the area of each of the groups observed by Carrington , in order to increase the accuracy of our results .
In this paper we obtained nineteen or twenty months as the approximate value of the period of recurrence of the same behaviour .
2 .
A recurrence of this kind is rather a deduction from observations more or less probable than an hypothesis ; nevertheless , it appeared to us to connect itself at once with an hypothesis regarding sun-spot activity .
" The average size of a spot " ( we remarked ) " would appear to attain its maximum on that side of the sun which is turned away from Yenus , and to have its minimum in the neighbourhood of this planet .
" In venturing a remark of this nature , we were aware it might be said " How can a comparatively small body like one of the planets so far away from the sun cause such enormous disturbances on the sun 's surface as we know sunspots to be ?
" It ought , however , we think , to be borne in mind that in sun-spots we have , as a matter of fact , a set of phenomena curiously restricted to certain solar latitudes , within which , however , they vary according to some complicated periodical law , and presenting also periodical variations in their frequency of a strangely complicated nature .
Now these phenomena must either be caused by something within the sun 's surface , or by something without it .
But if we cannot easily imagine bodies so distant as the planets to produce such large effects , we have equal difficulty in imagining any thing beneath the sun 's surface that could give rise to phenomena of such a complicated periodicity .
Nevertheless , as we have remarked , sun-spots do exist , and obey complicated laws , whether they be caused by something within or something without the sun .
Under these circumstances , it does not appear to us unphilosophical to see whether as a matter of fact the behaviour of sun-spots has any reference to planetary positions .
There likewise appears to be this advantage in establishing a connexion of any kind between the behaviour of sun-spots and the positions of some one prominent planet , that we at once expect a similar result in the case of another planet of nearly equal prominence , and are thus led to use our idea as a working hypothesis .
3 .
We have now a larger number of observations at our disposal than we 212 Messrs. Warren De La Hue , Stewart , and Loewy [ Mar. 1^ had in 1866 .
We had then only the groups observed by Carrington , the positions and areas of all of which we had accurately measured .
We have now in addition five years of the Kew observations , for each group 0f which the positions and areas have been recorded by us in our previous communications to this Society .
We have thus altogether observations extending from the beginning of 1854 to the end of 1860 , forming the series of Carrington ; and observations extending from the beginning 0f 1862 to the end of 1866 , forming the Kew series , as far as this is yet reduced .
We have , in fact , altogether a nearly continuous series , beginning a year or two before one minimum , and extending to the next , and thus embracing rather more than a whole period .
We propose in the following pages to discuss the behaviour with regard to size of the various groups of these two series , as each group passes from left to right across the sun 's visible disk .
Unfortunately for this purpose , a large number of groups has to be rejected ; for , on account of bad weather , we have frequent blank days , during which the sun cannot be seen , and on this account we cannot tell with sufficient accuracy the behaviour of many groups as they pass across the disk .
In our catalogue of sun-spot behaviour we have only retained those groups for which , making the times abscissae , and the areas ordinates , we had sufficiently frequent observations to enable us to construct a reasonably accurate curve exhibiting the area of the group for each point of its passage across the disk .
From these curves a Table was then formed denoting the probable area of each non-rejected group at the following heliographic longitudes ( that of the visible centre of the disk being reckoned as zero ) :\#151 ; \#151 ; 63 ' \#151 ; 49'\#151 ; 35'\#151 ; 21'\#151 ; 7'+7'+ 21'+35'+49'+ 63 ' ; in fact giving the area of the group for the ten central days of its progress , and rejecting those observations that were too near the sun 's border on either side , on account of the uncertainty of measurement of such observations .
We have succeeded in tabulating in this manner 421 groups of Carrington 's series , and 373 groups of the Kew series up to the end of 1866 , in all 794 groups .
In this catalogue the area is that of the whole spot , including umbra and penumbra ; and in measuring these areas a correction for foreshortening has always been made , as described in a paper which we presented to this Society , and which constitutes the first series of our researches .
These areas are expressed in millionths of the sun 's visible hemisphere .
4 .
When we began this present investigation into the behaviour of spots , we soon found reason to conclude that in the case of sun-spots the usual formula for foreshortening is not strictly correct .
Perhaps if a sun-spot were strictly a surface-phenomenon , the usual formula might be correct , though even that is doubtful ; for the earth as a planet may not impossibly affect the behaviour of all spots as they cross the disk , so as to render the formula somewhat inexact .
However this may be , a spot is probably always surrounded more or less by faculous matter , forming in many cases on Planetary Influence upon Solar Activity .
1872 .
] a sort of cylindrical wall round the spot .
Now the effect of such a wall would be to allow the whole spot to be seen when at or near the centre of the disk , but to hide part of the spot as it approached the border on either side .
A spot thus affected would therefore appear to be more diminished by foreshortening than the usual formula would indicate ; and we should therefore expect , if this were the case , that , on the whole , and after making the usual allowance for foreshortening , spots would nevertheless be found deficient in area near the borders as compared with their area at the centre 1 of the disk .
As a matter of fact we have something of this kind , as will be seen from the following Table , in which we have used the whole body of spots forming the catalogue to which we have made allusion .
In this Table the first column denotes the heliocentric longitude from the centre j of the disk reckoned as zero ; the second denotes the united areas at the I various longitudes of all those groups from both series , the behaviour of !
which we have been able to obtain with accuracy ; while the third column l exhibits the residual factor for foreshortening , which will bring the areas of t the second column into equality with each other .

From the above Table it appears that the average behaviour of spots , as far as can be judged from the information at present attainable , is not quite symmetrical as regards the centre of the disk .
Without attempting at present to enter into an explanation of this remarkable phenomenon , we may point to it as a confirmation of our view previously stated , that most spots are accompanied by a wall-shaped surrounding of facula .
Observations show that on the whole the life-history of the facula begins and ends earlier than that of the spot which it surrounds , and that throughout a gradual subsidence or dissipation of this elevated mural appendage seems to be taking place .
But such a diminution of the wall discloses more of the spot itself ; and hence the spot-areas measured in the eastern half of the hemisphere VOL. XX .
R 214 Messrs. Warren De La Hue , Stewart , Loewy [ Mar.l^ might be presumed , ccetens paribus , to be smaller than those observed in the western half , a fact strikingly demonstrated by the above Table .
Our present object , however , is not to account foi the average behaviour of spots , hut rather to investigate the causes or concomitants of a de .
parture from this average behaviour .
We have therefore in all cases made use of the factors given in the above Table as those which , judging by the average behaviour , tend to equalize the areas that pass the various Ion-gitudes , We have called this earth-corr and have limited our dis-cussion to any well " marked behaviour that remains after the earth-correction has been applied .
6 .
Let us now divide the whole mass of observations into four portions , depending upon the position of the planet Venus with reference to the Earth or point of view .
First , let us take each occasion on which the planet is in the same heliographic longitude as the Earth , that is to say , when the Earth and Venus are nearly in a line on the same side of the sun .
Let us use five months ' observations for each such occasion , extending equally on both sides of it ; thus , for instance , if the planet Venus and the Earth had the same heliocentric longitude on September 30,1855 , we should make use of sun-spots from the middle of July to the middle of December of that year as likely to represent any behaviour that might be due to this particular position of Venus .
Let us do the same for all similar occasions , and finally add all the spots thus selected together .
We have thus obtained a mass of observations which may be supposed to represent any behaviour due to this position of the planet Venus with reference to the Earth or point of view .
Secondly , let us now take each occasion on which Venus is at the same longitude as the extreme right of the visible disk , that is to say , 90 ' before the Earth , and do the same as we did in the previous instance , using five months ' observations for each occasion .
We shall thus , as before , obtain a mass of observations which maybe supposed to represent the behaviour due to a position of Venus 90 ' before the Earth .
Thirdly , let us obtain in a similar manner a mass of observations representing the behaviour of sunspots for a position of Venus 180 ' before the Earth , Venus and the Earth being now at exactly opposite sides of the sun ; and fourthly , let us finally obtain , in a similar manner , those observations representing the behaviour of sun-spots when Venus is 270 ' before the Earth , being now of the same heliocentric longitude as the extreme left of the visible disk .
These four series of five months each will in fact split up the whole body of observations into four equal parts , the synodical revolution of Venus being nearly twenty months .
The following Table exhibits these series after the earth-correction has been applied to each ; it also represents each series reduced so as to exhibit its characteristic behaviour for an averuge size of spot =1000 .

We may do the same for the planet Mercury as we have done for I Venus , that is to say , we may split up the whole body of observations into four parts , representing the behaviour of sun-spots when Mercury is in the i same four positions with respect to the Earth as those which are given for * Venus in the above Table .
Only in this case we must bear in mind that , f owing to the eccentricity of Mercury 's orbit , this planet will sometimes take ^ a longer , and sometimes a shorter time to go from one configuration to | another .
Thus , for instance , we have Mercury = Earth + 0 ' on March 24 , 1854 j Mercury=Earth + 90 ' on May 6 , 1854 j and Mercury = Earth +180 ' on May 29 , 1854 .
j\#187 ; j We should therefore take the observations between April 15 , 1854 , and , :J May 18 , 1854 , as representing the behaviour of sun-spots due to a position I of Mercury 90 ' before the Earth , and so on for other cases .

If we now examine the two Tables for the planets Venus and Mercury , we shall find in them indications of a behaviour of sun-spots appearing to have reference to the positions of these planets , and which seems to be of the same nature for both .
This behaviour may be characterized as follows : \#151 ; the average size of a spot would appear to attain its maximum on that side of the sun which is turned away from Venus or from Mercury , and to j have its minimum in the neighbourhood of Venus or of Mercury .
10 .
The apparent behaviour is so decided with regard to Venus , that the whole body of observations will bear to be split up into two parts , namely Carrington 's series and the Kew series , in each of which it is distinctly manifest .
The following treatment will serve to render this effect more visible to the eye .
In Table II .
, column ( A ) ( Venus = Earth+ 0 ' ) , we have ten final numbers denoting the behaviour of a spot of average area=1000 at ten central longitudes as follows : +54 + 42 + 23\#151 ; 4\#151 ; 30 \#151 ; 61\#151 ; 49 \#151 ; 25+1+49 .
Let us take the mean of the first and second of these , the mean of the second and third , and so on , and we get the following nine numbers:- " + 48 + 32+10 \#151 ; 17\#151 ; 45\#151 ; 55-37-12 + 25 .
Performing the same operation once more , we obtain the following eight j numbers , corresponding to the eight central longitudes :\#151 ; + 40 + 21 -3-31\#151 ; 50\#151 ; 46-25+7 .
In the following Table we have exhibited the results obtained by this process:\#151 ; 1872 .

11 .
If we now refer to the Table for Jupiter , we find that we cannot [ detect the same kind of behaviour that we did in the case of Venus and Mercury .
We cannot say that such a behaviour does not exist with reference to this planet j but , if it does , it is to such an extent that the obser* vations at our disposal have not enabled us to detect it .
12 .
The following evidence from a different point of view goes to confirm the results we have now obtained .
We might expect , if there really is a behaviour of sun-spots depending upon the position of Venus , and of the nature herein stated , that the average area of a spot as it passes the central longitude of the disk ought to be greatest when Venus is 180 ' from the earth , and least when Venus and the Earth are together , and the same ought to hold for Mercury and for Jupiter , if these planets have any influence .
Taking the mean of the four central areas as giving the best value of the area of a spot as it passes the centre , we have for Venus the following results :\#151 ; Mean of four central areas\#151 ; ( A ) ( B ) ( 0 ) ( D ) 44741 57426 46068 33095 and the number of groups for these are as follows:\#151 ; -229 265 150 181 j hence the mean area of one group will be\#151 ; 195 217 307 183 J from which we get ( A)=195 ; mean of ( B ) and ( D ) = 200 ; ( C)=30/ ; j that is to say , A is least , and C is greatest .
1 Doing the same in the case of Mercury , we get ( A ) = 204 ; mean of ( B ) and ( D ) = 217 ; ( C ) = 246 ; and finally , doing the same in the case of Jupiter , we get ( A)=185 ; mean of ( B ) and ( D ) = 207 ; ( C)=282 : it thus appears that in all these cases the same order is preserved .
13 .
We leave it to others to remark upon the nature and strength of the 218 Messrs. J. II .
Gladstone Tribe on [ Mar. 14 evidence now deduced as to a connexion o.f some sort between the behavior of sun-spots and the positions of the planets Venus and Mercury .
\ye think , however , it must be allowed , that the investigation is one of interest and importance , and we trust that arrangements may be made for the systematic continuance of solar observations in such localities as will ensure to us a daily picture of the sun 's disk .
The influence of blank days in diminishing the value of a series of sun .
observations is very manifest .
We have been able to record the behaviour across the sun 's disk of 421 groups of Carrington 's series out of a total number of 885 groups , and we have been able to record the same behaviour for 373 out of 544 groups observed at Kew .
Thus , out of a total of 1429 groups , we have only been able to record the behaviour of 794 .
Nor are the records which we have obtained so perfect as we could wish , on account of blank days , which make interpolations necessary .
It is therefore of much importance for the future of such researches as the present , that there should be several observing-stations so placed that we may reckon on having at least a daily picture of the sun 's disk .
It will be easily seen that such observations are very different from experiments , which may be multiplied ad libitum ; for in this case Nature gives us in a year or in ten years a certain amount of information , and no more , while it depends upon ourselves to make a good use of the information which she affords .
It is already universally acknowledged that we ought to make the best possible use of the few precious moments of a total eclipse ; but such observations must necessarily be incomplete unless they are followed up by the equally important , if more laborious , task of recording the sun 's surface from day to day .

aTlie Decomposition of Water by Zinc in conjunction with a more Negative Metal .
" By J. H. Gladstone , Ph. D. , F.B.S. , and Alfred Tribe , F.C.S. Deceived February 8 , 1872 .
Pure zinc is incapable of decomposing pure wrater , even at 100 ' C. , but at a considerably higher temperature it is known to combine with its oxygen .
Davy exposed pure water for two days to the action of a pile of silver and zinc plates , separated only by pasteboard , without obtaining any hydrogen ; Buff , however , has shown that a very minute trace of gas can be formed at the ordinary temperature by a pair of zinc and platinum plates .
During a series of experiments , of which we have already published an instalment , it occurred to us to ascertain whether by bringing the two metals closer together , and so increasing the electrical tension of the liquid , we could effect the same combination of zinc with oxygen at the ordinary temperature which takes place without the second metal at a very high
