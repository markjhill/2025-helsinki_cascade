" Note on some Winter Thermometrie Observations in the Alps .
" By E. Frankland , F.R.S. During the past winter , I spent a. fortnight at the village of Davos , Canton Q-raubiinden , Switzerland , and had thus an opportunity of experiencing some of the remarkable peculiarities of the climate of the elevated valley ( the Prattigau ) in which Davos is situated .
The village has of late acquired considerable repute as a climatic sanitarium for persons suffering from diseases of the chest .
So rapidly has its reputation grown , that while in the winter of 1865\#151 ; 66 only eight patients resided there , during the past season upwards of three hundred have wintered in the valley .
The summer climate of Davos is very similar to that of Pontresina and St. Moritz , in the neighbouring high valley of the Engadin\#151 ; cool and rather windy ; but so soon as the Prattigau and surrounding mountains become thickly and , for the winter , permanently covered with snow , which usually happens in November , a new set of conditions come into play and the winter climate becomes exceedingly remarkable .
The sky is , as a-rule , cloudless or nearly so ; and , as the solar rays , though very powerful , are incompetent to melt the snow , they have little effect upon the temperature , either of the valley or its enclosing mountains ; consequently there are no currents of heated air ; and , as the valley is well sheltered from more general atmospheric movements , an almost uniform calm prevails until the snow melts in spring .
3ig Prof. Frankland some Winter [ May 7 , According to Dufour 's trigonometrical measurements , Davos is 1556 metres , or 5105 feet , above the sea ; the measurements of the Swiss Meteorological Society make the height 1650 metres , or 5413 feet ; and my own estimation with an aneroid gave it as 4000 feet above Zurich , or 5352 feet above the sea .
The village of Davos is therefore about 500 feet lower than the summit of the Bigi .
I arrived on the evening of the 20th of December , and found the snow lying from two to three feet deep on the flat sole of the valley .
On the following morning the thermonxetric observations were commenced with instruments supplied to me by Mr. L. Casella , all of which had been cei'tified at the Kew Observatory .
For the corresponding readings at Greenwich I am indebted to Mr. Glaisher .
December 21 st,1873.\#151 ; From behind the sharp peak of the Schwarz-horn the sun rose at the Seehof Hotel , Davos-Dorfli , at 8.35 a.m. Throughout the day the sun was alternately clear and obscured by clouds .
At Davos-Platz it did not rise until 9.44 a.m. At 10 a.m. the mercurial thermometer with blackened bulb in vacuo showed 44 ' C. ( 1110,2 Fahr. ) in the sunshine , and 45 ' C. ( 113 ' Fahr. ) at 2.50 p.m. At Greenwich the readings on this day with the blackened bulb in vacuo placed on the grass * in the sunshine were :\#151 ; at 9 a.m. , 90,3 C. ( 480,7 Fahr. ) , at noon and at 3 p.m. , 21'-9 C. ( 710,5 Fahr. ) , the maximum during the day being 21'*9 C. ( 71'-5 Fahr. ) .
The maximum temperature observed in the shade was 10o,9 C. ( 510,7 Fahr. ) , and the minimum on grass in the shade 20,1 C. ( 35'-7 Fahr. ) .
December 22ncl.\#151 ; A mercurial thermometer with black glass bulb was laid on the snow at 8 a.m. ; twenty minutes later , or fifteen minutes before sunrise , it marked \#151 ; 180-3 C. ( \#151 ; 1 ' Fahr. ) .
The sky was deep blue , and almost perfectly cloudless during the whole day .
Five minutes after sunrise many of the patients at the Seehof Hotel were walking in the open air without any special wraps , and many of them without overcoats .
In the brilliant sunshine one felt comfortably warm sitting in front of the hotel in a light morning coat .
The following thermometrical observations were made on this day:\#151 ; * Since the above was written I have ascertained that the readings of this kind of instrument are much higher when it is laid on grass than when it is clamped upon a staff at a height of 5 feet above the ground .
Thus , at St. Leonard's-on-Sea on the 7th of April last , this thermometer in sunshine stood at 42'-3 C. at 11.50 a.m. , when placed 5 feet from the ground , but when laid on the grass it promptly rose to 56''5 C. It is therefore evident that the readings of the solar thermometer at Greenwich , given throughout this paper , are much too high for fair comparison with the Davos temperature , the thermometer at Greenwich having been always laid upon the grass .
On the 7th of April the sky at St. Leonard 's was clear , the air warm with hut little wind , and the sun bright ; nevertheless the maximum temperature during the day in sunshine was 2'-7 C. lower than that observed with the same instrument at Davos on the 21st of December last.\#151 ; May 7 , 1874 .

Prof. Frankland on some Winter [ May 7 , December 23rcL\#151 ; The sky was again deep blue and cloudless nearly the whole of the day .

At Greenwich the readings were , with blackened bulb in vacuo :\#151 ; maximum 22'*8 C. ( 73 ' Fahr. ) ; at 9 a.m. , 4'*4 C. ( 40 ' Fahr. ) ; at noon , 12'-6 C. ( 54'-6 Fahr. ) ; at 3 p.m. , 22'*8 C. ( 73 ' Fahr. ) .
The maximum in the shade was 80,3 C. ( 46'*9 Fahr. ) , and the minimum on grass in the shade \#151 ; 2'*3 C. ( 27''9 Fahr. ) .
December 24dh.\#151 ; As the Fluela pass , the highest carriage-road in Switzerland , was still open for sledges , I determined to make some observations on the summit , which is 7890 feet above the sea , and consequently about 2538 feet above Davos .
Starting from Davos at 8 a.m. , I arrived at the summit of the pass , where there is a small hotel and telegraph station , at 10.30 a.m. The early morning was somewhat cloudy , but , about ten o'clock , the sky became perfectly clear and deep blue , and continued so until the sun set behind the Schwarzhorn , a few minutes past noon .
The following temperatures were recorded:\#151 ; I. The blackened bulb in vacuo marked 41'*7 C. at 11 a.m. in the sunshine , 42'-3 C. at 11.30 a.m. , and 42'*3 C. at 12 o'clock .
II .
The plain black glass bulb in the shade showed at noon - 7'*2 C. when freely suspended about two feet above the snow in a brisk breeze .
The highest temperature in sunshine which I have observed at Davos at noon , with the blackened bulb vacuo , was 42'-5 , which scarcely differs from that read on the Fluela pass at the same hour .
So far as these limited observations go , therefore , they indicate that the solar rays are not of appreciably higher thermal intensity at a height of 7890 feet than at a height of 5350 feet .
I may add that the thermometer in the sunshine was sheltered from the wind on the Fluela pass , and was , in all respects but one , in a more favourable position for attaining a high temperature than at Davos .
The one unfavourable condition was its exposure to less solar heat reflected from the snow than at Davos .

] Thermometric Observations in the Alps .
At Greenwich the readings were , with blackened bulb in vacuo \#151 ; maximum 19''5 0 .
( 67'*1 Fahr. ) ; at 9 a.m. , 9'*6 C. ( 490,3 Fahr. ) ; at noon , 18'*6 C. ( 65'-5 Fahr. ) j and at 3 p.m. , 19'*5 C. ( 67'*1 Fahr. ) .
The maximum in the shade was 10'*5 C. ( 50o-9 Fahr. ) , and the minimum on grass in the shade \#151 ; 3'*1 C. ( 260,5 Fahr. ) .
December 25th.\#151 ; The sky was again deep blue and perfectly cloudless .
The air was also apparently clear , except at about 9 a.m. , when the village and valley became immersed in a light fog , which consisted of minute snow crystals .
On this and most subsequent days isolated crystals could be distinctly seen floating in the air , by placing the eye in shadow and then looking into the sunshine .
The abundance or paucity of these suspended and , under ordinary circumstances , invisible snow crystals must exercise a powerful influence upon the intensity of solar radiation .
To this cause , for instance , it was probably due that at 1.45 p.m. on this day , although the sky was perfectly clear and the sunshine most intensely brilliant , the blackened bulb in vacuo only stood at 35 ' C. in the sun , whereas at noon , when all the conditions were apparently the same ( except , of course , the sun 's altitude ) , the temperature was 5 ' C. higher .

February , 1871 52'-2 C. 38'*8 C. The chief remarkable things about the observations made last winter are , first , the very high sun-temperatures prevailing contemporaneously with very low air- or shade-temperatures , and secondly , the comparative uniformity of the solar heat from sunrise to sunset .
Thus on the 29th of December , whilst the temperature of the air was \#151 ; 18'-1 C. , the sun-thermometer stood at +37 ' C. , and on the following day , with an air-temperature not exceeding \#151 ; 120,8 C. , the sun-temperature was 38'*5 C. Again , the sun-temperatures observed on the 26th of December illustrate the comparative uniformity of solar radiation during the day , when the sky remains cloudless .
Twenty-five minutes after sunrise the solar thermometer indicated 31'#8 C. ; at noon it stood at 420,5 C. , and at thirty-five minutes before sunset it recorded 33'*1 C. Besides the intensity of solar radiation and its comparative uniformity during the day , the rarity and calmness of the air are important factors amongst the causes of the peculiar climate of Davos .
With the barometer standing at 615 millims. the weight of air in contact with a given surface of the skin is about one fifth less than it is at the sea-level .
The excessive dryness of the air at Davos has probably but little special influence upon the sensation of heat and cold , because the maximum proportion of aqueous vapour present in air near 0 ' C. is everywhere small , and the specific heats of equal volumes of air and aqueous vapour are not widely VOL.

[ May 7 , different .
On the other hand , the absence of suspended watery particles in the air has , no doubt , very considerable influence in preventing the chilling of the skin .
Not only are such liquid particles present when there is visible fog , but they often exist in great numbers when the air possesses its usual transparent appearance .
Another very important influence upon the sun-temperature is the reflection of solar rays from the snow .
The valley of Davos is about one mile wide , and has precipitous sides and a flat sole .
The villages of Davos-Dorfli and Davos-Platz are situated on the north-west slope of the valley , and consequently receive the scattered solar rays reflected from a large area of snow .
I have no doubt that the sun-temperature at the opposite side of the valley is markedly lower ; but having no second sun-thermometer , I could not ascertain this by the comparison of simultaneous thermometric observations .
When staying at Yentnor , in the winter of 1872-73 , I noticed that a not inconsiderable proportion of the total solar heat falling upon a house on a cliff , near the shore , was reflected from the sea .
M. Dufour has since observed the same phenomenon between Lausanne and Yevay on the Lake of Geneva* , and has actually measured the proportions of direct and reflected heat incident at five different stations on the northern shore of the lake .
He found that the proportion of reflected heat was as much as 68 per cent , of the heat directly incident from the sun , when the sun 's altitude was between 4 ' 38 ' and 3 ' 34 ' .
At about 7 ' altitude the proportion was between 40 and 50 of reflected to 100 of direct heat .
Even at about 16 ' altitude the proportion was between 20 and 30 of reflected to 100 of direct heat ; but when the sun was higher than 30 ' , the reflected heat was hardly appreciable .
It will be seen that this action of extensive reflecting surfaces of snow or water must exert a powerful influence upon the maximum temperature of places favourably situated for receiving the reflected rays ; and , moreover , where the proportion of heat reflected varies ( as it has been proved to do in the case of water , and as it doubtless also does in the case of snow ) inversely as the angle formed by the incident rays and the reflecting surface , this action must materially contribute , especially in winter , to the maintenance of an approximately uniform sun-temperature throughout the day .
At Davos and similar elevated stations , however , the comparative freedom of the air from suspended liquid and solid particles must obviously contribute , to a still greater extent , to such a result ; for as pure and dry air is transcalent and reflects light but slightly , the horizontal sunbeams , passing through such air , would be nearly as powerful as vertical rays .
The peculiar winter climate of Davos appears , therefore , to depend upon the following conditions :\#151 ; 1 .

] consequently less abstraction of heat from the body .
It also secures greater transcalency in the atmosphere by a position above the chief region of aqueous precipitation , and which is comparatively out of the reach of the dust and fuliginous matters that pollute the lower stratum of the air .
On my journey from London to Davos I never saw the sun until I had arrived nearly at my destination ; and during the greater portion of the fortnight of brilliant weather recorded above , there was a dull leaden sky at Zurich , about 60 miles distant .

Thiele and ( during the winter months ) permanent snow , which reflects the solar heat and prevents the communication of warmth to the air , and consequently the production of atmospheric currents .
In still , though cold , air the skin is well known to be less chilled than in much less cold air , which impinges with considerable velocity upon the surface of the body .
The effect of motion through the air upon the sensation of warmth and cold at Davos is very striking .
Sitting perfectly still in the sunshine , the heat in mid winter is sometimes almost unbearable ; on rising and walking about briskly , a delicious feeling of coolness is experienced ; but on driving in a sledge , the cold soon becomes painful to the unprotected face and hands .

A sheltered position favourable for receiving both the direct and reflected solar rays.\#151 ; In this respect Davos-Dorfli , situated opposite to the entrance of the Dischma valley , has the advantage over Davos-Platz , two miles lower down the valley ; for , in the latter village , the sun rises on the 21st December lh 9\#153 ; later , and sets about ten minutes earlier , than at Dorfli .
All these conditions contribute not only to a high sun-temperature during the winter months , but also to a comparatively uniform radiant heat from sunrise to sunset .
In conclusion I wrill only point to the general bearing which these observations have upon winter refuges for invalids .
While the primary conditions to be secured in such places must ever be fine weather and a sheltered position , the next in importance is , undoubtedly , exposure all day long to reflected , as well as direct , solar radiation .
To accomplish this , a southern aspect and a considerable expanse of water , or nearly level snow , are necessary ; and it is important that the sanitarium should be considerably , and somewhat abruptly , elevated above the reflecting surface , so that it may receive , throughout the entire day , the uninterrupted reflection of the sun 's rays .
At the sea-side , for instance , only those houses which command such an uninterrupted view of the sea , ranging from S.E. to S.W. , as show 's the reflection of the sun throughout the entire day , enjoy the full advantages of the place .
At , or near , the sea-level , however , it is impossible , owing to the suspended matters in the lower regions of the atmosphere , to enjoy any thing approaching to a uniform temperature from sunrise to sunset .
Tor this purpose it is necessary to leave the grosser air of the plains behind , and to ascend 2 c 2 328 Mr. 11 .

( Abstract .
) Referring to his original paper ( Phil. Trans. 1873 ) , the author remarks here that , upon the basis of the heat annually dissipated from our globe being equal to that evolved by the melting of 777 cubic miles of ice at zero to water at the same temperature , and of the experimental data contained in his paper , he had demonstrated , in terms of mean crushed rock , the annual supply of heat derivable from the transformation of the mechanical work of contraction available for volcanic energy , and had also estimated the proportion of that amount of heat necessary to support the annual vulcanicity noAV active on our globe ; but , from the want of necessary data , he had refrained from making any calculation as to what amount in voluine of the solid shell of our earth must be crushed annually , in order to admit of the shell following down after the more rapidly contracting nucleus .
This calculation he now makes upon the basis of certain allowable suppositions , where the wank of data requires such to be made , and for assumed thicknesses of solid shell of 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800 miles respectively .
Prom the cunre 'of total contraction ( plate x. Phil. Trans , part i. 1873 ) obtained by his experiments on the contraction of slags , he has now deduced partial mean coefficients of contraction for a reduction in temperature of 1 ' Fahr. , for intervals generally of about 500 ' for the entire scale , between a temperature somewhat exceeding that of the blastfurnace and that of the atmosphere , or 53 ' Fahr. And applying the higher of these coefficients to the data of his former paper , and to the suppositions of the present , he has obtained the absolute contraction in volume of the nuclei appertaining to the respective thicknesses of solid shell above stated .
In order that the shell may follow down and remain in contact with the contracted nucleus , either its thickness must be in* Read June 20 , 1872 ; Phil. Trans , for 187-4 P- 147 .
