New Derivatives of Phenylamine and Ethylamine .
By A. W. HOFMANN .
Received June 9th , 1859 .
Some time ago* I communicated to the Royal Society some results obtained in.studying the action of dibromide of ethylene upon phenylamine .
The principal product of this reaction was found to be a well-defined crystalline compound with basic characters .
By the analysis of the base itself , and of several of its combinations , it had been proved that the formula IIN=(C4 } N)i C16 9NlcI } is the simplest atomic expression for the new substance ; but the actioyn of iodide of methyl and of ethyl upon this body having given rise to compounds c HN IC IGI , N lcui1 C34 21 2N I=C HN23 and Q , H~ 'N , I CIIO HN c C. 15 , 36 232-C HN IN I was induced to assume the formula C32 182 ( CN24h5 ) ; }N,2 as representing the true constitution , of the basic body , which thus appears as a diammonia , in which 2 equivs. of hydrogen are replaced by 2 equivs. of phenyl , and 4 equivs. of hydrogen by 2 molecules of diatomic ethylene .
This view involves the existence of a basic compound , ( C4 114 ) " C28 H1G N2= ( C,2 115)2 N , 112 J i.e. of a diphenyl-diamine in which only one molecule of diatomic ethylene has beeni substituted for hydrogen .
Experiment has not failed to realize the body pointed out by theory .
A mixtuire of dibromide of ethylene with a large excess of phenylamine ( 1 vol. of dibromide of ethylene and 4 vols .
of phenylamine ) rapidly solidifies to a crystalline mass .
Treatment with water removes from this mixture a very considerable proportioni of hydrochlorate of pheiiylamine , leaving a brown resinous substance , which gradually but imperfectly solidifies .
This stubstanice forms a hydrochlorate which is difficultly soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid , and which may be readily purified by repeated crystallizations from boiling alcohol .
The pure hydrochlorate dissolved in water , and mixed with potassa or ammonia , furnishes the free base , which generally separates as an oil , rapicly solidifying into a crystalline substance .
This may be further purified by repeated crystallizations from diluted alcohol .
Analysis in fact , assigns to this body the formula ( C4 114 ) " 028 H11 N2 ( C12 1115)2 N2 , H2 which was confirmed by the analysis of the dichloride(C12 HI)2f N2 C129 and of the platinum-saltr 04114 ) " L C12 115)2t N2 ji C2 , 2Pt Cl2 .
The formation of the niew body is obvious : 4[ 12 } N ] +(C4 H4 ) " Br =(C1I2H })2}N 2([2 12 6 }N 1Br Phenylamine .
Dibromide of EthyleneBromide of Ethylene .

diamine .
This substance differs in its physical characters essentially from the base containing 2 molecules of ethylene .
The former is very soluble in alcohol and ether , the latter being very difficultly soluble ; its fusing-point is 59 ?
, the fusing-point of the latter being 1570 In order finally to establish the relation between the body which forms the subject of this note and the base previously described , it remained to prove experimentally that the former , when submitted to the action of dibromide of ethylene , may be readily converted into the latter .
Nothing is easier than to accomplish this transformation , which , in the presence of alcohol , is rapidly effected at the temperature of boiling water .
Treatment of the product of digestion with water removes the dichloride of ethylene-diphenyl-diammonium , the diethylene-diphenylamine remaining dissolved in the excess of dibromide of ethylene , from which it may be readily extracted by hydrocbloric acid .
Preparation of the substance in a state of purity , and comparison of its properties with those of the body previously obtained , established beyond a doubt the transformation , which resolves itself ilito a simple process of substitution(C4 H4 ) " ?

On digesting the base with iodide of ethyl some hours at a temperature of 1000 , a beautiful iodide was obtained , crystalliz ing in well-defined prisms , difficultly soluble in water , but more soluble in alcohol .
This substance contains C H2 NI |(4115 L ) N12 C,1 '26 22 ( C15211 ) 22 Treatment with potassa separates from this iodide the b ) as as a crystalline body fusing at 700 , and resembling in many respects the previous base .
It contains ( C4 114 ) " C36 Ht241N2-(C4 H5 )2 ( C12 1T-)4J and forms a beautiful platinum-salt crystallizing in needles of the formutla [ C , 112G N2 ] C12 , 2PtCl .
The deportment of phenylamine under the influence of dibromide of ethylene gives a fair illustration of the nature of the substances wliieh are generated , under the influence of diatomic molecules , from primary aromatic monamines .
To complete the study of this subject , I have examined , moreover , the action of dibromide of ethylenie upoin ethylamine , as a representative of the monamines couitaining aln ordinary aloholradical .
Dibromide of ethylene acts upon ethylamine even in the cold , the products of the reaction varying according to the relative proportions of the two bodies , and according to the temperature .
Among other products invariably occur the two bromides corresponding to the two salts of the phenyl-compounds mentioned in the previous paragraphs .
These substances are the Dibromide of 1 F(C4 114 ) " ethylene-diethyl0C12 H1 N2 Br2 , = ( C4 H5 ) 2 N2 , Br2 , and diammonium , JL H4 J Dibromide of ( C4H 4)2 NB diethylene-diethyl &gt; C10H122 N2Br .
( C4H5)2 N2 Br2 .
diammonium , JL H2 JjI have fixed the composition of the former compound by the analysis of the dibromide of the dichloride and of the base itself , all of which are remarkably well-defined crystalline bodies , and that of the latter by the examination of a well-defined platinum-salt .
The first base , separated by the action of anhydrous baryta from the dry bromide , distils as an oily liquid of a powerfully ammoniacal odour , which solidifies into a brittle crystalline mass not unlike fused stearic acid .
The composition of the body is remarkable .
It contains -(C4 I14)"1 t C12 118 N2 02-(C4 H5)2 N2 02 ) H4J_ and thus constitutes the dioxide of the diatomic metal , ethylenedietbyl-diammoonIum .
The second base is liquid , and boils at 185 ? .
It is easily obtained from the dibromide , which , being extremely soluble , may be readily separated from the bromide of the first body .
I have experimentally established that this body may be readily procured by the action of dibromide of ethylene upon the dioxide previously mentioned .
The dioxide , 012 118 N2 02 , presents considerable interest in a theoretical point of view .
I have determinied the vapour-density of this compound by Gay-Lussac 's process .
Experiment gave the number 2-26 .
Assuming that the molecule of the body under examination corresponds to 4 volumes of vapour , the theoretical density is 4-62 .
The extraordinary discrepancy between theory and experiment may be removed in two ways : viz. either by halving the formula , or by assuming that the molecule of the dioxide of ethylene-diethyldiammonium corresponds to 8 volumes of vapour , in either of which cases the theoretical denisity becomes 2P31 , closely agreeing with the experimental number 2P26 .
I shall discuss the vapour-densities of the diammonias somewhat more fully in a future communication ; but I cannot refrain from pointing out even now , that , by dividing the formula by 2 , we arrive at an expression containing 1 equiv. of oxygen ( 0=8 ) , which , in the eyes of those who con-sider the number 16 as the true molecular value of oxygen , must appear perfectly inadmissible .
