( Abstract .
) The results of the experiments which are recorded by the author are divided into three classes , which tend to show1st .
That a tendon , having , b ) even divided , maiy r'eulnite withollu leaving permanently a cicatrix , 2ndly .
That the uniting niew material may be drawin ouit to any required length , and in such case may , under gradual and carefllyv regulated extension , even acquire the thickniess of the tendon itself ; but that if the divided ends are widely separated after the section , and so remain , reunion will not take place .
3rdly .
That the addition of nlew tendon does not impair the strength of the muscle , unless the lentgth be more than sufficient , in which case it occasionally weakens the muscle .
The process of reunion is explained , and the appearances presented by the tenidon in the various stages of reunion are detailed and illustrated by coloured drawings .
Preparations of the parts operated on were also exhibited .
The author conieludes that , when the divide(d ends of the tendon are held in apposition and the limb is kept at rest , reunion will take place without leaving a cicatrix ; but that when extension is made , the new material becomes or ganized , and persists as a permanent structure .
