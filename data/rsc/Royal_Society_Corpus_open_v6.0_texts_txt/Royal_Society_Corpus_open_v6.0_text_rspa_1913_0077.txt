The examination of this complex spectrum was facilitated by a comparison with of the electric discharge through rarefied vapour of the tetrachloride at a pressure less than its own maximum vapour-pressure , which latter is too to allow the discharge to pass .

The positions of the brighter heads were determined from taken with the rating , the comparison spectrtun being that of the iron For the fainter bands raphs taken with the quartz raph w utilised , and the limits of error are therefore considerably greater .
As many heads as possible were included in the measurements in order to make the discussion of the ularity of structure fairly complete .

The frequencies in the brackets have been calculated from the formula .
The successive intervals of taken vertically and horiZOll t form arithmetical ression s ; that is to say , the frequencies in each vertical group may be represented by a formula , and in each row by where , A and are constants , and successive values given to and to , while are constant fractions .
The system of bands may therefore be esented by a Deslandres equation .
For the bands observed takes the years from 50 to 55 , and from 12 to 22 .
The more accurately observed frequencies have been in evaluating the constants , and the resulting equation is Mr. W. Jevons .
The degl'ee of approximation to which this formula represents all the bands can be seen from the column in Table I , headed " " Observed minus Calculated Evidence to the Origin of the New Bands .
The new afterglow bands are not present in the discharge spectrum , in which the chloride is characterised by entirely different bands ( see footnote , p. 188 ) .
It is probable , therefore , that the new bands are not due to a chloride , but to a compound .
In the afterglow reaction , chlorine is from the tetrachloride .
Prof. Strutt has tested qualitatively the white solid which was deposited on the inside of the afterglow tube in these experiments .
The deposit was put in caustic potash solution , and a small quantity of liquid distilled off ; this gave a Nessler reaction , while blank tests with the potash solution alone gave negative results .
This proof of the presence of nitrogen in the deposit confirms the spectroscopic evidence of the itride origin of the new bands .
It may be recalled that Welss and Engelhardt* have described the formation of a nitride , the approximate formula , by heating silicon in at 1300-1400o C. They have also prepared , by other means , another compound , , which , when ignited and washed with hydrochloric acid , ives rise to a white nitride , .
It is impossible to say what is the composition of the nitride the band spectrum until a analysis of the deposit has been un dertaken .
Tetrachloride .
In view of the chemical relations of titanium to carbon and silicon , and especially of the fact that metallic titanium unites very readily with forming a nitride , it was that titanium tetrachloride might behave in a similar manner to silicon tetrachloride and the carbon compounds in the afterglow .
The tetrachloride of titanium closely resembles that of silicon , being a colourless , volatile liquid ( boiling point fuming even more strongly on exposure to the atmosphere .
On introduction of its vapour into the active nitrogen , the afterglow became very pale blue in colour .
The spectrum was compared with those of titanium oxide in the carbon arc , and of the condensed discharge through the tetrachloride vapour itself , at a pressure less than that of its saturated vapour .
The afterglow gives a well developed line spectrum of titanium , with intensities about equal to those in the arc .
In addition , and in common with the discharge , it shows the group 'Zeit .

The enhanced lines of titanium , generally speaking , are not developed in the afterglow , the few which do occur being fainter than in the arc .
The condensed discharge t , hrough vapour of the tetrachloride , on the other hand , noteworthy as being an excellent source of enbanced lines .
No bands occur in the which can be attributed to a although it has previously been proved that is present in the compound which is deposited in apparatus .
Unlike the carbon compounds and silicon tetrach]oride , therefore , the tetrachloride of titanium to the class of substances which , ) introduced into the afterglow , do not develop the spectrum of the final product of the reaction .
