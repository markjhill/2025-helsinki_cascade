A paper was read , entitled , " Discussion of Tide Observations made at Liverpool .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , F.R.S. The chief purpose which the author has in viewin presenting the tables accompanying this paper , which are a continuation of those published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1835 , and are founded on the observations instituted by Mr. Hutchinsonat Liver ?
pool , is to exhibit the diurnal inequality in the height of high water , which is scarcely sensible in the river Thames , but which at Liver ?
pool amounts to more than a foot .
The diurnal inequality in the interval appears to be insensible .
The author has farther ascertained that Bernouilli 's formulae expressing the height of the tide , deduced from his theory of the tides , present a very remarkable accordance with observation .
