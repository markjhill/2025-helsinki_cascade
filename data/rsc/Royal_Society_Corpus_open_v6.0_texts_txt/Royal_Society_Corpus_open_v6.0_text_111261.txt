" Sir la Th6orie de l'orientation du Plan oscillatoire du Pendule simple , et son application A la recherche de l'aplatissement du spheroide terrestre .
' By M. Oliveira .
Communicated by Charles Babbage , Esq. , F.R.S. &amp;c. Received January 18 , 1854 .
In this memoir , the author first deduces a formula upon geometrical considerations alone , expressing the deviation of a free pendulum ( like Foucault 's ) in terms of the latitude and difference of meridians , or hour-angle ; and this is done ( as far as appears ) without any reference to the dynamical considerations on which Foucault 's formula is deduced , assuming only the inertia of the pendulum .
The author 's formula assumes the earth to be a sphere .
If now , observation should give a slightly differentdeviation , the author infers that this would be due to the ellipticity of the earth ; and investigates a formula geometrically , to express the ellipticity in terms of such difference ; and thus by accurate observations of Foucault 's pendulum in different parts of the earth , he conceives the ellipticity might be determined .
As an instance , he cites Foucault 's result for the latitude of Paris ; which differs by a small amount from the formula , and which he considers accordingly to express the ellipticity , though he does not calculate it .
