Denoting by ( 1800 + t ) the date of observation in tropical years of the Gregorian epoch , T the absolute value of horizontal intensity with milli .
metre , milligram , and the second of mean time as unities , o the same in unities of the Gaussian constants ; the two values of T for 1805*5 and 1828'31 have been deduced from observed w , by T-0'00349216 .
r and -r deinote the observed time of oscillation of two magnets which , since 1853 523 were carefully guarded from the influence of other magnets ; and therefore , marking by C , a , 3 , Ct , a ' , / 3 ' unknown constants , e the basis of hyperbolic logarithms , and taking t1= t-53-523 , each value of r and ' had to fulfil the equations 2C 2C ( 1+ ae~Pti ) .

It ought to be observed , that equal probability has been attributed to the error +1 in T , + in n r , 2T r that is to say , equal errors to an intensiby determined by each of the three methods , -this supposition being at onlce the most simple and the most conformable to my experience , by nearly contemporaneous repetitions of each class of observation .
All my determinations of absolute intensity have been obtained either by one of two , or by two magnetometers ; the first of which is a Gaussian of large size , by Meyerstein , the second my declinationland transit-instrument by Pistor , completed by the usual graduated holders for deflecting magnets , and perfectly adapted to observations in the open air .

Inclination .
The values of inclination here employed are taken for 1806 0 , 18325o , and 1836 87 , from the observationis of Humboldt , Rudberg , and Encke ; for the ten other dates since 1825-0 , they have been obtained by my own applications of the methods exposed in my ' Reise um die Erde , ' Physikal .

The methods of observation leave no room for any constant error in the resulting inclination , as long as no directive magnetic force is exerted upon the needle by the instrument itself .
In order to free my results from any influence from this improbable ( but not impossible ) source , I compared , in 1860 , three full determinationis by the last-mentioned apparatus , with an equal number which I obtained under identical circumstances with a most perfect copy of Weber 's inductive inclinometer .
The result was an agreement of the two kinds of determinations within the limits of accidental error of the first-that is to say , far below one minutte in the incliniation ; I ventulre , therefore , to say hat the following numbers must give the absolute value of the element in question with no less certainty than the rate of its secular variation : Date of Incliination , observation .

This expression can be brought under the form ( B* ) i=660 26f 09 +(t2_ 110.543)2 .
0'018931 , which would prove that at the place in question the inclination will come , in 1910 543 , to a minimum of 660 26 ' 09 .
The aforesaid errors of terms give +2-27 years for the uncertainty of the epoch of this minimum , and + 31 9 for the uncertainty of its value ; but as the expression ( B ) results from observations between 1806 and 1863 , its consequences ought not to be extended as far as 1910 .

Declination .
Four results of observations of this element , made by the late astronomers Kirch in 1731 , Bode in 1784 and 1805 , and Tralles in 1819 , have been added to my own , which extend from 1825 to 1864 .
These latter were obtained with the declinationand transit-instrument employed in my voyage , which intermediately was frequently compared and found in perfect agreement with a large Gaussian magnetometer , whenever the indications of the latter were duly freed from the torsion of the suspending wires and from the want of parallelism between the normal of the employed speculum and the magnetic axis of the bar .
My observations were all made in the open air , with the exception of the two in 1849 and 1850 , which , having been executed in a room , were corrected for the influence of local attractions .
As the determination of this latter seemed exposed to a somewhat larger error than the other declinations , in combining the two reduced values with those obtained in the open air , I have given to the two first only a fourth of the weight of the others .
A similar allowance for larger probable errors should perhaps have been made in employing the four statements of former observers ; but , for want of particulars about the operations they are founded upon , it was more safe to neglect the difference between their weight and that of the others , than to fix it by an arbitrary assumption .
If , for the moment of observation , there were marked by 1800+t , as before , the tropical years elapsed since the Gregoriani epoch , m the positive excess of t over the next integer , x the horary angle of mean Sun , each observed west declination d ' had to be brought under the form d'-D +f ( t ) + 0(m , x ) , D denoting a constant , and f and 0 two fulnctions , the first of which was to be determined here .

, of the function p(m , x ) , or 0 as I will call it for abbreviation , are the same for all moments alike situated in different years , I was well aware that this assumptioni is but approximative , and that all sufficielntly extended and direct investigations of 0 , as chiefly those of General Sabine , have shown a periodicity of about 9'5 years in the total values of this function .
But as the laws of such dependence between T and each of the seven parameters of 0 have not yet been perfectly exposed , I preferred in the present to treat the latter as mere functions of m and x. In the following Table of employed mean declinations for the moments t , to each of them is subjoined the value of c/ by whose subtraction it has resulted from the momentary value furnished by observation .
This arrangement will allow us to appreciate ( and , if wanted , to correct for ) the influence exerted by any periodical variation of 0 upon the final result of my observations .
It may , too , be convenient to observe that for some of the following west declinations ( D ) , as well as for the before-mentioned intensities ( T ) and inclinations ( I ) , the observations were made in latitude p-Ap , and longitude I-Al ( where p and 1 mark the corresponding and above alleged values for my ordinary place ) , and that then the directly obtained results , viz. d-Ad , T-AT , or i-Ai , have been reduced by Ad=-O00940 .

which furnishes the above calculated numbers ; and by their comparison with the observed ones , the probable errors arein the absolute term of d ยง 1'94 ; in the coefficient of t in d +0 ' 2932 ; in the coefficient of t2 in d+O'030669 .
If , now , instead of employing the variations q ( m , x ) , or 0 according to observations in the years 1837 and 1838 , we assunme ( 1 ) that the periodical dependelnce between this fuiietion and the date t consists in always changing each parameter proportionally to its mean or primitive value , and them ( 2 ) that , as General Sabine has proved , the whole function has nearly reached a maximum in all moments marked by 1=48 +n .
95 , n being an integer , and ( 3 ) that , according to the same philosopher , the least and the largest amount of corresponding variations are approximately as 1 : 1 4 , then , ( D marking the function of t , m , x which in each case must be substituted for 0 , and Ca function of M and X , we shall have 4)=c { 120+0-20 .

Bv executing this operation , I found that the reduced oNservations are best represented by ( C* ) d=18ยง 8*43+026831 .
t-0070652 .
t2 , and that , though scarcely differing from ( IV .
) , this expression is preferable , because the probable error of each of its terrns is by nearly -14 of its former value smaller than the corresponding one in ( IV .
) As the expression ( C* ) is idelntical with ( C ) d= 180 8'68 0'070652{t1l899}2 , we see that , according to my observations , the west declination at the place in question arrived in 1801P899 at a maximum of 18ยง 8'"68 .
Putting off for a further artiele some more general observations on the secular changes of terrestrial magnetism , I briefly resume , as results of my nearly forty years ' observations , that for latitude =520 31 ' 55 " North , longitude= l30 23 ' 20 " E. from Greenwich , there have been-between 1805 and 18644 , Horizontal intensity=T= 1P79183-0-000048119 { t-59 930}2 ; between 1806 and 1863 , Inclination =i= 66ยง 26 ' 09+0'018931 { t-1 10.543}2 ; and between 1731 and 1864 , West declination=d= 180 8 ' 68-O'070652 { t1 899}2 ; all results being meant to be just for the date 1800+t in years of the Gregorian epoch .
N.B. It seems not unworthy of remark , that no evidence of the existence of a third term in the expression for any one of the three phenomena results from the above-mentioned observations ; and this , though partly due to the inevitable imperfections of the observations , makes it highly probable that a man 's lifetime , and even a century is but a very small part of the secular peiiod of terrestrial magnetism .
