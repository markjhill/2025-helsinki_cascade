, the easily hydrolyses into its component mononucleotides , but the latter is comparatively stable .
Evidently a similar decomposition of nucleic acid has taken place during peat formation , and the relatively unstable guanine-cytosine dinucleotide has been further decomposed into its constituent parts .
In view of the stable nature of this adenine-uracil dinucleotide and the ease with which it can be extracted from peat , it is surprising that its occurrence as such in nature has hitherto escaped observation .
So far the work has been purely qualitative , but a more exhaustive examination of the substances obtained is now in progress , to determine not only the quantitative proportions of the various radicles , but also their elementary composition .
The Distribution in Wheat , Riand Maize Grains of the Substance , the Deficiency of which a Diet causes Polyneuritis in Birds and Beri-beri in Man .
By Harriette Chick and E. Margaret Hume .
( Communicated by Dr. C. J. Martin , F.R.S. Received January 10 , 1917 .
) ( From the Lister Institute .
) Our attention was turned to this subject by the reported occurrence of beri-beri among our forces in the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia during the autumn and winter of 1915 ( see Wilcox , 1916 , I and II ) .
Owing to the exigencies of the military situation , many individuals in these regions subsisted for considerable periods mainly on tinned meat , jam and white bread ( or biscuit baked principally from white flour ) .
Beri-beri has in recent years been included among the deficiency diseases , and there was therefore good presumptive evidence that the diet had been at fault .
We examined two samples of tinned meat-and-vegetable ration by the methods described below , and found , as was to be expected , that the substances preventing beri-beri in the fresh materials had not survived the heat-sterilisation undergone in the process of canning .
The case of bread and biscuit demanded a more extended investigation , and the present work is concerned with the nutritive properties of cereals generally , especially wheat .
One member of this group , viz. , rice , has been exhaustively studied in recent years , and the work , among others , of Eijkman , Grijns , and Braddon has established the etiology of tropical beri-beri in a deficiency in the diet of Deficiency of which causes Beri-beri in Man .
45 rice-eating people , caused by the removal of certain materials from the grain during milling .
The presence in the rice-bran or rice polishings of a substance essential for nutrition has been demonstrated by many observers , including those named above , and also by Schaumann ( 1910 ) , to whom and to Funk ( 1913 ) the reader is referred for a complete bibliography upon the subject .
Funk ( 1912 ) adopted the term " vitamine " for this essential material , and for the sake of brevity we shall use the expression " anti-neuritic vitamine " * to express the substance whose absence in a diet causes beri-beri .
The vitamine in the rice grain was supposed to be contained in the layer of cells rich in protein ( aleurone-layer ) situated immediately underneath the pericarp of the husked grain .
These cells form the outer layer of the endosperm , but are removed with the bran during milling .
As a result of experiments made chiefly with wheat , but also including rice and maize for purposes of comparison , we have reached the conclusion that the more important receptacle of the anti-beri-beri vitamine is the embryo or germ , and not the pericarp , of the grain .
In the case of wheat , there are already some facts in the literature which indicate such a conclusion , but the exact composition of the materials employed in those researches was not sufficiently controlled for any dogmatic conclusion to be drawn .
For example , Holst ( 1907 ) and Edie and Simpson ( 1911 ) have shown that a diet of white bread ( milled wheat-endosperm ) will induce polyneuritis ( beri-beri ) in pigeons in the same manner as polished rice ( milled rice-endosperm ) , and the latter observers proved that birds would remain well and healthy if ( a ) whole-meal bread or ( b ) " standard " bread is used instead .
The last-named article , however , in spite of its title , has no standard composition ; it is generally made from white flour containing an addition of wheat germ and comparatively little bran .
Hill and Flack ( 1911 ) demonstrated the inferior nutritive properties of white bread compared with " whole-meal " or " standard " bread in the case of young rats .
They further showed that satisfactory growth could be induced if a proportion of wheat germ were added to a diet of white bread , and it was at Dr. Flack 's suggestion that we turned our attention to wheat germ in the hope that the subject would repay study .
Quite recently McCollum and Davis ( 1915 ) have found that young rats will thrive upon a diet of polished rice , butter fat and salts to which either wheat embryo or rice polishings are added ; they have suggested that the curative value of rice polishings for polyneuritis of birds might be attributed to the rice embryo removed with the pericarp rather than to the bran itself .
* This expression is also convenient to mark a distinction from those substances equally essential in a human diet , for the prevention of scurvy , which may be referred to as " anti-scorbutic vitamiues .

, the The modern " roller " milling of wheat effects so perfect a separation of the constituent parts of the grain that trustworthy material for experiment is readily obtained .
During the " break " of the grain by the rollers the pericarp , being brittle , is broken up into bran , while the embryo , being soft and oily , is squeezed out flat .
The subsequent operations of milling , which include such processes as sieving , fanning and centrifuging , lead to a complete separation of these two products .
With rice , however , this is not the case , and the few experiments we made with rice germ were made with materials separated by hand in the laboratory .
Methods Employed .
Polyneuritis of birds has been accepted as analogous to beri-beri in human beings with regard to etiology , symptoms , and methods of cure .
The following experiments were , therefore , made with pigeons of 300-400 grm. weight , and were of two kinds , the methods adopted being in principle those used by Cooper ( 1913 and 1914 ) , working in this Institute .
( 1 ) Preventive , in which determination was made of the minimum amounts of the various materials in question , that must be added to a ( relatively ) vitamine-free diet in order to prevent the occurrence of polyneuritis .
Polished rice , about 40 grm. daily , formed the vitamine-free diet , and prevention was considered to be successfully accomplished if the bird showed no symptoms of polyneuritis after a period of about 60 days .
Unprotected birds usually developed symptoms in 15-25 days .
( 2 ) Curative , in which determination was made of the minimal amount which , administered by the mouth , would cure a bird suffering from acute polyneuritis .
A bird in this condition , brought on by an exclusive diet of polished rice , will usually die within 24-48 hours if not treated .
In order to be able to administer the requisite amount of curative substance in time Cooper ( loc. cit. ) concentrated the vitamines by extracting the air-dried material with absolute alcohol in the cold and evaporating the alcoholic extract to dryness under reduced pressure .
This residue was taken up in a small volume of water and definite quantities were given by the mouth , the doses being reckoned in terms of the original foodstuffs .
We found it possible , however , in most cases , to give the curative doses of the original materials without preliminary extraction .
By this means we gained a better idea of their absolute vitamine value in the natural condition , and avoided the loss due to the extraction processes .
Our method , however , has its drawbacks , as , unless the crop of the bird is fairly empty at the time when a cure is essayed , digestion and absorption will be slow and difficult .
In addition , these processes are frequently interfered with by the paralysis of the bird , so that cures are often slow ( 24 hours to 3 or 4 days ) in progress , and it is unusual Deficiency of ivhich causes Beri-beri in Man .
47 to see the swift dramatic changes ( in 6-24 hours ) so typical of the cure of polvneuritis in birds , when the vitamine is administered in a soluble form .
Nevertheless , with the exception of a small proportion of cases , where the character of the symptoms and the general condition were unsuitable , cures can usually be accomplished if the amount of vitamine given is adequate .
Some examples are given in Tables V and VI below , in which similar material was used for cures both before and after concentration of the active substance by extraction .
In the case of wheat germ , the curative dose was found to be equal to 2-5 grin , of the original material ; after extraction , the equivalent of 15 grm. was required , which result shows the large proportion of vitamine lost by the extraction process .
In the case of comparative curative experiments the difficulty is , firstly , to form a judgment of the severity of the symptoms , and , secondly , to obtain a sufficiency of acute cases in which this shall be approximately equal .
This difficulty was not altogether overcome , as will be seen in the somewhat irregular results of the experiments described below , especially those set forth in Table VI .
Preventive experiments form the more satisfactory method of estimating the vitamine-content in foodstuffs and yield much more regular results .
The drawback is that they take at least two months to complete , and , if adopted exclusively , would limit the scope of any enquiry .
Feeding was artificial in both cases and the rice rations given in the Tables must be regarded as approximate only , since the birds frequently vomited small amounts after feeding .
In case of the wTheat-bran and wheat-germ rations , no significant amount of vomiting was noticed , nor was the rice vomited when these substances were added to the diet .
Wheat Embryo.\#151 ; Tables I and II give the results of preventive experiments with two different samples of wheat germ , and in each case a series of birds was arranged to act as control , with a diet consisting exclusively of polished rice .
The results of these two sets of experiments are in concordance ; in both a ration of 3 grm. wheat germ , given every second day , was found to afford complete protection from polyneuritis .
With 2 grm. every second day , half the birds used in each experiment were protected .
Wheat Bran.\#151 ; The wheat bran used for comparison with the wheat germ was what is known as " Broad bran , " and the sample E.I. ( Table III ) was obtained from the same wheat as germ R.I. ( Table II ) and white flour R.I. ( Table IV ) .
It consisted of large particles , and in its thickness comprised all the outer layers of the grain .
Traces of the starchy endosperm were visible upon the inside surface , and the presence of the aleurone-layer was demonstrated by sections .
The sample R.I. was obtained from a modern 48 Miss H. Chick and Miss E. M. Hume .

Birds receiving a ration of 3 grin , every second day developed polyneuritis in the same time as those upon an exclusive polished rice diet ; with 5 grm. every second day the onset of symptoms was postponed for about two weeks .
If the results of Table III be compared with Table II one may regard the anti-neuritic value of 5 grm. of broad bran as equivalent to T5 grm. germ .
On general grounds it would seem not unlikely that what value the bran possesses must be attributed to the aleurone-layer , which forms only a small proportion of the whole .
Hamill ( 1911 ) states that the aleurone-layer forms about 4 per cent , of the grain and the pericarp about 15 per cent. He gives no authority for these figures , and it is difficult to see that they can be other than approximate .
On this basis , the aleurone-layer would constitute about one-fifth of the bran , and , weight for weight , be about equal to the embryo as regards vitamine-content .
It is interesting to note the greater anti-neuritic power of the broad bran derived from stone-milled wheat ( see Sample A , Table III ) .
In this case .no separation of the germ is effected in the milling , and each constituent issuing from the mill contains some of it .

, the amount of water .
By experience this ration was found to he as much as they could assimilate .
Polyneuritis occurred in each instance , and the time of onset was , if anything , rather earlier than that occurring with a series of control birds fed on polished rice .
There was also no significant difference in the loss of weight suffered by the birds in the two series of experiments .
Curative Experiments .
In Table Y are given the results of some curative experiments made with ( 1 ) wheat germ , and ( 2 ) wheat ''middlings , " or the finely ground bran , which is probably not free from admixture with germ .
In both cases the vitamines were concentrated by the extraction process with alcohol described above ( p. 46 ) .
The relative curative values of these two materials were found to be in the ratio of about 5'5 to 1 , if we judge by the " great improvement " obtained with the extracts equivalent to 9 and 50 grm. respectively in the two instances .
It is necessary to define here what is meant by the various types of cure described in Tables Yand YI .
The expression ' complete cure " indicates that both flight and gait were perfectly restored ; " cure " that one or both remained slightly imperfect , while " incomplete cure " is used to describe a rather less satisfactory condition .

It should be added , perhaps , that these expressions deal with symptoms alone , and that nothing is assumed with regard to the actual lesions .
It is obviously impossible that if axon degeneration is present this can be restored in the short period occupied by the " cure .
" The quality of the cure was also studied by continuing the diet of polished rice and noting the time elapsing before the recurrence of polyneuritis symptoms .
I urther curative experiments with wheat germ are set forth in Table VI .
Here no extraction with alcohol took place , but the moistened germ was given in the form of boluses , which were readily swallowed by the bird .
The results of this experiment , compared with those given in Table V , show how great is the loss of vitamine due to the extraction process , and how small , comparatively ( from 1 to 2'5 grm. ) , is the amount of wheat germ required to effect a cure when given in the natural condition .
The results also show the degree of irregularity that must be expected in this type of experiment ( see above , p. 47 ) .
This is doubtless due to 54 Miss H. Chick and Miss E. M. Hume .
Substance , the differences in the nature and severity of the symptoms in the different birds , all of whom were acutely ill , and in certain cases also to difficulty in digesting and absorbing the curative material .
Those cases in which the action of the crop was affected by polyneuritis are by far the hardest to cure , and probably should be disregarded in any attempt to estimate vitamine-content in the substances administered as cures .
From Table VI one may conclude that 2-5 grm. of wheat embryo may generally be relied upon to cure acute polyneuritis in a pigeon of 300-400 grm. weight ; at the same time , cures were obtained , exceptionally , with 1 grm. , and occasionally with 1*5 and 2 grm. For comparison with the above , some curative experiments were made with " broad bran , " this being again chosen as likely to provide a specimen of pericarp free from any admixture of germ .
In one case we failed to effect a complete cure with 10 grm. , and in another we obtained no improvement with 5 grm. , while in a third instance we obtained a cure with 5 grm. These experiments present special difficulties as regards their correct interpretation ; the bran is very bulky , the dose is large , and difficulties of absorption correspondingly enhanced .
In fact , a much more trustworthy estimate of the relative vitamine values of wheat pericarp and embryo , weight for weight , are obtained when the vitamines are concentrated and administered in a soluble form as in Table V ( 1 : 5'5 ) , or , better still , when the results of preventive experiments are used to make the comparison ( 1*5 : 5 , see Tables I-III ) .
Bice .
We have only made a few preliminary experiments with rice , owing to the difficulty in obtaining material .
Some little work has , however , been accomplished , using rice embryo separated from the unmilled grain by hand , in the laboratory .
The rice embryo is extremely small , and amounts only to about 2'5 per cent , by weight of the husked grain , so that the work is exceedingly laborious ; only a small amount of material was obtained , and all the experiments were perforce of the curative type .
The rice-bran used for comparison was a sample kindly furnished by a firm of rice millers , and contained both pericarp and embryo .
The experiments with embryo demonstrated the high concentration of vitamine in this organ ; the birds showed some improvement in symptoms after administration of 0*3 grm. , and better results , almost amounting to cures , after 0'5 grm. , while a dose of 1 grm. gave a complete cure lasting nine days .
In case of the bran , a distinct improvement was manifested on one occasion after receiving 4 and 6 grm. respectively .
In one case improvement was also noticed Deficiency of which causes Man , 55 after 5 grm. , and in a second case , not so severe as the first , a complete cure was effected .
Complete cures were obtained after doses of 8 and 10 grm. on more than one occasion .
Maize .
A few trials have been made with maize embryo , which also has proved to be very rich in anti-neuritic vitamine .
In this cereal the embryo is comparatively large , and it was easily picked out by hand , especially if the grain were soaked in water overnight .
After this treatment the embryo amounted to 15 per cent , by weight of the entire grain .
In the case of maize , the plumule ( shoot ) and radicle ( root ) of the embryo can be separated with ease from the scutellum , which organ is exceedingly large , and amounts to about 12*5 per cent , of the soaked grain , while the plantlet comprises the remaining 2*5 per cent. Both parts of the embryo , however , proved to be receptacles of vitamine .
Cures were achieved with 1 and 2 grm. of the wetted plantlet ( equivalent to 0*6 and 0'7 grm. dry weight respectively ) .
A complete cure , lasting 13 days , followed a dose of 2 grm. ( dry weight ) of the entire germ ( scutellum , plumule , and radicle ) , and a less satisfactory result with 3 grm. ( dry weight ) of scutellum .
Smaller quantities than these were not given , and it is hoped later to investigate this cereal further .
Relation between the Preventive Ration and the Curative Dose .
A very curious result has emerged from the foregoing experiments , viz. , the very close approximation between the daily ration of wheat germ required to prevent the onset of polyneuritis , and the dose necessary to cure a bird in the acute condition .
While 3 grm. must be added every second day to a diet of polished rice , to prevent polyneuritis with certainty ( see Tables I and II ) , the curative dose is found to be only 2*5 grm. , and in exceptional cases 1 grm. sufficed .
These curative doses cause disappearance of polyneuritic symptoms , brought on by the exclusive diet of polished rice , and the bird is usually maintained in good health for several days , notwithstanding the deficiency in its food ( see Table YI ) .
After this period recurrence of symptoms again takes place .
This relation between the preventive ration and the curative dose is not confined to any particular anti-neuritic substance , but appears to be general .
In case of a yeast-extract ( water-content = 30 per cent. ) , the daily preventive dose was found to be from 1 to 2 grm. , and the curative dose from 2 to 3 grm. , occasionally 1 grm. This result is in accord with the observations of Cooper , who ( 1913 ) found that 2*5 grm. pressed yeast ( dry weight = 0*5 grm. ) , given daily , would prevent polyneuritis in pigeons fed otherwise with 56 Miss H. Chick and Miss E. M. Hume .
Substance , the polished rice .
In order to cure pigeons suffering from acute polyneuritis ( 1914 , II ) , he used autolysed yeast , and found it necessary to administer the equivalent of 3-6 grm. of the original pressed yeast ; on a second occasion the equivalent of 1-2 grm. was sufficient .
There are no other good instances available , because curative experiments have almost universally been made with material which has been extracted with alcohol to concentrate the vitamine , while , for the preventive experiments , the natural foodstuffs have been used .
As pointed out above , there is a great loss of anti-neuritic material in the extraction process as usually carried out .
Hence the stated amounts required for the cure of animals show an exaggerated size when reckoned on the original foodstuffs .
That the preventive and curative doses are of the same order of magnitude is perplexing , and demands further investigation .
In order to obtain some light upon this point we are making a series of preventive experiments in which the total amount of vitamine is kept constant , but the dosage , i.e. , size and periodicity of the dose , is varied .
These experiments are not yet completed , but the only interpretation which the facts seem capable of carrying at present is that : ( 1 ) There is an urgent daily need for a small quantity of this vital substance to maintain the metabolism of the nerve tissue ; ( 2 ) In the normal condition a considerable store is available somewhere in the animal body upon which to draw ; and ( 3 ) This store becomes suddenly exhausted , but ean be temporarily restored by the administration of a small quantity from outside .
Influence of a Small Regular Ration of Wheat-Embryo in Maintaining the t Weight of Birds Fed on Polished Rice .
It has been shown by numerous observers that birds fed exclusively on polished rice lose consistently in weight .
In our experience , the average loss of weight under these conditions varied from 11 to 22 per cent , over a mean period varying from 17 to 22 days ( see control experiments , Tables I-IV ) .
When a ration of wheat was given insufficient to prevent the onset of polyneuritis ( i.e. , from 0'5 to T5 grm. every second day ) , this loss in weight was not exceeded , although the mean period of the experiment lasted from 22 to 35 days ( see Tables I and II ) .
When the wheat ration was adequate for protection against polyneuritis ( i.e. , 3 grm. every second day ) , in one instance ( Expt. 4 , Table I ) the average loss of weight was negligible , viz. , \#151 ; 4 per cent. , and in a second ( Lxpt .
3 , Table II ) a gain in weight was observed , viz. , + 8 per cent. The total weight Deficiency of which causes in Man .
57 gained by the seven birds in these two experiments was 72 grm. , or a gain of about 10 grm. per bird .
In Expt. 3 , Table I , and Expt. 2 , Table II , where 2 grm. wheat germ was given every second day , and polyneuritis was not prevented with certainty , there was an average loss of weight of 16 and 10 per cent , respectively , or a total loss of 365 grm. among the eight birds studied , i.e. , 46 grm. per bird .
The average difference in weight between individuals in the above two series of experiments is therefore 56 grm. This must be referred to a difference in diet amounting to 05 grm. wheat germ daily over a period of about 60 days , i.e. , a total of 30 grm. per head .
It is therefore evident that the addition to a diet of polished rice of wheat germ in amount to prevent polyneuritis has also some influence in promoting the general metabolism of the animal .
This result is in accord with the observation of Schaumann ( 1911 ) , who found that if a ration of a vitamine-containing foodstuff ( such as rice-bran or yeast ) were adequate to prevent onset of polyneuritis in birds , when added to a diet of polished rice , loss of weight was prevented , whereas extracts of these foodstuffs prepared by extraction with acid or alcohol , sufficient to prevent polyneuritis , did not maintain weight .
Our experiments with wheat-bran offer another example of this principle .
Where the bran was free from germ , as in sample R.I. ( Table III ) , a ration of 5 grm. each second day did not prevent polyneuritis , nor did it maintain weight .
In case of sample A , which was stone-milled , and presumably contained traces of germ , a ration equal to 5 grm. each second day more nearly protected a pigeon from polyneuritis , and there was no appreciable loss of weight .
Cooper ( 1913 ) came to the conclusion that the substances preventing polyneuritis and maintaining body weight were separate and might be separately distributed in natural foodstuffs .
For certain of these , e.g. yeast , ox-heart and ox-brain , the two substances were evenly balanced and the daily ration required to prevent polyneuritis also maintained the weight of the bird .
In others , e.g. egg-yolk , barley , lentils , this daily ration had to be increased if loss of weight were also to be prevented .
In this connection our experiments in which casein was added to a diet of polished rice ( set out in Table VII ) are of some interest .
The casein , prepared from milk by precipitation and subjected to some purification , proved to be vitamine-free , as was expected ; the addition of the extra protein had no influence upon the onset of polyneuritis .
With the addition to the diet of 3 grm. of this casein daily , however , the weight of the birds was certainly maintained better than was the case with the control birds fed on polished rice alone .

( 'Bulletin No. 45 , U.S. Department of Agriculture ' ; Tibbie 's " Foods , " 1912 , p. 474 ) .
A ration of wheat germ equal to 4 grm. every second day , which is slightly in excess of that .
necessary to prevent polyneuritis , had a marked beneficial influence upon the general health and well-being of the birds ( Expt. 5 , Table I ) .
When this allowance was further exceeded , as in Expt. 6 , Table I , where 3 grm. wheat germ were given daily , the effect was even more noticeable .
The increase in weight of the two birds employed amounted , in a period of two months , to 25 and 35 per cent , respectively of their original weight , and the birds displayed unusual energy and vitality .
They became wilder and more quarrelsome ; they could not be kept together in one cage , as was our custom , seeing that they fought one another with great vigour , if permitted .
They would also resist being taken up and examined , and if the cage were opened , would usually take up a sideways position at bay , striking out with the wing against any invader .
All this demeanour is in very marked contrast to the gentleness characteristic of birds which are artificially fed and subjected to the large amount of handling which is involved in this type of experiment .
Deficiency of which causes in Man .
59 Summary and Conclusions .
1 .
The foregoing experiments deal with ; the distribution of " anti-neuritic ( anti-beri-beri ) vitamines " in the various contituents of the wheat , maize , and rice grains .
By " anti-neuritic vitamine " is meant the substance whose deficiency in a diet causes polyneuritis in pigeons and beri-beri in man .
2 .
Wheat-endosperm , after removal of the aleurone-layer in the ordinary milling processes , constitutes white flour .
It is deficient in this vitamine , and if used as an exclusive diet will induce polyneuritis in pigeons ( or beri-beri in man ) in a manner identical with polished rice .
3 .
In both the rice and wheat grain , the anti-neuritic vitamine is concentrated mainly in the germ or embryo ; it is also present to a less degree in the bran ( pericarp and aleurone-layer ) , probably in the aleurone-layer .
4 .
In case of maize grain , the embryo also ' possesses marked anti-neuritic properties .
Here the scutellum can be separated from the " plantlet " and separately investigated .
Both these constituents of the embryo were found to contain anti-neuritic vitamine .
5 .
The practical results given under 2 and 3 show the importance of including germ in the flour from which wheaten bread or biscuit is made , especially when the diet may consist largely of preserved foods , e.g. tinned meats and vegetables , which are deficient in anti-beri-beri vitamines .
6 .
The daily ration of wheat-germ that must be added to a diet of polished rice in order to prevent the onset of polyneuritis is of the same order of magnitude as the amount which , administered by the mouth , will cure a pigeon acutely ill with polyneuritis , brought on by an exclusive diet of polished rice .
This relation is not peculiar to wheat-germ but applies to other foodstuffs containing anti-neuritic vitamines , e.g. yeast .
7 .
The addition of wheat-germ to a diet of polished rice in quantity ( 3 grm. every second day ) sufficient to prevent polyneuritis , also maintained the weight and general health of the bird .
Rations in excess of this ( 2 grm. every day to 3 grm. every day ) led to great increase in body-weight and in general well being and vitality of the birds , which , after a short period of this diet , became in remarkably fine condition .
In conclusion , our best thanks are due to Messrs. Steel and Co. ( rice millers ) , to The Ho vis Milling Co. , and to Messrs. J. and H. Robinson ( wheat millers ) , for kindness in supplying us with material for experiment , and especially to Mr. E. G. Ellis , of the last-named firm , for much valuable advice and assistance .

The Effect of Exposure to Temperatures at or above 100 ' C. upon the Substance ( Vitamine ) whose Deficiency in a Diet causes Polyneuritis in Birds and Beri-Beri in .

) The influence of exposure to high temperatures upon the 44 vitamine , " whose deficiency in a diet causes polyneuritis in birds and beri-beri in man , is a subject of great practical importance , chiefly for two reasons .
In the first place , it is very necessary to know what degree of destruction , if any , is suffered by the vitamines contained in ordinary foodstuffs during the usual cooking processes , at or about 100 ' C. In the second place , there is the case of preserved foods , such as tinned meat , vegetables , milk , etc. , which are sterilised at temperatures above 100 ' C. in the process of their manufacture .
