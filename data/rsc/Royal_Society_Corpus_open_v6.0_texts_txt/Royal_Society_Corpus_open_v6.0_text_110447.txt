A paper was also read , entitled , " Discovery of the Metamorphoses in the second Type of the Cirripedes , viz. the Lepades , completing the Natural History of these singular Animals , and confirming their affinity with the Crustacea .
" By J. V. Thompson , Esq. , F.L.S. , Deputy Inspector General of Hospitals .
Communicated by Sir James Macgrigor , Bart. , M.D. , F.R.S. The discoveries madeby the authorof the remarkable metamorphoses which the animals composing the first family of the Cirripedes , or Balani , undergo in the progress of their developement , and which he has published in the third number of his Zoological Researches ( p. 76 ) , are in the present paper , which is intended as a prize Essay for one of the Royal Medals , followed up by the report of his discovery of similar changes exhibited by three species of two other genera of the second tribe of this family , namely , the Lepades .
The larvae of this tribe , like those of the Balani , have the external appearance of bivalve Monoculi , furnished with locomotive organs , in the form ofthree pairs of members , the most anterior of which are simple and the other bifid .
The back of the animal is covered by an ample shield , terminatinganteriorly in two extended horns , and posteriorlyin a single elongated spinous process .
Thus they possess considerable powers of locomotion , which , with the assistance of an organ of vision , enable them to seek their future per ?
manent place of residence .
The author is led from his researches to the conclusion that the Cirripedes do not constitute , as modern na ?
turalists have considered them , a distinct class of animals , but that they occupy a place intermediate between the Crustacea decapoda , with which the Balani have a marked affinity , and the Crustacea entomostraca , to which the Lepades are allied 3 and that they have no natural affinity with the Testaceous Mollusca , as was supposed by Linnaeus , and all the older systematic writers on Zoology .
