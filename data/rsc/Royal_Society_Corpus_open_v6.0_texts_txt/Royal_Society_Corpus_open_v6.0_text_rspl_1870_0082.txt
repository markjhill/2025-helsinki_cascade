( Abstract .
) It is well known that one metal has the power of decomposing the salts of certain other metals , and that the chemical change will proceed until the more powerful metal has entirely taken the place of the other .
The authors have investigated what takes place during the process .
The experiments were generally performed as follows :\#151 ; 72 cubic centimetres of an aqueous solution of the salt of known strength , and at , 12 ' Centigrade , were placed in a tall glass ; a perfectly clean plate of metal of 3230 square millimetres was weighed and placed vertically in this solution without reaching either to the top or bottom ; the action was allowed to proceed quietly for ten minutes , when the plate was removed , and the deposited metal was washed off .
The loss of weight gave the amount of metal dissolved , and represented the chemical action .
The most complete series of results was with copper and nitrate of silver .

] Law in Chemical Dynamics .
499 is shown in the 5th and 6th columns .
The law then breaks down , and after about 7 per cent , the increased action is almost in direct ratio with the increased strength .
The position of the plate in the solution was found to make no difference to this 2\#151 ; 3 law .
Similar series of experiments were made with zinc and chloride of copper , zinc and sulphate of copper , zinc and nitrate of lead , iron and sulphate of copper , and other combinations ; and in every instance where the solution was weak and the action simple , the law of three times the chemical change for twice the strength was found to hold good .
It was proved that the breaking down of the law at about 3*5 per cent , of salt in solution was irrespective of the quantity of the liquid , or of the time for which the plate was exposed .
With 72 cub. centims. of a 1*41 per cent , solution of nitrate of silver the rate of action remained sensibly the same for as long as twenty-five minutes , notwithstanding the constant deposition of silver .
This apparently paradoxical result is due to fresh relays of the original solution being brought up to the plate by the currents produced , and that period of time elapsing before any of the products of decomposition are brought hack again in their circuit .
~ When it was perceived that within easily ascertainable limits the chemical action is the same for similar consecutive periods of time , experiments were made in far weaker solutions .
It was only necessary to lengthen the time of exposure* It was thus found that the law of three times the chemical action for twice the strength of solution holds good through at least eleven terms of the powers of 2 ; in fact , from a solution that could dissolve one gramme of copper during the hour , to a solution that dissolved only O'000001 gramme , a million times less .
The manner in which the silver is deposited on a copper plate was examined , and the currents produced were studied .
At first a light blue current is perceived flowing upwards from the surface of the plate , presently a deep blue current pours downwards , and these two currents in opposite directions continue to form sirmiltaneously .
A similar phenomenon was observed in every case where a metallic salt attacked a plate of anotner metal .
The downward current was found to be a solution of almost pure nitrate of copper , containing about three times as much N03 as the original silver solution , while the upward current was a diluted solution of the mixed nitrates .
Moreover the heavy current took its rise in the entangled mass of crystals right against the plate , while the light current flowed from the tops of the crystalline branches .
It was evident that when the fresh silver was deposited on these branches , and the fresh copper taken up from the plate , there was not merely a transference of the nitric element from one combination to another , but an actual molecular movement of it towards the copper plate , producing an accumulation of nitrate of copper there , and a corresponding loss of salt in the liquid that is drawn within the influence of the branching crystals .
Hence the opposite currents .

[ June 15 , The amount of action in a circuit of two metals and a saline solution must have as one of its regulating conditions the conducting-power of that solution .
It appeared by experiment that a strong solution of nitrate of silver offers less resistance than a weak one ; and it was also found , on adding nitrate of potassium to the nitrate of silver , that its power of attacking the copper plate was increased , that the augmentation of the foreign salt increased the action still further , and that the 2-3 law holds good between two solutions in which both the silver and potassium salt are doubled , though it does not hold good if the quantity of foreign salt be kept constant .
Similar results were obtained with mixed nitrates of silver and copper .
While these later experiments offer an explanation of the fact that a solution of double the strength produces more than double the chemical action , they do not explain why it should produce exactly three times the effect , or why the ratio should be the same in all substitutions of this nature hitherto tried .
The simplicity and wide range of the 2-3 law seem to indicate that it is a very primary one in chemical dynamics .

( Abstract .
) The Lepidodendron selaginoides described by Mr. Binney , and still more recently by Mr. Carruthers , is taken as the standard of comparison for numerous other forms .
It consists of a central medullary axis composed of a combination of transversely barred vessels with similarly barred cells ; the vessels are arranged without any special linear order .
This tissue is closely surrounded by a second and narrower ring , also of barred vessels , but of smaller size , and arranged in vertical laminae which radiate from within outwards .
These laminae are separated by short vertical piles of cells , believed to be medullary rays .
In the transverse section the intersected mouths of the vessels form radiating lines , and the whole structure is regarded as an early type of an exogenous cylinder ; it is from this cylinder alone that the vascular bundles going to the leaves are given off .
Ihis woody zone is surrounded by a very thick cortical layer , which is parenchymatous at its inner part , the cells being without definite order ; but externally they become prosenchymatous , and are arranged in radiating lines , which latter tendency is observed to manifest itself whenever the bark-cells assume the prosenchymatous type .
Outside the bark is an epidermal layer , separated from the rest of the bark by a thin bast-layer of prosenchyma , the cells of which are developed into a tubular and almost vascular form ; but the vessels are never barred , being essentially of the fibrous type .
