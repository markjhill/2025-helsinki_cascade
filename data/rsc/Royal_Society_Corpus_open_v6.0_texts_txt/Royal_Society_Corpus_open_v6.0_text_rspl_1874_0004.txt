" On Musical Duodenes , or the Theory of Constructing Instruments with Fixed Tones in Just or Practically Just Intonation .
" By Alexander J. Ellis , F.R.S. , F.S.A. , F.C.P.S. , F.C.P. Received October 28 , 1874 .
This paper is intended to complete and supplement three papers on Music which I have already read before the Royal Society ' .
It contains a more complete theory of temperament , embracing that indicated by Helmholtz2 , but not worked out by him , and its application to the theory of constructing musical instruments with an intonation practically just , without change of fingering , and , if there are three or four performers , without change of mechanism .
The name Duodene refers to that collection of twelve notes , suitable to the present manuals , which is made the unit of construction .
To obtain its precise form , and determine the number and value of all such duodenes as it is necessary to tune , I have been obliged to indicate a theory of harmonic scales and modulation , which I believe to be entirely new , and which has of course other uses .
The great extent of the subject obliges me to confine this part of my paper to a mere indication .
A. Notation of Pitch .
The letters C , D , E , F , G , A , B indicate both musical tones and the number of vibrations made by the prime or lowest partial tone of each in a second ; so that , C being known , D = |C , E=f C , F=|C , G=f C , A = fC , B = MC .
The marks ftt\gt ; t iIT Jt a^e used for fractional multipliers , having the following names and values:\#151 ; , " 135 " , " " 128 sharp , % = J28 5 flat\gt ; 9 = 135 ' , 4 , 81 .

^ = ye The precise pitch of every tone is therefore indicated by its symbol , when C is known .
When Italic letters are used , Ot , C , c , c ' , c " , \amp ; c. indicate Octaves , and C is the pitch of the lowest note of the violoncello .
When Homan letters are used , no such relative values are attributed to large and small letters .
B. Temperament .
All intervals here considered can be made up of Fifths , major Thirds , and Octaves , taken up or down .
In other words , the ratio of the vibration-numbers of any two tones can be represented by .
2P , where m , n , and p are zero , or some positive or negative integers .
In Table I. the ratios of the vibrational numbers of all the tones in the same horizontal line is .
2** , and in the same vertical column is .
2f , the p or Octave being left indeterminate .
If , then , we proceed from any note supposed to be the lower , first horizontally to the column containing a second note , supposed to be higher and in the same Octave , and then vertically to the second note itself , and multiply or divide by 7 for each horizontal step , according as it is to the right or left , and multiply or divide by 5 for each vertical step , according as it is upwards or downwards , and finally multiply or divide the result by 2 , until the final result lies between 1 and 2 , that fraction will be the ratio of the higher vibrational number to the lower .
Thus 0 to F# gives C to E , E to B , 3 3 5 / 3\ 2 45 2 ; B to F# , g ; and g. UJ = jg , which , being greater than 2 , on being divided by 2 gives the correct ratio of the Tritone C to F# as An inspection of the Table then shows that JD to JG# , +Gb to tC , \lt ; fcc .
are the same intervals as C to F# , because they have the same relative position , and this is sometimes very convenient .
But as 2 , 3 , 5 are primes , no one tone in Table I. , supposing it to be indefinitely extended , will have the same pitch as any other tone .
The object of Temperament generally is to obviate this inconvenience , by slightly altering the ratios of the Fifth or major Third , or both .
From doing so , as Helmholtz has proved , more or less dissonance must result .
1874.1 Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
Another object , therefore , is to make that dissonance as little annoying as possible .

As they contain 4 unknown expressions , two may be assumed and the rest found , giving rise to an endless variety of temperaments .
Without discussing these generally , the following cases should be mentioned :\#151 ; Commatic System ( for which Tc\#151 ; 1).\#151 ; This is the only system discussed in my previous paper , where 50 cases were considered .
1 .
Quintal or Pythagorean Temperament .
Assume 1 , and V="* then by ( 7 ) , log +4-log H=log whence by ( 8 ) , log T=log | + log + .
This temperament proves to be thoroughly unsuitable for harmony .
2 .

Assume \amp ; = 1 and T=| , then by ( 8 ) , 2 log t\#151 ; log f\#151 ; log s ; whence by ( 7 ) , Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
[ Nov. 19 , log V=log \log + .
In my previous paper I have shown this to be the best suited for harmony of all in this system ; but it requires 27 tones to the Octave .
3 .
Hemitonic or Equal Temperament .
Assume 1 , and also = 1 , then by ( 7 ) , log V=log |\#151 ; j2'0'g \#166 ; t+log IF ) , by ( 8 ) , _ t log T=log 1+ i .
( 2 log t-log IF ) .
Since log t= 0*005 3950 319 ( whence ^ log += 0*000 4904 574 ) and log 5F = 0*000 4901 071 , we may , for all acoustical purposes , assume log 5F=yT t\#187 ; an\lt ; ^ bence that log V=log ^ .
log +=log log f , log T=log .
log t=log | + 7 log % This is the only uniform temperament which requires no more than 12 tones , and hence , although very ill suited to harmony , it has been theoretically adopted by almost all musicians .
SJchismatic System ( for which s=l ) .
4 .
SJchismic or Arabic , according to Helmholtz 's indication ( op .
cit. p. 441 ) .
Assume s=l and V=g ; then by ( 7 ) , log Jc= log t+log IF , and by ( 8 ) , log T=log log f .
The Arabs tune 17 tones to form 16 perfect Fifths , and thus obtain 8 major Thirds which are only one skhisma too flat .
But they do not use harmony in our sense of the word , although this would give almost just intonation in certain keys .
5 .
SJchistic , or Helmholtzian , as it may be called , because suggested by Helmholtz ( op .
cit. p. 495 ) .
Assume s=l and T = r ; then by ( 8 ) , 2 log Tc =2 log t\#151 ; log % and by ( 7 ) , log Y= log |log f. The name slchistic is derived from s7chist , or by abbreviation \lt ; t , which is Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .

] my name for \#163 ; /1T .
Since log +=88 log cr very nearly , one comma may be said to contain 88 skhists .
Skhistic temperament is indistinguishable [ from just intonation , and 1 shall use it in the theory of constructing instruments .
If in Table I. we suppose the horizontal intervals to be still I r g gj but the vertical intervals to be and the sign + to stand for Sq V Jt\gt ; while ++=1 as before , then this Table represents skhistic relations ; so that if from any note , as E[\gt ; ( col .
5 , line # ) , we proceed by 8 skhistic Fifths up to +B and then one major Third to the right , we find a tone D# , which , when reduced to the same Octave , is identical with E[\gt ; .
We thus find a number of sJchistic synonyms shown in Tables II .
\amp ; III .
We may express the errors in the temperaments just discussed in terms of skhists thus , using #56\lt ; 7 to mean " too sharp by 56 skhists , " and so on , and 0 to mean " no error \#151 ; Just .

( 9,10 ) Take any integral values for q and z , and find the integral values which satisfy one of these indeterminate equations for v , m , or t , m , and substitute in the other , taking the resulting integral values of or respectively .
The five integral values determine a cycle in which the Octave is divided into m aliquot parts , which may be termed octs , v of which make a Fifth , t a major Third , q a comma , and z a skhisma of " the cycle of m " Most of the results are valueless , but the following present either theoretical convenience or historical interest:\#151 ; Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .

1 .
The cycle of 30103 is such an excellent representative of just intonation ( giving even 6 octs for the skhist ) , that it can be used without sensible error , in place of ordinary logarithms , to reduce the relations of intervals to addition and subtraction , for general use among musicians or learners unacquainted with higher arithmetic .
By dividing out by 100,000 we obtain almost precisely the five-figure logarithms of the intervals .
2 .
The cycle of 3010 is almost as correct , with smaller numbers .
3 .
The cycle of 301 is almost a perfect representation of skhistic temperament , in which the skhisma is eliminated , and for that reason becomes perhaps the most practical representation of general musical intonation .
4 .
The first cycle of 53 is Nicholas Mercator 's representation of just intonation , but it is more correctly a representation of skhistic temperament , and not so good as No. 31 , 5 .
The second cycle of 53 is a very accurate representation of Pythagorean intonation , and has actually been proposed for the violin by Drobisch .
6 .
The cycle of 31 is Huyghens 's Cyclus Harmonious , and closely represents the tertian or mean temperament .
7 .
The cycle of 12 is the ordinary equal temperament , and its principal convenience consists in the very small number of its octs , here called Semitones .
Unequal Temperaments , whether they consist of 12 selected tones from uniform temperaments , or of 12 tones turned intentionally false ( see my former paper , Proc. vol. xiii .
pp. 414-417 , for their theory ) , are now abandoned .
But the difficulty of tuning equal temperament by estimation of ear , or even by the monochord , and of retaining the intonation of the piano or organ unchanged for even an hour , makes all temperaments in actual use really unequal .
The difficulty of original tuning by estimation 1 When this paper was read , I mentioned that this was the cycle used by Mr. JBosanquet in his paper read before the Royal Society on 30th January , 1873 .
Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
1874 .
] of ear in the case of skhistic temperament , where the Fifths have to be flattened by an almost inaudible skhist , is so much enhanced as to be insuperable except by Scheibler 's method1 .
Hence it is necessary to find a practical substitute .
This I term Unequally Just Intonation.\#151 ; Suppose that the 48 tones marked off by a dotted line in Table I. have to be tuned in this substitute for skhistic intonation .
Tune C to the fork .
Take 4 just Fifths up ( or Fourths down ) , C to G , G to D , D to +A , fA to +E , without beats ; and three just Fifths down ( or Fourths up ) , C to F , F to B[\gt ; , to Efc\gt ; .
Then tune C to E as a just major Third up , without beats , and from E proceed to its just Fifth B , verifying the result by determining that it is a just major Third above G , and so on to G# up and f G down .
Then if from G# we proceeded to the just Fifth , D# , the resulting tone would be exactly one skhisma sharper than Ef ?
, whereas in skhistic intonation it would be identical with BUp , as already shown .
It is needless to say that no tuner could effect this exact difference of a skhisma , but he will come practically near it , and the error is that of the Fifth ( the least of the errors ) in equal temperament .
If we were to proceed in this way for all the six columns of 8 tones marked off in Table I. , we should have just major Thirds throughout , and just Fifths also in all but 5 cases\#151 ; namely , \#163 ; D## to \#163 ; B , B % to \#163 ; G\#187 ; G# to E| ?
, +E to Qp , and +C to fA^ , each of which would be too flat by one skhisma .
Since \#163 ; G ( Table I. col .
6 , line x ) is a just major Third below +B , and a just minor Third above JE , but \#163 ; E is a whole skhisma flatter than ( col .
8 , line p ) , which would be played for \#163 ; E , it follows that the minor Third , +D## to \#163 ; G , would be a skhisma too flat or close ; and similarly that the minor Thirds , B# to E| ?
, G# to Op , and tE to tAJpJ } , or 4 minor Thirds on the whole , would be a skhisma too flat1 2 .
Hence this style of tuning gives 5 Fifths and 4 minor Thirds , as 1 Calculate the logarithms of the ratios of all the skhistic tones by perpetual addition or subtraction of 0*1760300 ( =log f\#151 ; log a ) to or from 0 , continually adding or subtracting 0*3010300 ( =log 2 ) to make the results positive and lie between this and 0 .
Add the logarithm of the vibrational number of C , and then find the numbers ( to three places of decimals ) corresponding to these logarithms .
This gives the vibrational numbers of all the skhistic tones in the Octave , of which 48 will be required .
Subtract 4 from each of these values , and procure tuning-forks giving exactly the tones thus determined to at least the hundredth of a vibration in a second .
These may be obtained of the great manufacturer of acoustic apparatus , Mons. It .
Koenig , of Paris ; but it is necessary to state that the English and German ( not the French ) system of counting vibrations is to be used .
Then tune each tone roughly to the corresponding fork , and afterwards sharpen it until it beats 4 times in a second with the fork .
By this means , and by this means only , with great care and attention , the pitch may probably be obtained with sufficient accuracy to distinguish skhistic from just intonation .
And similarly for equal and tertian intonation .
2 Taking the cycle of 30103 , JG contains 17070 , JB 26761 , and %DU 9200 octs .
Hence the Fifth , JDjfjf to JB , has only 17561 in place of 17609 octs , and the minor Third , JDjf# to JG , only 7870 , in place of 7918 octs\#151 ; that is , in each case 48 octs too little ; that is , these intervals are one skhisma too flat .
Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
[ Nov. 19 , bad as the best intervals ( Fifths ) in equal temperament , and all the other intervals absolutely just .
Hence the name unequally just .
In future I shall consider that skhistic intonation is practically realized by unequally just intonation , for which the practical rule is :\#151 ; tune six tones making just major Thirds without beats ( as fF[\gt ; to t to C to E to JG# to line t in Table I. ) , and from each of them tune seven other tones making just Fifths ( as C to G to D to +A to +E , and C to E to B[\gt ; to E[\gt ; , in col .
5 of Table I. ) .
Saunders 's ilTilting Action."\#151 ; Before proceeding to show that 48 skhistic tones suffice for modern modulational music , it will be useful for future constructions to remark that a method of realizing all the effects which I contemplated by my duplex finger-board ( Proc. vol. xiii .
p. 422 ) has been invented by Mr. T. W. Saundersl , by means of stops , which allow the manual and fingering to remain unaltered .
Two sets of harmonium vibrators are arranged one behind the other , tuned in tertian intonation ( by means of beats , counted by a pendulum , which gives a fairly accurate means of approximating to the correct result ) as follows , the capital letters referring to the white or long digitals , and the small letters to the black or short digitals , a mode of distinction which I shall constantly employ:\#151 ; Back .

B# db m eb E# gb E## ab G## bb Q ?
Front .C c# D d# E E f# G g# A a# B There are 12 stops1 2 , one corresponding to each digital in the Octave , which , by a " tilting action , " enables one , and one only , out of the two vibrators in the same column , as shown above , to be " damped " at pleasure throughout all the Octaves of the-instrument .
When all the stops are pushed in , the front vibrators only are free , and any one may be exchanged for a back vibrator by pulling out its stop .
Hence 24 out of 27 tones are under the command of the player ; Bbb , Ebb , Abb are omitted .
C. Harmonic Scales .
A series of tones , each of which is consonant with two other tones in the same series that are themselves consonant with each other , forms what I here mean by an harmonic scale .
This was not the principle on which scales were originally formed ; but this is the way in which the pitch of the tones must be determined for the just intonation of modem harmony and modulation .
1 As Mr. Saunders has not patented his invention , I am unable to give more than the indications in the text , and refer to him personally , at E. Lachenal 's Concertina Manufactory , 4 Little James Street , Bedford Kow , W.C. His invention offers great facilities for the construction of experimental instruments in any uniform or just intonation .
His harmonium was shown when this paper was read .
2 In the specimen shown there are only 9 stops , the CJfJf , Fjfjf , Gfljf having been omitted ; hut as the principle admits of the construction of 12 stops as easily as 9 , the complete form is mentioned in the text .

The Harmonic Elements are the Fifth , CxG ( = !
)\gt ; the major Third , C+E ( = | ) , and the minor Third , C - Wp ( =|)\#187 ; using a notation which I have found practically very convenient for representing the intervals between two tones ; the symbols X , + , \#151 ; are not to be employed with any other meaning between the names of tones .
In these elements it is supposed that either note may be raised or depressed by any number of Octaves , or be accompanied by such Octaves of itself .
The Harmonic Cell , or Unit of C , consists of a major triad , C+E \#151 ; G , and a minor triad , C\#151 ; +E| ?
+ G , arranged as in +E( ?
G- the margin , and having the same First C , and hence the C E same Fifth Gr .
The Fifth CxG !
is placed vertically , the two major thirds , C+E and " fE[\gt ; +Gr , are horizontal , and the two minor Thirds , C\#151 ; fE| ?
and E-G , slope obliquely from the bottom upwards to the left .
These positions , then , replace the symbols x , + , - .
Allowing any one of the tones to be altered by any number of Octaves , or to have Octaves of itself added , and any tone to be taken as the First , this cell , whence all harmony is developed , contains every chord recognized by musicians as a concord in Tertian Harmony\#151 ; that is , harmony depending on Octaves , Fifths , and Thirds alone , excluding natural Sevenths ( =| ) , which form Septimal Harmony .
By Table I. cells can be readily constructed on any tone as a First .
The Harmonic Heptad , or Unit of consists of two cells , the First of one being the Fifth of the other , as tEb G- in the margin .
Allowing Octave variations as before , this tAf ?
C E contains all the three major and three minor triads which F A have C as one of their constituents , and are thus related in the first degree .
Two of these chords , the minor triad A \#151 ; C+E on the right or major side , and the major triad +A[ ?
+C\#151 ; +Eh on the left or minor side , connecting the two cells and due to their union , may be called union triads , to distinguish them from the four cell triads .
The heptad also contains all con-dissonant triads ( as I term them ) , consisting of three tones , two of which are consonant with C but dissonant with each other .
Of these the trine f AJ\gt ; + 0+E , which forms the central horizontal line , is most important for future work .
The Harmonic Decad , or Unit of , consists of two heptads having a common cell , and hence of three cells , the Fifth TB|\gt ; D of the first , lowest , or subclominant cell , and the Fifth of the t^u n 5 SeCOnd ' middle\gt ; or tonic cell , being the First of the second P cell , an(l birst of the third , highest , or dominant cell , I A respectively .
The decad contains three major and three minor cell triads , and two major and two minor union triads that is , ten triads in all , together with all the discords possible without Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical [ Nov. 19 , modulation .
The .First of the tonic cell is called the tonic of the decade , and gives its name to it .
The example , therefore , is a C decade .
Harmonic Trichordals consist of three triads , one from each cell in a decade , and form eight groups .
Contracting major triad and minor triad into ma and mi respectively ( with Italian vowels ) , and naming the threecell triads in order from bottom to top , these 8 trichordals are distinguished as follows in the C decade .
The triads are spread out and marked by + and \#151 ; , and the terminal triads are repeated in part with an interposed | to indicate the dissonant interval of a Pythagorean minor Third= 80 0 32 gj .
g'=2f\#187 ; so that all the harmonies , consonant and dissonant , peculiar to any trichordal , may be collected at a glance .

But in repeating them each may begin on any tone of the seven , giving 7 modes ( in the ancient Greek sense ) to each trichordal .
To distinguish these , change the m of the name of the triad containing the initial tone into when it is its First ( p rima ) , t when it is its Third ( t ertia ) , and qu when it is its Fifth ( qu inta ) , which last is of course required for the highest or dominant triad only .
The final cadence fully distinguishes the 56 resulting harmonic scales .
Of these I append such as are usually acknowledged , making them all begin with C , and changing the decade accordingly .
Between the tones I use ( .

c'These 56 harmonic scales are all that can be produced without modu-lation .
To retain old names as much , as possible , C wncipci'innci will be called C major , and all three , C mipimi , mipima , mapima , will be considered as making up C minor , whilst other forms will be termed unusual minor scales .
All these , however , and more of the 56 scales mentioned above , actually occur in modern music , at least for short phrases , although the usual major and minor alone characterize whole compositions .
D. Modulation and Duodenation .
Although a decad consists of complete triads and cells , yet it is evident that one or two of the cells may be made parts of other decads , and that the union triads may be regarded as parts of cells left incomplete .
The tones forming these cells and unions are therefore ambiguous , and there is always a tendency to complete them in a different way from that in the original decad , or , in other words , to proceed to the other decads of which they form a part .
By an extension of the term modulation , which originally referred to a mere change of mode , this change of decad might still be called modulation , although decadation might be more appropriate .

On the left is the heptadecad of C , in which the decad of C is printed in capitals , and the added tones necessary to complete the heptadecad in small letters .
On the right solfeggio names are proposed as substitutes , to be pronounced with Italian vowels .
These names are founded on those used by the Tonic Solfaists , and are suitable to any original tonic Do ; and they are introduced because singers in just intonation should become accustomed to the " mental effect " of each of these tones in relation to the Do selected .
The decads are named from the names of the tones in the original decad .
The Gr decad is the dominant or So decad ; the F the subdominant or Fa decad ; the A the right relative , or major Sixth , or La deead ; the fE[\gt ; is the left relative or minor Third or Mo decad ; the E is the right correlative or major Third , or Mi decad ; and the +AJ ?
is the left correlative or minor Sixth or Lo decad\#151 ; all with reference to the C or tonic or Do decad .
These six decads are related to the original decad in the first degree .
The dominant and subdominant decads have each seven tones , the relative and correlative decads have each six tones , in common with the original decad .
The dominant decad raises two tones , F and A , by a comma , |j=j , to +f and fa , and one , F , by a sharp , to f# .
The subdominant depresses tw ; o tones , tB| ?
and D , by a comma , to b[\gt ; and id , and one , D , by a sharp , to d[\gt ; .
These two decads are therefore equally related to the original .
The right relative decad depresses one tone , D , by a QK comma , to id , and raises three tones , F , C , G- , by a low sharp , to +f# , fc# , ig# .
The right correlative decad raises one tone , F , by a sharp , to fJ , and three tones , 0 , G- , D , by a low sharp , to fc# , fg# , id# .
Hence the right relative is more nearly related to the original than the right correlative .
Similarly the left relative , changing F in ff , and C , Q- , D into fc|\gt ; , tg{\gt ; , td[\gt ; , is more nearly related than the left correlative , which changes D into d[\gt ; , and F , C , Q- into tfj ?
, tcf ?
, +gj\gt ; .
In commatic temperaments , where id , +f are not distinguished from D , F , the relative decads seem , like the just dominant and subdominant , to have 7 tones in common with the original , and similarly the dominant and subdominant decads appear to have 9 tones in common with the original .
Hence various important confusions have arisen , of which it must suffice to have indicated the source .
Since the most natural and easy harmonic tri- Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .

] chordal , with the fullest and best harmonies , is undoubtedly the mcimama or major , consisting of the central and right columns of the decade containing it , modulation ( or decadation ) to the right is more common than modulation to the left ; and , owing to the closer relationship , modulation to the right relative is more common than into the right correlative , which generally occurs as a vertical ( dominant ) modulation from the latter .
Vertical ( dominant or subdominant ) modulations are , however , the most common of all , unconsciously ( owing to commatie temperament ) into the subdominant ( when the minor chord , +d\#151 ; f+a , is used , for the chord of the added Sixth , f+a | d ) , and consciously into the dominant ( in which , however , only f# , and not fa , is commonly recognized ) .
The vertical modulation is so common that it influences scales , producing actual tetrachordals , which are disguised in melody by being occasionally deprived of their extreme tones , so as to reduce their apparent number at any time to 7 .
The fourth chord may be added on to the name by a hyphen .

A means of putting the strange-looking chords1 , f + a ... b + Jd# , and f+a\#151 ; c with +d# , or f + awith \#163 ; d# , which they contain , under the hands of the performer on justly intoned instruments , is absolutely necessary .
The Harmonic Duodene or Element of , as distinguished from the heptadecad or unit of modulation , contains the 12 tones inclosed within an oblong in the figure of the heptadecad .
It is seen to contain a complete decad of C and two additional tones , f# and d[\gt ; , which I term mutators , as each of them is part of two cells , and hence lead the old decad to change into the new decads containing them .
Thus f J is part of the vertical cell ff ta and of the lateral cell D f# D f# B +d# , and hence leads both to the dominant decad and to the right correlative decad .
Again , d[\gt ; is a part of the vertical cell d| ?
E and of the lateral cell tf[\gt ; tAJ ?
b[\gt ; td dt ?
F , and hence leads to the subdominant decad and to the left correlative decad .

A duodene , then , consists of 12 tones , forming four trines of major Thirds arranged in three quaternions of Fifths .
Hence the duodene constructed on the second tone C of any trine , f Ajp C -j- E , contains the mapama or major of the first tone f A| ) , the complete decad of the second tone C , and the mipimi or common descending minor of the third tone E. It has therefore three tonics , tA[\gt ; , C , and E ; but the tonic of the decad being most characteristic , this is called the root of the duodene , and the duodene is named after it .
Any duodene is clearly and sharply separated from its adjacent trines and quaternions , as shown in Table I. , where the small innermost oblong marks off the duodene of C. For in the duodene the smallest intervals .16 between two adjacent tones are the Semitone , ( fjf to G , B to C , E to F , 1 The justification of these chords is that the interval/ to \d ' % = 2 .

But if we take the trine above , +f+ fa + c# , we have two intervals of a comma , t , ( E to ff , A to fa ) , and one of a diaskhisma , tj^ , ( c# to d[\gt ; ) .
If we take the trine below , gt ?

to tB[\gt ; , +d to D ) , and a diaskhisma ( f # to g|\gt ; ) .
If we take the quaternion to the right , as +c# x +g# x id# x a# , we have three intervals of a diesis , ftj^ , ( a# to fB| ?
, +d# to fE[y , ig# to tA[\gt ; , and ic# to d[\gt ; ) ; and similarly if we proceed to the left .
Hence the intervals introduced by adjacent trines and quaternions are all less than two commas .
In equal temperament no new intervals would be thus introduced ; for all the Fifths are there so altered that the new upper trine , tempered tf+ta+c# , would become identical with the original bottom trine , tempered d[)-j-F+A , except in order of terms ; and the new quaternion to the right , tempered +c# X ig# X id# X a# , would be identical both in value and order of terms with the old quaternion to the left , tempered d[ ?
x tA{ ?
x tE[\gt ; x tBJj .
The consequence is that only one duodene exists for equal temperament , and the real nature of modulation is thoroughly disguised .
In tertian temperament this would not be the case ; the quaternions would be distinguished , but the trines would partly coincide , and hence some , but not all , of the meaning of modulation would be lost1 .
1 If in Table I. the signs t J be omitted , and the letters and the signs bbe taken to have their values in Tertian or any uniform commatie temperament ( except the Equal , which is also skhismatic ) , the Table will represent the corresponding duodenes .
But if the letters and signs % b are taken to have their value in the Equal temperament , so that C D E F GAB =Dbb Ebb Fb Gbb Abb Bbb Ob and =B\#187 ; 099 E# F#jf G## A## and 0# DJf E# F# G# A# B# =Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb 0 ( showing the utterly absurd relations between symbolization and signification ) , then the gam pi Table will reduce to the one central duodene with its tones'differently distributed .
This will be still better shown by using C cd D de E F fg G- ga A ab B for the 12 digitala on a piano , so that the central duodene and its adjacent trines and quaternions reduce to cd F A cd F % ab D fg ab B de G B de E ga 0 E ga A cd F A cd D % ab D fg ~ VOL. XXIII , C Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical [ Nov. 19 , In skhistic intonation , the modification of the Fifth leads to a modification of the comma and obliteration of the skhisma ; so that the two !
first tones , skhistic tf , fa , of the new upper trine , +f + fa+c# , are skhistic comma higher , and the third , skhistic c# , is one skhistic comma 1 lower than the two last tones , F , A , and the first tone D| ?
of the old 1 trine , D| ?
+F4-A .
And the tones of the new right quaternion will bel in the same order , exactly two skhistic commas flatter than the old left-j hand quaternion1 .
The consequence is that if we took 4 independent duodenes ( that is , 1 such that no tone of one is common to any tone of the other ) as the duo- 1 denes of f B[\gt ; , A# , G\ ) , and \#163 ; F$ , the tones of which are contained within 1 the dotted lines and right side of the inner oblong of Table I. , the tones 1 of the duodenes A# and \#163 ; F# will be two commas flatter than those of 1 fB{ ?
and G\ ) ; and the tones of the two first quaternions of the fB[\gt ; and 1 A# duodenes will be one comma sharper than those of the two last I quaternions of Gr[\gt ; and +F# , while the tones of the third quaternions of I tBf ?
and A# will be one comma flatter than those of the duodenes of 1 and +F# respectively .
The result , then , is that the 48 tones will consist of four corresponding 1 sets of 12 tones each appearing in 4 forms , differing in pitch by one skhistic comma .
This will appear more clearly by the following Table , | in which the value in octs of the cycle of 301 is given for 73 tones , being \ those in cols .

1 This is readily seen by expressing the tones in terms of the octs of the cycle of 301 , j by continually adding and subtracting 176 for the Fifths and 97 for the major Thirds , i adding or subtracting 301 as often as is necessary to reduce to the same Octave .

our habits of heading musical notes into directions for using digitals ) will be all fitted .for being played oh the same digitals .
This is the most important point in the practical construction of instruments , and is for the first time pointed out in this paper . . .
Another important result is , that if we take any 12 consecutive skhistic tones in order of Fifths , or 8 consecutive tones in that order , and 4 others separated from them by 24 or 48 Fifths , although such tones will not form a duodene , they will be 12 tones suitable for our manuals , and will therefore afford the means of temporarily supplementing other arrangements .
... .
, In skhistic intonation , then , the modulatipnal peculiarities ot just intonation are preserved ; and it will be convenient in future to consider modulation as taking place by duodenes , and hence consisting of tion .
We shall therefore have in just intonation both vertical and lateral duodenation to consider ; but in skhistic intonation it wdl be seen by Table II .
that one right lateral duodenation , as from root tB[ ?
to root D , is the same as eight descending vertical duodenations , for these would in just intonation lead to the root Eft\gt ; , which , as shown in the last Table , is skhistically identical with D. Hence in skhistic intonation we have , so far as instruments are concerned , only to render yertical uo ena ion possible and easy .
' ^ Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
[ Nov. 19 , And in writing music , i\#163 ; we note at the top of any bar the name of the duodene to which the notes to be played belong , and suppose this duodenal ( as the mark may be called , in contradistinction to the , which will remain as before ) to hold till a new one is written ( according to the custom of musical signatures ) , we shall be able precisely to mark the pitch of every tone in just or skhistic intonation , introducing any change or any additional sign into the staff-notation of music1 .
This is again an entirely new practical principle resulting from the present theory .
The duodenal will direct the player to the mode of arranging the manual he has to use .
It should be the duty of the composer to insert the duodenals himself ; but in respect of existing compositions , which were composed for some commatic system of temperament , it will be often difficult to determine which of two adjacent vertical duodenes it would be best to use ; and it will probably be necessary to introduce commatic changes , when they can be made within the limits of a single heptadecad .
Also in the case of compositions in a major scale , which do not change into the minors of the same decade , and hence use only two quaternions of a duodene , but will necessarily and frequently modulate to the right , it is more convenient to consider the music as performed in the first and second quaternions of a duodene having for its root the Third of the major scale , because the third quaternion of that duodene contains the tones required for right lateral modulation .
Thus C major will be assigned to the duodene of E , No. 19 of Table II .
, and E major to the duodene of A , No. 20 of Table II .
, \amp ; c. This makes the modulation from the major into the relative minor as simple and direct as vertical modulation , for C major passes into any form of A minor or major by descending vertically from the duodene of E to that of A. All pieces in any minor scale pass into each of the three quaternions of a duodene , and hence their duodenal will be the tonic of their decade , which gives its name to the duodene .
The duodene is then prepared for playing the synonymous major of that minor scale .
Such duodenals might be distinguished by an added star .
It often happens that passing tones , changing notes and are introduced which do not belong to the harmony .
They are written usually after the laws of Pythagorean temperament , but their pitch is really indeterminate .
Eor these there is no occasion to change the duodenal at all .
They will then be played in the duodene of the other 1 For theoretical and experimental purposes it may be sometimes convenient to use signs equivalent to t ' | in the staff-notation itself .
The signs h ^ for t , tt , and j \#163 ; for l , being the tails of quavers and semiquavers , are well adapted for this purpose .
The direction of the angles show ascent and descent , and the forms exist as types for every required position on the staff ; thus ta , td , tbb , and |g# , would be Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .

] I harmonies by a tone of not more than two commas different , which must I be considered as their proper representative in just intonation .
E. Number of Tones required .
The next important point is to determine how many duodenes must be provided .
In Table I. the large inner oblong contains all the duodenes which have at least one tone in common with the original duodene of 0 .
Thus the duodenes +D[ ?
and \#163 ; B have respectively the tones fB[\gt ; and A in common with the original duodene , and no others .
If we proceeded I further , as vertically from the +D[\gt ; to the ++A[\gt ; duodene , we should no longer have any connexion with the decad of the original tonic C. The confusions of modem equal temperament might lead much further ; but in that case , we must restore the commatic changes which equal temperament ignored , considering , for example , that when the composer modulated into tempered A| ?
from tempered D( ?
be really meant to make a modulation from just D| ?
into just +A| ?
, and not from fD\\gt ; to just f+A| ? .
It would probably have never been the composer 's intention to proceed to such unrelated duodenes as these two last .
The limits of the original roots of duodenes may be taken to be the tones of the duodene of C. Practically , composers had no others in their minds .
Any smaller changes of pitch were relegated to- differences in the pitch of C , whence all the others were derived .
If , then , we construct the limiting duodenes to the extreme tones of the duodene of C as original roots , we shall obtain all the tones in Table I. , being 9x13=117 in number .
This is the number of tones required , therefore , in just intonation .
Skhistic intonation would introduce identifications which would reduce this number to the 9 x 8=7 2tones in the lines to a ?
in Table I. , together with three in col .
1 , lines l , m , n , and in col .
9 , lines y and z , that is to 77 skhistic tones in all .
The last 5 are so extremely unlikely to occur , however , that we may consider these 72 skhistic tones as sufficiently representing the whole 117 of the Table . .
These 72 tones form 6 independent duodenes , those of tfE|p[\gt ; , D and JC## , and of B[ ?
and iA# .
It will be shown that there is really no difficulty in playing them all , with existing means , if required ; but they would not be required .
The tendency of musicians is not to modulate to both right and left equally in the same piece .
It has been already noted that on account of the prevalence of major scales duodenation is generally to the right .
The fingering for the duodenes of 1"B|\gt ; and A\#177 ; f would be the same on manuals constructed on the duodenary theory , although the tones in skhistic intonation would differ by two skhistic commas .
* If , then , a piece in tB[\gt ; duodenated much to the left , that is ( for skhistic intonation ) , ascended vertically , we could play it as A# .
It would simply be necessary to write $B[ ?
as its duodenal , as that is shown to be identical with A# in the last Table .
We should then be able to use ascending duodena22 Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical Duodenes .
[ Nov. 19 , tion with great ease , as shown in Table IX .
, even if columns 1 and 2 in Table I. were omitted .
Hence we may begin by cancelling columns 1 and 2 of Table II .
In view of the greater frequency of right lateral or descending duodenation , we need only reject column 9 to the right1 .
We have thus reduced the just tones to the 6 x 13 = 78 in columns i. to vi .
of Table I. The skhistic identifications reduce these further to the 6 x 8=48 tones in lines p to x of the same columns , together with the three tones in col .

1 If in changes of key in the movements of a long piece modulation took place first much to the left and then much to the right , we might perhaps make commatic changes between the movements , without disturbing the connexion .
And when changes are introduced by successions of discords , such commatic changes could not be observed at all by the listener .
By the use of the duodenal , however , they will be rendered perfectly simple-to the pefforttie'r .

, also , the tones in each of the duodenes are written down in the order in which they would stand on a manual ; but the skhistic identities of the central column of tones in the preceding Table of Octs ( p. 19 ) have been used to give the same names to all the tones in one column , exclusive of the prefixed t and + .
We thus see clearly that three new tones are introduced by each new successive duodene , two falling and one rising by a skhistic comma , as respects the tones they replace .
We also see that each tone prevails through 4 consecutive duodenes , and that there are 4 , and only 4 , varieties of t , in each column .
This completes the theory of the construction of instruments , because the rest is properly the work of the mechanician , and consists simply in devising a method for bringing each of these 29 duodenes under the hand of the performer , when indicated by the duodenal .
* It will be sufficient here to point out a few experimental instruments , to suggest some practical forms , and to show that means of playing in just intonation with fixed tones already exist .

Just Concertina ( exhibited when this paper was read ) .
The C concertina described in my former paper ( Proceedings , tA D n vol. xiii .
p. 104 ) contains the portion of a hepta-decad shown in the margin\#151 ; that is , the duodene of G B in# E with the exception of A and the duodene of A C E ta# with the exception of +FJ .
It has the whole decade F \#163 ; t\gt ; A in ic of E , and the major scales of F , C , G , E. I have found it a most useful instrument in all my experiments .
Using capitals for white and small letters for black studs , its 14 notes are tuned thus :\#151 ; C tct , D id , E id# , F G +A a , B b\\gt ; .

For ordinary lecture and illustrative purposes , this is the cheapest and best instrument .
It contains the portion of a heptadecad shown in the margin , and hence contains the duodene of C with the exception of F# , the whole decad of C , and the major scales of fE|\gt ; and +A| ? .
The two last show vertical modulation .
Again , +E[\gt ; major or +A[\gt ; major to C ' decad shows right lateral , and , inversely , C decad to +E[\gt ; major or +A[\gt ; major shows left lateral modulation .
The F and +F show the influence of a comma , and the difference between the just triad , D[\gt ; +F \#151 ; +A[\gt ; , and the Pythagorean triad , D| ?
with +F and tA[\gt ; .
Also in the key of +E[\gt ; major the difference can be shown between the minor chord , F \#151 ; tAJ ?
+ C , and the chord of the added Sixth , fA[\gt ; + C | +F .
It also contains the German Sixth , D[ ?
+F \#151 ; fA[\gt ; with B ( which is a close imitation of the chord of the natural Seventh ) , the Italian Sixth , DJ ?
+F with B , and the French Sixth , D[\gt ; + F ... G + B. Using capitals and small letters for the black and white keys , they are arranged thus :\#151 ; C d[ ?

The five tones , d[\gt ; x fa[\gt ; x te| ?

The front vibrators , to which correspond the digitals when the stops are all pushed in , contain the whole duodene of C , and the stops enable the player to exchange their tones for those in the six other decads .
All lie on the usual digitals except tD[ ?
and fG| ?
, which are placed on the long white digitals of C and G , in place of the short black digitals next to their right , as these were wanted for +c# and +g# .
This makes a slight difference in the fingering of +EJ ?

Helmholtz 's Harmonium ( Tonempfindungen , p. 496 ) .
Two sets of vibrators are tuned , the back set to the duodene of E| ?
or D# , No. 14 , Tables II .
and III .
, and the front set to duodene of $C[\gt ; or B , No. 18 , of the same .
This instrument contains the eight trines , Nos. 14 to 21 , and the five duodenes , Nos. 14 to 18 , Table II . .
The " tilting action " produces a most useful experimental instrument , which is far easier to use than Helmholtz 's own double manual instrument , because it has only one manual , and requires no alteration in ordinary fingering .
Eor this purpose the stops may be reduced to four , each changing a trine instead of a single note .
5 .
Oueroult 's Harmonium ( Comptes B-endus , 1872 , p. 1188 ) .
This , again , may be treated as the last by means of Mr. Saunders 's " tilting action .
" Two sets of vibrators must be used , the back set tuned to duodene +D[ } or C# , No. 16 , and the front to or A , No. 20 , of Tables II .
and III .
M. Grueroult tuned the B# of duodene No. 16 as B'tf = 54~^|Bjj : , so as to make the combinational tone of Gr# and B'$ the same as that of B'# and E| ?
, the other tones being tuned in just intonation from 0 .
Omitting this as unnecessary , the instrument contains the eight trines , Nos. 16 to 23 of Table II .
, and the five duodenes , Nos. 16 to 20 .
M. G-ueroult arranged the tones somewhat differently for two manuals .

Duoni , Trioni , Quartoni , Quintoni , The Russian horn-band which visited London some years ago , and produed great effects by each performer 's playing a single tone only ( and hence , probably , in just intonation ) , and the customs of hand-bell and church-bell " ringers , who each play a single note in a melody , have suggested to me the use of two , three , four , Jive , or six harmoniums or pianofortes , indicated by the above names , for the purpose of playing in skhistic or unequally just intonation , by means of two , three , four , five , or six performers , among whom the tones are distributed .
The Duoni are intended for two independent duodenes , as in the two last cases , the Quartoni for four such , playing the whole 48 tones , the Sestoni for six , in the almost impossible case of 72 tones being required .
The Trioni supplement the Duoni by using 12 additional tones , forming consecutive Fifths , and hence not constituting a duodene , by which means the 36 tones of Mr. Poole 's compass can be played .
The Quintoni supplement the Quartoni in a similar manner ; but the first 8 tones are those in col .
2 , lines p to and the last 4 those in col .
9 , lines jo to sof Table II.\#151 ; giving 60 tones on the whole , chosen so as to supplement without changing the arrangement of the Quartoni .
In each case separate harmoniums or pianos are used , with no change in existing mechanism or fingering , but only in intonation ; so that the instruments could be obtained and tuned in unequally just intonation , as Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical [ Nov. 19 , ( II .
) tE G# already described , without difficulty , at a day 's notice .
The music is to be marked with the proper duodenals , and the duodenes thus indicated are to be transcribed separately , and divided into parts by transverse lines , corresponding to the tones existing on the different instruments .
The copyist writes out a separate part for each performer ( which had better have an indication of the complete harmony annexed ) , in which only those notes that belong to his own instrument are written .
Thus , suppose that the duodene is E# , and the lines show what tones lie on -gj ' the instrument ( I. , II .
, III .
) , as in the mar_______ gin .
Suppose that the succession of chords tA C# E# e % g % V \lt ; f % / # o'# a'# c ' % and B %d !
% / # V ( I. ) D E# A# ( III .
) has to be played .
The tones will be district B j +DJ buted as in the margin .
Considerable practice would be necessary to take up the notes truly at the right moment , but there is no longer any instrumental or digitational difficulty in playing in just intonation .
Leaving D aside as sufficiently indicated in the two last cases , and of only experimental interest , and Sestoni as practically not required , it will be enough to explain the tuning of Trioni , Quartoni , and Quintoni .

) .
Then tune \#163 ; B# a major Third above +G$ , and tune up by Fifths to +G verifying by the major Thirds below , which lie all in ( III .

By this the three instruments are completely in tune , and give the 17 duodenes , Nos. 10 to 26 , Table II .
, containing Mr. Poole 's scale of 36 tones .
Quartdni are much simpler , because they contain the four independent duodenes , ( I. ) of +B[ ?

] Mr. A. J. Ellis on Musical instrument .
The arrangement of tones is managed as before .
Suppose , for example , we have to play the succession of chords f fc ' a ' , d g f b\ and c g e ' c ' in the duodene of C , this duodene would be written and the tones would be distributed among the four instruments as follows :\#151 ; Quintoni have five instruments , ( I. ) to ( IV .
) being tuned as in Quar-t6nit and ( V. ) added when by some extraordinary vagaries of modulation more than 48 tones are needed .
( V. ) is tuned thus , where the synonyms show the meaning of the arrangement:\#151 ; ( V. ) +Dbb }bjf# t+Ebb tfbb ttFb tG-bb Jeg# ttAbb Jf### ttBbb tcbb JAg$ =ttC ttc# ttB tteb tttE ttF $Jf# ttG- JJg# tttA ttbb fJB The tuning of ( V. ) is effected thus Tune ftA|\gt ; [ j as a major Third below tC| ?
on ( I. ) , and then work up by Fifths to ttF| ?
and down to +F[\gt ; [ \gt ; , verifying by the major Thirds above in ( I. ) and ( II .
) .
Then tune tA## as a major Third above +F## in ( III .
) , and work up by Fifths to \#163 ; F### , verifying by the major Thirds below in ( III .
) .
The notation of the tones , though inevitable , is frightful ; but the tuning is very simple , and the use of the duodenal leaves the old staff-notation unchanged .
It is most probable that the fifth instrument would never be wanted .

Great and Small Duodenary Harmonium .
Although the mode just explained places just intonation at the immediate command of three or four performers , yet it seems necessary to suggest a mode of putting all the 17 or 29 duodenes at the command of a single performer .
I suggest the following for consideration .
It seems practicable , ^ but would doubtless require much mechanical treatment from harmonium-builders before it would act properly .
It will be enough to indicate the form of the great duodenary .
Take four sets of vibrators , tuned as for Quartdni , and placed one behind the other , each opening with a separate valve connected with a digital .
Sometimes two digitals will have to be connected with the same valve .
Conceive the manual as a set of 29 " steps , with f-inch " tread " and ]-inch " rise , " the lowest step next the performer .
Each step for the length of an Octave is divided into 12 digitals corresponding to the columns in Table III .
The width of ( I. ) gg ' \#151 ; gd g ( II .
) c df f cc ' ( in .

[ Nov. 19 , the digitals to be as follows for No. 11 of Table III .
, in eighths of an inch:\#151 ; C db D tej ?
E F tgt ) G taj ?
A +bf\gt ; B 5 3 5 3553 53 53 5 The digitals corresponding to the small letters are to rise | inch above the others and to be bevelled , so that they are S inch wide at bottom , and | inch wide at top .
Each step is then a miniature finger-board in the ordinary arrangement .
Whenever any note occurs in 4 consecutive steps , as shown by the cross lines in Table III .
, its 4 digitals are to be consolidated into one , so that , except in " steps " 1 to 3 and 26 to 29 , the digitals will be practically 3 inches long .
To show which digitals are consolidated , colour the low wide digitals alternately white and light red , and the high narrow digitals alternately light blue and light brown , distinctions of colour easily seen .
To mark the duodene , draw a black line , | inch broad , across the digital bearing the name of the duodene , and put a black circle of \ inch in diameter on the tonic of the major scale which it contains .
The lines thus marked , together with the alternation of colour , will clearly distinguish each duodene .
The depth of this manual from front to back would be 21f inches , and the rise 7^ inches ; the width of an Octave from to B is 6| inches , and from Cto c is 6|- inches .
This last width is 7S inches on the piano ; but as the hand would on the duodenary always have to dip between high digitals to strike Octaves of low digitals , it must be held more upright , and hence its span will be less .
A manual of five Octaves and one note , G to c " " , will be 31-| inches long .
The number of movable digitals in each column of Table III .
is 8 , which open only 4 valves ; this will necessitate coupling\#151 ; the details resulting from Table III .
, which may be considered as a ground-plan of this manual1 .
1 When this paper was read I mentioned that the 48 tones , making 29 duodenes , of Tables II .
and III .
could be played on Mr. Bosanquet 's " generalized key-board , " as exhibited to the Royal Society when his paper was read on January 30 , 1873 , with less difficulty in mechanism than by the plan I proposed ( of which a model was exhibited ) , but that slightly new fingering would then be necessary ; and also that the 72 tones of Table I. , lines p to # , making 53 duodenes , might be played by the same arrangement on a manual not larger than that which I proposed for the 48 tones or 29 duodenes ; and hence that the sole advantage of my scheme for a manual was its preservation of the present fingering , against which had to be set off the advantage that the new fingering of Mr. Bosanquet would be the , same in all keys or duodenes . .
The intonation , however , would remain different from Mr. Bosanquet 's .
