MY DEAR MR. BELL , --During the month of March , now past , and since an abstract of my Second Series of observations " On the Impregnation of the Ovum in the Amphibia " has appeared in the , Proceedings of the Royal Society for June 1851 , I have ascertained that the spermatozoa of the Frog are not only brought into contact with the surface of the egg , in fecundation , as already known , but that some of these bodies penetrate into the thick gelatinous envelopes , as stated by Prevost and Dumas : and further , I have found that in those eggs which are completely fecundated , some spermatozoa have arrived at , and become partially imbedded in the internal envelope which encloses the yelk , although I have not yet been able to detect any within the yelk itself ; nor have obtained any evidence of the existence of an orifice , or natural perforation in the external envelopes , through which these bodies might enter .
It is right that I should make this announcement without further delay , as the fact now mentioned necessitates some revision of my view respecting the nature of the impregnating influence , as expressed in the paper alluded to .
This I propose to make , and to lay very soon before the Royal Society .
I remain , my dear Sir , Yours very faithfully , Those .
Bell , Esq. , Sec. R.S. GEORGE NEWPORT .
