] The power of Professor Volta 's pile to produce galvanism is now supposed to depend on the disposition of one of the metals employed , to be oxidated by the fluid interposed ; but a doubt is still entertained whether that oxidation depends on electricity set in motion by the contact of the metals , or whether the electricity be excited by some chemical'action of the substances used .
The experiments described in the present paper seem to favour the latter opinion , viz. that a chemical agency is the cause ' of the effects produced .
They go principally to prove that this chemical agency of common electricity is the same as the power excited in Professor Volta 's apparatus , likewise by chemical means .
The production of airs by the electric pile is here imitated , and even the appearance of two currents is produced , by occasioning the electricity to pass by fine points of communication on both sides of the water at the same time , each wire yielding both hydrogen and oxygen gas .
It is also observed , that in the same manner as in Professor Volta 's apparatus , there is manifestly a disposition to oxidate on the positive side alone ; and that although oxygen gas be given as well as hydrogen by the negative wire , that wire is never perceptibly oxidated ; while the positive one , when of silver , uniformly shows a stream of oxide proceeding from it .
This is accounted for by the supposition that the difference between these two effects is owing to the greater intensity of common electricity in the method hitherto employed ; and it is ultimately inferred that galvanism probably differs solely in quantity and want of intensity from common electricity .
