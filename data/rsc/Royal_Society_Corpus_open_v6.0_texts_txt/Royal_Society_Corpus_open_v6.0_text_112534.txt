Stockholm , T May 9 , 1868 .
DEAR Sin , -Some days ago I had the pleasure of receiving yoUr kind letter of the 12th February , and the same clay I was informed that the sum necessary for a new Polar Expeditioni was fu rnished by some private gentle.inen of Gottenbtlrg .
Since then this unidertaking has been embraced withi great interest by the Swedish Goverinment and the navy , who have granted the new expedition a strong and excellent screw-steamer , which will be supplied with provisions for a year .
The main object of the expedition will be to penetrate northward from Spitzbergen ; but several naturalists will also accompany it .
I hope the new undertaking , will be emibraced by you with the same interest as the former ones , though the measurement of an arc of meridian does not yet make the aim of our enterprise .
But I think that during the expedition I shall be able to amend my omission of measuring the hill south of Fairhavcena , ' which surely will furnish an excellent datum for determining * Philosophical Tralisactions , 1824 , p. 290 .
the rising of the land in this part of Spitzbergen .
I shall also , where the rocks are hard enough for the purpose , bore along the shores as many watermarks as possible , to give in the future sure data for the settling of the same interesting question .
If it were possible to obtain a good pendulum we also would make pen dulum observations , at least if the expeditioni remains in these regions during the winter .
P.S. The expedition will start from Gotteniburg July the 1.5th .
