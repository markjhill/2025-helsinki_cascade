The object which the author had in view in pursuing the investigations alluded to in the following paper was to discover some form of voltaic battery which should have a perfectly constant electromotive force , and should maintain a uniform difference of electric potential between its poles .
This want has been much felt by electricians ; and the utility of such an investigation may be best shown by a brief reference to the recent history of electrical measurement .
In September 1861 a paper was read by the author before the British Association for the Advancement of Science advocating the adoption of a series of standard units of electrical measurement , and pointing out the mutual relations which should exist between such units .
The subject was independently supported in Committee by Sir William Thomson , F.R.S. , and the result was the appointment of a " Committee on Standards of Electrical Resistance , " and a grant of money was set aside for the purposes of the Committee .
In 1862 the Committee presented their first Report ; their numbers were then enlarged , further sums of money were voted for the continuation of their researches , and further Reports were presented in 1863 , 1864 , 1865 , and 1867 , after which the Committee was dissolved .
The Committee finally recommended the adoption of a system of natural electromagnetic units based on the metre and gramme* , in which the unit current flowing through a conductor of unit length exerts the unit force on the unit pole at the unit distance .
As these units were unfitted in magnitude for practical use , certain multiples have been adopted in practice and have received names , and are now in almost universal use among electricians .
These units are:\#151 ; 1 .
Resistance.\#151 ; The Ohm , equal to 107 absolute electromagnetic metre-gramme units .
2 .
Capacity.\#151 ; The Farad , equal to 10-7 absolute electromagnetic units .
3 .
Potential.\#151 ; The Volt , equal to 105 absolute electromagnetic units .
* They have since adopted the centimetre-gramme unit .

The measure of quantity is the same as that of electrostatic capacity , and in practice generally receives the same name , although it has been sometimes called the " Weber the weber or farad quantity is equal to 10"2 absolute units .
Electrical currents are defined as currents of so many farads per second .
In this system the volt electromotive force through the ohm resistance produces the unit current , or a current of one farad per second .
The Committee determined with great care the value of the ohm resistance and the farad capacity , and issued standards which have been very extensively copied and distributed .
They would naturally have desired to issue a standard of electromotive force , or degree of potential , and thus complete the series ; but in this they met with insuperable difficulties , and finally separated without accomplishing this part of their task .
This was a matter of regret , seeing that the electromotive forces of batteries and the strength of currents are among the measures most frequently required by the practical electrician .
The difference of potential between two bodies may be measured by measuring the force of attraction between two electrified planes of known dimensions at a known distance , or two coils conveying currents .
It may also be determined by similar means to those employed by the Committee in their determination of the absolute unit of resistance\#151 ; that is , by revolving a coil at a known speed in a field of known magnetic intensity .
If the value of the earth 's horizontal magnetic intensity ( H ) were uniform at different times and places , or easily obtained , and if the measurements were made at a distance from iron bodies , the tangent galvanometer would afford a means of absolutely measuring electromotive force .
All these methods , however , require complicated and expensive apparatus and great manipulative skill ; and owing to these causes it may be safely asserted that not more than half a dozen absolute determinations of potential have ever yet been made .
Practically electricians have been compelled to define electromotive forces by comparison with those of the Grove 's or Daniell 's cell , the copper and zinc cell , or other electromotive sources ; and it is a curious circumstance that among the thousand galvanic combinations known to exist , not one has been hitherto found which could be relied upon to give a definite electromotive force : however pure the materials , and however skilful the manipulation , differences varying from four or five per cent , upwards constantly occur without any assignable cause ; and different observers using different materials of course meet with still larger discrepancies .
The author , sustained by a conviction that this difficulty could not , in the nature of things , be insuperable , has carried on a course of experiments since 1867 with a view to discover and obviate the cause of these variations , and has devised a form of battery which he desires to lay before the Royal Society , and which appears to meet , in a very satisfactory manner , all necessary requirements .
The battery is formed by employing pure mercury as the negative element , the mercury being covered by a paste made by boiling mercurous sulphate in a thoroughly MR. LATIMER CLARK ON A STANDARD VOLTAIC BATTERY .
saturated solution of zinc sulphate , the positive element consisting of pure distilled zinc resting on the paste .
The best method of forming this element is to dissolve pure zinc sulphate to saturation in boiling distilled water .
When cool , the solution is poured off from the crystals and mixed to a thick paste with pure mercurous sulphate , which is again boiled to drive off any air ; this paste is then poured on to the surface of the mercury , previously heated in a suitable glass cell ; a piece of pure zinc is then suspended in the paste , and the vessel may be advantageously sealed up with melted paraffin-wax .
Contact with the mercury may be made by means of a platinum wire passing down a glass tube , cemented to the inside of the cell , and dipping below the surface of the mercury , or more conveniently by a small external glass tube blown on to the cell , and opening into it close to the bottom .
The mercurous sulphate ( Hg2 S04 ) can be obtained commercially* ; but it may be prepared by dissolving pure mercury in excess in hot sulphuric acid at a temperature below the boiling-point : the salt , which is a nearly insoluble white powder , should be well washed in distilled water , and care should be taken to obtain it free from the mercuric sulphate ( persulphate ) , the presence of which may be known by the mixture turning yellowish on the addition of water .
The careful washing of the salt is a matter of essential importance , as the presence of any free acid , or of persulphate , produces a considerable change in the electromotive force of the cell .
The electromotive force of the elements thus formed is remarkably uniform and constant , provided the elements be not connected up and allowed to become weakened by working .
A long series of comparisons was made between various elements , some of which had been made many months , and it was found that the greatest variation among them all did not differ from the mean value more than one thousandth part of the whole electromotive force ; such a difference as this was , however , unusual , and might have been due to slight differences of temperature .
The following Table gives some of the results obtained .

Several experiments were made to determine the variation of the electromotive force at different temperatures ; from the mean of these it appears that the force decreases with increase of temperature in the ratio of about *06 per cent , for each degree Cent. ; for example , an element gave relative values of *9993 at 0 ' Cent , and of .9412 at 100 ' Cent. The element varies much more at temperatures near 0 ' Cent , than at temperatures near 100 ' Cent. The variation for about 10 degrees above or below 15*5 is -06 per degree Cent. When the temperature is lowered from 150,5 to 0 ' the force increases at the rate of *08 per cent , per degree ; when raised from about 15'-5 to 100 ' Cent , it diminishes at the rate of '055 per cent , per degree .
The element maintains a sensibly constant electromotive force for one or two years , and possibly longer if the salts be prevented from drying by an air-tight covering .
It is not intended that this element should supersede any of the existing combinations in practical use for the production of a current ; for it , like the Marie Davy and many other batteries , falls rapidly in electromotive force when allowed to work through a circuit of small resistance , though it recovers its original electromotive force if allowed to remain inactive for a short time .
It is intended to be used chiefly as a standard of electromotive force with which other elements or sources of potential can be compared by means of an electrometer or of instruments ( similar to the one described below ) which do not require any current .
It will , however , continue to supply a permanent current through a circuit of large resistance , say 10,000 ohms , without any sensible diminution of its force , and has been advantageously applied to the testing of submarine cables .
The instrument used in comparing the elements was one devised by the author in 1859 ( see fig. 6 , p. 14 ) ; the following diagram will explain its construction:\#151 ; .

diameter wound on a cylinder of ebonite , the ends being connected to the axes b V , which woik in blocks of metal with mercury contacts i two batteries are also connected to the same blocks , the larger one , C , of several cells , sends a continuous current through the coil , the strength of which can be varied by means of the rheostat or resistance-coil , d ; the smaller , c , is the standard element ; it is connected with the terminal blocks , b and it has a reflecting galvanometer , g , in circuit with it ; as these two batteries are connected up in the same direction , they both tend to send a current through the coil a If the difference of potential maintained by the battery between the blocks b V be greater than that of the standard cell , the battery will of course overpower the cell and send a reversed current through it ; if , on the other hand , the difference of potential be less , then both the battery and the cell will jointly send a current through a a. In practice , however , the resistance , d , is so adjusted that the difference of potentials at b and b ' is exactly the same as the difference of potential between the poles of the standard cell\#151 ; in other words , is equal to its electromotive force , in which case no current passes through the galvanometer , g , and the cell remains inactive .
In comparing a trial cell with the standard , one pole of the cell is connected with that end of the coil to which the similar pole of the standard is fixed ; the other pole is connected through a second galvanometer , h , to a sliding piece , By means of this sliding piece contact can be made at any point of the coil , a , which is calibrated into 10,000 equal divisions .
The point along the wire is readily found at which the potential is the same as that of the trial cell , and consequently no current passes through the galvanometer , h ; in this case the reading or number of divisions gives the value of the trial cell in ten-thousandth parts of the standard element .
As it is necessary that the standard element should have a higher electromotive force than that which is compared with it , two or more cells may be employed as a standard .
Having thus obtained a constant and easily reproducible measure of electric potential , it became necessary to ascertain its precise value in terms of the British-Association units and in absolute measure .
There are two well-known methods by which this may be accomplished ; the one is by the use of Weber 's electrodynamometer* , and the other by means of the sine or tangent galvanometerf , in which the force of the current , acting on a suspended needle through a known resistance , is compared with that of the earth 's horizontal intensity .
It was determined to measure the element by both methods .
The electrodynamometer employed was an instrument constructed for the British-Association Committee , and referred to in their Report for 1867 , page 478 .
This instrument had not been previously used .
In the electromagnetic system , the unit length of the unit current , acting on another similar current at the unit distance , exercises the unit of attractive or repulsive force .
The value of the current ( C ) in absolute units may therefore thus be determined from its mechanical effect ; and the resistance ( R ) of the circuit being known , the value of the * Taylor 's Scientific Memoirs , vol. iii .

electromotive force ( E ) follows from Ohm 's formula , C=| or E=CR .
In the instrument in question ( fig. 2 ) the large fixed coil is double , as in the arrangeEig .

double , and is suspended bifilarly truly central to the fixed coils , the bifilar suspension-wires being used to convey the current between the fixed and movable coils .
The top of the instrument ( fig. 8 ) is furnished with various contrivances for facilitating the central adjustment of the coils ; these consist of two plates , forming a slide-rest movement fitted with verniers , by which horizontal motion can be given to the suspension in any direction .
The upper plate carries a circular collar , which can be rotated by a tangent screw , and is graduated to 360 degrees .
Into this collar fits a brass frame , Pig .

carrying two ebonite blocks , on which are two horizontal sliding pieces , diametrically opposite to one another , each furnished with a vernier , and terminating interiorly in small brass pulleys or rollers , against which the suspension-wires rest , and by which their distance apart can be regulated .
The frame carries a light pulley three centimetres diameter , which supports the suspension-wires by means of a silk cord passing over the pulley and attached to the wires near the top , so as to ensure an equality of tension on the two wires .
The wires pass down through the collar and socket to the lower coil .
The suspension-pulley admits of upward and downward adjustment by means of a milled head screw .
The electrodynamometer with its telescope and stand was supported on a solid brick foundation ; the scale was a metre long , divided into millimetres , and was fixed at a distance of 2*7 metres from the centre of suspension .
The scale was carefully adjusted at right angles to the axis of the telescope .
A plate of silvered glass was fixed at the back of the large coils and adjusted parallel to them , and upon it was marked the centre of the coil accurately determined .
When this centre mark , viewed through the telescope , was brought to coincide with the cross wires by moving the large coils , and when the MR. LATIMER CLARK ON A STANDARD VOLTAIC BATTERY .
centre of the telescope reflected in the silvered glass also coincided with the cross wires , the telescope was of course directed normally to the centre of the plane of the coils , which were adjusted in the magnetic meridian ; excessive care was taken with all the adjustments and readings , which were repeated with reversed currents and positions .
In order to maintain a current through the coils of the dynamometer and to ensure that the difference of potential between its poles should be precisely equal to that of the standard cell , an auxiliary battery was used in the manner before described .
This consisted of five large Daniell 's cells working through a circuit consisting of the dynamometer and a rheostat , r ( fig. 4 ) ; a and b are the two terminals of the dynamometer , and the poles of the auxiliary battery , C , Z , are connected with them ; the similar poles of the standard elements c , z , and the galvanometer , , are also connected to the same terminals ; and the rheostat r is adjusted so that no current passes through the galvanometer .
In this case it is evident that the poles a and b are maintained at a difference of potential precisely equal to that of the standard elements .
In this arrangement not the slightest difficulty is experienced in maintaining a perfectly steady and uniform current through the coils of the dynamometer .
The poles of the dynamometer were so arranged that they could be connected immediately with a Wheatstone balance in order that its resistance could be measured promptly after each observation .

( 1 ) The coil was vibrated on a fine steel wire , and the moment was then increased by a gun-metal cylinder passing through the centre of the coil ; the increased time of vibration was then observed , and the moment of the coil calculated by the formula _ / " TZ2 d*\ 2 *\#151 ; ( ^12 +16/ ?

( 2 ) From the value so ascertained the dimensions of a gun-metal cylinder were calculated , having about the same moment of inertia as the coil when vibrating on a transverse diameter : two of these rings were accurately formed by Mr. Becker and carefully weighed ; their times of vibration were compared with that of the coil when suspended from the same wire .
The corrected moment of the coil was then calculated from these times by the formula 1= ^2 j 2 where t and t ' are the times of a vibration of the coil and the ring , r and r ' the external and internal radii of the ring , 2 a its breadth , and W its weight .
( 3 ) The moment of inertia was also determined by the vibration about its longitudinal axis of a metal cylinder of small thickness compared with its radius , as suggested by Sir William Thomson , F.R.S. ( Proc. Royal Society , vol. xiv .
p. 294 ) , the coil and cylinder being alternately vibrated on the same wire .

Values were also obtained when the suspended coil was moved two millims. in various directions about the centre , but they did not differ sensibly from the above .
As a verification of the results obtained with the electrodynamometer , the electromotive force of the new element was also determined by means of the sine galvanometer by a method which is well known , viz. E=(^Hsin\#171 ; )xK , ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
( 3 ) where E is the electromotive force , K is the radius of the circle , n the number of turns , H the horizontal intensity of the earth 's magnetism , \amp ; the angle through which the coils must be turned in order to maintain the needle in the plane of the coils , and R the resistance of the circuit in absolute measure .
The instrument employed was specially constructed for these experiments , and presents some novelties .
The needle was one centimetre in length , and was furnished with a mirror of parallel glass silvered by the chemical process , so that the reflection from either side could be observed in the telescope .
The coil was 140 millimetres in diameter , and was furnished with a large mirror accurately parallel to its plane , silvered on the observing or front side , and having the centre of the coil marked upon it ; by the aid of the tele " scope and these mirrors it was easy to adjust the needle accurately to the centre of the coil , and to ensure that the plane of the coil was truly vertical , and coincided with the magnetic meridian .
The telescope was carried on an arm one metre in length , which with the coil turned c 2 12 MR. LATIMER CLARK ON A STANDARD VOLTAIC BATTERY .
on a pair of theodolite plates ; and thus readings could be taken to half minutes .
The experiments were performed within five miles of the Eoyal Observatory .
The value of H , a knowledge of which is necessary for the determinations with this instrument , was kindly supplied to me by the Astronomer Eoyal for each day on which the observations were taken .
No iron was near the instrument .
A difference of potential equal to that of one standard cell was maintained between the poles of the sine galvanometer , by the use of an auxiliary battery , rheostat , and galvanometer , in the manner described when treating of the dynamometer observations .

The observations are corrected for the temperature of the element and of the coils ; but the correction for the breadth and depth of the coil , according to Professor Cleek Maxwell 's formula* , was so small as only to appear in the fifth place of decimals , and was therefore neglected .
The instrument was rewound twice with various lengths of wire .

The uses of this standard element to practical electricians are sufficiently obvious .
It may be used for determining the electromotive force of other elements by the use of an electrometer or by the discharge from a condenser .
Or a condenser having a capacity of farad charged by the standard cell would contain the B. A. unit quantity of electricity ( one Weber ) , or T^o of the absolute unit of quantity .

It is also of great value for maintaining a current of known strength in any circuit for the purposes of experimental research .
Thus if it be desired to produce in any circuit ( a b , fig. 5 ) a current equal to the B. A. unit of current absolute units ) , it is only Fig. 5 .

necessary to insert in the circuit a wire R having a resistance of 1*457 ohm , and to connect to each end of this wire the poles of a standard cell , c , with a galvanometer , , and to vary the strength of the current in a buntil no deflection is produced on the galvanometer ; the current through a b will then be equal to one B. A. unit of current , or 1 farad per second , whatever its length or resistance .
By varying the resistance of R , or by varying the number of elements , any given current can be steadily maintained through a at pleasure ; on the other hand , the value of any given current can be measured by so varying the resistance R that no deflection is produced on the galvanometer .
The value of the passing current will then be C\#151 ; - I\#151 ; farad per second .
It is also evident that , knowing the value of E , we may determine the horizontal intensity of the earth 's magnetism , H , in any place quickly and simply by means of an ordinary sine or tangent galvanometer .
Thus by transposing the equation ( 3 ) we have for the tangent galvanometer E 2nn R K tan 0 ( 4 ) In fact the standard of electric potential is second only in importance to that of the standard of electric resistance ; and the use of such a standard , combined with an auxiliary battery in the manner described in the foregoing paper , admits of a variety of applications which it is believed will be found of great value in electrical research .
In conclusion I have to acknowledge the great assistance I have received from Mr. Herbert Taylor , C.E. , and Dr. Alexander Muirhead , in conducting these experiments .
