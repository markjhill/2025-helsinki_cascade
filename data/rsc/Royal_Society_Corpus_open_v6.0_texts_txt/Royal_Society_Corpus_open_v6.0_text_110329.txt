A paper was read , entitled " On some Properties of Numbers in Geometrical Progression .
" By Charles Blacklewar , Esq. B.A. Communicated by J. G. Children , Esq. Sec. R.S. This paper contains the demonstrations of the three following theorems ; namely , n 1 ? .
If the terms of a geometrical series be raised to 2 , then any odd number of them is divisible by the corresponding terms of the original series .
2 ? .
If each term of a geometrical series be raised to any odd power , the sum of the terms so raised is divisible by the original series , if the number of terms taken be any power of 2 .
3 ? .
If the number of terms of a geometrical series be any power of 2 , the sum of the terms raised to the power m is divisible by the sum of the same terms raised to the power n , provided m divided by n be a whole number .
