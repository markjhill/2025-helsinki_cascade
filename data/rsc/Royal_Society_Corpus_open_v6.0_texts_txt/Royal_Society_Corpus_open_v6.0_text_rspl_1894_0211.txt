The pressure by weights was invariably higher than by crusher .
at 5 tons ( by crusher ) the difference was about 11 per cent. , at 6 tons about 9 per cent. , at 13 tons about 11 per cent. , at 16 tons about 16 per cent. At 5 , 6 , and 13 tons there is usually ( but not always ) less difference between the individual pressures by crusher giyea above than between the weights pressures ; at 16 tons there is decidedly greater regularity in the crusher results than in those by weights ; the crusher pressures are , however , the means of series , which favours them somewhat .

The Croonian Lecture was delivered as follows:\#151 ; Croonian Lecture.\#151 ; " On the Nature of Muscular Contraction .
" By Th. W. Engelmann , Professor of Physiology in the University of Utrecht .
Received February 25 , 1895 .
I beg your kind attention for a few moments to some observations and considerations on the nature of muscular contraction .
Besides its general biological interest , the subject may claim a particular interest for the members of this Society , for the venerable institution of these Croonian Lectures is especially devoted to the furtherance of the study of muscular life , and , moreover , the Royal Society has , through its Fellows , from Robert Hooke down to our friend Professor Schafer , produced numerous researches on muscular structure and action which may be said to belong to the most valuable part of our scientific property .
It will not be my task to recall to your mind all those eminent Fellows of this Society who have helped us to get a clearer insight iato this subject , yet I cannot refrain from reminding you of one of these men , who is honoured throughout the whole world as one of
