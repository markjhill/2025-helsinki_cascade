" The Wave-lengths of A , a , and of Prominent Lines in the Infra-Red of the Solar Spectrum .
" By Captain W. DE W. Abney , R.E. , F.R.S. Received November 20 , 1883 .
M. Fievez has recently sent me a map of the solar spectrum from j0 to A* inclusive , and as part of this region is one which I have 5 been measuring , I have examined the new publication with great interest .
Photography and eye measurements do not exactly coincide in the detail of the grouping of the little a group as far as A , and A itself is shown by M. Fipvez 's map as wanting some details which appear in the photographs .
Thus in the photographs there are some seventeen lines , whilst in M. Fievez 's map there are but thirteen .
Between A and a there are several lines of marked intensity in the photograph which are not shown in the new map .
The wave-lengths of the different lines from above " " to A are not the same as those given by Fievez , when they are taken from comparison photographs of the ' 1st order of the red and 2nd of the ultra-violet on the same plate , or when checked by photographs of the 2nd order of the red with the 3rd order of the green taken in a similar manner .
In my paper , " Phil. Trans. , " Part II , 1880 , I gave a method of using mirrors by which this could be effected , but since Professor Rowland introduced his concave gratings this is much more readily carried out .
He has kindly furnished me with gratings for the purpose , having about 14,400 lines to the inch , with focal distances of 7 feet 6 inches and 12 feet 6 inches respectively .
These have been employed in determining the wave-lengths of this part of the spectrum .
Cornu 's map was used as a reference for the ultraj| ; m o violet wave-lengths , and Angstrom 's map for those in the bine and green .
The two maps may be taken as equally exact .

[ Remarks .
Centre of 6th pair of lines in the flutings following A* 764a*2 7643-33 7652-2 The determination of A has been made* by Maseart , Smyth , and j\gt ; others , besides Angstrom and Langley , with discordant results .
I I think the above may be taken as accurate as are Cornu 's and Ang- .* strom 's maps .
It may be useful to forestal the detailed publication of my measure- | ments by giving the wave-lengths of a few of the principal lines in the infra-red .
The scale numbers refer to my map of the infra-red , which j is published in the " Phil. Trans. , " Part II , 1880. . .
