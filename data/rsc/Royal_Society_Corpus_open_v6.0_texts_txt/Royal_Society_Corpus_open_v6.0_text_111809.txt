The memoir contains a discussion of the problem " to find in how many ways a number q can be made up as a sum of m terms with the elements 0 , 1 , 2 , ... .
k , each element being repeatable an indefinite number of times .
" The number q may without loss of generality be taken to be equal to -(km--c ) , and the expression for the number of partitions of this number ( knm- ) is by a peculiar method reduced to the form coeff. xm in , where is an algebraical fx fx fraction , the form of which depends on the value of k , but which does in anywise involve the number m ; the denominator fx is the product of factors of the form 1--x , and up to certain limiting values of a the fraction is a proper fraction .
The author remarks in conclusion that the researches were made for the sake of their application to the theory developed in his " Second Memoir upon Quantics .
