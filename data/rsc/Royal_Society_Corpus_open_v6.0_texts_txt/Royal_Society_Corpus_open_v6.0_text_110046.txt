An Account of Experiments made with an Invariable Pendulum at New South Wales , by Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane , K.C.B. F.R.S. Communicated by Captain Henry Kater , F.R.S. , in a Letter to Sir Humphry Davy , Bart. P.R.S. Read June 19 , 1823 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1823 , p. 308 .
] In this communication , laid before the Royal Society at the request of Sir Thomas Brisbane , Captain Kater gives , the results of experiments made by Sir Thomas Brisbane and Mr. Dunlop , at Paramatta , in New South Wales ; and by Sir Thomas Brisbane , Captain Kater , and Mr. Rumker , in Portland Place , London , with an invariable pendulum belonging to the Board of Longitude .
The number of vibrations made by this pendulum in a mean solar day at London , in latitude 51ยง 311 81 " 4 , at the temperature of 600 , and reduced to a vacuum , was found to be 86090-17 : at Paramatta , in latitude 330 48 ' 43 " S. , by Sir Thomas Brisbane 's experiments 86021-59 ; and by those of Mr. Dunlop 86022-21 .
Captain Kater , after detailing these observations , proceeds to deduce the compression , and finds it , by comparing the vibrations at London with those resulting from Sir Thomas Brisbane 's experiments at Paramatta , to be -r-.T ; by Mr. Dunlop 's 2-5 .
By the comparison of the vibrations at Unst with those at Paramatta , Sir Thomas Brisbane 's experiments give 3s .
, and those of Mr. Dunlop -r- .
, for the compression .
But the author remarks that these numbers are not to be deemed conclusive , as a small alteration in the number of vibrations made by the pendulum would occasion a considerable difference in the fraction indicating the compression .
