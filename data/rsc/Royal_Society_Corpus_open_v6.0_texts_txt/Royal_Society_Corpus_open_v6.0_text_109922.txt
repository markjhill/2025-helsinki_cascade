On Corpora Lutea .
By Sir Everard Home , Bart. V.P.R.S. Read January 14 , 1819 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1819 , p. 59 .
] In this paper the author describes the origin , growth , use , and decay of the Corpora lutea .
The ovarium , before puberty , is a loose , open texture , in which are a number of globular cells .
After puberty , the Corpus luteum forms in the substance of the ovarium .
In the cow it appears , when magnified , as a mass of convolutions , somewhat like the brain .
Sir Everard then proceeds to describe the drawings which accompany this paper , and of which the object is to show that the Corpora lutea are the structures in which the ova are formed ; that they exist previous to , and perfectly independent of , sexual intercourse ; and that , when they have fulfilled their office of forming ova , they are destroyed by absorption , whether the ova are impregnated or not .
On examining the appearance of the Corpora lutea before and after impregnation , it appears probable that impregnation is necessary for the expulsion of the ovum ; but when impregnation does not take place , the ovum appears to remain in the cavity of the Corpus luteum .
Hence it may be concluded , that impregnation takes place in the ovarium itself .
