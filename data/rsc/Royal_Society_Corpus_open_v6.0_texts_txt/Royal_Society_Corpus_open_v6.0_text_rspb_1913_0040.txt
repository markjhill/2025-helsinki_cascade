) Introduction .
The object of this paper is to put on record the proportion of tsetse flies found in this district of Nyasaland to be infected with disease-producing trypanosomes , and , further , to identify the species of trypanosomes with which the flies are infected .
It must be understood that this paper only deals with the district lying near the camp at Kasu and not to every part of Nyasaland .
The geographical position and other features of this district have already been described in a previous paper.* It is known as the " Sleeping Sickness Area " or " Proclaimed Area , " and in it almost all the cases of the Human Trypanosome Disease of Nyasaland have occurred .
This disease is caused by Trypanosoma rkodesiense , and the natives give it the name of " Kaodzera , " but there is a good deal of evidence accumulating that T. rhodesiense is in reality T. hrucei , in which case the disease would be known as " Nagana .
" Definitions .
In this paper an infective fly is one which contains trypanosomes which have reached the final stage of their development and are capable of giving rise to disease .
An infected fly is one in which the development of the trypanosomes may not have reached this final stage , and where , therefore , it may not as yet be disease-producing .
An infective fly must be infected , whereas an infected fly need not be infective .
" Fly " means the tsetse fly , and in this paper the species dealt with is Glossina morsitans .
Methods Employed .
The method employed in studying the infectivity of the flies was simple .
Native boys were employed in catching the flies , which were brought up to Kasu in small cages by a native cyclist .
Each cage of flies was fed on three healthy animals\#151 ; the first day on a monkey , the second on a dog , and the * Supra , p. 269 .

423 third on a goat .
To ensure , as far as possible , that each animal was fed on by every fly , the flies were fed nine times\#151 ; three times on each animal .
The number of flies brought up each day would probably average about 60 , and as each animal was fed on by three cagefuls , then each monkey , dog , and goat ran the gauntlet of some 180 flies .
It is therefore impossible to arrive at any very precise knowledge of the proportion of infective flies in each cage .
Infectivity of the Flies .
As will be seen from Table I , every experiment , with the exception of one , was positive , and on two occasions a goat was infected by all the four species of pathogenic trypanosomes occurring in this neighbourhood .
The Commission showed in a previous paper* that one in three of the wild game found in this district is infected with trypanosomes , and recommended that the animals should be destroyed .
If this were done and a year allowed to elapse , the proportion of infective flies then found would be an index of the usefulness or futility of such operations .
The Commission is of opinion that the wild game is the principal factor in the spread of trypanosome disease , and that , for practical purposes , the smaller mammals , birds , and reptiles need not be taken into account .
The following table gives , in the first column , the date the first cageful of flies was fed on the monkey , the second column the number of flies fed ; the signs plus and minus show the result of feeding the flies on the monkey , dog , and goat .
The four species of trypanosomes carried by the " fly " in this district are T. hrucei vel rhodesiense , T. pecorum , T. simice , and T. caprce .
The first and second of these attack all three animals , the third the monkey and goat , being harmless to the dog , whereas the fourth only produces disease in the goat .
Where no plus or minus sign occurs it means that an animal was not available .
For example , the experiment beginning on January 20 shows that the monkey was infected by T. simice , the goat by T. brucei , and that no dog was available .
The experiment on February 21 shows that neither the dog nor goat became infected by the bites of 170 flies , and that no monkey was available .

3*5 This is only allowing one infective fly to each series of flies fed on the experimental animals , and is therefore the irreducible minimum .
The average number of flies fed on each animal was 180 , and it might well be that there were present in the same batch several flies infective with the same species of trypanosome .
Ten thousand flies gave rise to 135 infections , and taking it for granted that no fly was infective with more than one species of trypanosome , then 13*5 per 1000 flies are infective with one or other of the disease-producing trypanosomes of this district .

This means that in experiments carried out in the manner described T. brucei may be expected to turn up once in every three series , T. pecorum eight times in ten , and T. simice and T. caprae six times in ten .
Months and Seasons .
On examining Table I it will be seen that these infective flies occur all the year round , and are just as numerous during one season as another , it will also be seen that no experiments on the infectivity of the flies were carried out during July and August .
This was due to the fact that all the energy of the Commission was devoted during these two months to the study of the wild game .
Conclusions .
1 .
The tsetse flies ( Glossina morsitans ) caught in the " fly-country " near Kasu are infected with four species of disease-producing trypanosomes\#151 ; T. brucei vel rhodesiense , T. pecorum , T. simice , and T. caprce .
2 .
The proportion of infective flies is 13'5 per 1000 .
3 .
The proportion of flies infective with T. brucei vel rhodesiense , the cause of the Human Trypanosome Disease of Nyasaland , is 2 per 1000 .
4 .
The flies are found infective all the year round .
5 .
To prevent the infection of tsetse flies it is proposed that the experiment should be tried of destroying all the wild game in the " Proclaimed Area " of Nyasaland .
