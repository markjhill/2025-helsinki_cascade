) As is now well known , the very varied symptoms produced by rapid decompression from high atmospheric pressures , and popularly known as " caisson disease " or " diver 's palsy , " are due to liberation of bubbles of gas\#151 ; chiefly nitrogen\#151 ; in the blood and tissues .
In the course of a recently published investigation , I found that air is much more soluble in certain oils than in water .
Dr. J. S. Haldane pointed out to me the interest of this fact in connection with the causation of caisson disease , and at his suggestion I have repeated and extended my observations .
The fats experimented with were olive oil , cod liver oil and lard .
In the case of the first two , the solubility was measured at 15 ' and at 37 ' C. , whilst for lard it was determined at 45 ' C. In the observations made at room temperature , the oil was shaken violently with air in a bottle for several minutes , and was allowed to stand for 1 to 1J hours till all the air bubbles had risen to the surface .
It was then weighed , and about 40 to 50 grammes of it were sucked up into the vacuous flask of a Geissler 's mercury pump .
This flask contained 70 to 100 c.c. of 0*5 per cent , sulphuric acid which had previously been well boiled for an hour so as to get rid of all traces of air .
The mixture of oil and water was now boiled for half an hour , the oil breaking up into a very fine emulsion and giving up practically all of its gas in the first few minutes .
This gas was pumped off and analysed with Haldane's* gas analysis apparatus .
The oil was boiled with dilute acid instead of water , so as to obtain the whole of the carbon dioxide present , both combined and in solution .
In determining the solubility at 37 ' , the oil , previously saturated at room temperature , was warmed to about 38 ' to 39 ' , and was shaken vigorously with air for about two minutes .
At the end of this time its temperature had fallen to about 360,5 .
It was warmed up a second time and the shaking repeated , and was then kept in a water bath at 37 ' for about half an hour in the case of the cod liver oil , and an hour in the case of the olive oil , these being the times required for all the bubbles of air to rise to the surface .
The gaseous content of a weighed amount of the oil was then determined as before .
The results obtained are given in the tables .

To calculate these values , it was assumed that the specific gravity of olive oil at 15 ' is 0'917 , and at 37 ' , 0'902.* The specific gravity of cod liver oil , compared with that of water at 15 ' , was found by direct experiment to be 0*928 at 15 ' , and 0*914 at 37 ' .

A similar constancy was found by Bunsen for the solubility of oxygen in alcohol at temperatures from 0 ' to 24 ' , though Timofjew*f* has since found that the solubility does slightly diminish with the temperature .
In any case the diminution is small ( 6*8 per cent , diminution for oxygen and 5*2 per cent , diminution for nitrogen between 0 ' and 24 ' ) and if it exists at all in the case of these oils , it must be smaller still .
A simple proof of the slight effect of temperature on solubility is obtained by saturating the oil at room temperature , and heating it gradually in a water bath .
Not a trace of gas is observed to come off if the temperature be kept at 97 ' ; but at 100 ' it bubbles off in very small quantities .
The observations on lard were carried out at one temperature only .
Lard melts at 36 ' to 48 ' , and solidifies at 27 ' to 30 ' , but if melted and shaken with * See Lewkowitsch , " Chemical Analysis of Oils , Fats and Waxes , " London , 1898 , .

Solubility of Air in [ Apr. 1 , air at 37 ' it is too viscid to allow the air bubbles to rise to the surface in a reasonable time .
Hence the solubility was determined at 45 ' .
The lard was heated to about 48 ' , and then shaken violently for a minute with air , its temperature at the end of this time having fallen slightly below 45 ' .
The process was repeated , and after keeping the lard in a water bath at 45 ' for about 35 minutes the gases were boiled off in the usual way .
They came oft quite as readily as from the olive and cod liver oils .
The data obtained are given in the table , they being calculated on the supposition that the specific gravity of lard at 45 ' , as compared with water at 15 ' , is 0*895.* If the mean values be compared with the mean values for the other fats , it will be seen that the solubility of oxygen is practically constant throughout .

Still these differences are almost within the limits of experimental error .
In the case of the lard , it is possible that the two minutes ' shaking with air was not quite sufficient for complete saturation , but more thorough shaking was not possible , as it brought down a slight precipitate which prevented the rapid clearing of the air bubbles .

From the physical and chemical constants collected in the accompanying table , f we see that the melting point of human fat lies between those of cod liver oil and lard , whilst its iodine value is 61*5 per cent. , or about the same as that of lard .

olive oil one of about 83 per cent. , it follows that the proportion of unsaturated acids present in a fat has little or no influence upon its solvent powers for oxygen and nitrogen .
From the absorption coefficients for oxygen and nitrogen given by Bohr and Bock* it is calculated that 100 c.c. of water saturated with air at 15 ' absorb 0*733 c.c. of oxygen and 1*411 c.c. of nitrogen .
Taking a mean of all the values obtained with cod liver oil and olive oil at 15 ' , the solubility of oxygen is found to be 3*1 times greater than in water , and of nitrogen 3*7 times greater .
At 37 ' Bohr and Bock 's values show that 100 c.c. of water absorb 0*507 c.c. of oxygen , and 0*975 c.c. of nitrogen .
Taking a mean of all the values obtained with cod liver oil and olive oil at 37 ' , and with lard at 45 ' ( for doubtless the solubility at this temperature is practically the same as at 37 ' ) , the solubility of oxygen is found to be 4*5 times greater than in water , and that of nitrogen 5*3 times greater .
It has been found by Bohr , f that blood plasma dissolves 2*5 per cent , less nitrogen than an equal volume of water , whilst blood dissolves slightly less still ; hence we may conclude that at body temperature the fat of mammals dissolves at least five times as much nitrogen as water or as blood and blood plasma .
The solubility of oxygen in fats , though apparently less than that of nitrogen , may in reality be as great .
It is well known that oils are able to absorb and combine with oxygen , and the rate of this absorption is by no means inconsiderable .
For instance , a sample of olive oil was saturated with air at 15 ' , and was kept for 23 hours at 18 ' in a stoppered bottle filled to the brim .
It then yielded only 0*49 c.c. of oxygen per 100 c.c. , whilst some of the sample from which the air was boiled off an hour after saturation yielded 2*40 c.c. Owing to its richness in unsaturated acids , cod liver oil absorbs oxygen more quickly still , and a sample saturated with air at 15 ' , and kept 23 hours at 18 ' in a stoppered bottle , gave only 0*05 c.c. of oxygen per 100 c.c. Undoubtedly , therefore , there must have been some absorption of dissolved oxygen during the half to one and a-half hours the air-saturated oils were kept before analysis .
It might be thought that the solubilities , determined by the above described method are invalidated , or liable to be invalidated , by leakage of air into the vacuum pump .
This is not the case if due precautions are taken .
The pump must be in such good order that no appreciable leakage occurs when it is left vacuous for several days , and it must be kept vacuous for a week or more before use , for if air be left in it a small amount attaches itself to the glass walls of the apparatus , and only escapes slowly when the pump is * Bohr and Bock , ' Wied .

Solubility of Air in [ Apr. 1 made vacuous again .
Air likewise attaches itself to the walls of the boiling flask , but it is got rid of by the preliminary boiling of the dilute acid previous to the introduction of the oil .
In all analyses of gases , whether in oil , water , or salt solutions , such a preliminary boiling was invariably adopted , and by taking these precautions many hundreds of analyses have been made without invalidation of results by leakage of air .
I have elsewhere* recorded nearly a hundred analyses of the gases in sea water , and the mean nitrogen values then obtained are almost identical with the nitrogen absorption values determined by Dittmar .
The bearing of the above recorded results upon many phases of caisson disease is probably a direct one .
The commonest symptoms observed in caissoniers consist of joint and muscular pains , and in paralysis , the latter being the result of injury to the spinal cord .
Thus in autopsies of caissoniers , Bert observed softening of some inches of the spinal cord in the dorsal region , v. Leyden , in a case of death 15 days after decompression , observed signs of myelitis , and small irregular fissures in the mid-dorsal cord , probably produced by the escape of gas .
Autopsies of divers have shown necrobiosis and haemorrhages in the spinal cord , f and distention of the blood vessels by air bubbles .
J Chemical analysis shows that spinal cord and peripheral nerves contain nearly 20 per cent , of fat and fat-like substances .
Adipose tissue contains about 83 per cent , of fat , and yellow bone marrow ( as distinct from red marrow , which is poor in fat ) contains no less than 96 per cent , of fat ( Gorup-Besanez ) .
If these tissues were saturated with nitrogen at , for instance , four atmospheres of atmospheric pressure , 100 c.c. of them would contain , instead of the 0*975 x4 = 3*90 c.c. of dissolved nitrogen present in an equal volume of water , about 7 c.c. in the case of the spinal cord and nerve , and 20 c.c. in the case of yellow bone marrow .
On sudden decompression , therefore , the volume of nitrogen bubbling off in a gaseous form might be two to six times as much as that from the non-fatty fluids and tissues of the body .
It has been found that the .severity of the symptoms developed by caissoniers is influenced greatly by the time of exposure to increased pressure .
In sinking the foundations of a bridge at St. Louis , a pressure reaching at a maximum to 50 lbs. above normal was used , and a large proportion of the workers were affected .
As the depth of the caissons increased , the shifts were shortened from four hours to one hour , with the result that the serious * Vernon , ' Journ. Physiol. , ' vol. 19 , p. 68 , 1895 .

accidents were reduced to nil* Presumably , therefore , the body tissues were not so fully saturated with nitrogen in the shorter as in the longer period .
On the other hand , Hill and Greenwoodf found that on exposing themselves to a pressure of 30 to 45 lbs. , their urine became saturated with the theoretical amount of nitrogen in 10 to 15 minutes .
This quicker saturation must be due to the blood-flow through the kidney being much more rapid than that through the spinal cord , and very much more rapid than that through adipose tissues .
Even if it were as rapid through fat-containing tissues as through the kidney , the fats , in virtue of their greater solvent power , would take longer to become fully saturated than the fluids of non-fatty tissues .
Conclusion .
At body temperature , fats dissolve more than five times as much nitrogen as an equal volume of water or blood plasma .
The special tendency of the fat-containing tissues ( such as subcutaneous tissues , spinal cord and peripheral nerves ) of caisson workers and divers to suffer injury from the liberation of gas bubbles after rapid decompression is dependent on this great solubility .
