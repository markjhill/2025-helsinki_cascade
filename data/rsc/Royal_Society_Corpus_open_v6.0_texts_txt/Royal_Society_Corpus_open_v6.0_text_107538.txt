On the fluents of irrational functions .
By Edward Ffrench Bromhead , Esq. M. A. Communicated by J. F. W. Herschel , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 4 , 18i6 .
HE efforts of analysts in determining the fluents of rational functions , have been completely successful , and their labours form one of the most perfect and beautiful branches of the fluxionary calculus .
In the irrational functions , however , we find but little effected .
With the exception of WARING , modern analysts have not added any thing important , to the forms given by NEWTON , CRAIG , COTES , and BERNOULLI .
No attempt lias been made to generalize the known forms , and the last eminent writer on the subject , LA CRoix , seems to consider them as independent results , not deducible from any common principles , and refers us to the Petersburgh Acts , and other miscellaneous Collections .
In the following pages , it is attempted to generalize and systematize our knowledge on this subject ; and to show that all the known forms result from other forms of the greatest extent , not depending on particular functions , but upon the properties of all rational functions whatever .
R , R , R , R , denote rational functions of any kind ' ; R"- ' , R- ' , XZn ]i R-~ , Rt their inverse functions .
Thus if x -R ( v ) any rational function of ( v ) , then v= R- ' ( x ) the inverse function .
It is thought unnecessary to prove , that the fluxions of all rational functions , and all rational functions of them , are themselves rational .

By this theorem , any of the expressions deducible from Prop. I. may enter contemporaneously , and we may find fluents of very great intricacy .

This form may be extended to Prop. II .

The cases are very few , in which the ditficulty can be overcome , and perhaps the following Propositions will be found to include all the instances , in which analysts have effected the reduction .

Hence we have R { R ( z ) , R ( z ) } = o ; remove fractions and make the coefficients of the powers of z vanish .
This will give the indeterminates , if x and v admit common rationalities .
Thence xe have d. DR ( ) .
R ( z ) rational .
Should all the artifices in the foregoing propositions fail , we must attempt to resolve the fluxion into a series of terms , such that each term may be separately rationalized .
This is 344l4 often possible , when the original function does not admit a rational expression , and can be effected sometimes directly , and sometimes by introducing a new variable .
But it will first be necessary to reduce all irrational functions whatever to a definite form .
LEMMA .
To reduce all irrational functions to a definite form .
1 .
By successively multiplying numerators and denominators into the same expressions , every irrational function may at last be reduced to a series of terms , whose numerators and denominators do not contain any fraction or negative index .
Thus + ' .
and if , y , a , b , c , are ( a+ +jT .
( acn + b)m functions involving fractions or negative indices , themselves , the reduction is continued in the same manner .
2 .
Now multiply both the numerators and denominators of the expressions so reduced , by such multipliers , as will render the denominators rational .
This factor is the product of all the different values of the denominator , with the exception of the denominator itself .
The new numerators will still consist of a series of terms not involving any fraction or negative index. .

By expanding all the integer powers under the index 7 ; and again reducing the indices of the sums and products , which are under it , to a common denominator n ' ; we shall by continuing the same operations , ultimately reduce the whole expression , to a series of terms of the form R ( x ) AV mS denoting the sum of any number of terms such as follow it , wherein R ( x ) may be different in each term , but always of the form cxm + cxm-+ e the series of terms above exhibited , may readily be found ; by introducing all the rational parts entirely under the radicals ; by reducing the indices of all the terms to a common denominator p ; by expanding all integer powers ; and by again reducing all the products and sums contained under - , to indices with a common denominator yt .
These operations continued , will ultimately lead to the expression\y/ F/ P* ( b ) R ( x ) SS v ' ... S V/ , where amay be of any diffeR ( x ) R ( -x ) rent values in the different sums , but always of the form ax + ax + .

Sometimes by the substitution of a new variable , for some function of x , the fluxion will be divided into a series of terms , each of which may be separately made rational .
-But unfortunately no general principle has been discovered , to which these reductions can be referred .
Cor. 3 .
As the fluent of each term can sometimes be found apart , when the fluent of the whole cannot be found at once ; so conversely , the fluent of a series of terms may be found , when each separate term surpasses the powers of analysis .

Which theorem admits farther extension , and may be applied to elliptic arches .
Should the above processes for rendering the fluxion rational fail us , we must attempt the fluxion at once in its irrational state , for which purpose I shall add a few miscellaneous observations .
i. If &lt; p ( x ) , V ( x ) be any algebraic functions , d ( x ) then dT{ ( x ) + log .
m ( x ) } = dp ( x ) + i- .
is an algebraic expression .
Whenever , therefore , we meet with an 349 algebraic fluxion , we may legitimately try q ( x ) + log .
p ( x ) , as a form to which the fluent may possibly belong.* 9 .
It presents three cases : ist .
where the fluent is wholly algebraic , for which we assume some expression so general , that its fluxion will include the given fluxion , if it admit an algebraic fluent ; or we find the fluent implicitly by an equation : ddly .
where the fluent is mixed , when we attempt to separate the algebraic part : 3dly .
where the fluent is purely logarithmic , when we assume , as in the firat case , some expression with indeterminate constants , sufficiently general to include the given fluxion .
g. In assuming for an algebraic fluxion , it must be observed , that the fluent will always be a surd of the same order as the fluxion .
On this principle WARING gives some assumptions for surds of the second order , but nothing has been attempted generally for surds of all orders , for want of some definite form which should include them all .
In irrationals of the first order , the fluxion may always be reduced to series of terms , such as dx .
Ix + a".x + aY ix + a\ where the factors are all different , and where the indices are positive , negative , fractions , integers , or unity .
Then let R.(x ) be any expression cx"+ cxn-Z +. .
with indeterminate coefficients .
Assume for the fluent ( )( x ?
) n+ ) R ( x ) n-I Its fluxion will be DR ( x ) .
x( + a ) .

( x a ) the original fluxion .
In Now that the two expressions may be equal , the coefficient found above must be = i , or we must have DR ( x).Q-R ( ).Q ' R ( x ) } n-I n-I n-i where Q and Q ' are the expressions in the coefficient involving a , a , a. By equating the terms in this equation , the indei n terminates c , c , c , &amp;c. may be found ; but the reduction will I2 often be impossible , as there are more equations to be satisfied than there are indeterminates .
4 .
If any index a , 3 , y =--- , the expression fails , and there is no algebraic fluent ; also WARING says , that if the dimensions of a fluxional coefficient be--i , the fluent cannot be algebraic .
5 .
If ( x ) be an irrational function , let z =fdx .
q ( x ) =fdJx .
v ; then since R x , v}o there are cases , where we can determine , R x , z } = o.* 6 .
If ( x ) , ,r ( x ) be irrational functions of .
, we have Jdf .
( x ) =fd .
{ ( x ) +s ( x ) } ~-fJ .
( , ) Now let I ( x ) be so assumed , that See Phil , Trans , 1764- , -EMBRsoNR ' Fluxions 351 fdx .
*{ ( x ) +{ ( )x ) } I ?
( ) , and we have $dx * .
q ( x)3 p ( x)--fod .
r ( x ) .
If therefore ?
r ( x ) be a simpler expression than ( &lt; x ) , the fluxion will be reduced to a simpler form .
In order to find w ( x ) ; ( x ) is assumed with indeterminate coefficients , so that its fluxion may be of the same form as dx .
&lt; q ( x ) .
Now equate the similar terms in the two expressions , and the indeterminates may be found .
But as there may be more equations than indeterminates , we add vr ( x ) a function of the same form , and containing indeterminates of sufficient number , to satisfy all the deficient equations .
We shall thus have Dp ( ) =P ( X ) +x ( + ) and .
( x ) =d .
{ ( x ) + ( x ) } by which the difficulty may be reduced to findingfdx .
r ( x ) .
Reductions of particular kinds were discovered by SIMPSON and others , but this is universally applicable .

It may be of advantage to reduce the index of the variable under the radical , which may sometimes be effected .
In dx .

If the fluent be wholly logarithmic , we may assume for irrationals of the first order iog , )R ( ).(x + a)6 .
( x + b ) ... +R ( ).( + c)( .
+ } O ?
i(~~~~~~~~~~~~ I shall conclude by observing that the fluxion may always be made rational , if the fluent be wholly algebrate , or wholly logarithmic .
Thus , if q ( x ) be any algebraic function , take xa= p,1 R ( v ) , Then dq ( x ) =d ( qR ( v ) ) dR ( v ) and d ( log .
( px =d ( log .
q)p-l R ( v ) i are both rational .
If the fluent be of the mixed form ?
\ ( x ) + log .
( x ) , its fluxion may be made rational , if R , 1R , can be so assumed that ?
-I R ( x ) = p--1 R ( x ) ; and it may ii always be effected by introducing two new variables .
First let x= -x -R ( v ) , and the fluxion becomes d(99'R ( v ) dR ( v ) + -R--'- ; now let v R- ' pCR ( Z ) , an Rq ) 'R(v ) S-^(l i^ we get dRdR ( z ) a ( v ) +R ) which is wholly rational .

Note.-As modern analysts have in general confounded the fluxions , either with the increments or the derived functions , it may not be superfluous to state precisely , what is meant by the symbols d and D. If it be possible , ( which must be shown in each particular case ) to expand p ( x + v ) in the form p ( x ) +9 ( x ) .
+q ( x). .
; then 9 ( x ) is called the derived ~'* function of i ( x ) , and its relation to Q ( x ) is thus expressed , p ( x ) D ( x ) .
Hence , if x be considered a function of itself , we have ( x + v ) = ( x ) +D ( x ) .
v , and , .
D ( x ) Now to avoid a constant reference to the variable x , of which other variables are considered as functions , we introduce fluxions .
Ify , , w , ... are functions of the 355 same variable , then die , dz , dw , * are expressions proportional to the derived func tions of y , zs , w. whatever may be the variable of which they are common functions .
Iene e Wy =-Dz ; and if y be a function of x , or = ( ) , then d= Dop ( x ) De = Dp ( x ) and.- , die dx .
Dp ( x ) .
Moreover , since the derived functions are in the limiting ratio of the increments , so also are the fluxions .
From this consideration we can in the applications of analysis , practically determine the ratio of the fluxions , when the derived functions are unknown .
