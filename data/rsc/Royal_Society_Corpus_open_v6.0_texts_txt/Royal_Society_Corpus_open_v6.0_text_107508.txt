A new method of solving numerical eqiuations of all orders , by continuous approximation.* By W. G. Horner , Esq. Communicated by Davies Gilbert , Esq. F. R. S. Read July 1 , 1819 .

TH E process which it is the object of this Essay to establish , being nothing else than the leading theorem in the Calculus of Derivations , presented under a new aspect , may be regarded as a universal instrument of calculation , extending to the composition as well as analysis of functions of every kind .
But it comes into most useful application in the numerical solution of equations .

To the important cases in which the discovery of y , 3 , &amp;c. depends on the previous developerment of the partial functions P ( o + ~x ) , j ( a + ~x + yX2 ) , &amp;c. it is totally inapplicable .
A theorem which should meet this deficiency , without sacrificing the great facilitating principle of attaching the functional symbols to M alone , does not appear to have engaged the attention of mathematicians , in any degree proportionate to the utility of the research .
This desideratum it has been my object to supply .
The train of considerations pursued is sufficiently simple ; and as they have been regulated by a particular reared to the genius of arithmetic , and have been carried to the utmost extent , the result Seems to possess all the harmony and simplicity that can be desired ; and to unite to continuity and perfect accuracy , a degree of facility superior even to that of the best popular methods .
Investigatio'n of the Method .
$ .
In the general equation epx 0o I assume x= R+r + r'+r"-*** and preserve the binomial and continuous character of the operations , by making successively x=R +z =R+r +z ' =R ' +z ' =RI+r'+z " R= R"+ = z"= .
Where R# represents the whole portion of$ which has already been subjected to o , and zx= rt+z ' the portion still excluded ; but of which the part rv is immediately ready for use , and is to be transferred from the side of z to that of R , so as to change ?
Rto p R , ' without suspending the corrective process .
4 .
By TAYLOR'S theorem , expressed in the more convenient manner of ARBOGAST , we have , x=p ( R + z)= ?
R + DpR , z +I R. + D3 0R .
z3 + ... .
839 Where by DI qpR is to be understood d-pR-d 7 viz. the nb derivee with its proper denominator ; or , that function which ARBOGAST calls the derivee divise'e , and distinguishes by ac subscribed .
Having no occasion to refer to any other form of the derivative functions , I drop thedistinctive symbol for the sake of convenience .
Occasionally these derivees will be represented by a , b , c , &amp;c. 5 .
Supposing cpR and its derivees to be known , the mode of valuing pR ' or q ( R + r ) is obvious .
We have only to say in the manner of LAGRANGE , when preparing to develope his Theory of Functions , ( pR ' R+ Are A=DpR +Br B DqpR + Cr C : D3pR + Dr V Dn2pR + Ur U-D &gt; p R+r ... . .
E. Taking these operations in reverse order , we ascend with rapidity to the value of q ( R + r ) or pR ' .
6 .
The next point is , to apply a similar principle to discover the value of q ( R +r+ r ' ) =( R ' + r ' ) = pR " .
We here have pR " pR ' + A ' r ' A ' DR ' + Br ' B ' = D2R'4+ C ' r ' C ' D3pR'+ D ' r ' V= D- , pR U ' + r ' U ' D- ' qnR'+ .
r ' But the former operation determined &lt; pR ' only , without giving the value of any of the derived functions .
The very simple scale of known quantities , therefore , by which we advance so rapidly in the first process , fails in those which follow .
7 .
Still we can reduce these formulae to known terms ; for since we have in general r+i.r+2 ... ... ..r+s s Dr D cp --------D ( See ARBOGAST , ยง 137 ) ; by applying a similar reduction to the successive terms in the developement of Dm pR'= Dm p ( R +r ) , we obtain* DmpR'-=D.'R+ T Dm+R ( R. r+ m. m+ D , m+ pR.r m+ I..m+ 3 Dm+3q R r3+ &amp;c. And it is manifest that this expression may be reduced to a form somewhat more simple , and at the same time be accommodated to our principle of successive derivation , by introducing the letters A , B , C , &amp;c. instead of the functional expressions .
8 .
As a general example , let M=Dm qR+Nr N =Dm iR +Pr P =Dm+a+2R+ Qr represent any successive steps in the series in Art .
5 ; then are D'M R= MNr Dm+ ; R NPr Dm+zR =P -Qr And by substituting these equivalents in the developement just enounced , it becomes D " &lt; pR'= M+m Nr + mn m+ Pr ' + m : *-2 Q. &amp;c. 9 .
With this advantage , we may now return to the process of Art .
6 , which becomes R " ( pR ' + A ' r ' A'= ( A + Br+ Cr ' + Dr + Er + &amp;c. ) + B ' r B ' ( B + Cr +3 Dr +4 Er + &amp;c. ) + C ' C'=-(C +8 Dr+ 6 Er ' + &amp;c. ) + D ' r ' e ?
*a* e here employed are lower by one order than those which naturally occur in transforming an equation of the nth degree .
But it is much to be wished , that these coefficients could be entirely dispensed with .
Were this object effected , no multipliers would remain , except the successive corrections of the root , and the operations would thus arrange themselves , in point of simplicity , in the same class as those of division and the square root .
12 .
Nor will this end appear unattainable , if we recur to the known properties of figurate numbers ; which present to our view , as equivalent to the nlh term of the mtb series : i. The difference of the n'b and ntlb term of the mr + 1th series .
2 .
The sum of the first n terms of the m--1th series .
3 .
The sum of the nth term of the m--1th , and the n--1th term of the mth series .
The depression already attained has resulted from the first of these properties , and a slight effort of reflection will convince us that the second may immediately be called to our aid .
i3 .
For this purpose , let the results of Art .
9 be expressed by the following notation : PR"=R ' + A ' r ' A ' = Al + B ' r ' B ' =B+ C ' r ' C= C3 + Dli V ' = V_2+ U ' r ' U'= U_I+r ' the exponents subjoined to any letter indicating the degree 3of the figurate coefficients in that formula of the theorem , of which such letter is the first term .
14 .
Although this statement appears only to have returned to us the conditions of Art .
6 , with all their disadvantages , and to have merely substituted AI for DqR ' or a ' B2 for D2R'or b ' C3 for DqR ' or c ' &amp;c. yet , by means of the property just alluded to , the essential data A , B , C , &amp;c. which have disappeared , will again be extricated .
For the developement of DmpR ' , found in Art , 8 , undergoes thereby the following analysis : M+m Nr+ mm+ Pr +m I.+t pQr3 + .
M+ Nr+ Pr2 + Qr3 + ... .
+Nr+ Pr+39Qr3+ ... ... + Nr+3Pr+6Qr 3+ ... ... + Nr +m Pr+ Qr3+ ... ... which equivalence will be thus expressed : Mm=M+N r+Nzr+N r+ ... ... -NMr Returning therefore once more to our theorem , we now have R " pR ' + A'r ' A=( A+ Blr ) + B ' r B'(B+Cr +C2r ) +Cr ' C =(C D , r + -Dr + D3r ) + D ' r ? . .

0V= ( V+Ur+Uzr+U 3r+ ... ... Un_r ) +Ur U'= ( U + nt.r ) +r ' This theorem employs exactly the same total number of addends as Theorem II , but with the iiportant improvement , that the num.er of addends to each derivee is inversely as their magnitude , contrary to what happened befo-re Figu ~ .
, ~ude .
And is easy to convmce rate multipliers are also Andis to ourselves that no embarrassment will arse fro the newly introduced futnctions .
For if we expand aany of the addends Nr in the general formula equivalent to Mm arid analyze it by means of the third roperty of figurate series , we shall find Mr =N r+Pk And since we take the scale in our Theorem in a reverse or ascending order , this formula merely instructs us to multiply an addend already determined by r , and to add the product to another known addend ; and if we trace its effect through all the descending scale , to the first operations , we observe that the addends to the last derivee , from which the work begins , are simply r repeated n- ' .
times .
i6 .
Because N o-N , the addend exterior to the parenthesis , might for the sake of uniformity be written Nr The harmony of the whole scheme would then be more completely displayed .
To render the simplicity of it equally perfect , we may reflect that as the factors r , r ' , &amp;c. are engaged in no other manner tha has just been tated , viz. in effecting the subordinate derivations , their appearance amnong the principal ones is superfluous , and tends to create embarrassment .
Assume therefore kN Njr and we have .
at their first occurrence in the table , and their ultimate application at the second .
The operations included in the parentheses may be mentally effected , whenever r is a simple digit .
And lastly , the vertical arrangement of the addends adapts them at once to the purposes of arithmetic , on every scale of notation .

The remarks which are yet to be adduced will bear almost exclusively on the Analytic portion of the Theorem , from which the Synthetic differs only in the less intricate management of the first derivee ; this function having no concern with the discovery of the root , and its multiple being additive like all the rest , instead of subtractive .
From the unrestricted nature of the notation employed , it is evident that no class of equations , whether finite , irrational or transcendental , is excluded from our design .
In this respect indeed , the new method agrees with the established a-_ lb Der urU n.r U ' 7 ] i{ ( r ' ( U ' popular methods of approximation ; a circumstance in favour of the latter , which is overlooked by many algebraists , both in employing those methods , and in comparing thema with processes pretending to superior accuracy .
The radical feature which distinguishes them from ours is this : they forego the influence of all the derivees , excepting the first and perhaps the second ; ours provides for the effectual action of all .
20o .
Concerning these derives little need be said , as their nature and properties are well known .
It is sufficient to state that they may be contemplated either as differential coefficients , as the limiting equations of NEWTON , or as the nume.rical coefficients of the transformed equation in R+ z. This last elementary view will suffice for determining them , in most of the cases to which the popular solutions are adequate ; viz. in finite equations where R , an unambiguous limiting value of x , is readily to be conjectured .
When perplexity arises in consequence of some roots being imaginary , or differing by small quantities , the second notation must be called in aid .
The first , in general , when qx is irrational or transcendental .
21 .
The fact just stated , namely , that our theorem contains within itself the requisite conditions for investigating the limits , or presumptive impossibility , of the roots , demonstrates its sufficiency for effecting the developement of the real roots , independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this purpose , we might assume R o ; r , r , &amp;c. -= i or .
1 &amp;c. and adopt , as most suitable to these conditions , the algorithm of Theorem II , until we had arrived at R " , an unambiguous Jinmiting value of x. But since these initiatory researches seem more naturally to depend on the simple derivees , a , b , &amp;c. than on A , B , &amp;c. their aggregates ; and since , in fact , as long as ris assumptive orindependent of R , our system of derivation offers no peculiar advantage ; I should prefer applying the limiting formulae in the usual way ; passing however from column to column ( WOOD , ยง 318 .
) of the results , at first by means of the neat algorithm suggested in the note on Art .
7 , and afterwards by differencing , &amp;c. as recommended by LAGRANGE , ( Res. des Eq. Num. ยง 13 ) , when the number of columns has exceeded the dimensions of the equation .
( Vide Addendum .
) If , during this process the observation of DE GUA be kept in view , that whenever all the roots of px are real , Dmm-1 ( px and Dm+ qpx will have contrary signs when Dm px is made to vanish , we shall seldom be under the necessity of resorting to more recondite criteria of impossibility .
Every column in which o appears between results affected with like signs , will apprize us of a distinct pair of imaginary roots ; and even a horizontal change of signs , occurring between two horizontal permanences of an identical sign , will induce a suspicion , which it will in general be easy , in regard of the existing case , either to confirm or to overthrow .
22 .
The facilities here brought into a focus , constitute , I believe , a perfectly novel combination ; and which , on that account , as well as on account of its natural affinity to our own principles , and still more on account of the extreme degree of simplicity it confers on the practical investigation of limits , appears to merit the illustration of one or two familiar examples .
Ex. i. Has the equation x4x3 + 8*2i6x + ?
loo any real root ?
-See EULER , C. D. p. 678 .
01 22 0 ' 4,0 -16 -3 oi8 e ; 8 , -4 ?
0 4 ; Here the first column consists of the given co-efficients taken in reverse order .
In the second , 9 is the sum of the first column , 8 is =-16 + ( 8 ) +3 ( -4 ) +4( ) , is =8+3 ( -4 ) +6 ( i ) , &amp;c. The third column is formed from the second , by the same easy process .
We need proceed no farther ; for the sequences 2 , o , 1 in the second column , and 4 , o , 8 in the third , show that the equation has two pairs of imaginary roots .
Consequently it has no real root .
Ex. e. To determine the nearest distinct limits of the positive roots of ix3 7x +7= o. See LAGRANGE , Res. des E. N. ยง 27 , and note 4 .
ยง 8 .
Operating as in the former example , we have X0 10 27111I11 ' -7 4 Since all the signs are now positive , 2 is greater than any of the positive roots .
Again , between -4 and + 5 , it is manifest , that o will occur as a value of the first derivee , and that the simultaneous value of the second derivee will be affirmative .
But as the principal result has evidently converged and subsequently diverged again in this interval , no conclusion relative to the simultaneous sign of that result can be immediately drawn .
We will return to complete the transformations .
Forx= 1. .

11 Here the first column was formed from that under x-=i , by annexing ciphers according to the dimensions of the functions ; the 2nd and 3rd columns and the number 97 were found as in the former Example ; the remaining numbers by differencing and extending the series 1000ooo,631,3$8,97 .
We have no need to continue the work , since the changes of signs in the principal results indicate the first digits of the roots in question to be 1.3 and i.6 .
But if we proceed by farther differencing to complete all the lines , the columns standing under these numbers will give the co-efficients of p(i.3 + z ) and ( i.6 + z ) without farther trouble .
23 .
Assuming , then , that R has been determined , and R+z substituted for x in the proposed equation , thereby transforming it to A=az + bza+ cz3+ dz4 +.****. .
it is to this latter equation that the analytical part of our theorem is more immediately adapted .
Now the slightest degree of reflection will evince , that our method is absolutely identical for all equations of the same order , whether they be binomial or adfected , as soon as the transformation in R has been accomplished .
The following description , therefore , of a familiar process in arithmetic , will convey an accurate general idea of our more extensive calculus , and obviate the necessity of any formal precepts .
In EVOLUTION , the first step is unique , and if not assisted by an effort of memory , could only be tentative .
The whole subsequent process may be defined , division by a variable divisor .
For an accurate illustration of this idea , as discoverable in the existing practice of arithmeticians , we cannot however refer to the mode of extracting any root , except that of the square ; and to this , only in its most recently improved state .
Here , in passing from one divisor to another , two additive corrections are introduced .
; the first depending on the last correction of the root , the second on the correction actually making .
And this new quotient correction of the root , since it must exist previously to the completion of the divisor by which it is to be verified , is required to be found by means of the incomplete divisor ; and may be taken out , either to one digit only , as is most usual , or to a number of digits equal to that which the complete and incomplete divisors possess in common .
And farther , as these divisors may not , in the first instance , agree accurately even in a single digit , it is necessary at that stage of the operation , mentally to anticipate the effect of the new quotient , so as to obtain a sufficiently correct idea of the magnitude of the new divisor .
24 .
This is an accurate statement of the relation which the column headed by the first derivee bears to the analysis .
The remaining columns contribute their aid , as successively subsidiary to each other ; the contributions commencing with the last or n-1th derivee , and being conveyed to the first through a regular system of preparatory addends dependent on the last quotient-correction , and of closing addends dependent on the new one .
The overt and registered manner of conducting the whole calculation , enables us to derive important advantage from anticipated corrections of the divisors , not only at the first step , but , if requisite , through the whole performance , and also , without the necessity of a minute 's bye-calculation , communicates , with the result , its verification .
25 .
Let us trace the operation of the theorem as far as may be requisite , through the ascending scale of equations .
i. In Simple equations , the reduced equation may be represented by A= az ; whence z= ^ .
Now the theorem directs us to proceed thus : aA ( r. +eX Xo are _ are -ar ' &amp; C. precisely the common arithmetical process of division , 2 .
In Quadratics , we have A az.+ z ' , and proceed in this manner : Xa A(r+ r'+ ... . .
r -Ar A SA r -A &amp; &amp; C. na ; the known arithmetical process for extracting the square root .
$ .
At Cubic equations , the aberration of the old practice of evolution commences , and our theorem places us at once on new ground .
We have here A= az + bz2+ z3 and must proceed thus : 1ba A(r+r+..a .
Or Br= B -Ar _ oo zr B+rB r3A'rC &amp;c. This ought to be the arithmetical practice of the cube root , as an example will prove .
Ex. I. Extract the cube root of 4828544 .
Having distributed the number into tridigital periods as usual , we immediately perceive that the first figure of the root is s= R. Consequently , the first subtrahend is R3=27 , the first derivee SR227 , the second $R=9 ; the third ( =i , ) need not be written .
Hence 48228544( 364 9 .

393136f In this example the reader will perceive that no supplementary operations are concealed .
The work before him is complete , and may be verified mentally .
I need not intimate how much more concise it is than even the abbreviated statement of the old process .
( See HUTTON'S Course .
) The station of i , 2 , &amp;c. numeral places respectively , which the closing addends occupy in advance of the preparatory ones , is an obvious consequence of combining the numeral relation of the successive root-figures with the potential relation of the successive derivees .
In fact , as is usual in arithmetic , we tacitly regard the last root-figure as units , and the new one as a decimal fraction ; then the common rules of decimal addition and multiplication regulate the vertical alineation of the addends .
26 .
The advantage of mental verification is common to the solution of equations of every order , provided the successive corrections of the root be simple digits : for the parenthetic derivations will , in that case , consist of multiplying a given number by a digit , and adding the successive digital products to the corresponding digits of another given number ; all which may readily be done without writing a figure intermediate to these given numbers and the combined result .
For this reason the procedure by single digits appears generally preferable .
Nevertheless , to assist the reader in forming his own option , and at the same time to institute a comparison with known methods on their own grounds , I introduce one example illustrative of the advantage which arises from the anticipatory correction of the divisors spoken of in Art .
24 , when the object is to secure a high degree of convergency by as few approximations as possible .
The example is that by which NEWTON elucidates his method .
I premise as the depreciators of NEWTON do , that it is an extremely easy problem ; and I say this to invite comparison , not so much with his mode of treating it , as with theirs .
Ex. II .
What is the value of x in the equation x3-x-5 .
The root is manifestly a very little greater than 2 .
Make it x=2+ z , and the equation becomes 1= ioz + 6Z'+ Z3 .

For this purpose , we proceed thus : 62,8 &amp;c. x 154 &amp;c. = , 968 , &amp;c. is the true correction of the last divisor .

So rapid an advance is to be expected only under very favourable data .
Yet this example clearly affixes to the new method , a character of unusual boldness and certainty ; advantages derived from the overt manner of conducting the work , which thus contains its own proof .
The abbreviations used in the close of this example , are of a description sufficiently obvious and inartificial ; but in order to perfect the algorithm of our method in its application to higher equations , and to the progress by simple digits , attene tion must be given to the following general principles of Compendious Operation .
27 .
We have seen that every new digit of the root occasions the resolvend to be extended n figures to the right , and the mth derivee n-m figures ; so that if the work be carried on as with a view to unlimited progress , every new root-figure will be obtainedand verified at an expense of , ( n. n+ 3 ) +e new lines of calculation , containing in all somewhat above ( n. n-1 .
n +4 ) digits more than the preceding root-figure cost .
But as the necessity for unlimited continuity can rarely , if ever , occur , we may consider ourselves at liberty to check the advance of the resolvend , as soon as it contains one or two figures more than the number we yet propose to annex to the root .
This will happen , generally speaking , when I th of the numeral places of the root are determined .
By arresting the advance of the resolvend , we diminish it in the first instance by an optional number ( p ) of places , and by n places more at each succeeding step .
Neglecting at the same time an equal number of figures in the right hand places of each closing addend and its derivatives , as contributing nothing to the diuminished resolvend , we thus cause the effective units ' place of each derivee to retrograde* in the first instance p +m--n places , and at every subsequent step , a number of places ( in ) equal to the index of the derivee .
In the mean time , while these amputations are diminishing the derivees and addends on the right hand , a uniform average diminution of one digit on the left hand is taking place in the successive classes of addends in each column .
The obvious consequence is , that after about th of the root* As the advance of the closing addend is prepared by annexing dots to the superior preparatory addend , so its retrogradation may be prepared by a perpendicular line beginning before the proper place ( the mh or m+p nt^ ) of the said preparatory addend , and continued indefinitely downward .
One digit , or two , of those which fall to the right of this line in the next succeeding sum and preparatory addends , must be retained , for the sake ultimately of correctly adjusting the effective units of the subtrahend .
figures are found , the mth derivee will receive no augmentation ; or , in other words , it will be exterminated when - .
th of those places are determined .
m Again , when all the derivees inferior to M , the mh , have vanished , the process reduces itself to that of the m^ order simply .
For , the amount of the preparatory addends to L , the m-ith augmented derivee , will be m-i times the previous closing addend OM ; and the preparatory addends to K , the m-2t^ , will be formed-from its previous closing addend ?
L , by adding oMr to it m-2 times successively ; a procedure obviously similar to that with which the general synopsis commences .
28 .
From these principles we form the following conclusions , demonstrative of the facilities introduced by this improvement on the original process : i. Whatever be the dimensions ( n ) of the proposed equation , whose root is to be determined to a certain number of places , only nth part of that number ( reckoning from the point at which the highest place of the closing addend begins to advance to the right of that of the first derivee ) needs to be found by means of the process peculiar to the complete order of the equation ; after which , 7 may be found by the process of the n-1th order , 1by that of the n-2-th order , &amp;c. 2 .
Several of these inferior processes will often be passed over per saltum ; and when this advantage ceases , or does not occur , the higher the order of the process , the fewer will be the places determinable by it .
And in every case , the latter half of the root will be found by division simply .
Meantime , the number of figures employed in verification of each successive root-digit , instead of increasing , is rapidly diminishing .
3 .
The process with which we commence , need not be of a higher order than is indicated by the number of places to which we would extend the root ; and may be even reduced to an order as much lower as we please , by means of an introductory approximation .
Ex. III .
Let the root of the equation in Ex. IL be determined to the tenth place of decimals .
Arranging the derivees as before , we proceed thus : 6 .

The work occupied a very few minutes , and may be verified by mere perusal , as not a figure was written besides those which appear .
By a similar operation , in less than half an hour , I have verified the root to the whole extent found in Ex. II .

As a praxis in case of the intervention of negative numbers , let it be proposed to extract , to a convenient extent , that root of the equation xI3--7x =-7 , whose first digits we have already determined to be 1.3 .

This example was selected by LAGRANGE for its difficulty .
Of its three roots , that which we have now found is the most difficult to obtain ; yet the whole work , including the preparatory portion in Art .
22 , may be performed without one subsidiary figure , in less than a quarter of an hoIr .
A little attention and practice will render the mental ag " gregation of positive and negative numbers as familiar as the addition of either sort separately .
The introduction of a small negative resolvend , instead of a large positive one , where the opportunity occurs , will then greatly abridge the operations .
For example , the cube root of a , or 1.26. .

) It appears to me , that no explanation of this solution cai be offered , which has not been abundantly anticipated in this Essay ; and the student who peruses it in connection with the General Synopsis , and Arts .
23 , 27 , will acquire an indelible impression of the whole algorithm .
Ex. VI .
If it were proposed to obtain a very accurate solution of an equation of very high dimensions , or of the irrational or transcendental kind , a plan similar to the following might be adopted .
Suppose , for example , the root of gx i oo , or x log x=2 were required correct to 60 decimal places .
By an easy experiment we find x= 3.6 nearly ; and thence , by a process of the third order , x3 $.59785 more accurately .
Now , 3597286 = 98 x 71 x 47 x 11 , whose logarithms , found to 61 decimals in SHARPE'S Tables , give R log R= 2.oooooo96658 , &amp;c. correct to 7 figures ; whence the subsequent functions need be taken out to 55 figures only .
They are a= Mod + log R =.990269449408 , &amp;c. b= Mod sR = ... ... o76o364 , &amp;c. c=bi 3R =e ... ... -.o455 , &amp;c. &amp;c. The significant part disappears after the 8th derivee ; consequently , the process will at first be of the eighth order .
If the root is now made to advance by single digits , the first of these will reduce the process to the seventh order ; one more reduces it to the sixth order ; two more , to the fifth , &amp;c. The last 27 figures will be found by division alone .
But if the first additional correction is taken to 8 figures , and the second to i6 , on the principle of Example II , we pass from the 8th order to the 4th at once , and thence to the ist or mere division , which will give the remaining 29 figures .
This mode appears in description to possess the greater simplicity , but is perhaps the more laborious .
It cannot fail to be observed , that in all these examples a great proportion of the whole labour of solution is expended on the comparatively small portion of the root , which is connected with the leading process .
The toil attending this part of the solution , in examples similar in kind to the last , is very considerable ; since every derivee is at this stage to receive its utmost digital extent .
To obviate an unjust prejudice , I must therefore invite the reader 's candid attention to the following particulars : In all other methods the difficulty increases with the extent of the root , nearly through the whole work ; in ours , it is in a great measure surmounted at the first step : in most others , there is a periodical recurrence to first conditions , under circumstances of accumulating inconvenience ; in the new method , the given conditions affect the first derivees alone , and the remaining process is arithmetically direct , and increasingly easy to the end .
The question of practical facility may be decided by a very simple criterion ; by comparing the times of calculation which I have specified , with a similar datum by Dr. HALLEY in favour of his own favourite riethod of approximation .

Addendum II .
It is with pleasure that I refer to the Imperial Encyclopaedia ( Art .
Arithmetic ) for an improved method of extracting the cube root , which should have been noticed in the proper place , had I been aware of its existence ; but it was pointed out to me , for the first time , by the discoverer , Mr. EXLEY , of Bristol , after this Essay was completed .
It agrees in substance with the method deduced in Art .
S5 , from my general principle , and affords an additional illustration of the affinity between that principle and the most improved processes of common arithmetic .
