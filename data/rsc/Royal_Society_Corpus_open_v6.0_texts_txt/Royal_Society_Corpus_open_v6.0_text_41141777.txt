extensive water course , and a low flat beach extending a quarter of a mile , and interrupting the high table land for the whole of that space .
The land on the north side of the harbour from the head of the Port to Stony Island ( which lies about of a mile to the S. E. of the observatory ) , is similar in character to that already described on the south .
From Stony Island to the north point of entrance , the coast land is not above 200 feet high , but rises to the height of 900 feet at a little distance in the interior .
The house was placed with its length at right angles to the meridian , and divided into two apartments ; one was 10 feet square ; the other was five feet wide , 10 feet long , and 10 feet high .
For conducting the various observations in the winter , the former of these was lined with a thick woollen cloth called fearnought ; the floor boarded , and a stove placed in it ; the latter , being for the use of the transit instrument , had a slit 18 inches wide cut through the walls and roof , and a large stone placed on the top of a cask filled with sand , formed the pedestal for the instrument .
Previous to the commencement of the experiments with the pendulum , it became necessary to remove the boarded floor , and block up the door opening into the room from the outside : the entrance now being through the slit into the transit room ; the door in the middle of the partition between the rooms was protected by screens of canvas and fearnought on each side .
The surface of the ground was then cleared away to as great a depth as possible , and large flat stones filled in with sand , formed the foundation for the supports of the pendulum and clock : care was also taken , that each support should stand on separate and unconnected stones % additional solidity was given to the supports , by attaching to the hindmost leg of each , a mass of lead , weighing from 40 to 50 lbs. The clock was now fixed to its support ; but the pendulum of experiment remained on board the Hecla , until all the necessary preparations were completed .
The small telescope containing the diaphragm , and used to observe the coincidences , was placed at the proper distance ( 9 % feet ) from the pendulum , on its stand outside of the room , in a porch originally erected for the use of the repeating circle : this stand was sunk so far into the ground , as to bring the object-end of the telescope , on a level with the bob of the pendulum of the clock .
An aperture of a foot square was found sufficiently large for observing the coincidences , as well as the face of the clock , when sitting at the telescope , which was sheltered by a screen of canvas from any rush of air into the room , on opening the door of the porch .
A transit instrument made by Dollond , of thirty inches focal length , and two inches aperture , was cemented to the pedestal already described , with plaister of Paris , at the latter end of October , and brought accurately into the meridian by the transits of high and low stars .
A mark was then set up at the distance of 506 feet , to which it was afterwards always adjusted before making an observation : towards the end of March , the sun 's rays caused such an apparent wavering of the meridian mark , as to render its removal necessary , and it was accordingly transferred from the exposed situation where it stood at first , to .
the opposite side of the harbour , a distance of 6697 feet , where , being fixed in a hollow part of the rock , and completely shaded from the sun , it ever afterwards afforded the means of adjusting the instrument in a satisfactory manner , being perfectly steady and distinct .
The allowance made for expansion , not being the result of experiments actually made on this particular pendulum , but from the deductions resulting from Captain Kater ' s experiments on a bar exactly similar , it became important in order to render the experiment strictly comparable with that at Greenwich , to keep the temperature of the room as near as possible to the one in which the previous experiments had been performed in England , namely , 50o .
From the smallness of the room it was soon found , that the stove placed within it , produced incessant fluctuations in the temperature ; it was therefore removed outside , to about six feet from the north wall of the house , and sunk into the ground level with the foundation of the observatory ; built round with stones , and a tent was pitched over it .
The room was now warmed by the smoke-pipe passing through it ; and , to preserve the temperature of the pendulum more uniform , a large triangular covering of fearnought lined with racoon skins , was made to enclose the whole apparatus , except that part of the front required for observation .
These arrangements effected the object so far , that the temperature of the room was seldom more than 30 , and frequently not one from 50o during the observations .
By a Sixes ' self-registering thermometer , the mean range of temperature to which the pendulum was exposed in 24 hours was only 8 ' , and the extreme not more than 12o during the series in June , whilst that of the atmosphere , varied from 23o to 47 ' of Fah .
without any uniformity .
Under these circumstances the pendulum of experiment was placed in theY'son the 29th of May , 1825 , and the adjustments finally completed on the ist of June ; the clock put in motion , and the apparatus for measuring the arc of vibration fixed in its place ; the barometer and thermometer were also suspended after the manner described in the experiments at Greenwich .
The perfect stability of the point of suspension being of the utmost consequence , spirit levels were arranged on the top of the pendulum frame and clock case , to indicate any giving way in the foundation of their respective supports from the effects of thaw , which at this time very generally prevailed ; the foundations however remained solid , and the adjustments were preserved , during the whole course of these experiments , which were not commenced to any good purpose before the 14th of June , owing to an unfavourable change in the weather .
This took place on the 7th of June , and was such , as rarely to permit a sight of the sun , and not one glimpse of the stars during the above interval from the 7th to 14th .
In ascertaining the rate of the clock , I was confined to the transits of the sun at noon ; of Arcturus and cc Lyrae when passing south of the zenith .
The sun 's transit at midnight could not be taken , in consequence of the undulations of his limb , caused by being too near the top of the high land in that direction ; neither could a Lyrae be seen soon after noon , from the general hazy state of the atmosphere at the elevation of 22 degrees .
At the time of the sun 's transit his rays were prevented from touching any part of the instrument , by a screen of canvas placed between the object-glass of the telescope and the slit in the roof of the house ; it had a small hole , through which the observation was made , but being always covered except at the moment of noon , I had reason to believe that none of the adjustments were ever disturbed .
In observing the times of transit , a steady going chronometer made by Henry Frodsham was used , and was found particularly convenient from its beating half seconds .
A comparison between the clock and chronometer , was always taken before and after the passage of either sun or star .
The time of transits shown by the face of the clock , was then deduced by direct proportion .
All the comparisons are given in a separate table .
It occasionally happened , owing to the state of the weather , that one of the stars was partially obscured at the time of its passing the meridian , so as to limit the observation to one or two wires only , whilst the transit of the other , over the whole five was obtained ; in such cases the mean of the rates for the clock has been deduced , by giving a value to each , in the ratio of the number of wires observed .
In the observation of the coincidences , the same mode was followed as in the experiments at Greenwich .
The temperature of the pendulum , however , was more frequently taken by means of a small telescope , placed outside of the room , at a window to the south , and on the same level with the thermometer , suspended a little below the middle of the pendulum for that purpose .
The weather on the whole was favourable during this series ; it became somewhat unsettled toward the close ; but as no day passed without at least one transit for the rate of the clock , I had no reason to be dissatisfied with any of the observations taken .
A second series was made in July , under more favourable circumstances of weather , the results of which , differ only one-tenth of a vibration in 24 hours from those in June .
The total number of factors for the first series being 275,5 , and for the second 66 , a mean in that ratio has finally been taken .
The experiment marked III .
was made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich in November , 1825 , after the return of the Expedition .
The number of vibrations in 24 hours , deduced from this experiment , differing more than was likely to arise from errors in observation , being 0,24 of a vibration in excess of the number obtained before leaving England in 1824 , I thought it right to repeat the experiment , especially as the rate of the clock appeared to be somewhat unsteady .
The results of this repetition , made with the rate of the clock more uniform , being precisely the same , I have not considered it necessary to give them in detail .
The difference alluded to in the number of vibrations of the pendulum in 24 hours , being on that side which would arise from the effects of wear of the knife edge of the pendulum , and which seemed probable , from the fine metallic line distinguishable on the agate planes after its removal , I feel disposed to adopt this explanation ; and assuming an equable wear , I have taken the mean of the first and last series , as the actual number of vibrations made at Greenwich , to compare with those at Port Bo wen , which being intermediate , of course required no correction on that account .
The results of this comparison are given in a subsequent page preceding the third set of experiments .
It will therefore be sufficient to state here , that the ellipticity of the earth deduced from these experiments , appears to be ^9 , ^ The experiments above described are of a nature to require , at every stage , the utmost degree of care ; since an error , very small in apparent amount , either in the observations themselves , or in the subsequent computations , may prove fatal to that minute accuracy , without a due attention to which the nice objects of this problem might easily elude our notice .
It will readily be understood , therefore , by every one conversant with such undertakings , that the observer , besides possessing adequate leisure , must be duly assisted in all parts of his progress by those persons with whom he is associated .
And as it has been my good fortune to meet not only with the heartiest encouragement , but also the most efficient cooperation from the Commander of the Expedition , throughout the whole course of these and various other delicate researches , I feel it my duty not less on public grounds , than as a matter of private respect and gratitude , to make this acknowledgment of the source , to which every thing that may appear valuable in these enquiries is justly to be traced .

By Lieutenant Henry Foster , R. JV .
F. R. S. Read April 6 , 1826 .
The determination of the length of the seconds ' pendulum in different latitudes , is a subject , that has long been considered of much interest and importance , but more especially of late years , since the practical problem has received from the ingenuity of Captain Henry Kater , certain improvements and simplifications , which have rendered its results more accurate than had ever before been obtained .
With the nature of these improvements I had already become acquainted when in H. M. S. Conway , with Captain Basil Hall , on the South American station , where , as will be seen in the Philosophical Transactions for 1823 , several series of experiments were made by that officer and myself .
Soon after my appointment to the N. W. Expedition under the command of Captain W. E. Parry , the Board of 'Longitude , at the suggestion of Captain Kater , did me the honour Table I. ( First Series .

to entrust me with an invariable pendulum ; and , the details of the observations made with this instrument , together with a statement of all the attendant circumstances , are given m the following pages .
The first set of experiments , which are marked ( No. I. ) , were made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich , in an apartment to the S. W. of the Transit Room , originally intended , I believe , for the observations of the eclipses of Jupiter 's satellites , but upon this occasion kindly appropriated by Mr. Pond to my use .
This room has a solid stone floor , on which the triangular supports for the pendulum and dock were placed .
The roof is low , and being composed of wooden panels , the temperature of the room was materially affected by the state of the weather ; on* one occasion the thermometer ranged four degrees during the observations , although the light was admitted by a window on the north side .
In the adjustments of the instruments employed in the ; experiments , I strictly adhered to the mode described by Captain Kater , in his paper read before the Royal Society in June , 1819 .
The intervals between the coincidences were determined by the disappearance of the white disk on the pendulum of the clock behind the tail-piece of the pendulum , and also by the mean of its disappearance and re-appearance^ I was induced to take this additional trouble , m order to remove all possible objections which might be raise\#271 ; as to the accuracy of the result ; and partly that I might , by actual trials , furnish materials for putting at rest the controversy on this subject .
The method of disappearances has been followed by Captain Kater , and more lately by Captain Basil .
mean number of vibrations in 24 hours is 86223,659 by the observation of disappearance , and 86223,800 by the mean of disappearance and re-appearance .
The mean height of the barometer was 29,844 inches , and the mean temp , 50o .
15 ; whence it appears that the specific gravity of the pendulum was to that of air , as 7000,6 to 1 , which gives 6v.i58 as a correction additive for the buoyancy of the atmosphere .
The ball of the pendulum was found by levelling to be 121,04 feet above low water ( neap tides ) , the correction for which by the duplicate ratio of distances from the earth 's centre ( 3950,858 miles ) is , oT.5oo in 24 hours .
And as the station was the tabular surface of a bed of secondary limestone , I suppose the proper multiplier is -\#163 ; \#163 ; S , which will give o'33o for the correction to be added due to this elevation .
These corrections being applied to the number of vibrations before found , will give the number of vibrations that would have been made by the pendulum in a mean solar day , in vacuo at the level of the sea , the temperature being 5OP of Fahrenheit at Port Bowen , in latitude* 73o 13 ' 39".4 N , longitude 88 ' 54 ' 48 " W , and are as follows : By the observation of disappearance 86230,147 By the mean of disappearance and re-appear .
86230,288 The state of the ice in the offing being such , as to indicate no immediate prospect of the ships leaving Port Bowen , I gladly availed myself of Captain Parry 's permission to pursue these observations by another series ; the difference between the results of which , and those of the first series , being only 0.105 of a vibration in 24 hours , affords , it is presumed , .
The elements of the observations for the latitude , and longitude , are given in the Appendix to the Narrative of Captain Parry 's Third Voyage for the Discovery of a NorthWest Passage .
Hall and General Sir Thomas Brisbane ; that of taking a mean between the disappearance and re-appearance of the disk , has been practised by Mr. Goldingham at Madras , and by Captain Sabine .
Theoretically , the mean of the disappearance and re-appearance , would give the true moment at which the two pendulums coincided at the lowest part of the arc of vibration , were it the object of this problem to determine that moment : but it is not:the experiment being strictly comparative ; and the method of disappearances accomplishes all that is sought after , with perfect certainty , and with less than half the trouble .
It may , however , be useful to know , that both methods give identically the same results ; that is to say , the number of vibrations of a pendulum determined by the method of disappearance at one station , compared with the number deduced by the same method at another , give precisely the same acceleration or retardation as that which would result from comparing the number of vibrations at the first station , ascertained by taking the mean of disappearance and re-appearance , with those of the second station , ascertained by the same method .
The results of the experiment contained in the following paper show this very obviously , as follows : Vibrations by the method of disapVibrations by the method of mean of pearance alone at disappearance and re-appearance at Greenwich , ... ... 86159,368 Greenwich , 86159,500 Port Bowen , ... .

86223,812 86223,964^^26 In this series , the number of vibrations made by the pendulum in 24 hours of mean solar time , as obtained from the observations of the disappearance of the white disk , and employing the rates furnished by the transits of stars , is 86223,803 , and by the rates , from the sun 's transits 86223,812 .
By the mean of the observations of the disappearance and re-appearance of the disk , the number of vibrations is 86223,938 by the rates , from the stars ' transits , and 86223,964 by the transits of the sun .
But the sum of the factors for the stars being 40 , and for the sun 26 , the mean number of vibrations in 24 hours , by the observation of the disappearance of the white disk is 86223,806 , and by the mean of its disappearance and reappearance 86223,948 .
If to each of these , we apply the corrections , oy,33o for elevation , and 6v , n6 for the buoyancy of the atmosphere , at the mean pressure 29,781 inches , and temperature 5i',25 of Fahrenheit , we shall arrive at the total number of vibrations which would have been made by the pendulum in a mean solar day , the temperature being 50o of Fahrenheit , in vacuo , at the level of the sea at Port Bowen ; and are By the observation of disappearance 86230,252 By the mean of disappearance and re-appearance 86230,394 By the first series , the total number of vibrations of the pendulum in 24 hours was By the observation of disappearance 86230,147 By the mean of disappearance and re-appearance 86230,288 The sums of the factors , however , being 275,5 in this series , and only 66 in the second , we obtain for the final number of vibrations at Port Bowen , By the method of disappearance 86230,172 By the mean of disappearance and re-app .
86230,313 .
From the above data and number of vibrations made by the same pendulum from the mean of both series at Greenwich , viz* by the method of disappearance 86159,368 and by mean of disappearance and re-app .
86159,500 , together with the assumed length , of the seconds ' pendulum at Greenwich 39,13911 inches ; the length of the seconds ' pendulum at Port Bowen is found to be nearly 39,203464 inches , by the method of disappearance , and by the mean of disappearance and re-appearance 39,203472 inches ; and comparing these with 39,1 39 11 inches , the assumed length in lat. 51o 28 ' 39 " N. as before stated , the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator will be by the method of disappearance,0054152 , the ellipticity of the earth\#191 ; 35 , and the length of the equatorial pendulum 39,009805 inches ; and by the mean of disappearance and re-appearance , the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator will be,0054159 , the ellipticity of the earth 55535- , and the length of the equatorial pendulum 39,009789 inches of Sir George Schuckburgh 's scale .
The length of the pendulum vibrating seconds , not having been determined at Greenwich , but at Mr. Browne 's house in London , it must be remembered that the above lengths are not the true lengths of the pendulum , but are merely given for the sake of comparison .
The difference of the results amounts only to 9 ten-thousandths of a vibration in 24 hours .
This , it may be observed , is the end and object of the problem ; which , as I have before stated , is strictly a comparative one ; and the only thing to be insisted upon is , that the same method should be followed , and the same adjustments of the apparatus strictly adhered to , at all the stations which are to be compared together .
Supposing , however , that the vibrations recorded in the present experiments , ascertained by the one method , were compared with those determined by the other , the results would differ only 0,14 of a vibration in 24 hours ; a quantity which does not occasion a difference of two ten-thousandths of an inch in the length of the deduced seconds ' pendulum , nor of an unit in the denominator of the fraction expressing the ellipticity .
There are cases , of course , dependant on the relative diameter of the white disk , to that of the tail-piece of the pendulum , in which a greater or less difference than the above would exist between the two methods so compared ; but this is of no importance whatever , as the object of the problem is fully accomplished by adhering to the same method , whichever it be , at both stations , as before stated .
It may not be useless to mention also , that Captain Kater did not adopt the method of disappearances in his comparative experiments , until after innumerable trials of other plans , including that of taking the mean of disappearance and re-appearance of the white disk ; all of which he eventually abandoned for that of disappearances alone ; and it is certainly to be regretted , that he did not publish an account of these unsucBy this experiment , it appears that the final number of vibrations which would have been made by the pendulum at Greenwich in 24 mean solar hours at the level of the sea , in vacuo , and at the temperature of 50o of Fahrenheit , by the method of disapp .
of the white disk is 86159,487 and by the mean of its disapp .
and re-app .
86159,621 But from the final results deduced from the experiment made at Greenwich in April 1824 , previous to leaving England , the total number of vibrations which would have been made by the same pendulum under the above circumstances , by the method of disappearance , was 86159,250 and by the mean of disapp .
and re-app .
86159,380 Having already stated , what I have considered to be the cause of the difference in the number of vibrations of the pendulum in these experiments ; the following arithmetical means of the results of the series in April 1824 , and November 1825 , are to be considered as the proper number of vibrations of the pendulum , at Greenwich , to be compared with those obtained at Port Bo wen , and are by the method of disappearance of the white disk 86159,368\#163 ; nd by the mean of its disapp .

cessful trials , as it might have saved myself and others , much unnecessary labour .
The clock used in these experiments was fitted with a gridiron pendulum , vibrating on knife edges in portions of hollow cylinders of agate , and belonged to the Royal Society .
It was put in motion at Greenwich on the 17th of April , 1 824 , three days previous to the commencement of the experiment , and its rate ascertained by comparisons with the transit clock of the observatory each day at noon , and also during the series , at the commencement and at the conclusion .
In these essential observations , I was kindly assisted by Mr. T. Taylor , jun .
of the Royal Observatory .
In making the observation of the coincidences , the following mode was pursued .
The pendulum being placed in the Y 's , was gently lowered until the knife edges rested on the agate planes ; and the sides of the diaphragm placed in the focus of the eye-piece of the small telescope , were made just to coincide with , or embrace those of the tail-piece of the pendulum ; and this adjustment was examined previous to every observation .
The heights of the barometer , and of the thermometer suspended with its bulb about f of the length of the pendulum below its point of suspension , and about ^ of an inch in front of the middle of the bar , were taken and registered at the beginning and end of each set of observations .
The pendulum was set in motion , by drawing it gently on one side with a piece of twine fastened to one of the legs of its support , until the point at the end of the tail-piece , was about i',2 upon the arc ; and a little before the pendulum of the clock attained its highest ascent on that side , the twine was let go , and the pendulum allowed to vibrate freely .
The number of vibrations made by the pendulum in 24 hours reduced to the level of the sea , in vacuo and at a determinate temperature , were computed by the methods detailed in Captain Kater ' s paper before referred to .
The second experiment marked ( No. II .
) was made at Port Bowen , on the eastern side of Prince Regent 's Inlet , where the ships passed the winter of 1824-25 .
The observatory house , prepared in frame at Deptford , having double walls and roofs , three inches apart , was erected early in October on the north side of the harbour , upwards of a hundred feet above the level of the sea , on a bed of secondary limestone , of which this place is composed ; the upper stratum consisted of small loose stones , that could only be removed to the depth of a few inches , below which , it was frozen so hard , that little impression could be made by the action of crows and pickaxes .
The high table land , which characterises this coast , rises directly from the sea , on the south side of the harbour , to the height of between six and seven hundred feet ; the upper part , presents a perpendicular cliff of one or two hundred feet , exhibiting alternate black and white horizontal stratifications of secondary limestone ; it is also deeply excavated in a variety of places by the action of the weather on its less durable parts , thus giving to its outline the appearance of ruined towers and other ancient edifices .
The debris , which has fallen from the upper part of the rock , has formed a steep shelving bank or " talus " along its base , except at those places where its outline is intersected by ravines , and here , projecting points are formed of the materials brought down by the melting of the winter 's snow .
To the eastward , at the head of Port Bowen , there is an
