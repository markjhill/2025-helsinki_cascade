] Influence of Oxygen on the Respiratory Exchange .
455 there suddenly swept down the arteries gas bubbles , which drove the blood corpuscles before them and filled the capillaries .
On recompressing the frog to 70 atmospheres the gas within the vessels passed again into solution and the corpuscles appeared in the capillaries . .
' ' We have made similar observations on a bat ( obtained for us by the kindness of Mr. F. Jones ) .
' .
We observed the circulation in the wing .
The bat was hibernating .
The circulation was therefore slow , and the heart-beat infrequent .
On raising the pressure to 10 atmospheres the pulse became more frequent and the capillary circulation accelerated .
At 20 atmospheres of oxygen the circulation continued unimpaired .
On decompression after 10 minutes the circulation became impaired , but no gas bubbles appeared in the capillaries .
The animal had not , owing to the slow circulation , been under -pressure for a sufficient length of time to become saturated with gas .
n One of us ( L. Hill ) lias frequently noticed gas embolism to follow decompression of mice and birds .
The gas embolism is the cause of the convulsions which follow decompression .
Conclusion.\#151 ; A rapid increase of pressure to 70 atmospheres has no mechanical effect on the circulation of the blood .

Regnault and Reiset* found that the uptake of oxygen was the same in 46 per cent , and in 77 per cent oxygen as in atmospheric air .
Paul Bertf on the other hand found that the processes of oxidation were most intense in 60 per cent , oxygen , while they became lessened in a pure atmosphere of oxygen .

[ May 22 , Moderate increase of the atmospheric pressure has , according to Panum and Gr .
von Liebig , * no distinct influence on the oxygen intake or carbonic acid output of man .
Lorrain Smith also found that the oxygen tension in blood was lowered by respiration in a pure atmosphere of oxygen .
The tension was estimated by the CO method . !
It will be seen from these researches that nothing conclusive can be asserted as to the influence of oxygen on the gaseous metabolism .
In the following investigation , the question is studied by an entirely different method from that of previous workers , and it will be seen that we obtain very constant results .
Method e. The estimations were carried out on mice .
These were placed in a small glass vessel , fitted with a ground glass stopper , through which passes an inlet and outlet tube .
Connected with the outlet tube is a " T ''-piece , through which a thermometer is passed so as to lie in the outgoing current of air .
By this the temperature of the chamber was ascertained .
The egress tubes were connected with Haldane and Pembrey 's soda lime and sulphuric acid absorption tubes , !
and the ingress tubes with a series of Woulfe 's bottles containing soda lime and sulphuric acid , so as to remove all the carbonic acid and water from the atmosphere before entering the chamber .
A gas meter was attached to the egress tube beyond the absorption tubes .
To study the effect of air an aspirating bottle was attached beyond the meter , and to study the effect of oxygen a cylinder of that gas was attached to the ingress tube .
S The O intake was determined by the difference between the loss of weight of the mouse , and the gain in weight of the CO2 and H20 absorption tubes .

] Influence of Oxygen on the Respiratory Exchange .
461 Consideration of Results .
It will be noticed that the most constant results are those of the carbonic acid .
If the amount of this expired per minute and per kilo , body weight for the different periods be examined , it will be seen that there is a very distinct diminution in the amount during respiration in a pare atmosphere of oxygen .
This diminution does not occur immediately , but is generally quite distinct in about 30 minutes .
In taking an average of the amount of this gas for any period , therefore , we have included the first period of the respiration in air which followed it .
The average of carbonic acid per minute and per kilo , body weight for a period ( varying from 1 to 3 hours ) in , is as follows : No. of experiment .

0 ^ j It will further be noticed that the mouse in Experiment 2 had a higher average than that in No. 1 , the difference in this case being due to the fact that the animal weighed less.t The average for a period in oxygen is as follows No. of experiment .

As it might well be argued that the diminution was not due to the effect of the oxygen , but to the fact that the animal was receiving no food , and was kept in a coniine space , we must consider the effect of an atmosphere of air following that of oxygen .
In the case of Experiments 1 and 2 a very distinct increase ( viz. , 20 per cent , in No. 1 and 12 per cent , in No. 2 ) occurred when the atmosphere was again changed to air .
This increase is no marked till about 2 hours after the commencement of the period.^ in Experiment 3 , the increase on changing from oxygen to air is a bou * Weighed at beginning of experiment .

[ May 28 , 8 per cent. , the smaller figure in this case being accounted for probably by the more sluggish metabolism in this animal .
These results regarding the carbonic acid excretion are confirmed by those of water excreted and oxygen absorbed .
For these two bodies the figures are by no means so constant as for the carbonic acid , the reason for this being no doubt that the technique for the estimation of them is much more complicated , and the chance of experimental error so much greater .
The results have been further confirmed by observing the rectal temperature during the various periods .
It will be noticed that even in an atmosphere of air a distinct fall is recorded after the animal has been in the chamber for about an hour .
This fall is , however , more marked when the animal is placed in oxygen , and it again rises somewhat when the oxygen is replaced by air .
Besides the experiments here recorded , we have performed a considerable number in which the carbonic acid and water excretions alone were recorded , and in every case we have obtained the above result .
Two of the most typical of these tables are given here as examples ( see Experiments 4 and 5 ) .

" Effects of Strain on the Crystalline Structure of Lead .
" By J. C. W. Humfrey , B.Sc. ( Viet .

Communicated by Professor Ewing , F.B.S. Be-ceived May 28 , \#151 ; Bead June 5 , 1902 .
( Abstract .
) The paper describes experiments carried out in the Engineering Laboratory at Cambridge , under Professor Ewing .
The material used was a pure variety of lead which crystallised on a particularly large scale .
Test pieces were obtained from it in which the part under observation ( which extended right across the centre of the specimen as well as through from front to back ) was a single crystal uniformly oriented throughout , and the paper deals with the behaviour of such uniformly oriented parts under the influence of strain .
It was found that by suitable etching a very beautiful system of geometrical pits ( which took the form of negative cubo-octahedra ) could be produced on the surface of the specimen , and by means of these any change of orientation could be readily observed .
In the first experiments described the specimens were strained in
