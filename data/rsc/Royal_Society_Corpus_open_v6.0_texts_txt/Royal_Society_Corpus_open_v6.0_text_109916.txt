] The telescope erected for this investigation resembles in its construction that which was formerly used for the observations of a Cygni .
It has an achromatic object-glass of 10 feet focal length , and 4 inches diameter .
The Astronomer Royal had first selected 3 Canis Minoris as a proper star to be compared with a Aquile ; but finding , upon trial , that it could rarely be seen in the day-time , he was induced to substitute X Pegasi .
Not being quite satisfied of the stability of the instrument , the author has only computed those observations in which each star was observed in the same day , and in the short interval of three hours ; so that it was not likely any sensible change in the telescope should have taken place .
The result of fifty-four observations between the 25th of July and the 29th of December 1817 , afforded no appearance of parallax ; indeed the author considering it as a hopeless task to establish its existence by observations on a star so far from the zenith , was about to abandon the subject , when his at* terntior was again called to it by Dr. Brinkley 's late communication .
By reference to an annexed table , it appears that the greatest error in a series of ten observations , made with the transit , could not have been more than 0 " 03 , and consequently it is not probable that the error in fifty observations should have exceeded half that quantity .
Taking , however , every circumstance into consideration , it is possible that the whole parallax of a Aquilwe may have amounted to half a second , which is about a tenth part of that assigned to this star by Dr. Brinkley .
The author , however , proposes to continue the investigation ; and when his observations shall have been sufficiently multiplied , promises to communicate the result to the Society .
