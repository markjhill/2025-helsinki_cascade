I. " Researches into the Chemical Constitution of Narcotine , and of its Products of Decomposition."-Part I. By A. MATTHIESSEN , F.R.S. , and GEORGE CAREY FOSTER , B.A. Received February 26 , 1863 .
( Abstract .
) An abstract of a considerable portioni of this paper has already appeared in the form of a preliminary notice* of the first results obtained .
The most important additional facts now communicated are the following : The anialysis of five additional specimens of narcotine has confirmed the accuracy of the formula 22 H23 NO7 , which the authors adopted for this base in their previous notice .

They now find that hydrochloric acid acts similarly on these bodies , evolving with each of them chloride of methyl .
They suggest the name hypoyallic acid for the acid 0 11 O , formed by the action of hydriodic acid on hemipinic acid* , in order to recall the fact of its containing one atom of oxygen less than gallic acid , C ' H16 O5 .
They obtained the same product by the prolonged action of hydrochloric acid on hemipinic acid ; but by a shorter action an intermediate product was obtained , which , according to a single analysis , appears to contain H8 H8 0 Calculated .

10000 This substance is an acid of much greater stability than bypogallic acid ; it crystallizes in long , thin , transparent prisms , which are anhydrous , and are almost insoluble in cold water , slightly soluble in boiling water , but dissolve more readily in alcohol and ether .

C. this acid sublimes unchanged , and it may be heated to 245 ' without melting or becoming coloured ; it dissolves in strong sulphuric acid , and is precipitated urnaltered on addition of water .
It gives no coloration with sesquichloride of iron ; with nitrate of silver it gives a white precipitate which slowly blackens on boiling .
Its formation from hemipinic acid may be expressed by the equation C"O110 0I1 C+=E0O2++C GE13 Cl+C8 118 0 ' .
Hemipinic acid .
This substance has the composition of methyl-hypogallic acid ; but its great stability , as compared with hypogallic acid , makes it appear improbable that such is its true constitution .
Nascent hydrogeni evolved from sodium-amalgam and water , or from zinc and dilute sulphuric acid , converts opianic acid into rneconin , C"O 1-0 " ( } ' + 1_12 C"10 11 " '+ 112 0 Opianic acid .

100 00 This body crystallizes in small silky nieedles of a pale yellow colour ; it is partially decomposed , losing hydrochloric acid , when dissolved in pure water , but dissolves unchanged in water containing a trace of free hydrochloric acid .
Alkalies , or alkaline carbonates or sul .
phites , throw down from the aqueous or acid solution an oran , gecoloured granular precipitate ( cotarnamic acid ?
) free from hydrochloric acid ; this precipitate dissolves in excess of alkali , giving a solution which quickly becomes dark brown by exposure to air ; with hydrochloric acid , it regenerates the originial crystalline compound ; it dissolves slightly in water , with a bright oraiige colour that is visible even in very dilute solutions .
The slightly acidulated solution of the hydrochlorate is pale yellow when pure , but acquires a deep .
green colour in the air .
A few drops of uitric acid added to a hot solution cause it to appear of an opake crimson colour by reflected light , though the liquLid is still transpareint when examined by transmitted light .
Nitrate of silver added in quantity more than sufficient to precipitate the chlorine is quickly reduced .
The compound acquires a fine crimson colour when evaporated nearly to dryness on the water-bath , with a slight excess of dilute sulphuric acid .
Hydriodic and diluted sulphuric acids decompose cotarnine at a high temperature in the same way as hydrochloric acid .
The products so formed have not been isolated , but were converted into hydrochlorate of cotarnamic acid .
The authors conclucde by offering some suggestions towards the interpretation of the results they have obtained .
Only the most important points discussed by them will be briefly indicated here .
They suppose that when opianic acid is converted into meconin by the action of nascent hydrogen , or into meconin and hemipinic acid by the action of potash * , a substance containing C " II " 0 ' may possibly be the immediate product of the reaction , and that this body-bearing the same relation to mieconin that glycol , C ' IF ' 02 , does to oxide of ethylene , C E4 0 , or maninite , C. 1I O ' , to mannitan , C'1 -may give rise to meconin by subsequent loss of the elements of water .
Making this supposition , the two reactions in question may be represented by the equations ( 1),. .

and may be regarded as supporting the views of Berthelot , who has suggested that opianic acid ought to be classed as an aldehyde rather than as a true acid .
With regard to the constitution of hemipinic acid , the authors suppose that it may be a dimethylized derivative of a bibasic but tetratomic acid , c8 IF 06 ( analogous to tartaric acid , Co 116 06 ) , the two atoms of methyl occupying the places of the two atoms of hydrogen , which , though outside the radical , are incapable of being replaced by metals : hemipinic acid would thus be comparable to Wurtz 's ethyllactic acid , the body at one time described by Butlerow as valerolactic acid .
An analogy is further pointed out between the derivatives of malic acid and the substances obtained from cotarnine .
