Preliminary Account of the Observations made at the Royal Alfred Observatory , Pamplemousses , Mauritius .
" By E. Walter Maunder , F.B.A.S. Received October 24 , \#151 ; Read at Joint Meeting of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies , October 31 , 1901 .
General Arrangements .
An expedition from the Royal Observatory to observe the Solar Eclipse of 1901 in the island of Mauritius having been sanctioned by the Admiralty , I was instructed by the Astronomer Royal to proceed to that island , there to act in concert with the Director of the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mr. T. F. Claxton , who had expressed his desire to co-operate in the observation of the eclipse .
In accordance with a scheme approved by the Joint Permanent Eclipse Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies , I took out with me two instruments belonging to the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , for photographing the corona ; the one giving an image of the Moon 2-4 inches in diameter , and intended to secure the general structure of the corona , and the other giving an image 0'3 inch m diameter , and intended to secure the outer coronal streamers .
The Join Permanent Eclipse Committee lent for use in combination with these instruments two coelostats , the one carrying a mirror of 16 inches diameter , the other one of 12 inches .
A third mirror , one of 12 me es diameter , was kindly lent by Mr. Frank McClean , F.R.S. My equipment was completed by the generosity of Mr. John Evershed , 1 .R . .
who very kindly placed his prismatic camera of 2 inches aperture at the disposal of the Astronomer Royal for my use in the eclipse .
I was warmly welcomed in Mauritius by the Director of the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mr. T. F. Claxton , and by his Chief Assistant , Mr. A. Walter .
Both identified themselves completely with me in my work , and helped me in every possible way .
We therefore combined the instruments which I had brought out with those of the Observatory , and worked with them as though we formed but one party , and as if the instruments were all part of the same e^ulP"enj : I was also greatly indebted to Sir Charles Bruce , G.C.M.G. , t e Governor of the island , and to Sir Graham Bower , K.C.M.G. , the officer administrating the Government during the Governor s absence , for the ready hospitality which they extended to me .
Through their action , also , my instruments were landed without Customs exammaMr .

tion and were conveyed by rail , free of cost , up to Pamplemousses , and back again after the eclipse was over .
Free passes on all the railways of the island were also issued to me , and to Mrs. Maunder , who had accompanied me with a special instrumental equipment of her own .
The military authorities also rendered great assistance .
Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Lyster , R.G.A. , gave permission to nine non-commissioned officers of the garrison , who had volunteered for the purpose , to come down to assist in the eclipse observations .
Of these , five also helped in the unpacking and erection of the instruments , and one , Staff-Sergeant R. M. Smith , A.O.C. , gave great assistance in the cleaning , repair , and rating of the several driving-clocks .
The expedition was also indebted to the Hon. Hamilton Stein , who undertook the re-shipping of the instruments for the homeward voyage ; to Mr. G. Ireland , who supplied tarpaulins for covering the skeleton huts erected to shelter the instruments ; to Captain A. W. de Wilton , Inspector-General of Police , who sent constables to keep the Observatory grounds from intrusion on the morning of the eclipse , and to Mr. D. P. Garrioch , Superintendent of Inland Revenue , who arranged for the greater part of the provisioning of the eclipse party during their stay at the Observatory .
Itinerary.\#151 ; The instruments for the Mauritius expedition were despatched from the Royal Observatory on March 6 , with the exception of the prisms and object-glass of the prismatic camera lent by Mr. .
John Evershed , F.R.A.S. , which I took to Marseilles with ifay personal t\gt ; aggage .
The instruments were embarked at the Royal Albert Docks on the ss .
" Bagdad " of the Messageries Maritimes line , and tran-I shipped from that vessel to the ss .
" Melbourne " of the same line at f Marseilles .
I left London on March 23 , and proceeded overland through France to Marseilles .
Owing to the great dock strike then prevailing at Marseilles , the ss .
" Melbourne " was not able to leave until the evening of March 26 .
The delay was , however , made up for by greater speed on the voyage , and Mauritius was reached on ; April 20 , as had been originally expected .
The return voyage was unexpectedly delayed , as the Messageries line quarantined the island jj on account of the plague there , and the Union-Castle steamers having jjj ceased to run to Mauritius , in consequence of the South African war , I the British India line viA Colombo was the sole remaining homeward I route , and even on this line the steamers only ran once a month .
It was j not possible , therefore , to leave Mauritius again until July 12 , when I I embarked on the ss .
" Warora " ; reaching Colombo on July 22 .
1 Here I had to wait until July 25 , when I left by the ss .
" Mombassa , " 1 also of the British India line , and reached London August 25 .
The i instruments left Mauritius in the ss .
" Slingsby " on July 12 , and were 1 received at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , on September 10 .
Station.\#151 ; The station occupied was the Royal Alfred Observatory , 1 Total Eclipse of the Sun , 1901 , May 18 .
249 Pamplemousses , in the low-lying plain which occupies the north of the island of Mauritius .
This was about 15 miles to the N.W. of the central line , but as the eclipse was one of long duration , the distance from the central line made but little difference to the length of totality , and several important considerations led to its adoption .
First of all , the probabilities of fine weather at the time of the morning when the eclipse would take place , appeared much greater for the low ground in the north of the island , than for the hills in the centre ; an anticipation which the event fully justified ; for whilst the total phase of the eclipse was observed under favourable conditions at Pamplemousses , it was entirely lost in cloud at Curepipe , on the central line on the high ground in the interior .
Next , there were the great advantages offered by the Observatory itself of accurate determination of time , of a site the co-ordinates of which were known , of two instruments on permanent mountings , an equatorial and a photoheliograph , suitable for use in the eclipse , and of two efficient and well constructed darkrooms for photography .
The observing station was therefore fixed in the Observatory grounds , in Lat. 20 ' 5 ' 39 " S. and Long. 3h 50m 12s 6 E. according to the " Nautical Almanac , " on the authority of the late Dr. G. Meldrum , the former Director .
Erection and Arrangement of the Instruments .
The instruments were landed from the " Melbourne " at Port Louis , on April 23 , and were conveyed by rail to Pamplemousses , and from thence by road to the Observatory , the same day .
The next day they were unpacked , and the positions which they were to occupy were chosen .
The main building of the Observatory is rectangular in form , and nearly but not exactly orientated .
Its front or north side is 76| feet in length , and its breadth is 58| feet .
Opposite the north front and distant from it 160 feet , is the Magnetic Basement , a structure of which only the roof is above the ground , and which is 43 feet square .
A broad lawn extends between the two buildings , and the instruments were erected for the most part at the west end of the lawn , so as to command as much of the eastern sky as possible .
It was , however , found necessary to cut down a clump of trees on the eastern side of the lawn to a height of 16 feet in order to secure an uninterrupted view of first contact , which would take place when the sun was only 5 ' high , and this Mr. Claxton accordingly had done .
The instruments were mounted in two divisions .
The first division consisted of the Mauritius photoheliograph , which was dismounted from its equatorial stand in a detached dome in the Observatory grounds , and of a rapid rectilinear lens by Dallmeyer , of 4 inches Mr. E. W. Maunder .
aperture and 32 inches focal length .
These two instruments were placed horizontally , the camera of the R.R. lens being placed immediately above the photoheliograph tube , and both were supplied with light by means of a 16-inch mirror mounted on a coelostat .
The second division consisted of the Greenwich coronagraph , and Mr. Ever-shed 's prismatic camera .
The coronagraph was mounted in a horizontal position , and the prismatic camera was fixed immediately above it , both instruments being supplied with light by a 12-inch mirror mounted on a coelostat .
Between the two a clock was mounted which rang an electric bell close to the camera end of the photoheliograph , and another close to the 12-inch coelostat , at every tenth second during totality .
The instruments were fixed upon boxes filled with stones , and to shelter them skeleton huts were formed , each consisting of three pairs of poles carrying a ridge-pole .
Tarpaulins were then thrown over the ridge-pole , and pegged down to the ground .
When any instrument needed to be used , one or more of the tarpaulins could be thrown up on the side upon which it was desired to observe .
During the eclipse all the tarpaulins were entirely removed , except one fixed round the 10-second clock , which was left in order to shelter the pendulum from the wind .
The positions of the instruments relative to the Observatory buildings are shown in the accompanying plan , in which are also indicated the positions of Mrs. Maunder 's instruments , which were also set up in the Observatory grounds .
The above arrangement of the instruments was finally completed by May 11 when the prismatic camera was mounted , one week before the eclipse .

N. V. Olivier\#151 ; Recorder to Mr. Piggott .
The following was the method of procedure , which was carefully rehearsed many times on May 16 and 17 .
The observers took their places at their instruments , and Mr. Claxton watched the diminishing arc of the Sun on the ground glass of the photoheliograph , and at 30 seconds before second contact gave the word to " Stand by .
" At 20 seconds I gave the word to Sergeant-Major Wade , to begin the exposure of the plates in the prismatic camera .
At 10 seconds , when the .
arc of sunlight had lessened down to one of 49 ' , Mr. Claxton called " Ten , " the signal to Staff-Sergeant Smith to start the 10-seconds striking eclipse clock , and Staff-Sergeant Smith called the number of the bells as they rang out at every tenth second from this moment until some time after third contact .
The exposures at the different cameras were then made at the sound of the bells , and Lieutenant F. W. Robertson , R.E. , entered the time of each bell as it rang ; a very simple arrangement , which worked smoothly and well , and gave the times of exposure of the different plates very closely .
The Day of the Eclipse.\#151 ; The weather at eclipse time\#151 ; from 6h 51m to 9h 5m a.m.\#151 ; had been by no means promising for the first three weeks after landing , but had tended to improve later .
The morning of May 18 was the first upon which the Sun had been entirely free from cloud at the time of totality , 7h 53m A.M. , and even on that morning first contact was lost by the interposition of a dense bank of cloud , which came up from the east soon after sunrise and overtook the Sun .
It passed away in a few minutes , and the first photograph of the partial phase was taken at 16 minutes after the predicted time for first contact .
Light scud continued to pass over the Sun for about 40 minutes more , but got thinner and lighter as totality drew on , and about or 3 minutes before second contact the entire eastern half of the sky was free from cloud , and remained so until after fourth contact .
But though the sky was thus apparently clear J there was evidently much moisture in the air , since at Quatre Bornes , | 13 miles to the south-west , the total phase was observed in a smart | drizzle of fine rain ; and at Curepipe , 16 miles to the south , it was entirely lost by thick cloud .
The images also , as seen upon the 1 ground glasses of the photoheliograph and coronagraph , were very 1 unsteady , the Sun 's limb " boiling " excessively .
This " boiling " I effect would seem to have been less noticeable in the 6-inch equatorial I mounted in a dome on the roof of the Observatory main building , and 1 in the Newbegin telescope brought by Mrs. Maunder and mounted in fl the photoheliograph dome of the Observatory , and which , were there-1 fore at a considerable elevation , than in the instruments fed by the two I Total Eclipse of the S 1901 , May 18 .
258 ccelostats which were necessarily quite close to the ground .
The position of the latter , in the open air and placed horizontally , would render them more exposed to the effect of ground currents than the two other telescopes would be , pointing upwards at an angle of 19 ' and within domes .
The darkness during totality to the observers out in the open air was not great , the general illumination being considerably greater than at the full Moon .
Five observers , noting the twilight illumination in the evening after the eclipse , considered it equal to that of midtotality at the following local times:\#151 ; h. m. Mrs. Claxton ... .
\#151 ; ... ... . .
5 58 p.m. Mrs. Maunder ... ... ... ... .
5 57 Mr. Claxton ... .\#151 ; ... ... ... ... 5 58 Mr. Hall ... ... ... ... .
5 58 Mr. Maunder ... ... ... ... .\#151 ; 5 57 corresponding in the mean to 31 minutes after geometrical sunset , or to a position of the Sun , neglecting refraction , of 6 ' 53 ' below the horizon .
| But the observers in the equatorial and photoheliograph domes found it very dark during totality .
A sudden gust of wind came from the N.E. at the moment of second contact and blew out the observer 's candle in the equatorial dome .
The recorder here , Mr. Olivier , found it quite impossible to read his chronometer or to write in the darkness , and hence Mr. Piggott 's determination of the times of the second and third contacts were wholly lost .
b Yenns and Mercury were both very brilliant , side by side , some 5 below the Sun , whilst Jupiter and Saturn were prominent in the western sky .
No search was made for other celestial objects .

Photographs of the Corona.\#151 ; These were taken on three different scales ; the first on a scale of 8 inches to the Moon 's diameter , to show the prominences and lowest corona ; the second on a scale of 2'4 inches , to show the general structure of the corona ; the third on a scale of O'3 inch , to show the coronal streamers to the greatest possible extension .
The aperture employed in each case was the same , viz. , 4 inches , and the light-gathering powers on the plate of the three instruments Were nearly in the proportion of 1 , 11 , and 700 .
Total Eclipse of the Sun , 1901 , May 18 .
( 1 .
) Photographs on the 8-inch Scale .
These were taken by Mr. T. V. Claxton with the photoheliograph of the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , the object-glass of which is 4 inches in aperture and 5 feet in focal length .
It gives an image of the Sun nearly 8 inches in diameter , being fitted with a secondary magnifier , enlarging the image in the primary focus 13f times .
The total length of the photoheliograph was 9$ feet ; its equivalent focal length 69 feet .
The camera was constructed to carry plates 10 inches square , and it was proposed to expose six plates during totality for photographs of the corona , and as many as possible during the partial phase for determination of the Moon 's place , and of the relative diameters of the Sun and Moon .
Only three plates were exposed during totality , the handle of the shutter of the fourth plate-carrier breaking short off when the shutter was opened .
The plate-carrier was thus locked in the camera , and it was not possible to release it until the total phase was over .
The three plates taken were exposed as below , the exposures being given by Mr. Rowden at the object-glass of the instrument at the sound of the signal bells .

After totality the clock of the coelostat was stopped , and three photographs of the Sun were taken on the same plate for orientation .
The true local times of the first and last of these were h. m. S. 8 15 20-1 8 16 5-2 The time of the second exposure was not recorded .
The plate was an " ordinary lantern " by Cadett and Neale .
The aperture of the photoheliograph was reduced to 1^ inches , and the exposure was given by the drop-slit in the primary focus .
Two sets of " Abney squares " were printed upon No. 3 on June 13 , before the plate was developed .
Both sets were printed by the light of a Sugg 's Standard candle ; the one being exposed for 4 seconds , the other for 64 seconds , the candle being at a distance of 10 feet in both cases .
The corona is seen only on the E. side of the Sun , as the image is Mr. E. W. Maunder .

These were taken with the object-glass of the Dallmeyer photo-heliograph No. 5 , belonging to the Royal Observatory , Greenwich and which , like that of the Mauritius photoheliograph , had an aperture of 4 inches and a focal length of 5 feet\#151 ; used in connection with a concave telephoto lens by Dallmeyer , of 3 inches aperture and 12 inches focal length .
The instrument thus constructed has been referred to for convenience as the " Greenwich coronagraph , " and was about 7^ feet in actual length , w'ith an equivalent focal length of nearly 21 feet .
It was furnished with ten plate-holders to take 12 by 10-inch plates , and it was proposed to take seven photographs during totality .

Both sets were printed by the light of a Sugg 's Standard candle , at 5 feet distance ; the one being exposed for 15 seconds , and the other for 4 minutes .
No. 1 is a clean and fairly dense negative , showing well the polar rays and the structure of the lower corona , especially in the east equatorial wing .
The west wing shows less detail .
The corona is traceable to a distance of 15 or 16 minutes from the limb of the Moon in the S.E. ray .
No. 2 is a clear thin negative showing much about the same detail as No. 1 .
No. 3 is a thin negative but shows a considerable extension of the great S.E. and N.E. rays and a good deal of detail in their lower regions .
No. 4 is a dense negative showing the greatest degree of extension in the coronal streamers of any of the series .
In the case of the two chief rays , the corona can be traced to a distance of nearly half a degree from the Moon 's limb .
No. 5 shows the lower corona well up to 5 or 6 minutes from the Moon 's limb .
No. 6 is partly spoiled by fog , and only the lower corona is seen up to about 3 minutes .
No. 7 is a faint and delicate negative showing the chromosphere , prominences , and the lower corona up to a distance of about 3 minutes from the limb of the Moon .
Two methods were employed to focus the Greenwich coronagraph ; the first being the method described by the Astronomer Royal in his Reports of the Eclipse Expeditions of 1896 , 1898 , and 1900 , * an image of an object ( gauze net in the plane of the plate ) being photographed by reflection normally from the plane mirror of the coelostat .
The second method was by photographing Arcturus , the image of which was allowed to trail across the plate .

Development of the Photographs.\#151 ; Owing to my having been taken ill on May 21 with a severe attack of malarial fever , the work of Total Eclipse of the Sun , 1901 , May 18 .
259 developing the photographs was almost entirely carried out by Mr. Walter and by Mrs. Maunder , to whom the expedition is therefore greatly indebted for the results obtained .
The weather being hot and damp , much difficulty was experienced with the different plates tested by way of experiment before the day of the eclipse .
Finally the following developer was adopted and found to work well .
In spite of its excessive dilution , it was found that fog resulted if its strength was materially increased .

For development half an ounce was taken of each stock solution and , made up with water to 30 ounces , 15 drops of a 10 per cent , solution of bromide of potassium being added .
During development this solution was strengthened by the gradual addition to it of a solution composed of 1 ounce of each of the two stock solutions made up with water to 10 ounces .
But the stronger solution was seldom added to the weaker in a greater proportion than 1 to 15 .
The average time of development was 75 minutes .
I Photographs of the Partial Phase.\#151 ; These were taken with the photoheliograph of the Royal Alfred Observatory , Mauritius , already described .
The aperture for this purpose was reduced to 1J inches , and the exposure given by the drop-slit in the primary focus .
Mr. T. F. Claxton made the exposures , and called the times by Kullberg 3400 to Bombardier Cox , who entered them .
There being only three plate-carriers available for this work , Mr. C. Garrioch remained in the dark room to change the plates , and Bombardier Truman ran to and fro with them .
The plates used were Cadett and Neale s ordinary lantern plates .
The times of exposure were as follows :\#151 ; 260 Total Eclipse of the 1901 .

The former I myself brought home to the Royal Observatory , Greenwich ; the latter will be sent at the first available opportunity .
I took no observations myself of temperature during the eclipse , the Director of the Royal Alfred Observatory having made arrangements for full meteorological observations being taken both at the Observatory and at several other stations , not only in Mauritius , but also on other islands in the Indian Ocean .
" Preliminary Note on Observations of the Total Solar Eclipse of 1901 May 18 , made at Pamplemousses , Mauritius .
" By ( Mrs. ) A. S. D. Maunder .
Received October 23 , \#151 ; Read at Joint Meeting of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies , October 31 , 1901 .
Having observed successfully the eclipses of 1898 January 22 , in India , and 1900 May 28 , in Algiers , and my husband having been sent to Mauritius as the representative of the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , to observe the eclipse of May 18 last , I determined to accompany him , and to take with me the instruments which we had used in 1900 .
By the great kindness of Mr. G. J. Newbegin , F.R.A.S. , I was also furnished with a 4|-inch Cooke photo-visual telescope of 71 inches focus .
As my husband fixed his observing station at the Royal Alfred Observatory , Pamplemousses , and as the Director , Mr. Claxton , gave me every facility , I set up my instruments in the Observatory grounds .
The Newbegin telescope was mounted upon the equatorial stand of the photoheliograph which was left vacant , the Mauritius photoheliograph having been dismounted in order that it might be used in connection with the 16-inch coelostat of the official Greenwich Expedition .
The photoheliograph dome stands on the east of the Observatory grounds , and about 150 feet to the west of the dome I set up the Waters equatorial lent to my husband by the Royal Astronomical Society , which I used to carry two little cameras , each with a 11-inch Dallmeyer Stigma tic lens .
About 105 feet further west the camera belonging to the Waters telescope was firmly fixed , pointing directly to the Sun , and by its side the Niblett lens belonging to the British Astronomical Association , a photographic lens 4 inches in diameter , and of 34 inches focus .
This was likewise fixed rigidly .
Mr. Nevil Maskelyne , F.R.A.S. , also lent me his kinematograph , and this was mounted a few feet further south .
The management of these instruments during the eclipse was very kindly undertaken by several friends , and I was
