" On some peculiar modifications of the Force of Cohesion , with reference to the forms and structure of Clouds , Films and Membranes .
" By William Addison , Esq. , F.L.S. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. In the course of his researches into the nature and origin of tubercles in the lungs , and into the physical properties of the secretions of the human structure , the author had occasion to notice various fibrous and membranous forms arising solely from physical agencies .
On pursuing the inquiry , he observed a class of phenomena indicating some peculiar modifications of the force of cohesion .
Thus he found that transparent liquid streams are visible when vapours or fluids mingle with one another , and also when solids are dissolving in a fluid ; and that opake deposits , assuming the appearance of clouds , form on those streams , rendering visible the lines of junction of two fluid or gaseous surfaces .
A great number of experiments are described illustrating these general facts , which are afterwards applied to explain various phenomena of clouds , films and membranous formations , resulting from the operation of the different cohesive forces which are called into action , under a diversity of circumstances , when liquid or gaseous bodies are brought into mutual contact .
