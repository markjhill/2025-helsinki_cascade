V. An Observation on an Occulation of Cor Leonis by the Moon , on Thursday , March 12 .
1747 , in Surrey-Street in the Strand , London , with a reflecting Telescope , made by Mr. Short , F. R. S. which magnified about 100 times ; communicated to the Royal Society by J. Bevis , M. D. Apparent Time .
dh~~ 1747 , Mar. 12 8 24 19 The Star immerg 'd into the dark Limb .
9 27 4 It emerged from the enlightened Limb a small Matter to the West of the Moon 's Zenith .
44 41/ 2 The Moon 's preceding Limb passed the Meridian in the Transitory .
44 21 The Star passed the Meridian .
Read March 19 .
1746-7 .
Mr. Short , another Gentleman , and myself , agreed to a single Second in the Immersion , with different Telescopes ; but I saw and pronounced the Emersion 2 or 3 Seconds before them .
There had been an exact Observation of the Sun 's Transit at Noon ; and the Clock gained about half a Second a Day .
We reckon Surrey-Street 27 Seconds in Time West of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich .
Mr. John Catlin had a few Days before delivered me a Computation of this Eclipse , corrected from two Places of the Moon , observed the 28th of February and the 2d of March 1729 , corresponding pretty nearly with her present Situation ; as likewise from the Star 's Position , as I had rectified it from several late Observations ; and this gave the h~ Immersion at 8 261/ 2 Emersion 9 30 J.
