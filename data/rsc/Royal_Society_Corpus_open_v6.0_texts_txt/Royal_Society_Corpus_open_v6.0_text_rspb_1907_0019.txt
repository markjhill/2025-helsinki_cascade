) The avidity of the tissues for oxygen is such that this gas has never been regarded as a factor in the production of decompression symptoms with respect to the formation of bubbles .

16*0 4*0 80*0 Hill and Macleod ( 4 ) submitted frogs and toads to 20 atmospheres of oxygen ( Brin 's oxygen , containing 93\#151 ; 95 per cent. Og ) for five minutes , and rapidly decompressed them .
They found that the animals were convulsed and enormously distended with gas .
In the case of mice submitted to 10 atmospheres for five minutes and rapidly decompressed , no such distension was observed , but the animals went into tetanic convulsions .
These convulsions could be excited by a touch , the mice usually recovering and appearing normal on the following day .
Mice killed in the convulsive state showed , here and there , a few bubbles in the vessels , some being found , on microscopic examination , in the central nervous system , distending the capillary The Influence of Increased Barometric Pressure on Man .
285 sized vessels and compressing the nerve-cells .
The convulsions were due to oxygen poisoning , and the bubbles , being formed of oxygen , were eventually absorbed by the tissues .
These bubbles supplied the nerve-cells with oxygen until the circulation became re-established , so that no lasting paralysis resulted , as occurs with nitrogen bubbles .
It seemed , therefore , probable that , if an animal be kept in oxygen until symptoms of poisoning are well marked and there is danger of death , then the tissues will be unable to combine with the oxygen liberated on sudden decompression , and embolism will result .
We decided to settle this question by analyses in the peritoneal cavity , blood-vessels , and subcutaneous tissues .
The technic employed was that described in the paper of Hill and Ham ( 3 ) , the animal being cut open under a funnel filled with water and inverted over a basin of water .
Before being passed under the funnel , the gas is carefully washed out of the fur , and pains are taken to avoid opening the digestive tract or lungs .

The onset of convulsions immediately after decompression , mentioned in the above account , is very suggestive , and may well have been due to the : sudden liberation of gas bubbles acting on the already poisoned tissues .

287 The breathing of pure oxygen has been suggested by v. Schrotter ( 5 ) as a means of washing the dissolved nitrogen out of the body before decompression .
He suggested that deep-sea divers might take down a small cylinder , wash themselves out for five minutes , and then ascend rapidly without risk .
The experiments of Durig ( 6 ) show that , on breathing almost pure oxygen , the body nitrogen is washed out in about five minutes , as shown by the quantity of nitrogen in the expired air sinking in that time to a constant level .
L. Hill and C. Ham ( 7 ) have pointed out the extreme danger of breathing oxygen for even five minutes at high pressures , and v. Schrotter ( 8 ) himself has come to the conclusion that the use of oxygen should be confined to an inhalation immediately after decompression .
The gas set free in the blood on rapid decompression contains 79\#151 ; 87 per cent. Ha .
Of the alveolar air , nitrogen forms 79 per cent. , so that the difference of tension promoting an escape of bubbles is very small or nil ( 5\#151 ; 0 per cent. ) .
If pure oxygen be breathed , the difference of tension will become 79\#151 ; 87 per cent. , and this will greatly favour the escape of nitrogen bubbles from the pulmonary vessels ( Zuntz ) .
There is little advantage in breathing oxygen diming the course of a rapid decompression , because the exchange is between the tissues saturated with nitrogen and the blood .
The amount carried away by the blood depends on the respective tensions of nitrogen in the tissues and the blood .
Oxygen inhalation cannot affect this , except in so far as it clears the arterial blood of nitrogen in the lungs .
If the pressure falls rapidly the tissues will still be saturated\#151 ; say , at 5 atmospheres\#151 ; and hold 5 per cent , of nitrogen , while the blood can only carry , say , 3 per cent. , the pressure having fallen to 3 atmospheres .
Oxygen can have little or no effect in arresting this decreasing power of the blood to carry nitrogen ( v. Schrotter ) .
The only safe method is slow decompression at a uniform rate when the body has been exposed long enough to become saturated .
