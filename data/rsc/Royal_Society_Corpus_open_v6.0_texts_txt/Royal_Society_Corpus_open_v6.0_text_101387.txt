An Extract of a Letter , written by Monsieur Denys November .
17.last from Paris concerning an odd faetus lately born there ; English't out of French .
SIR , A Few days since , I was called to a sick woman , brought to bed that very day I went to see her .
After I had prescribed the physic I judged necessary for the mother , I asked for the child , which died , I heard , as soon as'twas born .
The Body of it appeared outwardly very well formed and very fat ; but the head was so deformed , that it frighted all that were present .
It had no front ; the two eyes were on the top of the face , very big , and almost without an orbite to lodge them in .
The upper and hind-part of the Head was red like coagulated blood , and resembled the bottom of a Calves-head when cut and severed from the Vertebra 's of the neck .
I had the curiosity to examine this red flesh , and I found under it a Bone , that was not a hollow skul , but a solid bone in the form of a small oyster .
I had it opened every way ; but I found no hollowness nor brains in it .
This bone was only fastened before to the bones of the face , and not behind to the vertebra 's of the neck ; so that the marrow of the back-bone had no communication with the head .
I poursued the Optic nerves , and lost them in this bone , which was in lieu of the cranium , and was not at all spungy , but very hard .
It seems to me somewhat extraordinary , that a child should be able to live nine months without brains ; for I was informed , that it was very lively and brisk in the mothers belly , but died as soon as it came into the Air .
