Recovery of T. gambiense from Tragelaphus spekei .
483 observed and distinguished from those clumped .
In some culture tubes , rounded ( involution ) forms appear in great numbers on the third day to the fifth day , and the virulence and properties of these forms are now being separately studied .
The percentage of successes varies very much indeed\#151 ; from 1 tube in 25 to 6 in 6 .
Numerous other media have been used , giving invariably negative results by the fifth day , including those consisting of frozen and thawed rabbits ' blood serum only .
Further Observations on the Recovery of Trypanosoma gambiense from Tragelaphus spekei on the Islands of Lake Victoria Nyanza By Dr. H. L. Duke .
( Communicated by Sir John Rose Bradford , K.C.M.G. , Sec. R.S. Received July 17 , 1912 .
) In a paper* dealing with the recovery of a trypanosome from wild antelope on Damba Island , Lake Victoria Nyanza , the diagnosis is discussed at some length with a view to the exclusion of T. brucei .
Fifteen subinoculation experiments were considered and the conclusion was arrived at that the available evidence pointed to the organism being T. gambiense .
After a lapse of some four months this opinion has received considerable support from a more prolonged investigation of the animal reactions of the trypanosome .
In the following table many of the original subinoculations are followed to their conclusion on the death of the animal , and several other experiments have been added to the list .
It will be seen that the evidence supplied by the rat experiments is strongly in favour of T. gambiense .
In the six experiments conducted with rats the average duration of the disease is 61 days .
This constitutes very strong evidence against T. brucei .
In guinea-pigs ( three experiments ) the average duration is 67 days : in five completed monkey experiments , 147 days .

For comparison with the reactions of this Damba trypanosome the following experiments may be considered , involving other trypanosomes strains employed at Mpumu .
Two types were selected for experiment , the one represented by various strains recovered from wild Lake-shore flies by feeding them on monkeys ; the other an undoubted T. gambiense .
This last was obtained in Monkey 199 by direct inoculation from a reedbuck in captivity at the laboratory , 15 months after the original infection of this animal with a human strain .
It should be 1912 .
] Trypanosoma gambiense fromTragelaphus spekei .
485 noted that in the case of all the strains employed the trypanosomes had more or less recently passed through Glossina palpalis .
This is also presumably the case with the Damba strain as found originally in the wild antelope .
This fact is of considerable importance in that it eliminates all idiosyncrasies acquired during continued maintenance in laboratory animals .

The average duration of the disease in rats ( three experiments ) is 61 days : in four guinea-pigs 68 days : in seven monkeys 119 days .
From a comparison of the above two tables it will be seen that there is a close similarity in the animal reactions of all the trypanosomes employed .
In no instance does the disease in rats approach the virulence assumed by T. brucei .
There is , therefore , no reason to doubt that the trypanosomes recovered from wild Lake-shore flies and from the wild situtunga are indeed . .
gambUnse .
A visit was paid to Sese Islands where Carpenter had recently obtained an iiM^ction in a monkey with some 6000 odd flies .
palpalis were found to be very numerous and many situtunga tracks were seen .
The natural conditions on the islands visited are , however , apparently very much less favourable to the perpetuation of sleeping sickness by these animals than is the case with Damba .
There are tracts of open country , between and behind the forests which fringe most of the Lake shore , where situtunga come out to feed and where there are no tsetse .
The antelope do not , therefore , enter a fly area immediately upon leaving the shelter of the forest and papyrus as is nearly always the case on Damba .
Six situtunga were shot during the trip .
Their blood was examined in the fresh state , by stained films , and by inoculation into goats and monkeys .

[ May 10 , the latter method only was a positive result obtained , appearing in the goat 13 days after the first inoculation of blood .
The two monkeys used in these experiments remained negative to daily examinations for 30 days .
With regard to the appearance of trypanosomes in the goat it must be stated that the animal was sent to Sese direct from Entebbe .
I was , therefore , only able to make a few preliminary blood examinations before using it for experiment .
In the face of former results with T. vivax and the fact that the goat was to all appearance quite healthy , there is every reason to conclude that the trypanosomes came from the situtunga .
Studies on the Reductase of Liver and Kidney.\#151 ; Part I. By David Fraser Harris , M.D. , D.Sc .

) I. Introduction .
The notion has been steadily gaining ground that the reducing powers of animal tissues are due to enzymic action .
In March , 1910 , one of us* adduced evidence that this so-called " reductase " was active in the press-juice of liver and kidney of sheep , ox , horse , and frog .
Soluble Prussian blue , methylene blue , and sodium indigo-disulphonate are all reduced more or less perfectly to leuco-compounds by press juice , whereas by a boiled control they are not .
It seemed very desirable to conduct several lines of investigation arising out of the main contention that the tissues were capable of carrying out reduction-processes because they contained an endo-enzyme , viz. , How rapidly does the press juice deteriorate in reducing activity ; how does it behave in respect of such comparatively stable but reducible substances as KaNOa ; in what way , exactly , does its activity vary with temperature ; in what way , if any , is the catalase of the liver related to the reductase ?
It seemed , in particular , highly desirable that a method capable of following the reduction changes quantitatively should be devised in order to enable us to follow the velocity of any given reaction being studied .
