W. Shanks on the Extension of 40 .
Our conclusion from the evidence before us is , that the residual effect is a surface-e\amp ; ct more deeply seated than the gas-effect , but distributed outwards from the centre to the circumference , very much in the same mannel as the gas-effect .
The effect ikewise ppears able to penetrate a leitther blind without any perceptible diminution .
1Ve regard these conclusions as preliminary , and shall endeavour in our future expel.iments to procure additional evidence of these properties of the residual e#ect , as well as to obtain nsw facts regarding it .
In the mean time , the subject is one of interest , and has been already too long dlhyed , have not to bring these results before the notice of the Boyal Society .
concluding old desire to express our thanks to Nfr .
F. Kngdon for his assistance to us in many of these experiments . .

Communicated by Prof. G. G. Sec. R.S. Received April 16 , 1873 .
In the ' bIessenger of Mathematics ' for Dec. 1872 , J. W. L. Glaisher , Rq .
, has given some very interesting particulars regarding the calculntion of , in the justness of which the author generally comeurs .
He , however , differs from him as to the comparative merits of Van Ceulen , who , in the early part of the seyenteenth century , calculated to 36 decimals .
Hutton 's formuh also , given in the ' Messenger , ' appears , notwithstanding Hutton 's own opinion , to be not so well adapted extensive computation as lfachin 's , which the author has used om the present as well as former occasions , regarding it as the best yet found .
The values of and of are each given below to 709 , and the of to 707 decimals .
It will be observed that a few figures in the values of and of , published in 1853 , were erroneous .
The author detected the error quite l.ecently , and has corrected it .
The values of each term of the two series in ffi are far too bulky to be in extenso : fortunately , but few would care to see them !
It may here be stated that Prof. Richter , of IlClbing , to 500 decimals in the 1853\mdash ; all of which agree with the author 's , published in the same year .
