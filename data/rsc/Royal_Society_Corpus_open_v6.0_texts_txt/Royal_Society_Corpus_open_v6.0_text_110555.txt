" Observations on the Dry-rot of Ships , and an elfeclual method to prevent it pointed out .
" By James Mease , M.D. Communicated by Charles Konig , Esq. , For .
Sec. R.S. The method recommended by the author fov preventing the oc ?
currence of the dry-rot in ships is to impregnate the timbers and planks with common salt , as is practised by the ship-builders in Philadelphia .
For this purpose all the spaces between the timbers and the outside and inside planks are to be filled with Spanish or Portugal salt , driven down as the filling proceeds .
The salt is found to penetrate thoroughly , and completely to saturate the wood , combining with its native sap and preventing fermentation and the consequent evolution of foul air .
The principal inconvenience attend ?
ing this method is the dampness of the ships ?
an evil for which the author suggests various remedies .
