292 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. ig * ' ) copper to silver , that is , in the same direction as if the copper had been dissolved hy an acid and hydrogen evolved on the silver plate .
If the two plates have their sides parallel , the suhoxide is deposited not merely on that side of the silver plate which faces the copper , but after about a minute on the other side also , showing that in this , as in other cases , the lines of force curve round .
It became interesting to consider what started this electric current .
The original observations convinced us that it was not due to the action of oxygen on the copper j but , to mate the matter more certain , bright copper and silver plates in conjunction were immersedj the copper in a pure , i. e. deoxy-genized , solution of nitrate of copper , the silver in an oxygenized solution : the two liquids communicated through the diaphragm of a divided cell .
In half an hour the silver plate was covered with a reddish film , while not a trace of tarnish was perceptible on the copper .
On continuing this experiment for three hours , it was found that the copper plate lost 0*003 grm. , and the silver plate was increased by 0*004 grm. On cleaning the plates , and reversing their position , the copper was covered with a film of oxide , while the silver remained free from cupreous deposit .
We believe therefore that , through the simultaneous action of the two metals , the dissolved salt is put into such a state of tension that oxygen brings about a chemical change which otherwise would be impossible , and that this change is initiated in close proximity to the more negative metal .
Though we have examined only this particular reaction , we have satisfied ourselves that it is not an isolated fact .
Each of the elements concerned may be replaced by others : thus , the sulphate may be substituted for the nitrate of copper , or platinum may be used instead of silver ; chlorine may take the place of oxygen , with the production of the subchloride instead of the suboxide ; and zinc may be employed as the positive metal , with zinc chloride as the salt in solution , in which case copper may be taken as the negative metal , and on its surface will form a deposit of oxide of zinc .

Received March 19 , 1872 .
The gas commonly called ** Fire-damp , " to the mixture of which with atmospherical air the formation of the explosive mixture in coal-mines is due , exudes from the coal at a certain pressure ; so that the rate of its escape must , to some extent , depend on the pressure of the atmosphere , 1872.1 between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
293 especially in the shallower mines , where the tension of the gas is not great and the fissures are open .
On the other hand , the effect of a given quantity of gas in rendering the air of a mine explosive must depend on the supply of pure air to the workings .
It has long been observed that when the barometer , after having stood at a high level for a time , begins to fall more or less rapidly , the accumulations of foul air and gas in the goaves and fissures of a mine emit part of their contents into the ventilating-currents which flow past them .
It is also well known that as the very existence of these currents depends , in almost every case , on the difference of temperature between two columns of air , those in the downcast and upcast shaft respectively , any increase in the temperature of the external air , from which the downcast shaft receives its supply , must necessarily render the circulation underground more sluggish .
It is therefore obvious that the tendency to explosion will be increased when the ordinary causes which lead to the fouling of the air in a mine , such as falls of roofs and leakages in the air-courses , are assisted from without by the meteorological phenomena we have just mentioned ; and several investigators have compiled lists of explosions , in order to compare them with the meteorological observations which have been recorded prior to and at the time of the accidents .
At the Meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1855 , Mr. T. Dobson , B. A. , read a paper " On the Relation between Explosions in Coalmines and Revolving Storms , " which is printed entire among the Reports .
The reasoning in this paper is to a great extent based upon a diagram given by Mr. J. Dickinson , Inspector for the North and East Lancashire District , in his Report for 1852 , which shows the daily march of the barometer during that year at Manchester , and the explosions which occurred in his district during the year .
Mr. Dickinson , in his Report for 1866 , gives a diagram showing a continuous barogram recorded at Manchester for one week ( December 8\#151 ; 15th , 1866 ) , characterized by a remarkable barometrical depression .
Between the 10th and 13th of December 463 lives were lost in six different explosions , the two accidents at the " Oaks " Colliery causing 361 deaths .
In the * Transactions of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers ' ( vol. xix .
) diagrams are given showing the meteorological records from the Observatories of Kew and Glasgow for 1868 and 1869 , and the explosions reported durng those years .
No discussion is given , but the diagrams have been carefully compiled by the secretary , Mr. Bunning , and we have extracted the list of explosions for 1868 from this paper .
Lastly , in the ' Journal of the Austrian Meteorological Society ' for February 1872 , Herr F. M. Simmersbach* has published a paper on the * " TJeber den Einfluss meteorologischer Vorgange auf die Luffccirculation unter Tage , und auf die Gasgefahrlichkeit in den Kohlgruben , " von F. M.

Y 294 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. ^ subject of the present communication , but it does not call for special notice .
Mr. Dobson 's is the most elaborate discussion of the subject which has yet appeared , and we must devote a few words to it .
One of the diagrams in his paper exhibits 491 explosions in five-day periods , and from it the author concludes that the annual march of the curve coincides with the march of temperature , with a relative maximum occurring in the autumn , which he attributes to the frequency of serious storms at that time of the year .
To this we can only say that the maximum and minimum of annual temperature do not occur at the precise epochs named by Mr. Dobson , and that the last quarter of the year cannot be considered as preeminently stormy , at least not more so than such a month as the January ( 1872 ) which has just passed .
In order to test this question of periodicity , we have collected from the Reports of the Inspectors of Mines all the recorded explosions for the last twenty years .
These explosions are only the fatal ones , and include a few accidents due to suffocation by " choke-damp , " or carbonic-acid gas .
We consider that we may fairly count such accidents as due to causes closely related to those which produce explosions of " fire-damp .
" " We plotted the whole of these explosions in two decennial periods for the seventy-three intervals of five days each , and found that the curves hardly showed any agreement with each other , so that no confirmation was obtained for Mr. Dobson 's alleged periodicity .
The curve for the entire period of twenty years , including 1369 accidents , was also constructed , and all that is worth notice about it is that the number of accidents is somewhat greater in October than in other months .
The absolute maximum falls at the end of January , and the absolute minimum in the middle of September .
From a comparison of the two decennial curves we learn that the number of fatal accidents has decreased from 768 in the former ( 1851\#151 ; 1860 ) to 601 in the latter period ( 1861-1870 ) , notwithstanding the great augmentation of the output of coal during the time in question .
We do not consider it worth while to reproduce these curves .
At this juncture there is one matter which deserves attention , viz. that the number of serious accidents , involving the loss of ten or more lives , has very materially increased during the last five years .
The number of such explosions during the years 1851-1855 ( inclusive ) was 13 ; 1856-1860 , 15 ; 1861-1865 , 12 ; and 1866-1870 , 21 .
On this matter we do not offer any opinion , but it seems to us desirable to place the figures on record .
For the purposes of the present paper we have taken the continuous records furnished by the Observatory of Stonyhurst , one of the seven established by the Meteorological Committee .
These records exist from the 1st of January 1868 , and the curves for the years 1869 and 18/ 0 h\amp ; ve 1872 .
] between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
been published in the Quarterly Weather Report .
Stonyhurst has been selected inasmuch as from its situation , near Preston , it is more central as regards the coal-districts than any of the other observatories .
In the case of certain accidents , more especially in the South-Wales and Scotch districts , the records from Falmouth or Glasgow respectively might possibly throw more light on the matter , but we have thought it hardly worth while to complicate the diagrams by introducing them .
The curves for barometrical pressure and for temperature have been plotted from the daily maxima and minima registered for the years 1868 , 1869 , and 1870 .
The curves have not been actually reduced from the photographic records , as the horizontal scale has been so much compressed ; but they afford a fairly correct representation of the march of the phenomena , and for the last two years they can be compared , if necessary , with the Quarterly Weather Report .
One serious disturbing cause interferes with the value of these curves , arising from the weekly suspension of work in the collieries , and in many instances of ventilation , too , on Sundays .
The influence of this was eliminated in the former investigation , when we were seeking for periodicity , as we dealt with as many as twenty years .
The dates of the fatal explosions are all given in the Inspector 's Annual Reports , those of the non-fatal explosions for 1868 have been taken from Mr. Bunning 's paper .
For the facts relating to the years 1869 and 1870 we are indebted to the kindness of the Inspectors , who have almost without exception responded to our application by furnishing all the information which it was in their power to give .
The occurrences have all been entered to their proper dates , and the districts in which they were reported have been noted .
Fatal accidents are marked by a bar .
We have marked by special symbols all the explosions which appear to us to be connected with sudden changes in atmospherical pressure or with abnormally high temperature ; a few of the occurrences may possibly be attributable to the conjoint action of these two causes .
Mr. Dobson , writing at a time when all our serious barometrical oscillations were imagined to be connected with true cyclones , considered that , as in the front of such an advancing storm the barometer is falling and the temperature rising , he was justified in putting down the liability to explosion as a phenomenon of the anterior segment of such a storm .
He does not , however , give a continuous record of weather so that we can see how many storms were unaccompanied by explosions .
There can be no oubt of the coincidence of certain serious explosions with severe storms ; a notable instance of this will be found on the 8th of October , 1870 ; but | , e exldosions do not happen only at the commencement of a barome-rical depression , but occur also two or three days after the barometer has hs lowest point and is again rising .
We have taken a limit 296 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. g The cause of this prolongation of the dangerous period is that when fire-damp issues in greater quantity than usual from cavities and fissures into the workings , and more especially into places where the air is stagnant and already more or less foul by admixture of gas , the volume of the explosive portion of this mixture will increase in consequence of the in-creased rapidity of diffusion , or , in other words , the explosive boundary will extend itself .
This extension of the explosive boundary is gradual , and in some cases a considerable time may elapse before the boundary has reached its extreme limits and begins again to recede .
During all this period the mine will be in an abnormally dangerous state .
Meanwhile , although the pressure of the atmosphere rises , and a current sets in backwards* into the cavities whence the pure gas has just issued , yet if the entrance to such a cavity be at a lower level than the highest portion of the space occupied by such escaped gas , which rises , owing to its low density , it is evident that what is driven back into the cavity will be a mixture of gas and air , and that no portion of the gas which lies above the level of the aperture to the cavity can be driven back into it .
Accordingly a certain volume of this pure gas remains , diffusing itself freely and fouling the surrounding air .
It is evident from these considerations that , in the case of continued unsteadiness of pressure and repeated violent oscillations of the barometer , we need not expect that each of these reductions of pressure will cause the efflux of a quantity of gas proportionate to the extent of such reduction .
If the successive falls of the mercury are of less magnitude than the first , or than any previous one in the series , the quantity of gas given off cannot possibly be as great on each occasion as if that fall had been preceded by a period of high pressure .
If , however , any of the later oscillations be more serious than their predecessors , a certain fresh supply of pure gas will be given off .
Hence we see that , as a general rule , we do not find a succession of explosions at a time when the barometer is in a state of continued violent oscillation .
Recurring to what has already been said about temperature , we would here remark that in cold weather the ventilation of the pits is exceedingly active , many collieries ' being ventilated easily by natural means without any extraneous agency whatever .
In the height of summer , however , it is different ; for then the temperature of the air in the downcast shaft is higher , and the ventilation can only be kept up by the help of the furnace In some cases , then , a sudden rise of temperature may catch the miner unprepared , and where an active current would have remained safe , a sluggish one may become foul , and possibly an explosion may occur .
We shall now proceed to a discussion of the facts represented on the Plate for the years 1868 , 1869 , 1870 .

297 1868 .
The first quarter of this year was very exceptionally stormy , in fact Mr. Buchan , in a paper printed in the 'Atlas Met^orologique ' for 1868 , states that during the sixty-three days comprised between the 13t.h of January and the 26th of March , as many as twenty-seven distinct storms passed over the north of Europe .
We attribute thirty accidents which occurred during this period to barometrical causes .
The first serious depression occurred on the 18th of January , when three explosions were recorded , with a fourth on the 20th ; the barometer remained unsteady for some days and reached a very low level on February 1 , where we find four explosions close to each other .
The disturbances of pressure of the 7th and 19th of February caused , the former two , the latter three explosions , as did also that of March 11th .
In April the temperature began to rise to a considerable height during the day , so that the amount of daily range was large ; and so we attribute two explosions to this cause .
The serious storm of April 21st was accompanied by five accidents .
A period of warm weather set in in May ; and we attribute the hatch of accidents between the 15th and 20th to temperature , and similarly those at the beginning of June and July .
Occasionally accidents referable to temperature are also reported up to the middle of September .
After that date we find two months which were comparatively free from explosions , and also from serious storms .
The first great disturbance of pressure which succeeded was on the 22nd of November , and it resulted in six explosions , extending over a period of four days .
The atmosphere wa$ nearly as much disturbed in December as in January , and we count thirteen accidents as due to oscillations of the barometer .
The most serious group was that of five , which accompanied the heavy storm of December 21 st. In all we have in 1868 154 explosions ( 44 of them fatal ) , and of these 72 seem to be due to changes of pressure , 41 to rise of temperature , while 41 appear to us to be more or less independent of either of these agencies .
1869 .
The first two depressions of the year , those of January 8th and January 15th , were each accompanied by explosions , and on the 27th a period of prolonged violent disturbance set in .
Two very marked barometrical oscillations passed over all our stations , bringing with them heavy equatorial storms on January 28th and February 1st .
Seven explosions are recorded between the 27th and 29th , while the oscillation of the first only caused one .
Pressure was very low during the first half of February , the lowest reading being recorded on the 8th , with one explosion , followed by three others on the next three days .
The storm of February 12th , which was very destructive to shipping in the Channel , was not marked by any colliery accidents , as the oscillation of 298 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. 18 , the barometer , unusually violent though it was , did not extend beyond the southern stations , and was very transient in its character .
At the end of February the weather was again much disturbed , the barograms reaching their lowest points on the 1st of IVlarch , when we find two explosions .
Two more followed on the 11th , while the depression of the 17th caused three .
Slight disturbances , accompanied by one or two explosions , occurred up to April 4th .
A sudden period of warm weather appears on the 10th of April , the five , day mean for the period from April 11th to April 15th , at Stonyhurst and Glasgow , being nearly 10 ' warmer than those which preceded and followed it ; so that we consider ourselves justified in referring seven of the explosions during this period to temperature .
Another oscillation of the barometer occurred on the 16 th , which was most serious in the north of England , and we find three explosions .
The batch of four accidents on the 26th and 27th of April we refer to temperature .
From this till the 7th of June we find only one accident referable to atmospherical causes ; but on that day , as well as on the 24th and the 2nd of July , we find several explosions coincident with great warmth of the weather .
The storm of June 15th seems to have caused four explosions .
The 17th of July was a very hot day , and so were the days immediately succeeding it ; and we find six explosions close to each other , the last , that on July 21st , being the " Haydock " accident , which cost fifty-nine lives .
The first serious disturbance of pressure in the autumn was on September 11th , when a heavy gale swept up the Channel ; and we find at this time a batch of accidents , which we attribute to barometrical causes .
On the 16th of October we had another serious disturbance , and seven explosions occurred within four days .
The depression of the 29th caused three , and after that date there was nothing to call for special remark till the 21st of November .
On this day a most extensive and sudden diminution of pressure was observed , the account of which , as given in the Quarterly Weather Report , is as follows :\#151 ; " The actual fall of the barometer , within twenty-four hours , had exceeded 0*9 in .
over the entire district , stretching from Dover to Valencia , and from L'Orient to Shields .
The superficial extent of this area is about 200,000 square miles .
" This oscillation was marked by four accidents .
At the beginning of December the barometer ranged very high ; but from the 13th to the 18th a period of violent oscillation is observed , the absolute minimum for the year being recorded in Scotland .
Between the 13th and 15 th seven explosions are registered , five of which were in the Scotch coal-fields .
The year closed with a fall of the barometer , and three accidents in the N orth-Staffordshire district .
On the whole , we have in 1869 192 explosions ( 47 of which were fatal ) ) 1872 .
] between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
92 of them we attribute to oscillations of the barometer , 34 to temperature , while 66 are left unaccounted for by either agency .
1870 .
The storm of January 8th caused two explosions , and the depression of the 14th was followed by two others .
The barometer then remained unusually high from the 16th to the 25th ; and as soon as it began to give way , we have three explosions on the 27th , and two more to correspond with the barometrical minimum on the 31st .
The barometer at most stations read below 29-5ins .
during the first ten days of February , and we find seven accidents between the 4th and 9th ; these were followed by as many more within the next few days , with a high barometer and cold weather , which are therefore not referred by us to either deficiency of pressure or a high temperature .
One of these cost thirty lives .
Pressure was very unsteady and low at the end of February , and eight accidents occurred between the 21st and 26th ; another somewhat similar series is observable in the second week in March .
On the 5th of April the daily range of the thermometer was considerable , 22 ' at Stonyhurst and 26 ' at Kew ; and we refer two explosions to this cause .
The sudden outbreak of hot weather on the 16th , and the high temperature of 71'*7 .
at Stonyhurst on the 20th of May , account for two explosions in the adjoining coal-field on that day , with a third in the west of Scotland .
The weather was very hot from the 3rd to the 8th of June , and we find three explosions on the 4th , and one each on the 6th and 8th ; then follow three , which we trace to the fall of the barometer .
June 19th to the 22nd were also very hot days , especially in the centre and south of England ; and of the six accidents reported at this time two were in the southern and central coal-fields . .
In the months of July and August we have connected various explosions with the high temperature then prevailing .
A period of serious disturbance existed from the 1st to the 11th of September , and we have eight explosions , and four more on the 13th .
At the end of the month the weather became very warm , and we find six explosions close to each other .
The month of October was peculiarly stormy , and the first fall of the barometer occurred on the 7th and 8th ; on the latter day we have ve explosions ; another sudden depression on the 12th was followed by three .
The oscillations of the 16th and 19th had but little influence ; but on the 23rd the barometer again fell very low , and we find six explosions in t days .
Ihe next serious group of accidents was about the 20th of November , when we find several recorded simultaneously with a low state of the baro -^eter .
The mercury then rose and continued very high for some ay ; Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. 18 , but on the 11th of December a serious fall is observed , and two accidents occurred next day .
The explosions which appear at the end of the year do not seem to be referable to pressure .
On the whole , we find in 1870 179 explosions ( 67 of them fatal ) , of which 92 are due to the state of the barometer , 43 to the temperature , while 44 remain unaccounted for by either of these agencies # As a general summary , we consider that out of 525 explosions recorded in the three years , 49 per cent , may be reasonably connected with disturbance of the barometer , 22 per cent , with abnormally high tempera-ture while 29 per cent , are not traceable to atmospherical agency .
[ Since handing in the paper , we have received the statistics of non-fatal explosions in the mines of Yorkshire during the years 1869 and 1870 .
In 1869 there were eight occurrences , of which we attribute four to the state of the barometer , one to temperature , while three are unaccounted for .
In 1870 there were seventeen occurrences , of which we attribute six to the state of the barometer , four to temperature , while seven are unaccounted for .

The facts have been inserted in the diagrams.\#151 ; April 13 , 1872 .
] It may not he out of place to discuss briefly the manner in which an increased supply of gas or a diminished supply of air brought about by any of the causes just alluded to , leads to a fouling of the ventilating-current in its passage through the workings ; and also how the comparative purity or foulness of the ventilating-current affects the condition of the air in places adjoining its course .
The gas flows from the .fissures of the coal and stone either into a ventilating-current , by which it is carried out of the mine , as when it escapes at the face of a long-wall working or bratticed board , or from the sides of an air-course ; or , secondly , it flows into a quiet atmosphere , such as that in goaves and cavities in the roof whence stone has fallen , in unbratticed bords , or in recesses between pack-walls in long-wall workings .
In any of these latter cases it diffuses itself into the surrounding air , and an accumulation of a more or less explosive character is generated .
As long as the average quantity of air is circulating in the mine and the quantity of gas which escapes into the workings is not suddenly increased , we may take it for granted that little danger exists ; for the districts of the mine in which explosive mixtures are to be met with are clearly defined and well known , so that precautions can be taken to prevent ignition .
As soon as these conditions are in any way changed ( i. e. , if the supply of air be diminished in quantity or deteriorated in quality by an increased escape of gas ) , explosive mixtures may make their appearance in places where no danger had previously existed .
It may be assumed that a ventilating-current consists of pure air 1872 .
] between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
when it starts from the end of the in-take air-course on its passage through the workings , and that for every equal space it travels between the in-take and return air-course it receives an equal quantity of gas .
Thus when it arrives at the return air-course it consists of a mixture of air and fire-damp , whose constitution depends on the quantity of air passing through the workings , on the rate at which gas escapes into it , and on the distance between the in-take and return air-course .
It is therefore evident that if either the supply of air be diminished or the supply of gas increased , the resulting mixture will be rendered more explosive , not only in the return air-course , but also at every point of the passage between the xn-take and return air-course .
If , then , from any causes the mixture shall have reached the firing-point when it enters the return air-course* , any aggravation of these causes would make the firing-point to travel backwards through the workings towards the in-take air-course .
In this manner the ventilating-current may itself become explosive in some parts of its course .
Again , although the ventilating-current itself may never become explosive , its gradual fouling may cause explosive mixtures to be generated in certain places , such as unbratticed bords , recesses between pack-walls , and eavities in the roof in the following manner ( all other cases may be , more or less directly , referred to these ) :\#151 ; Fie .
1 .
Figs. 1 and 2 represent sections of the workings .
It is the roof , I the floor , C is a point where the ventilating-current passes in a direction formal to the plane of the paper .
In fig. 1 , is a cavity in the roof Although the air entering any particular return air-course may be explosive , it will lie become diluted again before it reaches the upcast , by leakages from the in-take course and admixture of air from other districts .
302 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. 18 , which is filled down to the level d c with a mixture of air and gas .
Gas may flow into such a cavity from a fissure in the sides , or from any lower part of the seam along the roof and under the edge at a. In fig 2 d b eg is an unbratticed bord , receiving gas from the face b c , filled with a similar mixture down to A The space occupied by the foul air is shaded in each case ; and e/ is a plane in that space which is choseu The plane d c , which bounds the lowest part of the accumulation , is level and here the mixture contains the least proportion of fire-damp ; the impurity of the air increases with the height , and the foulest atmosphere is found at b , the highest point of the cavity .
If any gas flows into the cavity a corresponding volume of the contents of the cavity is displaced and escapes into the ventilating-current .
Diffusion is also constantly going on ; and as the result of this process is to produce below the plane cda mixture lighter than the ventilatmg-current , this mixture rises along the roof and is carried away at C ( fig. 1 ) , d ( fig. 2 ) .
, , Gas is therefore constantly being removed from the cavity , partly by displacement , partly by diffusion , and its quantity is exactly equal to that entering the cavity .
# .
If , now , the ventilating-current become fouled in any of the ways we have* described , the space below the plane c d will be filled with the same mixture as that in the ventilating-current itself .
# JH If we suppose that the mixture in the cavity up to a certain level ef be less foul , and therefore heavier than that which now forms the ventilating-current , the volume of air \amp ; c. in the space d efc will be displaced , and no further escape of gas can take place from either accumulation until the whole of the contents above the line c d are more foul than the mixture below cd .
As soon as this condition is fulfilled , diffusion and displacement will go on .
In order , however , that the rate of diffusion may he the same ip before , the specific gravity of the whole mass must he reduced , for the square roots of the specific gravities of the mixtures above and below the plane cd must bear the same ratio to each other that they did before the current became fouled .
This reduction of the specific gravity is , in other words , increased foulness of the air .
II If , then , the mixture in the space was previously near the firing-point , it is obvious that any impurity in the ventilating-current wiB cause it to approach nearer to that point , and so eventually an explosive mixture may he generated in a cavity while the ventilating-curre# itself is non-explosive .
It will be seen that by the above process a quantity of fire-damp may be stored up in such a cavity , which can only escape very gradually* after the ventilating-current has become purer .
It follows , then , that if an explosive mixture has been formed in places 1872 .
] between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
and under conditions similar to those we have described , some time , possibly several days , must elapse after the causes which have led to its formation have disappeared before the contents of such a cavity shall have been rendered innocuous again .
We do not propose to treat specially of sudden " eruptions " of gas .
Such occurrences , at least of any serious magnitude , are very rare .
When they do take place in collieries where naked lights are used , the gas takes fire at the nearest such light , and at most one or two men are injured .
If safety-lamps are employed , the gas may pass those which are in good order and travel on until it meets a defective lamp , when the whole explodes .
A few words on the subject of the dependence of ventilation on temperature above ground may not be undesirable .
When the temperature of the air at the surface is less than that in the mine , the phenomenon called Natural Ventilation ensues .
The colder aii which descends the downcast shaft is heated nearly to the temperature of the workings on its passage through the air-courses and along the working faces , and when it reaches the upcast shaft it has a temperature which is nearly constant if the workings are extensive .
The temperature of the workings increases with their depth from the surface : thus , speaking generally , it is 55 ' at 50 fathoms , 60 ' at 100 , 65 ' at 150 , / 0 at 200 , and so on* .
Now , natural ventilation ceases when the temperature at the surface is the same as that in the workings , and , moreover , as the temperature at the surface rises above that point there is an increasing resistance to artificial ventilation .
The amount of the force which produces natural ventilation is still further modified by the changes in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere .
' For instance , if the tension of aqueous vapour in the air is less than that due to the temperature , water will be evaporated in a wet downcast shaft , and the air will not be able to rise in temperature as it descends , and may be actually much colder at the bottom than at the top of the shaft .
These considerations will show why shallow mines are much less easily ventilated , and also much more affected by surface temperature than deep ones .
Whatever be the artificial means adopted for producing ventilation at any mine , the quantity of air passing through the workings must vary with every variation of the natural force , unless the artificial power be changed at the same time .
It follows , therefore , that if there be no means for ascertaining what is the actual quantity of air supplied to the workings at every instantf , a slight decrease , sufficient to bring the colliery into a dangerous state , may take place without being noticed .

1 The Select Committees on Accidents in Mines , 1835 and 1852 , were aware o is , and were anxious to introduce instruments whereby a constant check might be kep over the ventilation .
304 Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion [ Apr. 18 , The first intimation in such a case is the fouling of the currents ; the artificial power may then he increased and the crisis passed without accident , but if an explosion takes place there is no trace of its cause discoverable .
One example of an explosion which happened under these circumstances may not be out of place .
It occurred in winter .
The temperature of the air rose for two days in succession to a higher point than it had reached for a considerable time before .
On the second day , when natural ventilation would cease in many shallow mines and become sluggish m deeper ones , an explosion took place hy which many men were killed .
After the accident the Inspector for the district visited the mine ; he described it as having strong natural ventilation , and looked upon the explosion as a mystery .
It so happens , however , that for more than three months afterwards the temperature at the surface only reached the point which was observed on the day of the explosion on two occasions\#151 ; once at midnight three days after the accident , and once on the thirty-second day after it .
It is therefore very improbable that the Inspector saw the mine in at all the same state of ventilation as that which had prevailed at the time of the explosion , and hence his description of the phenomena .
This explosion and some others like it are marked by triangles on our diagrams .
There are two groups of accidents during the year 1870 , one between the 10th and 14th of February , the other at the end of December , both of which occurred when the temperature was abnormally low , and the atmospherical pressure high and steady .
One of these accidents ( that on February 14th in South Wales , whereby thirty men were killed ) was traced to the escape of gas from a forty-acre goaf , in which it had been most injudiciously pent up until it attained so great a tension that it forced its way through the barriers into one of the air-courses , where it was ignited .
The others are probably ascribable to the so-called " sharpness " of the fire when ventilation is very active .
Under ordinary circumstances , in the lower parts of small accumulations of explosive mixtures , there is a stratum of air containing less gas than is requisite to make it explosive ; and when the miner slowly raises his candle into this stratum , shading all the flame excepting the very top with his hand , he is warned , by the increasing size of the " cap " ( the blue flame of the gas seen on the top of the candle-flame ) , that there is an explosive mixture above .
When the air in the mine becomes very pure this stratum disappears in many cases ; there is no longer a space between the pure air , in which fire-damp cannot be distinguished , and the explosive mixture above , and the gas is then called " sharp , " because it ignites without warning when a candle is raised into it .
It appears to us , in conclusion , that the evidence we submit fairly justifies the view that meteorological changes are the proximate causes of a large majority of the accidents .
It will be remembered , as Mr. Dobson has observed , that the records " contain no account of cases like that of *0Y*t 1872 ] between Explosions in Collieries and Weather .
305 Jarrow in 1839 , where mines have been filled with gas during stormy weather , and explosions have been prevented .
Whether , therefore , the barometer falls or the temperature rises it is absolutely necessary to keep a most careful watch over the amount of air passing through the workings , in order to prevent the formation of dangerous accumulations of explosive mixtures of air and fire-damp in all mines in which the margin between danger and safety is very small .
In a letter to the South-Shields Committee in 1843 , George Stephenson said , referring to explosions , " Generally speaking , there has been some fault in the ventilation of the mines when accidents have occurred.53 A similar opinion was expressed by most of the gentlemen who were consulted when at the beginning of the year 1868 the Meteorological Committee proposed to send telegraphic intelligence of storms to colliery proprietors .
The one cry , whether we look to security against explosion , or to affording to miners an atmosphere which is respirable without injury to health , is more air .
EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE* The dark line is the curve of the barometer , the faint line that of the thermometer at the Observatory of Stonyhurst , near Preston , taken , from the continuous records for the years 1868 , 1869 , 1870 .
The explosions which are apparently due to a fall of the barometer are shown by squares .
The explosions which are apparently due to a rise of the thermometer are shown by circles .
The explosions which are apparently not caused by either agency are shown by triangles .
The bar across the symbol for an explosion indicates that it was fatal .
Sundays are marked by a line near the base of the diagram .
The districts in which the respective explosions occurred are indicated by figures , the explanation of which is as follows :\#151 ; 1 .
