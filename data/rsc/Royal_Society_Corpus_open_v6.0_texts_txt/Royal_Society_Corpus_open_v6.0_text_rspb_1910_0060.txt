" It also differs from many Mycetozoa in growing in strong sunlight.* It would be of interest to examine in this way the rudimentary organisms which at present occupy an undefined position between the two great divisions of living matter .
If protoplasm is identically the same in animal and vegetable cells the principle of life for each must be the power of determining its activity so that as a result the charge of one becomes negative and the other positive .
It is also possible that the protoplasm itself may not be the same , and that the characteristic electrical charge is obtained not by separation within the cell but by selective absorption from without , so that the protoplasmic cell-content cannot be regarded as quite the same in the two cases .
In conclusion I wish to express my indebtedness to my colleague , Prof. H. J. Hutchens , for most useful advice .

) Numerous investigators have shown that many species of yeast which ordinarily do not ferment galactose , readily acquire that property when cultivated in a medium containing that sugar .
The present communication briefly describes experiments which have been made with living yeast in this way , and with the juice obtained from this yeast .
Experiments are also proceeding with yeast " killed " by acetone and other reagents ( zymin ) , and it is hoped when these are complete to give a more detailed account of the whole investigation in a future paper .
Pure cultures of S. Carlsberg I have been used throughout these experiments .
The medium employed for " training " the yeast consisted of yeast water to which was added 20 per cent , of hydrolysed lactose and 0T5 per cent , of K2HP04 .

Fermentation of [ July 18 , Kahlbaum 's galactose was used and the last traces of glucose removed by fermentation with ordinary brewers ' yeast .
The experiments were all carried out at 25 ' , those with yeast-juice being performed in the presence of toluene .
I. Action of Untrained S. Carlsberg I on Galactose and Glucose .
For this experiment wort cultures were employed and quantities of 1 gramme of the yeast were incubated with solutions of galactose and glucose and with water , the volume being the same in each case .
The galactose was not fermented at all .

Fermentation of Galactose by Yeast-juice .
The juice was obtained from S. Carlsberg I cultivated in the medium described above .
The yeast was well washed with water and then ground in the usual manner .
Experiment 12.\#151 ; Two quantities of 20 c.c. juice , to one of which 1 gramme of galactose had been added , were incubated at 25 ' in presence of toluene .
Experiment 13.\#151 ; Three quantities of 25 c.c. of a different juice were incubated as above ; to one was added 2 grammes galactose , to the second 2 grammes glucose , and to the third 1 c.c. HaO .

Experiment 14.\#151 ; Two quantities of 25 c.c. of the same yeast-juice as used in Experiment 13 were incubated with 2 grammes galactose and 2 grammes glucose respectively in presence of toluene .
The initial rate of the galactose solution was higher than that of the glucose , but the total volume of gas evolved was slightly greater in the case of glucose .
Fermentation had ceased in both cases after 19 hours .

Fermentation of [ July 18 , Y. Fermentation of Galactose by Yeast-juice in presence of Phosphate .
Relation of extra Carbon Dioxide evolved to Phosphate added .
The addition of phosphate to a fermenting mixture of galactose and yeast-juice produces an acceleration in the rate , and an extra amount of carbon dioxide is evolved which is equivalent to the phosphate added .
As in the case of glucose , the phosphate is converted into an organic compound which cannot be precipitated with magnesium citrate mixture .
The compound formed can be isolated in the form of its lead salt as described by Young for glucose.* The extra carbon dioxide was evolved much more rapidly in the case of glucose than with galactose with the particular sample of juice employed .
Experiment 15.\#151 ; Two quantities of 25 c.c. yeast-juice were incubated with 1 gramme of the sugar under investigation until a constant rate was obtained and 2*5 c.c. of a 0*3 molecular solution of sodium phosphate then added to each .

649 The phosphate added was equivalent to 16-7 c.c. of CO2 at N.T.P. in the ratio NasHPC^ : CO2 .
The phenomena observed with galactose are therefore precisely the same as those exhibited by glucose .
YI .
Formation of an Organic Phosphate .
25 c.c. of juice + 2 grammes galactose were incubated and phosphate added in small quantities until no further acceleration could be produced .
When the rate had fallen to its original value , the free phosphate in the boiled and filtered liquid was estimated .
Free phosphate found was equivalent to ... ... .
0T400 gramme Mg2P207 .
The phosphate added corresponded to ... ... ... .
0*3953 " " Hence phosphate equivalent to 0*2553 gramme Mg2p207 has been converted into a form not precipitable by magnesium citrate mixture .
The constitution and properties of this compound are under investigation .
VII .
Fermentation of Galactose by Yeast-juice in Presence of Arsenate .
As with glucose the addition of small quantities of sodium arsenate to a fermenting mixture of galactose and yeast-juice produces an acceleration , but hitherto it has only been found possible to double the rate in this way .
Conclusions .
1 .
The statement by various workers that some yeaBts can be trained to ferment galactose by cultivation in a medium containing that sugar , has been confirmed .
2 .
Such a trained yeast yields a juice capable of fermenting galactose .
3 .
A fermenting mixture of yeast-juice and galactose reacts with phosphate in a similar manner to yeast-juice and glucose .
The rate is accelerated , an extra amount of CO2 , equivalent to the phosphate added , is evolved and the rate then again becomes normal .
The phosphate is converted into an organic compound not precipitable by magnesium* citrate mixture .
4 .
The fermentation of galactose by yeast-juice is also accelerated by the addition of small quantities of sodium arsenate .
