" On the Examination for Colour of Cases of Tobacco Scotoma , and of Abnormal Colour Blindness .
" By Captain W. de W. Abney , C.B. , R.E. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Received April 29 , 1891 .
The following cases were submitted to the Colour Vision Committee , and it was thought desirable that the results of the examination should be communicated to the Royal Society .

2 L 492 Capt. W. de W. Abney .
Examination for [ May 14 , The examination of these three cases was conducted at different times , the first partially in the presence of the Colour Vision Committee by Mr. Nettle ship , and the two last , and part of the examination of the first , at different times , in my laboratory , with the assistance of Mr. Nettleship .
In all three cases the examination made was an ability to distinguish colour , luminosity of the different parts of the spectrum , and total sensation of light ; and , in addition , in the first case , to range of colour sensation on the retina .
Case I.\#151 ; This patient , Alfred C. , aged 36 , a traveller , was suffering from rather severe tobacco amblyopia , and was brought to the Committee by Mr. Nettleship .
The scotoma was a very marked one , and the loss of colour sensation most complete .
Mr. Nettleship has kindly added the following remarks on the case :\#151 ; His acuteness of vision was with R. and with L. He smoked half-an-ounce of " shag " daily and drank about four pints of beer .
His sight had been failing for about two months .
As is common in early stages of this disease , the ophthalmoscope revealed no decided changes at the optic discs .
He was tested at the Royal Institution by Mr. Nettleship , in the presence of the Committee , with the following results:\#151 ; He passed the test of the Holmgren wools satisfactorily , proving that the usual vision was normal for colour .
I had prepared small pellets of moulder 's clay , each weighing 4 grains , and about \ inch in diameter , and had had sets coloured with the same colours as those of the Holmgren wools .
C. was told to pick out the blues , reds , and greens .
The blue pellets he picked out without fail , and he never made the least mistake in his choice , but he failed entirely to distinguish the greens or reds , mistaking them for drabs and greys , which were amongst the pellets .
VThen told to look away some 20 ' from the slab on which the pellets were placed , he at once saw all the colours , but directly he turned his eyes to pick them out , all colour perception , except for blue , disappeared .
This test indicated that he had lost all perception of green and red in the central part of the eye .
He was next tested with small discs of different colours by Mr. Nettleship , keeping his eye fixed on a given point , and* the loss of colour sensation for all except blue , and perhaps a little yellow , in the central part of the eye , was at once made apparent ; the blue he would distinguish with the greatest facility , and the sensation was apparently as strong as in normal eyesight .
A further test was made by Mr. Nettleship with coloured lights to imitate signal lights , and he named a brilliant red light , and an equally brilliant green light , when side by side , both as white ( see also p. 85 ) .
This man attended at my laboratory , at the meeting of the Committee on Colour Vision , with Mr. Nettleship , and he was tested with 1891.J Colour of Cases of lobacco , Sfc .
493 the colour-patch apparatus described in " Colour Photometry , " in the ' Philosophical Transactions , ' 1886 , by General Festing and myself .
The objects first in view were to test his perception of the spectrum colours , and then his retinal field colour perception for the same .
A template was cut out after the manner described by General Festing and myself in the second part of " Colour Photometry " ( \#163 ; Phil. Trans. , ' 1889 ) , of such a shape that all the spectrum lying between X 4600 and X 6600 was reduced to equal luminosity when it was rotated in front of the spectrum .
Diaphragms containing holes of different sizes were placed in front of the last prism , and thus a round spot of monochromatic light of the same luminosity was produced upon the screen when a slit was passed through the spectrum .
From the red end to X5270 he called the whole of the colours white , and from that point he began to see blue , called the colours bluish and blue .
When the full illumination for all the colours was used , the same results were obtained .
From this examination it would appear that he was totally deprived of the sensation of any colour except of blue .
A subsequent examination of his perception of the luminosity of different rays , however , has to be taken into account , for in the first examination he had no light of pure white with which to compare the colours .

Examination for [ May 14 , placed in juxtaposition to the colour , and the results were slightly different .
The table ( p. 493 ) gives his luminosity measures .
Col. I is the empyric scale number , II is the wave-length , III the luminosity of the colour to the normal eye , IY the luminosity to C , and V the ratios of III to IY .
In the diagram , his luminosity curve X is shown , its area being 1400 against 1650 for the .
normal eye .
As will be shown , his perception of light is only two-thirds of that of the normal eye ; hence 1891 .
] Colour of Cases of Tobacco Scotoma , Sfc .
his area of luminosity should be 1100 .
As it is 1400 , the ordinates of the above curve should be multiplied by 0'8 , to compare with that of the normal eye .
It should be mentioned that his matches of luminosity were made without any hesitation , and were concordant for each observation , which is not to be wondered at , as the matches , except at the blue end , were practically matching shades of black to white .
From the foregoing , it will be seen that the white which 0 .
sees as white is the same as the D sodium light , and that the red he says is yellowish .
The mixture of this yellowish-white with the blue apparent makes white at A , 5430 .
He sees a little blue in the spectrum colour at A. 5720 , so it must be taken that at that point of the spectrum he begins to see colour , a point which is considerably lower than that given by his preliminary examination of the spectrum colour , and due , no doubt , to the fact that the white light used by the comparison light was that of the positive pole of the .
electric light .
It seems probable that what C. called yellowish was really a sensation of white mixed with a very small quantity of red sensation ( as he saw no yellow in the orange , in which that colour would be most easily distinguished on account of its luminosity ) , and red light , when strongly diluted with white light , to the normal eye appears slightly orange .
- Subsequently C. was tested for the illuminating value of white light compared with my own and that of Mr. Nettleship .
The apparatus used in this case ( fig. 2 ) was , I believe , somewhat on the principle of Dr. Forster 's photometer , with which I was unacquainted before I made the instrument .
It is made as follows:\#151 ; 496 Capt. W. de W. Abney .
Examination for [ May 14 E is a small tube for the eye to look down into a box 4 feet long .
G is an aperture in the side of the box covered with ground glass ; L is a gas-light ; A rotating sectors which can be opened and closed at will ; M a mirror to reflect the light on to a card ( which can be changed at will , and on which are one or more black spots ) slipping into a slot S from the top of the box .
E is so arranged that the whole 1 of the card can be viewed .
The observer places his eye at E , and the sectors , which at first are closed , are gradually opened until the observer can see that there are black spots on a white ground .
The angle of the aperture of the sector is noted .
Each eye is tested .
In this case my own right eye , agreeing with that of Mr. Nettle-ship , was used as the standard , since it was with that that the normal luminosity curve was originally made .

^ I Case II.\#151 ; The next two subjects are brothers ( Alfred and William P. , indicated below as P and Q ) , whose colour perception is monochromatic .
Mr. Nettleship had previously tested them with wools , and the matches they made , such as matching yellow with blue , made it evident that their colour vision was very abnormal .
The defect is not due to active disease , but they were born with it .
They snffer from amblyopia .
These cases were published as cases of " Day-blindness with Colour-blindness , " by Mr. Hettleship , in the ' St. Thomas 's Hospital Reports , ' 1880 ( vol. 10 ) .
Testing them with the spectrum , they made most extraordinary mistakes , calling blue , red ; red , green or blue .
On cross-examination , it seems that they only distinguish colour by its luminosity ; they always explain that one colour is lighter or darker than another ; evidently their colour names are founded on the observation of what is told them as to the different colours , and not from any real knowledge of them .
The next examination was to get their luminosity curve of the electric light spectrum , and this they did with the very greatest ease .
Their readings for the same colour were occasionally a little erratic , differing as much as 5 per cent , from one another , but , by taking the means , their curves come out very concordantly Practically , the curves of the two brothers are identical , the means not differing 2 per cent , from one another at any part of the spectrum ; hence it is unnecessary to give more than one of them .
It should be mentioned that both brothers could just catch a glimpse of the red line of lithium when the spectrum of the vapour was on the focussing j screen of the apparatus .

15 15 Wb may take it that P 's right eye has the same appreciation of light as the standard , and his left 1'5 times that of the standard .
Q is 1 6 times that of the standard with both eyes .
The luminosity curves were taken with both eyes open .
The curve is very remarkable , showing an intense excitement by the blue rays of the spectrum , the whole of which appears of one olour to both brothers .
The maximum luminosity is about E , but 1891 .
] Colour of Cases of Tobacco , Sj-c .
the place of the greatest difference in degree of luminosity , compared with the normal , is near F , where it is more than eight times more luminous than the normal eye .
The area of their luminosity curve is 1800 ; that of the normal eye being 1650 .
If we take their appreciation of light as being 1*5 that of the standard , their luminosity curve should be 1650 by 1*5 or 2475 .
Theirs is 1800 as measured , the ordinates of their curve should therefore be multiplically T37 for a strict comparison with that of the normal eye .
We may therefore take it that near F their sensation of light is 1F83 times that of the normal eye .
In the three patients we have cases of abnormal vision , one in which practically the only sensations in the central part of the eye are white and blue , and in the other two there is only one sensation .
In these last two cases we have apparently a curve of the fundamental sensation , since it must be the same as the luminosity curve , and it appears to agree with that found by Koenig .
In regard to Alfred C. , it should be remarked that he begins to feel the blue sensation in the spectrum near the point where Koenig places its origin .

On Four Cases of Colour Blindness Examined for the Colour Vision Committee .
Case III.\#151 ; The next case , W. S. , is one of progressive atrophy of both eyes .
When tested with spectrum colours\#151 ; a patch of white light being placed in juxtaposition with the colour\#151 ; it was found that he was absolutely blind to colour from 26-75 ( \ , 4733 ) on the scale of the spectrum to the termination of the red of his spectrum , which was close to 63 on the scale ( X 7082 ) .
Above scale No. 26-75 W. S. saw blue , and his spectrum was continued normally in the violet .
Mr. Nettleship has promised to furnish a chart of his retina .
His luminosity curve ( fig. 4 ) was made without any difficulty , and , compared with my own , is slightly deficient , from the red to the yellow , but his perception of luminosity increases as the blue is approached .
The following is the table applying to his curve of luminosity : 500 Capt. W. de W. Abney .

Case V* This was a remarkable ease , which Mr. Hettleship had mentioned to the Committee .
He had stated that this lady , N. W. , mistook blue for red , and it was with some curiosity that this case was examined .
Her first examination was as to colour sense with the spectrum colours , a patch of mono-chromatic light being placed in juxtaposition with an equal patch of white light .
At 62*5 ( \ 6890 ) of the scale the red of the spectrum disappeared .

From 48 on the scale she described the colour as green till quite sharply at 31*5 ( X 4905 ) .
In the blue she again began to see grey ; the grey at this end of the spectrum , and also of the white patch , she called brownish-grey .

Examination for [ May 14 This name must evidently have been a mental distinction , as she described the red end and the white as grey only , and not brown-grey ; and , indeed , she was tried again over that part of the spectrum and adhered to the previous naming .
It would appear to be due to the low luminosity which made the grey appear brownish to her , and not to any actual difference in hue .
Her curve of luminosity in the spectrum was next taken , and her readings are given in the table .
The curve is shown in fig. 5 .
The shaded band beneath it applies to her curve .
My own readings were 1/ 1'375 of the normal curve as shown in the diagram .
The extinction of a gas-light , in my own case and that of Mr. Nettleship , was 130,5 .
That of N. W.was 16 ' , showing that her final perception of light was 13*5/ 16 of what we may call the normal .
An endeavour was made to form a series of colour equations with her eyesight by placing three slits in different parts of the spectrum , but without success , although a match with white was made in two positions .
One slit was placed in the orange-red at about 52 of the scale , another at E , and the third at G , and white light was formed , though her match was so erratic that it was useless to measure the apertures .
When the slit in the violet was covered up , a white patch being alongside as a comparison , she called the mixture of red and green ' ' brownish-green ; " when the slit in the red was covered she called the mixed light of green and violet " green ; " and when the green slit was covered up she cailed the purple colour a " different kind of brown .
" When the first slit was moved into the red near the lithium line she .
called the colours " green , " whenever the green slot was uncovered .
A piece of signal-red glass ( London , Brighton , and South Coast Railway ) was placed in the white reflected beam , forming a red patch , and a patch of the blue scale at Ho. 30*5 ( X 4862 ) was placed alongside , and she matched them in luminosity and in colour .
( The dominant colour of the signal glass in question was X 6220 .
) She finally was tested with colour discs:\#151 ; One being in red with dominant wave-length . .

To make white she required 130 G-l-113 R + 117 U = 72 W+288 B ( corrected ) .
She was then tried with the blue and green discs alone and made a match\#151 ; 258 XT +102 G == 65 W+295 B ( corrected ) .
An attempt was made to match with the green and red discs alone , but this failed .

She matched the red disc alone with black and white , and also the blue disc alone\#151 ; 360 R = 56 W + 304 B ( corrected ) , 360 U = 60 W -(-300 B ( corrected ) .
With any prpportion of R and IT mixed together she matched a grey of approximately the same intensity as above , as it might be supposed she would from the last two equations .
506 Capt. W. de W. Abney .
Examination for [ May 14 Taking the intensity curve of the light reflected from the red it was found to contain a great deal of the part of the spectrum which she called brownish , viz. , from 53'5 to 48 on the scale , whereas the blue reflected a trifle of this portion of the spectrum , as did also the green , and this may account for her making a match to grey of U and G , and not of R and G , but it is hard to see why she matched U alone and also R with the grey .
Reviewing the case , it seems that any perception of colour is very small , and that the sensations are green and red , together with white .
Experiments which I have described in my book on " Colour Measurements and Mixture , " 1891 , show that a large proportion of colour may he mixed with white without being perceived , but this colour so hidden has still the capability of neutralising a certain quantity of the complementary colour thrown on the white , which , by itself , would not be masked by the white .
It would seem then that in H " , W. 's case the two colours perceived were very much diluted , and at parts of the spectrum so diluted as not to be perceived , but that the latent colour , if it may be so called , has the power of forming a grey with the green which she sees more strongly .
Case VI.\#151 ; -This case is that of Miss W. , who was brought before the Committee by Dr. Lindsay Johnson , on April 29 .
The right eye was apparently normal for colour , but with the other she saw nothing but shades of white .
Miss W. , it appears , has had a slight stroke of paralysis , which affected her left side , and subsequently she discovered that colour sensation in the left eye had disappeared .
Mr. Brudenell Carter , the day after the meeting of the Committee , examined her and pronounced hers to be a case of atrophy of the optic nerve .
I examined her with the spectrum colours on the 5th May , and found her left eye totally blind to every colour , though her perception of light was very fair .
She had very little difficulty in comparing the luminosity of the most brilliant spectrum colours with the white patch of light placed alongside them .
In making the measurements she experienced a certain amount of fatigue , but , by resting the eye for short intervals , her readings were very constant .
The following is the table of her readings:\#151 ; 1891 .

Her light perception extended further into the violet ( as white ) beyond this point , as the subsequent measures show conclusively .
It seemed that it would be interesting to examine her eye for the extinction of light by the same method as that described in my recent paper .

2 m 508 Examination of Cases of Tobacco Scotoma , fyc .
[ May 14 The orange sodium light of the spectrum was thrown on the apparatus therein described , of a luminosity of an amyl lamp 1 foot off , and the slit giving this brightness remained unchanged through-out the examination , and was moved through the spectrum till a position was reached where all light was just extinguished .
Her perception of the point of extinction was very acute .
Rotating sectors were placed in front of the apparatus , as described in the paper referred to , set at different angles , so that the amount of reduction of the luminosity of the spectrum was known at once .

At 57'9 the luminosity of the spectrum is 0'22 that at the D line , and as the light on the screen at the end of aperture is 1/ 620 that falling on the instrument originally , it follows that the extinction to myself was when the light of 57*9 ( A. 6510 ) was 0-22/ 620 = 0'000355 of an amyl lamp placed at 1 foot from the screen .
These details are given to show that the newer instrument used in these tests gives the same results as the older one , for with the latter it was 0-000350 .
The place in the spectrum where Miss W. last perceives light is the same as my own .
The luminosity which is invisible to her is when 1-45/ 100,000 of an amyl lamp illuminates a screen 1 foot off .
At D if 71/ 100,000 of an amyl lamp illuminated a screen l foot off it is invisible to her .
With my own vision if the screen be illuminated with 7/ 100,000 of the same light it just becomes invisible .
There is therefore a marked difference between the two sights as regarding initial perception of light .
