] In an elephant three weeks old , the membrana tympani was of an oval form , 1 inch long , and 1 -broad .
The muscular fibres lie upon its inner surface , and terminate by an attachment to the point and two sides of the malleus , so that one portion of the fibres ; is short , and the other more than double their length .
From this structure the elephant cannot adapt its ear to musical sounds in the same manner the human ear does ; but in Sir Everard 's opinion , it is enabled by the long fibres to hear sounds at a great distance .
In regard to musical sounds , high notes scarcely excite its attention , but it listens to the lower ones with apparent satisfaction .
In neat cattle , and in the deer , the membrana tympani is oval , and the structure approximates to that in the elephant .
In the horse , the hare , and the cat , the handle of the malleus lies in the middle line , so that the fibres on the two sides are equal , and the organ appears similarly constructed in the whole of the feline tribe ,
