" By H. N. Moseley , Naturalist to the Expedition .
( Published by permission of the Dords of the Admiralty .

The following Report is to be regarded as merely preliminary , and will be followed by a full account of the corals dredged by the { Challenger , ' which can be prepared only after the termination of the present voyage .
Many : specimens have been sent home for greater security , and are thus not available for comparison .
Moreover , in the case of corals , it is impossible to determine , with any accuracy , specific relations without making comparisons with museum collections , which , of course , has been impossible in the present instance .
^ The list of corals obtained here given has been made as accurate as circumstances would permit .
The amount of corals obtained by the Challenger in deep water has been small , considering the very large number ; of dredgings which have been made .
Corals have been yielded y only about forty-eight of the , numerous dredgings and trawlings .
Of Corals dredged by H.M.S. c / 545 these forty-eight hauls , twenty-five were made in 1873 , thirteen in 1874 , and ten in 1875 .
The much larger proportion of coral-yielding hauls obtained in the earlier part of the cruise is no doubt partly due to the fact that the dredge was then most frequently made use of , whereas subsequently the trawl has been almost exclusively employed , since it yields so much better general results .
The majority of deep-sea corals being simple and imbedded often partly in the mud , are more readily gathered by the dredge .
It is remarkable , however , that the trawl does bring up sometimes abundantly such small discoid forms as Fungia symmetrica ; and one of the best hauls of corals obtained was made with the trawl .
It was that which yielded , on Sept. 26th , 1874 , between the Ke Islands and the Banda group , in 129 fathoms , two most beautiful new species of Stephanophyllia , a very large new species of a new trochus , besides several simple Eupsamm and Caryophylliince .
The following is a list of the corals obtained from depths of 50 fathoms and upwards , with a statement of all the various localities and depths at which each form has occurred .

Notes on the Corals enumerated in the foregoing List .
Caryophyllia clavus ( Scacchi ) .
Professor Martin Duncan ( Ann. and Mag. Not .
Hist. 1870 , vol. v. 4th ser. p. 289 ) has remarked on the wide variation displayed by this species , and , after an examination of a long series of specimens , has concluded that C. clavus , C. Smithii , C. cyathus , and C. borealis are to be regarded as varieties of one and the same species , for which the name C. clavus is adopted by him in his final description of the corals dredged by H.M.S. ' Porcupine .
' Many varieties of this form have been obtained by the ' Challenger ; ' but the series obtained in each separate locality have been remarkably uniform , showing a similarity of variation produced in the species by the action of certain external conditions .
This fact has been found to hold good , not only in the case of phyllici clavus but also in that of Deltocyathus Agassizii and Fungia symmetrica , as will be subsequently described .
As instances may be cited the two following hauls of C. clavus:\#151 ; On July 10 , 1873 , in the neighbourhood of the Azores , in lat. 37 ' 24 ' N. , long .
25 ' 13 ' W. , about thirty specimens of the coral were obtained from 1000 fathoms .
Many of them were in the fresh condition with the soft parts uninjured .
The corals were all sharply conical , with narrow , pointed , unattached bases , and all uniformly curved .
They were from a bottom of fine mud , where only very small particles are present for the attachment of the young coral .
On dredging off the island of Eayal in the Azores in a depth of 50 fathoms , another series of C. clavus was obtained .
Here the bottom was composed of irregular masses made up of a coarse volcanic sand cemented by Serpula-tvibes .
The adult Caryophyllias were attached to Mr. H. N. Moseley on true these masses by broad bases , and were all remarkably small , no doubt from the unfavourable condition in which they existed on a volcanic bottom .
The largest of the series of 30 specimens of the curved variety of C. clavus measured 2 centims. in height .
The soft parts of the animals were transparent and almost colourless .
Acanthocyathus , sp. Obtained off Kadavu , Fiji Islands , August 3 , 1874 , in 210 fathoms .
The specimen appears to be closely allied to A. Grayi as described by Milne-Edwards* .
It differs in being attached , not free ; but the pedicle of attachment is very fine .
A. Grayi has its lateral costae provided with three or four spines , very strong , horizontal , and compact .
In the present specimen the spines are developed only on one of the lateral costae , and indicated by indentations on the other .
The calicle is oval in horizontal section , as in A. Grayi .
Three species of Acanthocyathus have been described , viz. A. Grayi , recent , locality unknown ; A. Has-tingsce , of Miocene age , from Malta ( M.-Edw .
\amp ; H. , 1 .
c. ) ; and A. sjginiger , recent , from Japan , lately described by Saville Kent f. Trochocyathus coron ( Pourt .
) .
The corallum is white .
It is free , but with a small scar of adherence .
It is circular in horizontal section , with a broad flat base , with the plane of which the walls of the calicle , sloping outwards , make an angle of about '60 ' .
At the junction of the wall of the calicle with the base , the base is continued horizontally outwards into twelve stout spines , irregularly beset with small pointed tubercles .
The spines correspond in position with the primary and secondary costae .
There are six systems of septa , and four cycles , with a partial fifth cycle in large specimens .
The septa of the four cycles are complete .
All the septa are exsert .
The primary , secondary , and tertiary septa bear pali , those of the tertiary septa being the most developed .
The columella is large and composed of a tubercular mass of contorted papillae .
The largest specimen measures 27 millims. in diameter of the calicle , and 32 millims. in extreme diameter between the tips of the exsert septa .
Its extreme height is 20 millims. Five specimens of this coral were obtained off St. Thomas , D. W. I. , in 390 fathoms .
One of the specimens , being very young , was seen to be identical with the young and imperfect specimen figured and described by Count Pourtales as T. coronatus$ .
The young form differs very much from the adult , the spines being scarcely at all developed .
In its tendency to develop a fifth cycle of septa this species conforms with the Trochocyathi arms of MM .
Edwards and Haime , a large number of these * MM .

Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' Challenger.* 551 having five cycles .
The present species is , with the exception of T. philippinensis ( Semper , l. c. p. 21 , tab .
xx .
fig. 16 ) , the only known recent one .
The fossil species range from the Lias to the more recent Tertiary beds .
They are most abundant in Miocene deposits .
Thecocyaihus , sp. Only a single specimen of this genus has been dredged off Banda Island in 60 fathoms .
The specimen is young , with roots only just commencing to be formed .
Deltocyathus Agassizii .
This coral has been dredged on five occasions .
On one occasion thirteen specimens , all dead , were obtained .
On another , July 10 , 1873 , lat. 37 ' 26 ' N. , long .
25 ' 14 ' W. , fifty specimens were procured at one haul , most of them with the soft parts in situ .
An examination of this latter fine series gives the following results .
Although the series obtained near St. Thomas , D. ~W .
I. , appeared to bear out Pourtales 's assertion that the young coralla of this species are cup-shaped , and that they gradually become more saucer-shaped as age advances , such is not the case in the long series of fifty specimens .
In this nearly all the larger specimens have the calicle deeply cup-shaped , whilst the younger ones are flatter , and some of the very small ones ( 2*5 millims. in diameter ) absolutely flat .
Some of the specimens are 14 millims. in diameter , a shade larger than Pourtales 's largest specimen .
The series presents points of well-marked variation from the West-Indian specimens .
The coralla are all characterized by having their primary and secondary septa , as well as their pali , extremely exsert ; but the pali never project so high as the septa to which they are soldered at their bases , as they do in Pourtales 's specimens and in the specimens dredged by the * Challenger ' in the SVest Indies .
No tendency towards the homed variety described by Pourtales is to be seen in the present series .
The coralla , in being more cup-like than specimens hitherto obtained , approach the fossil italicus , as figured in Bronn 's 'Klassen und Ordnungen des Thierreichs ; ' but the difference in the nature of the costae , relied upon as distinctive between the two species by Pourtales , is as well marked here as in all other specimens obtained by us .
Professor Martin Duncan considers D. Agassizii to be not specifically distinct from italicus .
A direct comparison of the long series of specimens of the recent species obtained by us with the fossil form will no doubt determine this point .
Deltocyathus Agassizii ( homed variety of Pourtales ) .
\#166 ; M. de Pourtales , in his description of Deltocyathus , gives an account of varieties of that species in which the primary cost\#174 ; are large and prolonged beyond the margin of the calicle , forming a star .
One mutilated specimen is figured by this author , in which the primary cost\#174 ; are prolonged into horn-like appendages as long as one fourth the 552 Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true diameter of the calicle * .
In sounding off Bermuda , on April 17 , 1873 , in about 200 fathoms , a finely preserved specimen of this variety was obtained , in which the horn-like appendages are developed to a remarkable degree .
The diameter of the calicle is 9 millims. ; the length of the horns or spines is 3*5 millims. , or more than one third the diameter of the calicle .
The horns have no accessory prong as in Pourtales 's specimen ; they are slender , rounded , and taper to a fine point .
A somewhat smaller horn is developed in relation with one of the secondary costae , although the remaining secondary costae show no tendency to elongation .
The horned or stellate variety of D. appeared to Pourtales , at first , to present good specific characters ; but the examination of intermediate forms showed that it was not specifically distinct .
None of these intermediate forms have been obtained by us , the single specimen of the extreme condition of the variety standing quite isolated .
The specimen , which is in most excellent preservation , shows further points of interest .
Thus the pali , as a whole , project more prominently above the general elevation of the septa than is the case in the normal specimens ; and the V or delta formed by the junction of the secondary with the tertiary pali is prominent and conspicuous ; so that in this respect the coral approaches the fossil species D. italicus , as figured by Broun f , more closely than do the normal species ; and there are , further , present around the columella , or , rather , to be considered as forming part of it , six small rounded projections covered with minute spines placed regularly , one opposite each of the secondary septa , as appears to be the case in the fossil form .
In other respects , however , the specimen shows the same differences from D. italicus as are presented by the normal specimens and as are described by Pourtales , viz. the costae are covered with fine sharp granulations , not formed of large grains , and the columella , or rather its central portion , shows no traces of a threefold arrangement .
The corallum is an almost flat disk , much flatter than any other specimens of D. Agassizii obtained by us .
During a visit which I paid to Boston in the spring of 1873 , Count Pourtales informed me that he had obtained a series of specimens of the stellate variety of D. Agassizii from Barbadoes , where all the specimens of this coral seemed to assume this remarkable form .
Deltocyathus magnijtcus , sp. n. This name has been given to a gigantic example of this genus , of which two living specimens were obtained from 126 fathoms between the Ke Islands and the Banda group .
The corallum is quite flattened and discoid .
The inferior surface is slightly concave , the margin of the calicle being somewhat tumid .
The tissue composing the corallum is dense , and of a slight reddish-yellow * Pourtales , l. c. pi .

In the structure of the columella this species differs more strongly than D. Agassizii from D. the columella being very diffuse and finely trabecular , whilst there is no trace of the rows of tubercles on the costa ? .
A fifth cycle of septa is fully developed , whereas the other two species of the genus have only four cycles .
All the septa bear pali disposed in four crowns , the quaternary pali being largest .
The diameter of the corallum is 3 centims. The disk of the living animal was of a light ochre-yellow colour , somewhat reddened towards the margin of the calicle .
The tentacles were white .

The primary and secondary cost\#174 ; are prominent and serrate .
There are six systems of septa and five cycles .
The whole of the septa are exsert , the primary and secondary extremely so , projecting 1 centim. above the margin of the calicle .
The quinary septa unite with the quaternary , the quaternary with the tertiary , and the tertiary with the secondary .
The primary septa remain free throughout their whole course to the columella .

Ceratotrochus platypus , sp. n. The corallum is shallow and circular , with a wide horizontal base , from which the low calicular wall rises abruptly and almost vertically .
A rudimentary peduncle is present attached to a small spiral shell , which , together with the peduncle , becomes buried and obliterated in fully grown specimens .
Primary and secondary costse are slightly marked ; they are simple , without teeth .
There are six systems of septa and five cycles .
The quinary septa are incomplete .
The septa are not fused with one another .
The primary and secondary septa are extremely exsert .
Well-marked pali are present on three of the septa of the larger specimen ; otherwise pali are absent .
The columella is rudimentary .

Note on the four Species of Ceratotrochus above described .
The four species of corals above described are evidently very closely related to one another .
In all the septa are remarkably exsert , in platypus extraordinarily so .
All show traces of original attachment , and are subpedicellate .
In all but C. platypus the costse are armed with short spines or teeth .
In its general form C. platypus recalls Trocho-cyathus coronatus , and it is remarkable that it shows a tendency to Corals dredged by H.M.S. e * 555 develop pali .

Fldbellum alabastrum , sp. n. | The corallum is of a beautiful light pink colour , and is very thin and fragile .
It is wedge-shaped , with an attenuated pedicle .
The lateral costae are sharp , with slightly prominent irregular edges ; they make an angle with one another of from 120 ' to 140 ' .
The external surface of the corallum is covered with a glistening epitheca .
The primary and secondary costae of the faces are almost as well marked as the lateral costae , and appear as irregularly dentate ridges , separated by slight depressions .
The caliele is compressed from side to side in its centre .
Its upper margin is curved , describing about one third of a circle , and is deeply indented , the primary and secondary costae being prolonged into prominent pointed processes .
There are six systems of septa disposed in five cycles .
The primary and secondary septa are , approximately , equal ; the tertiary , quaternary , and quinary successively narrower .
The quaternary septa join the tertiary at a short distance before reaching the columella .
The septa of the fifth cycle are incomplete .
Three perfect specimens obtained had about the same dimensions .
Extreme height of the calicle 5 centims. , longest diameter 6*5 centims. , shortest diameter 3 centims. The complicated , sharply-toothed margin of the calicle forms the most striking feature about this Fldbellum .
Its extreme fragility is remarkable in so large a species .
It appears to belong to the division of the genus Flabella subpedieellata of MM .
Edwards and Haime , and to the subdivision of these characterized by having the cost\#174 ; prominent and ridge-like on the faces , as well as on the lateral margins .
These corals , however , have the fifth cycle of septa complete .
Two of the specimens obtained were alive , and expanded themselves when placed in sea-water , notwithstanding the depth from which they came .
The inner margin of the disk around the elongate mouth presents a regular series of dentations corresponding with the septa , and is of a dark madder colour ; the remainder of the disk is of a pale pink .
The tentacles take origin directly from the septa ; they are of an elongate conical form ; those of the primary and secondary septa are equal in size and placed nearest the mouth and at an equal distance from it , together with the tertiary tentacles , which are somewhat shorter , but are placed in the same row with them .
The tentacles of the fourth and fifth cycles are successively smaller , and placed at successively longer distances from the mouth .
Placed on either side of each tentacle of the fifth cycle , and again somewhat nearer to the margin of the calicle , are a pair of very small tentacles which have no septa developed in correspondence with them .
The number of tentacles is thus ninety-six .
The tentacles are light red in colour .
Between their bases are Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true stripes of yellowish red and pale grey .
This coral was dredged twice i the neighbourhood of the Azores from 1000 fathoms ; five specimen !

* .
Flabellum ajpe , sp. n. The corallum is much compressed at the base , where it forms a shor pedicle , which is attached in one specimen to a minute rolled particle o basalt .
Above the pedicle the walls of the corallum curve outwards , s\lt ; .
as to form a widely open , almost cup-shaped calicle .
The summits o the calicle at the termination of the long axis are a little lower thai those at the termination of the short axis .
The wall of the caliclt presents twelve prominent costal ridges separated by intervening rounded excavations .
The primary ridges are more marked than th\lt ; secondary , and the lateral costae slightly more prominent than the others and continued almost to the apex of the pedicle .
The surface of tht wall and costal ridges is smooth , and covered wTith a glistening epitheca The margin of the calicle is deeply and irregularly dentate , with sharply angular prominences corresponding to the primary and secondary cost\#174 ; .
The septal arrangement is remarkable for its simplicity and symmetry as occurring in a Flabellum .
There are four cycles of septa in six systems , and these are present in every specimen obtained without any irregularity , the systems being all of the same breadth .
The columella is little developed , and composed of scanty outgrowths from the inner ends of the septa .
Extreme height of the largest specimen 2 centims. ; longer axis of the calicle 3*4 centims. , shorter axis 2*3 centims. The mean proportion of the axes of the series is about 100 to 137 .
This FlcibeTlumhas a wide range , having been obtained by us off the coast of-Portugal , and also off Prince-Edward Island in the South Indian Ocean , in 900 and 310 fathoms respectively .
Flabellum angul , sp. n. The corallum is thin and fragile and of a pearly white , covered externally with a glistening pellicular epitheca .
The calicle is vaseshaped , widely open , the diverging walls making with one another an angle of about 110 ' .
A short cylindrical pedicle is present .
The mouth of the calicle is even and pentagonal in outline ; from each angle of the pentagon a stout costal ridge , very slightly dentate , runs down to the pedicle .
Between these costae the wall of the calicle presents five faces , almost flat , but with slightly marked secondary costae .
The septa are in five systems and four cycles ; they consist of extremely fragile laminae covered with granules on their faces .
The septa are complete , except the quaternary , which reach to a very short distance only from the calicular margin .
The columella is well developed and trabecular , formed of outgrowths of .
the inner ends of the septa ; it is deeply Corals dredged by H.M.S. / placed in the calicle , the free vertical margins of the primary and secondary septa extending above it for a considerable height .

Cyathohelia axillaris , ?
A single specimen of this species , broken but quite fresh , was obtained from 825 fathoms , in lat. 0 ' 45 ' S. , long .
126 ' 59 ' E. This very peculiar form was hitherto known only from Japan .
It is quite a new genus amongst deep-sea corals .
Cryptohelia pudica ( ?
) .
Of Cryptohelia Piercii , Pourtales only obtained very small and badly developed specimens .
A large series of specimens of this genus has been dredged by us .
They show great variation ; and , some being evi* dently identical with C. Piercii ( Pourt .
) , others seem to show that this species is merely a dwarfed form of Cryptohelia pudica of Milne-Edwards and Haime , from which our best-developed specimens are apparently indistinguishable .
Eurther , as has already been pointed out by Pour-tales , the genus Endohelia of Milne-Edwards and Haime appears indistinguishable from the genus Cryptohelia , We dredged specimens of an undoubted Cryptohelia , apparently of the same species as our other deep-sea specimens , off Japan in 775 fathoms , in the living condition .
The genus Cryptohelia appears to be a characteristic deep-sea one , with a remarkably wide range , as with most other deep-sea forms .
We have obtained it in the neighbourhood of the Canary Islands and off the Danish West Indies in the Atlantic , 'whilst Pourtales obtained it from off Bahia , off Bahia Honda , and off Sombrero , D. W. I. We further obtained it near the Kermadec Islands in the South-west Pacific and off the coast of Japan .
M.-Edwards 's original specimen was from New Gruinea , and therefore probably not from deep water .
The coral was , however , not met with by the ' Porcupine ' in the Northern Atlantic .

Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true Stephanophyllia complieata and formosissima .
Two species of corals , procured from 126 fathoms in the neighbourhood of the Ke Islands , have been referred to the genus Stephanophyllia Both species are discoid , and have their wall extremely perforate ; ir fact composed merely of finely trabecular tissue .
Two genera of discoid corals , Micrabacia and Stephanophyllia , are given by M.-Edwards and Haime* , which present this peculiarity of having their wall covered wifi minute perforations , so as to be sieve-like in appearance .
The genus Micrabacia is placed amongst the imperforate corals ; whilst nophyllia is considered one of the Eupsammidae .
The differences between the two genera seem difficult to define .
Both are remarkable for having the costae corresponding in position to the interspaces between the septa , and not to the septa themselves .
The present species are placed in the genus Stephanophyllia , because in one species all the septa , excepting the primary , fuse together before reaching the columella ; whilst in the second species a peculiar extreme fusion and contortion of the septa takes place with the advancing age of the coral , which renders it very like Stephanophyllia jlorealis figured by Quenstedt f. The alternation of the costae with the septa , the presence of five cycles of septa , and perforation of the base here occurring are characters common to both genera , Micrabacia and Stephanophyllia .
The two species here described are placed provisionally in the genus Stephanophyllia ; a new genus may have to be formed for them .
They seem to have little or no affinity to the Eupsammidae .
Stephanophyllia c sp. n. The corallum is circular , free , and without trace of adherence ; it has the form of a biconvex lens , the base being very slightly curved , and the upper surface greatly so .
The under surface , or wall , is perforated by rows of oblong holes arranged in regular series along the interspaces between the costae .
The costae are fine ridges covered with small swellings and granules , which radiate out with great regularity from the centre of the basal disk ; they commence in the centre from six very short roots of origin , which immediately bifurcate , thus becoming twelve .
The bifurcation of each of the costal ridges proceeds at successive distances from the centre , until at the margin of the adult coral there are 96 costae present , 16 in each system .
The costae at the margin of the calicle are slightly grooved , showing a tendency to divide again .
The perforations between the costae form about 22 concentrically arranged rows .
The coral is very convex above the septal meshwork , rising in an even curve which culminates at the columella .
There is scarcely any central fossa .
There are six systems of septa and five cycles .
The primary septa are thin straight lamellae with untoothed margins , which proceed * M.-Edw .

Corals dredged by H.M.S. 1 Challenger .
' 559 directly from the periphery to the base of the columella .
At about half their length from the periphery to the centre of the calicle is a notch followed by a sudden rise , which forms thus a distinct palus , from the summit of which the line of the inferior margin of the septum slopes sharply down to the base of the columella .
The secondary septa are also straight thin laminae ; they can be traced in the adult coral no further than for about one third the distance from the periphery to the columella , since they are here covered by the tertiary septa , which , bending over the secondary septa at this point , bring together their upper margins , and , fusing with one another , form stout laminae , which run in a radial direction to join the columella , and are the stoutest and most conspicuous ~ Shows the arrangement of the septa in the adult and young * plicata .
The specimens were taken September 26 , 1874 , in 129 fathoms off the Ke Islands .
A. Adult , diam. T7 centim. B. Young , diam. 6 millims. septa in the coral .
From their point of junction with the secondary septa , the tertiary septa curve outwards towards the primary septa on either side in each system ; and each of them being joined on its side next the primary septa by a curved quaternary septum , curved lines of septal matter are formed which are fused by short , transverse , synapti-cular laminae to the primary septa , at points very near the centres of the I VOL. XXIV .
2 s 560 Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true lengths of each of these .
Thus is brought about the peculiar arrange meant which forms the most striking feature presented by the adult cora !
and which consists in the 'presence around the elongate columella of si symmetrically arranged oval hollow spaces , each of which is \lt ; hy a loop-like lamina , as it were , .
of hard tissue , and bisected longitn dinally by the inner end of the palus of the corresponding primary septm ( see accompanying diagram , p. 559 ) .
In their further course , the tertiary septa are bent from side to side in most remarkable manner , and fusing at successive distances outwards with the shorter quaternary and still shorter quinary septa , which are likewis* extremely undulate in their course , a series of chambers is formed , which chambers are closed at their peripheral ends by processes of synapticula : matter .
The chambers are arranged symmetrically in each system on either side of the secondary septum , and successively decrease in siz( and increase in number from the centre outwards .
The chamber ?
opening all over the coral give it a most remarkable honeycombed appearance .
The columella is an elongate , thin , vertical lamina stretched in line with an opposite pair of primary septa .
At its base it is provided with rootlets , which join the primary and fused tertiary septa .
In a young specimen of this coral , without reference to which the true nature of the complicated structures in the adult could hardly have been determined , the corallum is almost symmetrically biconvex and perfectly circular ; but the columella is elongate , as in the adult .
The columella is papillar rather than laminar , and represents the rooted base of the adult columella .
There are sixty perfect costae present at the margin of the calicle , and the commencement of two more in each system ( i. e. twelve in all ) .
There are twelve concentric rows of perforations in the base .
The septa are not nearly so much contorted as in the adult , and the synapticular junctions between them not being as yet formed , the division of the septal cavities into successive chambers is not apparent as in the adult .
No superficial fusion of the primary with the curved extensions of the tertiary and quaternary septa has as yet taken place ; hence no six-rayed star or flower appears in the centre .
Stout transverse granular projections are present on the upper margins of the septa , the sources of future synapticular connexions .
Only four cycles are complete in each system .
Two members of the fifth cycle are present in each system , and are those nearest the primary septa on each side .
An additional pair of quinary septa is just commencing to grow in each system , and branching off from the peripheral ends of the quaternary septa which are next the secondary , but on that side of them which is nearest the primary , i. e. opposite to the secondary .
A very short branch of the costa belonging to the interspace between the quaternary and secondary septa passes into each interspace formed between these newly grown quinary septa and the quaternary adjoining .
Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' 561 * Dimensions : of an adult specimen\#151 ; extreme diameter 1*7 centim. , extreme height from the summit of the columella to the centre of the base 7 millims. ; of the young specimen\#151 ; extreme diameter 6 millims. , height 3-5 millims. Three adult dead specimens and one living young one were obtained .
In the development of a flower-like series of oval chambers around the elongate columella , this coral most strikingly resembles jlorealis of Quenstedt , which is a fossil of the " White Jura " ( =Oxford Clay ) formation .
The oval chambers here in the first series around the columella are twelve in number , and alternate with twelve in the second series .
In S. complicata , six alternate with six .
In 8 .
jlorealis there appears to be no trace of the bisection of these chambers by the straight primary and secondary septa as in complicata ; but the fossil specimens are , according to Quenstedt , always so much mutilated that their structure can only partially be made out .
Possibly the twelve chambers of S.jlorealis may represent the twelve of complicata , formed by the bisection of the six inner by the primary septa , which might appear as figured in 8 .
jlorealis in much-worn specimens .
Comparison with actual specimens will determine this point .
In 8 .
jlorealis forty-eight septa only are distinguishable ; but it is highly probable that structures so slight as the quinary septa of 8 .
complicata might be indistinguishable in a mutilated fossil .
The coral appears to fall into that division of the Stephanophyllias distinguished by Milne-Edwards as having the secondary septa smaller than the tertiary , and in which the tertiary septa fuse together in front of the secondary , which do not reach the centre .
The coral , in fact , resembles 8 .
a fossil from Ignaberga , Sweden ; but in this coral the columella is rudimentary .
On the other hand , Quenstedt 's 8 .
jlorealis has been supposed by Milne-Edwards to be Turbinolid , and allied to the genus Thecocyathus .
StephanopJiyllia formosissima , sp. n. The corallum is discoid , with the base flat in the centre and slightly curved towards the margin .
It is white and very light and fragile , much more so than in 8 .
complicata , being composed of a fine trabecular network , through which the light penetrates freely , as through a fine sieve , when the coral is held up to the light .
The base is composed of a series of fine , radiating , costal rods connected by transverse trabeculae , which have a general concentric disposition .
The septa are composed , like the remainder of the corallum , of fused trabeculae ; but these are stouter than those composing the base , and more perfectly fused , so as to form , in most regions , continuous plates pierced by rounded perforations .
There are six systems of septa and five cycles .
The upper margins of the septa rise in a curve from points distant a short space from the margin of the calicle , and , ascending to some height above the level of the base , sink down again internally to the wide , oval fossa occupied by the columella .
2 s 2 562 Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true The primary and secondary septa are straight .
Their upper margins lit at a lower level than those of the remaining septa , and are only verj slightly toothed .
The primary septa are free from adherence .
The margins of the tertiary , quaternary , and quinary septa are deeply dentate , the teeth being curved towards the columella .
The quinary , quaternary , and tertiary septa fuse with one another laterally and by their upper margins at successive distances from the periphery of the coralluin , forming six deltoid masses of septa .
The tertiary septa , forming the sides of these deltoid masses , are bent over , sloping away from the primary septa , so that at the apex of the delta the upper margins of these tertiary septa fuse and cover over the inner ends of the secondary septa .
There is no separation of the septal interspaces into chambers , as in florealis , by development of synapticulae ; but the quaternary and quinary septa are more or less bent over above , so as to fuse along part of their upper margins , and roof in the spaces between them .
The septa correspond to the interspaces between the costae .
The columella is a large , oval , spongy mass composed of fine trabeculae .
Measurements of the largest specimens : extreme diameter 3'9 centims. ; extreme height 1*1 centim. Other specimens measure in diameter about 2-5 centims. and 2 centims. This coral was obtained near the Ke Islands together with S. compli-cata , and also found living with Euplectella aspergillum at Cebu , Philippines , in 95 fathoms .
Several living specimens have been preserved in spirit for future examination of the soft parts .
In the living animal the disk is of a madder-red colour , much darker towards the margin of the calicle .
The tentacles are simple and conical ; the inner are white with dark madder tips , and the outer of a light madder colour with vivid emerald-green radial stripes on either side of their bases .
The margin of the mouth is white .
The corallum is conspicuously white , the fleshy coloured parts of the coral not extending to the very edge of the calicle .
A white zone thus sets off the dark-coloured central parts of the coral .
Fungia symmetrica , Pourt .
This species of Pourtales 's has been proved by our dredgings to be one of the most constantly recurring deep-sea animals with a world-wide distribution .
As will be seen by reference to the list of localities , it has been dredged by us 15 times .
It occurs in the North and South Atlantic , near the ice-barrier in the S. Indian Ocean , off the West Indies , in the North and South Pacific Oceans , and amongst the Moluccas .
It has a more extended range in depth than almost any other animal , having been obtained by us in 30 fathoms off Bermuda , and at all intermediate depths down to 2900 fathoms .
Specimens from 2900 fathoms were obtained with the soft parts preserved , and specimens from 2300 fathoms , of which 30 or more were obtained at one haul , were full of ripe ova .
Fungia symmetrica is , further , the only coral which has been as yet obtained Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' * 563 from a greater depth than 1600 fathoms .
This coral occurs , moreover , on all kinds of bottoms\#151 ; on Globigerina-mud in the Atlantic ; amongst growing branched corals ( Madracis asp ) off Bermuda ; on a siliceous bottom , composed almost entirely of diatom-skeletons , in the South Indian Ocean ; and on red clay with manganese nodules in the N. Pacific .
It further sustains a range of temperature of 1 ' C. to 20 ' C. The specimens from great depths are much larger than those from shallow water , and are very delicate and fragile .
Pourtales 's largest specimen measured 1 centim. in diameter .
We have obtained specimens measuring 3 centime , in diameter ; and the specimens from the deep Northern Pacific average 2 centims. in diameter .
The specimens from the diatomaceous-mud bottom were , though large , evidently growing under unfavourable conditions as regards the formation of a corallum , the bottom containing only a trace of lime ; hence their coralla were so fragile that they broke at the slightest touch .
From an examination of the long series of specimens of this coral obtained by us , there seems no doubt of their belonging to one species ; and certain series obtained near Bermuda and the West Indies are undoubtedly identical with F. symmetrica as figured and described by Pourtales .
The larger specimens , however , seem to show close affinities with the Lophoserince .
Pourtales speaks of the near resemblance of F. symmetrica to Cycloseris Tiexagonalis .
Tubipora and Madrepora nasuta , c. f. Dead fragments of these corals were dredged in 200 fathoms off Banda .
They are instructive as showing how shore forms may be washed down into deep water .
Notes on a few Corals obtained from a less depth than 50 fathoms .
Madracis asperula .
i This coral was originally described from Madeira .
Pourtales describes it from west of Portugal in 36 fathoms , and from St. Nicholas Channel in Bahia de Cadiz in 120 fathoms .
The coral occurs in great quantities on a shoal off Bermuda , known as the South-west Bank , in 30 fathoms .
Masses of it came up in the dredge , and a number of specimens on fishing-lines .
The coral was also dredged on the shores of St. Vincent , Cape-Verd Islands , and at Fernando de Noronha .
Flabellum variabile of Semper .
1 In dredging in the Arafura Sea numerous specimens of this species ( which , according to Semper , includes F. , F. Owenii , F. aeuleatum , and F. spinosum of M.-Edwards ) were obtained .
The series shows all stages of the multiplication of this coral by fission as described by Semper * .
Occurring with F. variabile were found Khodopsammia * G-enerationswechsel bei Steinkorallen von 0 .

Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true socialis and B. parallela , which were obtained with variabile by Semper in his dredgings at the Philippines .
The coral-fauna of the Philippines of moderate depths seems thus to extend southwards to the Arafura Sea ; and this is borne out by the fact that in deeper water Stephanophyllia formosissima was obtained near the Ke Islands and also off Cebu , Philippines .
Heliastrcea cavernosa .
Off Barra G-rande , Brazil , two huge masses of this species were brought up by the trawl from 30 fathoms .
The masses , which were of the usual convex form , measured nearly two feet in the diameter of the flat base .
The corals were living .
They were bored by Lithodomi , which , however , were dead .
This is the only certain evidence obtained during our expedition of the existence of massive reef-forming species at so great a depth as 30 fathoms .
Madracis asperula mentioned above is hardly a reef-forming species ; but at the south-west bank , Bermuda , it is in such quantities that it must contribute to reef-formation to a considerable extent .

with ramca by Mr. H. N. Moseley on the true Besides Fungia symmetrica , the genera Flabellum , and Cryptohelia are remarkable , but in a less degree , for their wide bathymetrical range .
Only about 27 genera of corals have as yet been proved to exist in a depth of 250 fathoms and upwards .
A list of these genera is here given ( p. 565 ) , compiled from the reports of Count Pourtales and Prof. Martin Duncan , and from my own notes .
The various depths at which the genera have been obtained are shown in columns .
The letter A represents that the coral was obtained by the U. S. Coast Survey at the stated depth , B that it was dredged by H.M.S. ' Porcupine , ' C by H.M.S. ' Challenger .
' In the last column S. denotes that the genus occurs in Secondary formations , T. in Tertiary beds .
Geographical Distribution .
The extraordinarily wide distribution of Fungia symmetrica has already been referred to .
Cryptohelia pudica occurs off the Canary Islands , off the West Indies , off Bahia , in the South -west Pacific , and off the coast of Japan .
Flabellum apertum occurs off the coast of Portugal and off the Marion Islands in the South-Indian Ocean .
In this respeet deep-sea corals agree with almost all other deep-sea animals\#151 ; the same forms of starfish , sponges , Crustacea , \amp ; c. having turned up in the dredge over and over again in all parts of the world from deep water with tedious reiteration .
Some deep-sea corals , however , appear , as far as our present knowledge goes , to be remarkably limited in distribution , and some groups to be specially developed in particular places .
It is remarkable that Pourtales does not record the occurrence of a single Flabellum amongst the corals obtained by the U. S. Survey .
No Flabellum was obtained in the corresponding region by the ' Challenger .
' One apparently abnormal specimen , here described as Flabellum was obtained not far from Halifax , Nova Scotia , but none in the West-Indian region .
Various species of Flabellum have been dredged by the ' Challenger ' in deep water in all parts of the world , and two species were obtained by the * Porcupine .
' It is further singular that only one Stylasteracean was obtained , and at only one dredging , by the ' Porcupine .
' Pourtales describes seven genera of this group and eleven species obtained from deep water , most of them from 270 fathoms , off Cuba , where this group seems to be especially developed .
We have dredged specimens of the group at least eight times .
A considerable number , however , of the species of deep-sea corals dredged by us have been obtained very seldom indeed and in few specimens , in several cases only one specimen having been obtained .
Thus of Trochocyathus coronatus Pourtales received only one mutilated specimen from off the coast of Florida , whilst we dredged five specimens on one occasion only off St. -Thomas .
Of Ceratotrochus diadema two specimens only have been dredged at two localities in the Atlantic .
Ceratotrochus platypus , C. dis- Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' Challenger567 coides , and C. nobilis have been dredged but once , two specimens o\#163 ; the first of the three having been obtained , and only a single one of each of the others , Ceratotrochus platypus was obtained off the coast of New South Wales ; the other three species of Ceratotrochus in the Atlantic .
These Ceratotrochi appear not to occur in the Pacific , nor in the seas of the East-Indian archipelago and Philippines .
In the deep waters about the Philippines and near the Ke Islands their place seems to be taken by the Stephanophyllias and Platytrochus rubescens and Deltocyathus mag-nijicus .
Families and Genera of Corals occurring in the Deep Sea .
The following is a list of the genera of corals as yet obtained from the deep sea from depths of 50 fathoms and upwards , compiled from Count Pourtales 's and Professor Martin Duncan 's works , and from the preliminary determinations of our own series made by myself , which will , however , I expect , need some modifications hereafter , but not such as very materially to alter the results .

occurs in Secondary formations , 568 On the true Corals dredged by H.M.S. ' Challenger ?
From the foregoing list it will be seen that 17 genera out of 42 obtained hitherto in depths of 50 fathoms and upwards belong to the Turbinolidse ; and if , following Pourtales , we placed with the Turbinolidae the genera Parasmilia , Coelosmilia , and there would be twenty genera of Turbinolidae .
The family next most abundant in genera is that of the Stylasteridae , which has six genera in the list .
Further , twenty-six of the genera in the list are those of simple corals , and only sixteen genera of compound forms .
The excess of the genera of the Turbinolidae is what might be expected , since this is the family which contains most extratropical shallower-water forms , and which may thus be supposed to be best suited to low temperatures at considerable depths .
With regard to the genera and species procured by the ' Challenger , ' it will be remarked that the genera cyathus , Platytrochus , and Ceratotrochus amongst the Turbinolidae are new additions to the deep-sea coral-fauna .
The four species described under the genus Ceratotrochus may give rise to one or two new allied genera .
Amongst the Oculinidae , Cyathohelia is new to the deep sea .
Amongst the Astraeidae the occurrence of a genus of Astraeaceae at 126 fathoms is remarkable and quite exceptional .
The coral is a very small and dwarfed form , of which I have not determined the genus ; it occurs also in the Arafura Sea in 49 fathoms in company with Fldbellum bile and JRhodopsammia parallela and socialis .
Amongst the Eupsam- midae the genus of Stephanophyllia is a new phenomenon , and the two species obtained appear to be of great interest , and likely to throw much light on fossil forms .
On the occurrence of Fossil forms in the Deep-Sea Fauna .
Of the forty-two genera on the list just given twenty occur in the fossil state .
Eight of these occur in Secondary formations , viz. Caryo-phyllia , Bathycyathus , Trochocyathus , Thecocyathus , smilia , Coelosmilia , and Stephanophyllia .
Of these , two extend into the Jura formations , viz. Trochocyathus and Coelosmilia ; the remainder are not known from earlier deposits than the chalk .
The remaining genera of the list are known only from Tertiary formations .
Of these twenty genera , however , thirteen were known before deep-sea dredging commenced , to occur both in the recent and fossil condition , and hence they must occur in not very deep water , whilst some of them , as Caryophyllia and Fla-bellum , occur in very moderate depths .
Seven of the fossil genera , viz. Trochocyathus * , Thecocyathus , Deltocyathus , Platytrochus , , Parasmilia , and Stephanophyllia , have been added to the list of fossil genera , which have survived to the present epoch , by deep-sea dredging .
Of the twenty fossil genera above referred to , thirteen only occur at so great a depth as 250 fathoms , eight are found at 500 fathoms , seven at * Trochocyathus philippensis ( Semper ) , However , occurs at the Philippines in from 15-30 fathoms .
On Observations during the Voyage of ' / 569 1000 fathoms .
Some of the most interesting forms , such as Stephano-phyllia , occur at small depths ( 120 and 92 fathoms ) ; whilst Haplophyllia and Guynia , believed by Pourtales and Duncan to belong to the Eugosa , are from 324 fathoms and 92 fathoms respectively .
The most widely distributed and most abundant deep-sea coral , which extends to nearly twice the depth to which any other coral attains , viz. Fungia symmetrica , belongs to a genus which is not known to occur in the fossil state * .
The whole family of the Stylasteridae , of which six genera occur in the deep water ( one of them , Cryptohelia , being one of the only four genera which extend to a depth of 1500'fathoms , and the only compound coral amongst these ) , is recent only .
No coral in any way allied to the Eugosa has been dredged by the * Challenger .

Preliminary Eeport to Professor Wyville Thomson , F.E.S. , Director of the Civilian Scientific Staff , on Observations made during the earlier part* of the Voyage of H.M.S. * Challenger/ By the late Dr. Eudolf von Willemoes-Suhm , Naturalist to the Expedition .

Eead March 16 .
On our way from England to Lisbon we had continually very bad weather , and could hardly do any thing but put books and instruments into their proper places .
In Lisbon we paid frequent visits to the Museum , the fauna of Setubal ( near the capital ) being particularly interesting , as it is one of the few places in which deep-sea animals go up into shallower water and are accessible to fishermen .
Professor Barboza showed us the Hyalonema which had been got there , and pointed especially to the sharks and Chimaeridse which have been discovered near Lisbon .
On our way to Gibraltar we had some dredgings , but were in the latter place more busy at getting up the catalogue of books and instruments , which since that time has been printed by order of the Admiralty .
We also visited nearly daily the Gibraltar market , without , however , finding any thing that was particularly interesting .
Only when we left this port we got into proper working order ; and I began to examine more especially the worms which were brought up , a class to which I had paid much attention before joining this expedition , more especially the Annelids and Gephyreans .
I made sketches of the former , and was , however , very much astonished to find that they all agreed very much with the genera of shallower water\#151 ; a fact which has since been corroborated by Professor Ehlers 's interesting paper on | * Future comparison of specimens may , however , show a relation between some of the varieties of the species here called F. symmetrica and some Lophoserinse .
