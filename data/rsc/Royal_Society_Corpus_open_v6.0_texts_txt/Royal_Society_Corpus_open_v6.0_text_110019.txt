] After adverting to the discovery of the unattached human ovum in the uterus , and to the formation of the placenta independent of the chorion , the author proceeds to show that the office of the placenta , and when that is wanting , of the chorion , being to supply materials for the growth of the embryo , it varies in structure , and has a peculiar form .
in every genus of animal , and is to be considered as the means employed by Nature to prevent the whole system respecting animals from being thrown into confusion by any two different genera continuing to interbreed with one another , and which cannot take place without a new form of placenta is employed , for which there is no provision .
The author then states that the period of utero-gestation depends upon the structure of the placenta or chorion ; that where they are very vascular it will be short , and where the reverse very long ; and that where the female of one species breeds from the male of another , whose utero-gestation is different , the hybrid is brought forth at the end of the longest period of the utero-gestation of the species concerned .
Sir Everard thinks that the placenta and chorion are instrumental in producing the stimulus , in consequence of which parturition comes on ; for as soon as double circulation takes place in the foetus , which is not till the lungs are perfected , the placenta is so much diminished , that this alone may produce a separation of the placenta and chorion , and expulsion of the young .
The author concludes this paper with a specimen of a new classification of animals , founded upon the variation of structure of the placenta , of which the first class only is given , including animals in which the ovum becomes attached to the womb of the mother .
This class comprises seven orders , distinguished by peculiarities in the structure of the chorion and placenta .
