] The object of the author in this paper is to ascertain the modulus of torsion in different species of wood , and also of metals , deduced from experiments on a large scale , which he conceives will furnish many useful data , applicable to practice by the mechanic and engineer .
Care was taken that the specimens of wood which were the subjects of experiment were sound and dry , and free from any large knots ; and their correct dimensions were ascertained by an improved kind of callipers .
To every specimen two indexes were attached ; one , a few inches from the end , fixed in the clamp or vice , and the other , at a small distanlce from the attachment of the lever , to which the straining power was applied ; and the length of the bar subjected to torsion was estimated by the distance of the points of attachment of the indexes .
A pivot was fixed at the supported end ol the bar , in lieu of its axis .
The author gives the following rule for finding the deflection of a prismatic shaft ; namely , that it is equal to the product of the straining power into the square of the radius by which it acts , and into the length of the shaft , divided by the modulus of torsion into the fourth power of the side of the square shaft .
He then gives a table of the modulus of torsion in different woods , which he finds to vary from about 9000 to 30,000 pounds , and to follow nearly the order of the specific gravity .
In the metals , the modulus of torsion is one sixteenth of the modulus of elasticity .
