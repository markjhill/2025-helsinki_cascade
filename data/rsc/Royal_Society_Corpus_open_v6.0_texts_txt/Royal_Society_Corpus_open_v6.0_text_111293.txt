" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , P.R.S. Received March 13 , 1856 .
The object of the author in the present memoir is chiefly to collect together and put upon record various results useful in the theories of the particular quantics to which they relate .
The tables at the commencement relate to binary quantics , and are a direct sequel to the tables in the author 's second memoir upon Quantics , Phil. Trans. vol. cxlvi .
( 1856 ) .
The definitions and explanations in the next part of the present memoir are given here for the sake of convenience , the further development of the subjects to which they relate being reserved for another occasion .
The remainder of the memoir consists of tables and explanations relating to ternary quadrics and cubics .
