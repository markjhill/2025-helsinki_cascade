In continuation of investigations communicated to the Royal Society in 1879* and 1881 , f on the effect of liigh-tension electricity on the line spectra of metals , I have recently used a more powerful current and larger jar surface than that I formerly employed .
The former work consisted in noting ( 1 ) the lines brightened m passing a spark in a flame charged with metallic vapours , and ( 2 ) the lines brightened on passing from the arc to the spark .
It was found , in the case of iron , that two lines in the visible spectrum at 4924'1 anc 5018-6 , on Rowland 's scale , were greatly enhanced m brightness , and were very important in solar phenomena .
The recent work carries these results into the photographic region .
The result is interesting and important , since seven additional lines have been found to have their brightness enhanced at the highest temperature .
These , as well as the two previously observed , are shown in the following table , which also indicates the behaviour of the lines under different conditions , as observed by Kayser and Rung ( K and R ) and myself ( L ) in the arc , and by Thalen ( T ) and myself in sparks :\#151 ; Lines of Iron which are enhanced in Spark .

476 On the Iron Lines present the Hottest Stars .
Defining the hottest stars as those in which the ultra-violet spectrum is most extended , it is known that absorption is indicated by few lines only .
In these stars iron is practically represented by the enhanced lines alone ; those which build up , for the most part , the arc spectrum are almost or entirely absent .
The intensities of the enhanced lines in some of the hottest stars are shown in toe appended diagram , and , for the sake of comparison , the behaviour of a group of three lines which are among the most marked at lower temperatures , is also indicated .
In addition , the diagram shows the inversion in intensities of the spark and arc lines in the spectrum of a relatively cool star\#151 ; such as a-Orionis .

In the case of low temperature , howwer , iron is represented among the lines in the spectrum , but at the highest temperature all visible indications of its presence seem to have vanished .
This result affords a valuable confirmation of my view , that the arc spectrum of the metallic elements is produced by molecules of different complexities , and it also indicates that the temperature of the hottest stars is sufficient to produce simplifications beyond those which have so far been produced in our laboratories .
