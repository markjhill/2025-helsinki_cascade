\#171 ; On the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
" By G. Gore , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received March 12 , 1878.* Read March 28 .
In the " Philosophical Magazine , " January , 1857,1 published an account of an investigation on the " Development of Dynamic Electricity by the Immersion of unequally-heated Metals in Liquids , ' and observed that , if we heat the upper end of a column of an electrically conducting liquid , the two ends of the column being bounded by plates of the same metal , an upward current of electricity is usually produced if the liquid has an acid reaction , and a downward one if it is alkaline ; and I showed , in a brief manner , that this statement was true in various instances , provided chemical action was excluded .
This latter condition was , in many cases , largely secured by employmg platinum plates , and avoiding the use of such liquids as corrode that metal .
I also stated that the currents thus produced did not appear to arise from any action of heat or other force in the mass of the liquid .
I have recently investigated this phenomenon more extensively , employing , in the first series of experiments , a similar apparatus to the one described in that paper , but of a much larger and more effective size , as shown below .
The circular disks of metal which bounded the ends of the glass cylinder were 4f inches in diameter , and the column * See ante , p. 272 .
Mr. G. Gore on of liquid was 4 inches in diameter and 1^ inch high , and consisted of about 12 ounces by measure .
The metals employed in this apparatus were in nearly all cases either platinum , gold , or palladium.* The apparatus was made water-tight , by the aid of vulcanized india-rubber washers ; but , as those washers affected the electric currents , they were covered on each side by others of pure india-rubber , somewhat wider than themselves , secured to them by means of spirit-varnish .
In some cases , especially for the lower end of the cylinder , where the heat did not affect them , washers of the pure rubber alone were employed ; and , for use with strongly alkaline solutions , the vulcanized washers were , in certain instances , previously immersed during five or six hours in a hot or boiling and strong solution of caustic soda , to remove sulphur , and then thoroughly washed .
Nearly all the liquids were , previous to using , boiled , to expel dissolved air , * Messrs. Johnson and Matthey were kind enough to lend me a valuable pair of palladium plates for these experiments .
the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
515 cooled and filtered ; the presence of air in the liquid was , however , found to interfere but little with the chief results , except with certain solutions , or unless the air was large in amount .
It is necessary that the liquids be clear , for if a solid deposit settles upon the lower plate , it interferes with the current .
In using the apparatus it was essential to screw it together very tightly before each experiment , otherwise it became somewhat loosened by the influence of the heat upon the upper washers and the screws , and the currents were thereby greatly increased in magnitude .
The quantity of water put into the cistern above the upper plate before each experiment was two ounces , and the current of steam passed into it raised its temperature from 60 ' to 210 ' F. in about seven or eight minutes .
It*was necessary to take the apparatus asunder , and wash the plates and washers thoroughly before each experiment , and to remove from them every particle of extraneous substance .
In many cases the gold or platinum plates ( but never the palladium ones , because they oxidize ) were heated to redness before an experiment .
The galvanometer employed was in nearly all cases an astatic one , with a coil offering a resistance of 100 ohms , and was found to be more suitable than others which offered less resistance .
I examined , by means of this apparatus , a large number of conducting solutions , in order to include conspicuous instances of the phenomena and exceptional cases , as well as to more completely ascertain any sources of interference , and the proper conditions for obtaining the most reliable results .
Metals or liquids which chemically affected each other were usually avoided , and base metals , and even silver , were rarely used .
Plates of palladium were found to be much more frequently corroded than those of platinum or gold , and were therefore much less suitable for these experiments ; they were thus acted upon in hot or cold ones of chloride of chromium or perchloride of iron , in hot solutions of either chloride of manganese , acidulated ones of nitrate or chlorido of copper , and in one of iodate of potassium .
Those of copper were corroded in a hot solution of carbonate of sodium .
With different liquids , also , different circumstances occurred , which interfered with the currents ; in some cases the liquid corroded both plates , as with palladium in chloride of chromium or perchloride of iron ; in others it corroded the hot plate only .
In some instances the liquids were chemically changed by contact either with the hot plate or the washers , and deposited oxide or basic salt upon them ; for instance , perchloride of iron in contact with hot palladium , platinum , !
or gold ; or permanganate of potassium in contact with hot platinum or with the washers .
With strongly alkaline solutions , the prepared washers , and even those formed of pure rubber only , were acted upon , the upper stratum of liquid became , slightly yellow , and therefore altered in chemical composition , and the currents were greatly altered Mr. G. Gore on in magnitude , especially if the heat was continued until bubbles of steam formed against the upper plate .
During an examination , by means of this apparatus , of nearly all the liquids named in this paper , I gradually ascertained the extent of this-interference of the washers , and found that even the most carefully-prepared ones affected , more or less , the magnitude of the currents on all solutions which were not neutral , or nearly so , to test-paper ; they , , however , rarely reversed the direction of the current .
The degree of tightness , also , to which the apparatus was screwed up largely affected the quantity of the current in such liquids .
In consequence of these circumstances , I devised and constructed the apparatus .
here represented , and employed it for the purpose of checking the results obtained with strongly alkaline or acid solutions , in the one with circular plates ; those obtained with the more neutral liquids less required checking .
The chief part of this apparatus consists of a bent glass-tube ( fig. 1)\gt ; with open cup-shaped ends , B and C , and an open exit-tube , D. Thisthe Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
517 glass vessel , when first constructed , was straight , a/ nd the narrow part of it , A , afterwards bent by means of a row of Bunsen 's burners .
Each of the cups contained a ribbon of sheet platinum , E , welded to the lower end of a thin platinum tube , E , and coiled into a spiral form , the coil resting upon a triangle of glass rod or platinum wire , Gr , placed inside each cup 5 each ribbon employed was 48 inches long and 1 inch wide , and weighed two troy ounces ; shorter and somewhat wider ones would be more convenient , and for the cold electrode a much smaller one would probably suffice , but only for use with such liquids as offer but little electric conduction-resistance ; the hot electrode must , however , be large , in all cases , in order to obtain conspicuous results .
Each of the platinum tubes was tightly fixed in a hole in the centre of a bung of cork , which fitted the mouth of the cup , by which the electrode might be lifted out ; each bung also had a hole in it , for the insertion of a thermometer , and a small one , also , for escape of air .
The ends of thin platinum wires , M , N , for conveying the current to the galvanometer , were also fixed securely between the tubes and the bungs .
The cup to be heated , C , was surrounded by a brass jacket or cistern , H ( viewed from the front ) , and I ( viewed from the side ) , provided with an exit-tube , J , and a projecting chamber , K ( closed at its outer end only ) , beneath which the flame of a lamp might be conveniently applied .
The jacket was secured water-tight around 0 ( fig. 1 ) , by fixing upon the narrow part of the glass tube , at L , a split bung , of a diameter such as to tightly fit the lower opening of the cistern , and securing the cistern to it water-tight by means of asphalt varnish .
The jacket was kept concentric with the cup C , by means of three pieces of cork fixed between the two vessels at their upper end .
The exit-tube , D , was provided with a piece of pure india-rubber tubing , 15 inches long ( fig. 2 ) , provided with a narrow glass funnel , O , at its extremity , by means of which both the filling and the emptying of the cups , B and C , was effected ; a glass stop-cock was substituted for the tubing when liquids which acted upon india-rubber were employed .
The exit-pipe , J , of the cistern was also provided with a pinch tap , P , so that the hot water might be quickly removed from the cistern after an experiment .
Fig. 2 shows the complete apparatus .
The glass tube was supported in a vertical position by a firm clip-support , which grasped it tightly at the point A , and the funnel , O , was held in an elevated position by means of a separate clip-support , Ri , attached by a vertical metal rod to a metal hoop , Q , which encircled the cup , B , T is a screen of cardboard , also supported by the hoop Q ; U , and V , are thermometers .
The glass vessel con-tained about five ounces of solution , and the cistern required about three ounces of water .
All the sketches are about one-fourth the actual linear dimensions .
In using the apparatus the electrodes were first well cleaned , wash 3d , Mr. G. Gore on and drained as completely as possible , heated to redness , coiled , and placed in position ; the galvanometer connected ; the vessel charged with the clear and cold solution by means of the funnel , until the electrodes were quite submerged ; and the deflection of the galvanometer needles was also noted .
The cistern was then charged with water ; and as soon as the needles of the galvanometer settled at or near zero , a Bunsen 's burner ( previously placed beneath the projecting chamber K ) provided with a regulating tap , was lighted , the water heated to boiling , and boiled until the temperature of the solution ceased to rise , the deflections of the needles during the process of heating being noted .
The hot water was then ran out , the apparatus allowed to cool , then discharged of its solution , and thoroughly washed by pouring abundance of cold water through each limb .
It usually required about three or four minutes to raise the water in the cistern to 212 ' F , ; the liquid in the cup C usually acquiring a temperature of nearly 150 ' F. by that time ; and it required the water in the cistern to be kept boiling about six or eight minutes longer in order to raise the temperature of the inner liquid to 200 ' F. , and that was nearly the highest temperature it would acquire .
This apparatus acted very satisfactorily , and enabled me to more accurately examine the influence of heat in such actions .
The results obtained with this form of thermo-electric liquid examiner , confirmed in nearly every case , where the currents were feeble , those obtained with the other one , and confirmed also so far as regards the chief results ( viz. , the existence and direction of the current ) those obtained with strongly acid or alkaline liquids , but less frequently confirmed with such solutions the relative magnitudes of the currents in different cases ; the large cylinder apparatus may therefore be satisfactorily employed with neutral solutions , but is not suitable for purposes of accurate measurement of the currents , especially of those obtained with strongly acid or alkaline liquids .
Although the experiments made with the cylinder apparatus were liable to interferences caused by the washers , as nearly all of them gave substantially reliable results , it was desirable to record them in the following pages for the purpose of comparison .
A sufficient number of liquids was examined by means - of each apparatus so as to include apparently exceptional cases as well as conspicuous and extreme instances of the phenomenon ; and the following is an abbreviated statement of the results obtained , with occasional remarks upon them .
Behaviour of Different Liquids and Metals .
A.\#151 ; In the Cylinder Apparatus .
In all the experiments with this apparatus , the water in contact with the upper plate was raised to a temperature of about 210* F. , the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .

( Compare Nos 145 , 167 .

Gore oh No. 110 .
In order to ascertain the effect of entire absence of the washers with a strongly alkaline solntion , I took the solution of caustic soda used in experiments No. 86 , 87 , and 88 , and put it into a large V-shaped glass tube of 1-inch internal diameter , containing two large platinum electrodes wholly submerged , and suspended by thin platinum wires , the ends of the tube being nearly closed by corks , and heated one limb of the tube .
The hot platinum became positive 5| ' at 210 ' F. By allowing the liquid in the heated limb to come into contact with a bung of vulcanized india-rubber , the deflection was increased to 40 , thus further proving that vulcanized washers were liable to interfere with the results .
Conclusions and Remarks .
On classifying and comparing in different ways the foregoing results obtained with the large cylinder apparatus , we find 1st , that in nearly all cases where the liquid is strongly acid , and chemical action is absent , the cold metal is positive to the hot one , and the electric current flows upwards .
And 2nd , that in nearly all those where the liquid is strongly alkaline , and chemical action does not occur , the hot metal is positive to the cold one , and the current flows downwards ; thus affording additional evidence in support of the conclusions I drew in my former investigation already referred to ( see p. 513 ) .
The nearest approach to exceptions to the above conclusions are in the instance of dilute acetic acid ( see No. 10 ) ; solution of boracic acid ( No. 14 ) ; acid chromate of potassium ( Nos. 33 , 34 , and 35 ) ; acid sulphate of potassium { No. 47 ) ; chloride of potassium ( Nos. 65 , 66 ) ; ( compare No. 130 ) ; and potassium alum ( No. 97 ) ; ( compare No. 136 ) ; but in each of these cases the electric currents were very feeble , and may have been due to the influence of the washers .
Nos. 18 , 32 , and 60 , exhibit rather anomalous results , but in the two first of these corrosion of the metal occurred ; and in each case the metal plates were of palladium , and the solution contained a chloride .
It is important to notice that , provided chemical action is excluded , the direction of the current in all the experiments was scarcely at all dependent upon the kind of metal , but almost entirely upon that of liquid ; the only exception to this were Nos. 85 , 96 , and 102 , and these were but feeble ones .
In the exceptional cases , Nos. 18 and 32 , chemical action occurred .
I therefore conclude that is the nature of the liquid , and not that of the metal , which most determines the existence and direction of the current .
The magnitude of the current , however , is largely affected in many cases by a variation in the kind of metal employed , even when no chemical change takes place .
In some cases , especially with strongly alkaline liquids , the current due to the heat is greatly increased by keeping the hot plate at 210 ' F. for some time ; for instance , with palladium in an aqueous solution the Thermo-Electric Properties of .
of acid chromate of potassium acidified with chromic acid ( see No. 35 ) ; with platinum , gold or palladium , in solution of carbonate of sodium ( see Nos. 39 , 40 , 41 ) ; with gold or palladium in carbonate of potassium ( Nos. 71 , 72 ) ; also with platinum in potassic hydrate ( No. 108 , See also No. 112 ) .

In the experiments with this apparatus , the solution in the cup B was at the atmospheric temperature , viz. , from 55 ' to 65 ' F. , and that in cup C was raised to between 190 ' and 200 ' F. , rarely beyond , by keeping the water in the outer cistern at a boiling temperature .

As an illustration of the absence of corrosive action of this liquid upon iron , I took two thin wires of equal dimensions and perfectly clean and bright , one of iron and the other of pure gold , twisted them together , and immersed them in a solution of potassic cyanide in a closed bottle kept at ordinary atmospheric temperature .
After a few weeks the gold had entirely dissolved and disappeared , but the iron remained unaltered in appearance .
I also found iron to be electro-negative to gold in such a solution .
Iron employed also as an anode in such a liquid offers a much greater degree of resistance than gold to the passage of an electric current .
Bemarlcs and conclusions .
A review of the results obtained with the improved apparatus confirms , in nearly all cases , the general conclusions ( see p. 528 ) arrived at by means of experiments with the cylinder one .
The most conspicuous exceptions yet met with have been obtained with a solution of sulphate of manganese ( No. 148 ) , chrome alum ( No. 156 ) , sulphate of nickel ( No. 155 ) , and argentic nitrate ( No. 147 ) , probably also of sulphate of iron ( No. 159 ) ; cupric sulphate also ( Nos. 15 and 113 ) appears to be a feeble exception .
In some acid solutions , also , hot platinum is feebly positive , for instance , dilute selenious acid ( No. 157 ) , an alcoholic solution of chloride of chromium ( No. 129 ) , and an aqueous one of ammonic alum ( Nos. 96 and 136 ) .
No instance , however , has yet been met with in which , in the absence Mr. G. Gore on of chemical change , hot platinum is strongly positive in a strongly acid solntion , or strongly negative in a very alkaline one ; the nearest approach to this was in the case of aqueous selenious acid .
A law without an apparent exception is an unusual phenomenon , and , as a single real exception will invalidate a general law , if the .above exceptions are real ones , they prove that the theory that* acids are thermo-electro-positive , and alkalies thermo-electro-negative , is not an exact one .
Some strongly acid solutions give only feeble currents ; for instance , acid sulphate of potassium ( Nos. 48 and 128 ) , and some strongly alkaline ones behave similarly , except when persistently heated ; for example , potassic hydrate ( No. 112 ) , sodic hydrate ( No. 142 ) , and carbonate of rubidium ( No. 149 ) .
On the other hand , some neutral solutions yield currents stronger than the chemical theory would lead us to expect ; for instance , chloride of potassium ( Nos. 66 and 130 ) .
One rather common effect observed has been a very great increase in the magnitude of the current by continuance of the heat without increased rise of temperature , as if molecular inertia or some other slowly yielding resistance had to be overcome .
This occurred in nearly all solutions which were strongly alkaline , and was at one time suspected by me to be wholly due to the action of the liquid upon the washers ; it occurred freely , however , in experiments with the bent tube apparatus in which no washers were employed .
The following are examples of such an effect:\#151 ; with carbonate of sodium ( Nos. 39 , 40 , and 41 ) , carbonate of potassium ( Nos. 70,71 , 72 , and 121 ) , caustic potash ( Nos. 108 and 112 ) , iodide of potassium ( No. 132 ) , sodic hyposulphite ( No. 135 ) , cyanide of potassium ( No. 145 ) , carbonate of rubidium ( No. 149 ) , fluoride of potassium ( No 151 ) , and fluoride of rubidium ( No. 153 ) .
It also took place , though less frequently and to a less degree , in liquids of acid reaction ; for instance , an acidified solution of acid chromate of potassium ( No. 38 ) , iodate of potassium ( No. 131 ) , an acidified solution of cupric nitrate ( No. 138 ) , bromide of cobalt ( No. 140 ) , argentic nitrate ( No. 147 ) ; and sulphate of manganese ( No. 148 ) .
In some other cases the quantity of the current diminished by continuance of heat .
The whole of the results obtained with this apparatus further confirm the conclusion obtained from the results of the experiments made with the cylinder one , viz. , that , provided chemical action is not present , it is the nature of the liquid , and not so much that of the metal of the ' electrodes , which determines the existence and direction of the current.* If also we class under the heads of their respective acids all the salts employed in the experiments , and then class them similarly under their respective bases , we find that both the direction and the magni* No. 109 is not a real exception to this statement .
Compare Nos. 109 , 146 , and 167 .
the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
tude of the current varies with each different base and acid ; hut in the few cases in which electrodes of different metal were employed with the same liquid , as with platinum , copper , and iron in solution of sodic carbonate in Nos. 118-164 and 165 ; with platinum and iron in solution of sodic hydrate of Nos. 142 and 166 , and with iron and platinum in solution of potassic cyanide of Nos. 145 and 167 , the quantity only , and not the direction , of the current was affected .
This agrees with the results obtained with the cylinder apparatus , in which a greater variety of metals was employed .
The only apparent exception to this state-ment was with iron in solution of potassic cyanide of No. 109 ; hut the contradictory result obtained in that case was evidently due to the liquid acting upon the washers .
Cause of the Currents .
The heat applied to one of the plates must either act as the real cause of the currents , or merely as an exciting cause , by liberating from a potential state another force which produces them .
If it acts as the real cause , the effect will be proportional to the heat applied , except in those cases where some condition ( such as conduction resistance , or a reversal of electric polarity ) exists to prevent or diminish it .
If , however , it operates merely as an exciting cause , the current would either be large in proportion to the amount of heat applied , or vary m a different ratio to the temperature , because the liberated force would probably obey a different and higher law of increase than that of the temperature .
The substances also , having evolved a portion of their stored-up power , would be in a different potential condition after an experiment to what they were before it .
If , however , we examine all the results , we find that in nearly the whole of the instances the currents increased in magnitude ( usually in approximate proportion ) with the temperature , and the metals and liquids after an experiment were in precisely the same physical and chemical state as they were before it , and might therefore be used again for the same experiment any number of times without loss of efficiency .
Heat alone , or chemical affinity excited by heat , appears to be the only probable cause of the currents .
That chemical action , started by heat , did not produce them , appears certain\#151 ; 1st , because no corrosive effect ( shown by loss of brightness ) was manifested upon the plates , even after many experiments , except in certain cases , and this was quite a delicate test ; * nor in the great bulk of the instances did any other * As the plates were burnished , a change of brightness was a much more delicate test than any loss of weight , I therefore did not test for corrosion by weighing them .
To generate a current also of equal amount to that produced m some of the m-stances an appreciable amount of metal would have been required to dissolve .
Further .
no signs of dissolved platinum , gold , or palladium were observed in the residues obtained on evaporating and crystallizing the various liquids , m those cases where no signs of corrosion had been observed upon the plates .
Mr. ( ! .
Gore on chemical change occur ; and , 2nd , because when chemical action of an^ kind did take place , it either produced no electric currents , or it produced currents either in a reverse direction , or greater in amount than those due to the heat .
It also in nearly all such cases either caused the plates to lose their lustre , produced a deposit upon them , or made the liquids change in colour or become cloudy .
In consequence of these different effects , the apparatus and method of experiment may be employed for detecting some of the chemical ( as well as the electrical ) effects of heat upon electrically conducting liquids .
Ho signs of electrolytic action , or deposition of metal , even in the most suitable solutions , such as those of copper , were observed ; and there was no reason to suppose that the metal plates contained occluded gases .
The phenomena were also inconsistent with the supposition that the heat operated by temporarily dissociating the constituents of the liquid .
( Compare Nos. 77 , 94 , 159 , 160 , and 161 .
) The fact also that the currents produced in acid liquids were opposite in direction to those which would have been produced by chemical action , is very strong evidence against the cause being chemical .
From these various circumstances it is clear that , except in those cases where signs of chemical change were detected , heat was the true and only cause of the currents , and not merely an exciting cause of chemical action producing them .
Although heat is the true and only cause of the currents , it may operate either in a direct manner in producing them , or through the agency of some intermediate force .
If it operates through some other force , then an action of that force must form an essential part of the phenomena .
As the currents are not confined to magnetic liquids , magnetic action cannot be an essential condition .
Light also does not manifestly influence the results , and chemical action can be excluded ; and the only forces likely to be active in the circumstances of the case are those of cohesion and adhesion .
We know that rise of temperature usually diminishes both these powers , expands both solids and liquids , and rearranges their molecules ; it usually diminishes the adhesion of liquids to solids ; and in certain cases it even disassociates the elements of a compound .
As the action , however , which produces the current always requires two substances , viz. , a liquid and a metal , and evidently occurs either wholly or chiefly at their immediate surfaces of mutual contact , we may conclude that it is not an effect of heat upon the force of cohesion in the mass of liquid or of metal .
Although various effects of heat upon cohesion and adhesion must occur in the metals and liquids employed in these experiments , and cannot be excluded , they may still not necessarily form an essential part of the phenomena , but be only concomitant circumstances , and the existence of the electric currents may be in no degree dependent upon them .
As also the currents continue not only during the rise and fall of temperature , but likewise during a stationary and prolonged difference the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
537 of it , and are not reversed in direction during the cooling , it is evident that they cannot be due to the act of diminution of cohesion or adhesion produced by the heat .
As , further , all the substances employed are in precisely the same physical and chemical states after an experiment as they were before it , and as the portion of heat expended in raising the temperature , expanding the substances , and diminishing their cohesion and adhesion , must have been given out again on the cooling and contracting of those bodies , that portion cannot have been expended in producing the currents .
From these considerations I conclude that neither the force of cohesion , nor that of adhesion , acts as an intermediate cause of the currents , and that the latter are , in an ordinary sense of the word , direct effects of the heat .
( It may be further remarked that if a change of the force of cohesion , or of that of adhesion , gave rise to the currents , then such a change when produced by other means than heat ( such as enormous pressure ) must be capable of causing similar effects .
) As heat was the true , immediate , and only cause of the currents , the action may , in accordance with usage in similar cases , be properly termed thermo-electric ; and as heat was the only force expended , we may also , in accordance with the great law of conservation of energy , safely conclude that heat disappeared in the process .
And as it is the nature of the liquid which most determines both the existence of the current and its direction , it is true thermo-electric action of liquids , and liquids possess true thermo-electric properties .
The heat must , however , be subject in its operation to some guiding condition which determines the kind of effect to be produced , and both the cause , heat , and the effect , electricity , must be essentially related to that condition .
Such a condition appears to be the acid or alkaline nature of the liquid ; as , however , chemical action is not necessary , and different liquids of acid reaction ( or of alkaline reaction ) give a reverse direction of current , the chemical conditions of acidity or alkalinity are probably only concomitant circumstances , and do not really , but only apparently , determine the kind of effect ; and as those conditions are usually of an opposite kind in liquids which yield an opposite direction of current , and are in most cases stronger as the currents are more powerful , they are probably themselves dependent upon some more general condition which itself determines the direction of the currents .
# A single clear exception invalidates a general inference , and indicates the existence probably of the action of a second law , or of a more general cause or condition .
That the thermo-electric-negative property of a liquid is separable from and may exist without^ the alkaline property , is clearly proved by the exceptional direction of the current in solutions of selenious acid ( No. 157 ) , sulphate of nickel ( No. 155 ) , nitrate of silver ( No. 147 ) , chrome alum ( No. 156 ) , sul-vol .
xxvii .
^ N Mr. G. Gore phate of manganese ( No. 148 ) , and probably also sulphate of iron ( No. 159 ) ; and in a less conspicuous degree in solutions of sulphate of copper ( Nos. 15 and 113 ) , sulphate of didymium ( No. 154 ) , and other substances .
These anomalous results indicate the existence of a deeper seated condition of the currents than that of the acid or alkaline nature of the liquid , because the currents in those instances are not merely altered in quantity but actually reversed .
And this deeper condition must also affect the quantity of the current in different cases , because a diminution of quantity is a step towards a reversal of direction , and an actual reversals is probably only an extreme degree of the same change .
This more abstruse condition consists probably of the structural arrangement of the molecules of the liquid ; for we know as a matter of course that tridimensional geometrical , as well as mechanical conditions of the molecules must be fundamentally involved in the action .
It is also probable that as the chemical and electrical phenomena in these experiments are usually coincident in their changes , this hidden condition is of a more general kind than either , and determines not only the acid or alkaline reaction of the solution , but also the production and direction of the currents ( i.e. , it determines whether the heat shall produce a current at all , and also the direction of the current produced ) ; and that these two effect s , the chemical and electrical , are but concomitant ones .
It is , however , evident that heat acting upon a saline conducting liquid in the manner described is not alone sufficient to cause a current , but that another condition is necessary , because with some good conducting solutions , such as were used in Nos. 47 , 49 , 51 , 57 , 67 , 69 , 75 , 90 , 122 , and especially No. 146 , little or no current was produced .
The heat then acts as the real cause of the currents , and a particular molecular state of the liquid probably determines the kind and direction of effect the heat shall produce , and as we also know that the molecular structure of all bodies is profoundly altered by change of temperature , we may reasonably conclude that whilst a portion of the heat is absorbed in temporarily changing the molecular structure , and is again set free when the structure returns to its original state during the process of cooling , another portion is expended and lost in producing the current .
According to this interpretation the phenomenon of the current is a product of three circumstances , viz. , 1st , a particular molecular structure of the liquid ; 2nd , a change of the latter by alteration of temperature ; and 3rd , a direct conversion of heat into dynamic electricity ; such conversion being dependent upon the two prior conditions .
The second circumstance also agrees with the fact that in certain liquids , for instance , Nos. 130 , 139 , 155 , 156 , 157 , and 162 , the current does the Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .

Mr. G. Gore on These diminutions of current and reversals of its direction by rise of temperature indicate irregular molecular changes in the layer of liquid next to the heated plate ; and the examination of electrically conducting solutions by this apparatus and process constitutes a new mode of discovering such alterations in them .
By obtaining also a sufficient variety and number of instances of such change , for comparison , classification and generalization , we may probably be enabled to infer and discover some general truths respecting molecular action , or gain some knowledge of the molecular conditions necessary for the conversion of heat into dynamic electricity .
As also molecular change is a fundamental action in bodies , and many of the secondary properties of substances depend upon molecular state , an alteration of the former is usually attended by more than one of the latter ; and we may therefore reasonably infer that the foregoing change in the electrical properties of a solution of chrome alum and other liquids is attended by other coincident physical changes , such , for instance , as that of expansion , or of specific heat capacity .
According to the contact theory of voltaic action , a metal touching another metal , or touching a liquid , tends to produce an electric curthe Thermo-Electric Properties of Liquids .
541 rent by the mere contact alone , and when this contact effect of a metal with a liquid differs in strength with two different metals , such metals , each at the same temperature , and immersed in a liquid of that temperature ( whether cold or hot , and without the aid of chemical action ) , generates a current , provided the contact effect of the metals themselves does not neutralise that of the metals and liquid .
Such an effect has been already obtained .
Becquerel , for instance , immersed pure platinum and gold in various acids , ammonia , and neutral saline solution , and .
obtained very feeble currents .
He concluded that the state of the surface of the metals had great influence , and that consequently capillary affinity played a very important part in producing the effects .
( See " Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci , " Paris , 1870 , pp. 480 , 961 , 1813 ; also " Chemical Hews , " vol. xxii , p. 21 , and vol. xxiii , p. 222 .
) As neither gold nor platinum is perceptibly corroded by dilute acids , nor usually by saline liquids , at ordinary atmospheric temperatures , any electric current produced by such a combination can only be due to contact , either of the metals with each other or with the liquid .
According to these facts , as in the thermo-electric apparatus there is no contact of dissimilar metals , both the contact of the cold metal ( as well as that of the hot one ) with the liquid , tends to generate a current , and rise of temperature makes the warmer metal only more or less electro-positive than it was previously .
Another reason also for concluding that both the cold and the hot piece of metal , at each different temperature , tends to generate a current , is , that with two pieces of the same metal at 60 ' F. in the apparatus , if one was made colder , a current was produced in the same direction as when the other was heated .
The electrical effect , therefore , is a result of a difference of action at the surfaces of contact of the two pieces of metal with the liquid ; and the apparatus and method may be employed for detecting differences of electric potential between metals and liquids at different temperatures .
In addition to Volta and Becquerel , others , viz. , Pfaff , Fechner , Peclet , Matteucci , Kohlrausch , Marianini , Hankel , Zamboni , Buff , and Thomson , have investigated the contact theory of voltaic action , and Clifton has examined the difference of electric potential produced by the contact of metals and liquids ( see " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " 1877 , vol. xxvi , p. 299 ) , but the metals he employed were easily corrodible ones , viz. , zinc , iron , and copper .
As in my experiments the origin of the current appears to lie in a conversion of heat into electricity , and heat probably disappears in the process , it is a reasonable inference that , in the above experiments of Becquerel 's , \amp ; c. , heat also disappears and produces the currents ; and , if this be correct , then it is also likely that , when a piece of metal is simply immersed in a suitable liquid , the temperature is altered ; and Mr. G. Gore on this would be a parallel fact in the science of heat to that of the production of electricity by contact action in electrical science .
This research throws some light upon the origin of the voltaic current , and the results accord with the original contact theory of Yolta ( of late years revived in this country ) , that electric currents may be produced between metals and liquids , by mutual contact , without the aid of chemical action .
I should much like to determine , by actual experiment , various points suggested by this research:\#151 ; 1st .
Whether , by the mere contact of a metal and liquid , an alteration of temperature is produced .
2nd .
To make a model thermo-electromotor , composed of iron and a solution of sodic carbonate ; and ascertain its electromotive power , and whether a series of several such cells will electrolyse a liquid .
3rd .
To test the effect of rough and smooth surfaces of the plates .
4th .
To endeavour to obtain an electric current with iron plates under the influence of magnetism .
5th .
To search for other instances of molecular change , also for other physical changes ( such as that of irregular absorption of heat ) coincident with the molecular ones .
6th .
To compare the electromotive power of a platinum pair against one of iron , gold , silver , \amp ; c. , and to settle other questions which have occurred to my mind .
( Added March 17 , 1878 .
) The thermo-electric properties of liquids appear to be related to the statical electric effects of the contact of metals with liquids .
Peclet found that platinum and gold exhibited , by contact with acidulated water , electric signs contrary to those which would have been produced had those metals been oxidised or chemically corroded ; also , that they gave opposite electric signs with solutions of potash , ammonia , or hydrosulphate of potassium , to those which they gave with dilute nitric , hydrochloric , or sulphuric acid .
( See " Annal de Chim .
, " 1841 , vol. ii , pp. 233-255 ; " Arch , de 1'Elect .
, " 1841 , vol. i , pp. 621-650 ; and De la Rive 's " Treatise on Electricity , " English edition , vol. ii , p. 849 ) Pfaff , also , found those metals exhibit opposite electric signs by contact with solutions of caustic potash , soda , or ammonia , to those obtained by contact with strong nitric , hydrochloric , or sulphuric acids .
( See Poggendorff 's " Annalen , " 1840 , vol. li , pp. 110-124 , 197-212 ; Wiedemann 's " Galvanismus , " 1872 , vol. i , p. 32 ; and Peschel 's " Elements of Physics , " vol. iii , pp. 73\#151 ; 75 .
) Buff obtained similar results to the above , with platinum in contact with solution of potash , dilute nitric or sulphuric acid , commercial nitric acid , and in fully concentrated nitric acid .
( See Liebig 's " Ann. de Chem. and Pharm. " 1842 , vol. xlii , pp. 5-14 ; " Archives de 1'Elect .
, " 1843 , vol. iii , pp. 561-572 ; Wiedemann 's " Gialvanismus , " 1872 , vol. i , p. 29 .
) Each of these investigators also found platinum become charged with the Thermo-Electric Properties of .
positive electricity by contact with acids , and with negative by contact with alkalies ; and its electrical condition in acids to be the opposite of that which would have been produced by chemical corrosion .
All these results agree with mine .
The statical electric effects which Pfaff obtained with other liquids , such as solutions of argentic nitrate , cupric sulphate , ferrous and ferric sulphates , and other salts , also agree m the main with the dynamic ones obtained with my apparatus .
Rise ot temperature , therefore , usually only increased and sustained the difference of electric condition between metals and liquids which contact produced ; and this effect was the same in acid and alkaline solutions .
As also the direction of the current agreed usually with that of electric polarity produced by contact , if we know that of the one at a particular temperature , that of the other may be predicted from it .
These considerations also indicate the existence of a zero of temperature for each pair of substances , below which contact would not develop electricity in them .
( Added March 25 , 1878 .
) Since writing the above , I have met with a paper by M. Pouillet on " New Phenomena of the Production of Heat , " * in which the author stated , that at the instant a liquid wets a solid , or is absorbed by i , there is a disengagement of heat , and proved this statemen y nu merous experiments , made with a variety of substances in such a manner as was likely to secure trustworthy results .
The liquids employed were confined to water , oil , alcohol , and acetic ether only , but the solids were very various , chiefly organic substances , but including also ( in a state of fine division ) porcelain , glass , clay , carbon , sulphur , silica , alumina , magnesia , oxides of chromium , the peroxides of iron and of manganese ; also finely-powdered metals , viz. , iron , zinc , tin , antimony , and copper .
The rise of temperature found with inorganic bodies varied from 2 to '5 of a C. degree , and lasted from two to four minutes , and then the temperature returned to its former state .
Regnault has confirmed the general result.f As the mere contact of metals and liquids develops heat , and as ( without the aid of chemical action ) heat excites an electric current , and the direction of the current produced by heating platinum in contact with either acid or alkaline solutions , agrees with the signs of static electric polarity excited by the contact of that metal with those liouids we may reasonably conclude that the heat and free electricity , excited by such contact , are related to each other , either as cause and effect , or as coincident effects of some other cause contained in the act of contact . .
