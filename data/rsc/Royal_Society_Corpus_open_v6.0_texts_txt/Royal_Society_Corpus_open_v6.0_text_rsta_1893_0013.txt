The well-known relation of volume-energy to temperature , expressed by the equation pv = RT , and the simple relations between p , v , and T when the substance examined is in the state of gas , together with the constancy in the value of R , if the weights of unit volumes of gases taken are proportional to their molecular weights , have led us to make experiments on the surface-tension of liquids in the hope of discovering relations as direct and simple We were guided to this research by experiments by Eotvos , which shall be discussed later.* We have not been disappointed ; it appears that a similar formula expresses with moderate accuracy the variation of surface-energy with temperature ; it may be stated in similar terms , using the symbols y for surface-tension , i.e. , the force exerted along a linear centimetre of the liquid ; s for a surface over which are distributed a number of molecules the same for all liquids ; k for a constant analogous to R in the gaseous equation ; and r for temperature measured in Centigrade degrees downwards , the critical temperature being taken at zero .
An eauation completely analogous to the gaseous equation , Pv = RT , should therefore be is = kt .
That this is reasonable follows from the following consideration :\#151 ; In the gas equation , pv = RT , if v be kept constant , p decreases with fall of T , until where P ~0 , T = \#151 ; 273 ' , or absolute zero ; the origin of the scale of absolute temperature is also the origin of the scale of pressure .
Correspondingly , in the liquid surface equation , if s be kept constant , y decreases with r , until where y = 0 , a condition of affairs which takes place at the critical Ostwald ( ' Lehrbuch der Allgemeinen Chemie , ' p. 1130 ) has also pointed out the bearings of the experiments of EotvOs in this direction , and has indicated the possibility of determining the molecular heights of liquids by investigation of this " colligative " property .

temperature , r is zero ; hence the origin of the temperature-scale ( t ) is also the origin of the scale of tension .
But the above equation , unmodified , represents facts with only approximate accuracy , for reasons which will now be adduced .
Let is and r be the axes of the curve AO , showing the relation between is and At O , the critical temperature , r = 0 , and the value of is is also 0 .
With rise of r , i.e. , with fall of temperature , is increases slowly at first , but soon attains a nearly steady rate of increase , pictured by the nearly straight line CA .
The origin of the Fig. 1 .
line CA , which may be regarded as a tangent to a curve at some point intermediate between A and C , is not O , but B , a temperature some degrees on the ordinary scale below O , the critical temperature .
Hence , in representing the slope of the line CA by an equation , r cannot be one of the factors , but r diminished by the number of degrees between O and B. The equation then becomes , where d represents that number , is = k(r \#151 ; d ) .
A similar correction might possibly be applicable to the gaseous equation , if we wish to exhibit the behaviour of gases at ordinary temperatures , which are far above the absolute zero of the thermo-dynamic scale .
Were such a correction applicable , it would have the effect of merely altering the zero-point on the gas thermometer by some degrees .
That d ( is / dt ) is a constant has been shown to be approximately true by Eotvos ( ' Wied .
Ann./ 27 , 452 ) ; he also points out that s may be taken as equal to ( Mr ) ' , where v is the molecular volume of the liquid under investigation , i.e. , the volume in cub. centims. occupied by molecular weight of the compound taken in grammes .
He deduces from the constancy of the differential the equation y ( M/ y)f = ( T \#151 ; T ) , where T is the critical temperature of the liquid , and T ' the temperature at which y and ( Mv)1 are observed , i.e. ( T \#151 ; T ' ) = r.But , as we shall show , such an equation leads to erroneous results .
VARIATION OF MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .
649 The modification to be introduced into the equation y ( Mr)1 = ( t \#151 ; in order to secure concordance at temperatures ( or values of r ) higher than those represented by the point C on the figure will be considered later .
In calculating the results of experiment , we have assumed with Eotvos that ( Mr)1 = s ; for the surface of a liquid conceived to be contained in a cubical vessel is obviously a square on the line representing the cube-root of its volume .
Such an assumption , if molecular volumes be employed , gives a comparison of surfaces on which are distributed equal numbers of molecules , and permits of comparison between different liquids .

Proof of the Validity of the Equation y ( Mu)* = \#151 ; The data necessary in order to calculate the molecular surface-energy of a liquid are : ( 1 ) the height to which the liquid rises in a capillary tube of known diameter ; ( 2 ) the density of the liquid at the temperature of observation ; ( 3 ) the molecular weight of the liquid examined .
These data will be found on p. 667 , et .
seq. The liquids examined were : ( l ) ethyl oxide or ether ; ( 2 ) methyl alcohol ; ( 3 ) ethyl alcohol ; the specific orthobaric volumes of these liquids at temperatures from that of the atmosphere to their critical temperatures were determined by .Ramsay and Young ( 'Phil .
Trans./ 1887 , A. , 87 ; 313 ; 1886 , A. , 313 ) ; ( 4 ) methyl formate ; and ( 5 ) ethyl acetate ; the constants for these two liquids were kindly communicated to us by Young , as they are not vet published ; ( 6 ) carbon tetrachloride ; ( 7 ) benzene ; and ( 8 ) chlorobenzene , examined by Young ( ' Trans. Chem. Soc. , ' 1891 , p. 932 ; 1889 , p. 504 ; and 1891 , p. 134 ) ; and acetic acid ( ibid. , 1886 , p. 790 ; and 1891 , p. 909 ) .
These are at present the only liquids for which such data are available , and therefore they are the only ones of which the surface-energy and its variation with temperature can be determined .
They divide into two groups ; to the first group belong ether , methyl formate , and ethyl acetate , carbon tetrachloride , benzene , and chlorobenzene .
These liquids may he termed normal liquids , inasmuch as their behaviour resembles that of a normal gas .
The second group comprises acetic acid and the alcohols ; and these display properties which , as will afterwards be shown , make it more than likely that their molecules coalesce to form aggregates , as temperature falls , as indeed is known to be the case with acetic acid , even in the state of gas .
The first of these groups has the advantage of comprising liquids differing widely from each other chemically ; they are therefore specially " suitable for testing the truth It has been assumed that the distribution of molecules on the surface of a liquid is such that the average distance between any two molecules on the surface is equal to that in the interior .
We can give no proof of the correctness of this assumption , save to refer to the results of this investigation which appear to justify it .
of a physical law .
They will be first considered , leaving till later the " associating " liquids , acetic acid and the alcohols .

Deviation becomes apparent where an asterisk has been placed opposite the temperature .
A complete formula , representing all the results with fair accuracy , will afterwards be adduced , but several important deductions may be drawn from the simpler one .

Confirmation of these results at \#151 ; 89''8 .
Ethyl oxide , methyl formate , and ethyl acetate remain liquid , even when cooled to the boiling-point of nitrous- oxide under atmospheric pressure .
This temperature , which we have carefully determined by means of a thermometer filled with pure dry hydrogen ( 'Trans .
Chem. See .
, ' 1893 , p. 833 ) , is \#151 ; 890,8 .
It was thought advisable to measure the surface-energy , and to find out whether the linear relation between molecular surface-energy and temperature persists even at that low temperature .
The 4 o 2 results are given in the Table which follows ; the method of experiment is described on p. 671 .

761-5 744-0 + 2-4 The agreement is good except in the case of methyl formate ; here , however , the negative value , judging from experiments with acetic acid and with the alcohols , may be due to molecular association .
The positive value of the other two substances may be due to the fact that measurements were made in a different tube of wider capillary bore , and that the arrangements were necessarily less perfect than in determinations at higher temperatures .
We consider , therefore , that we are justified in stating that the linear relation between molecular surface-energy and temperature holds for ether within a range of 240 ' ; approximately for methyl formate , of 270 ' ; and for ethyl acetate , of 290 ' .
4 .
Molecular Surface-energy of Acetic Acid and of Methyl and Ethyl Alcohols .
The behaviour of acetic acid , and of methyl and ethyl alcohols , is exceptional ; the surface-energy no longer shows a linear relation to temperature .
Surface-energy , as has been stated , is the product of and y , where v* represents one-sixth of the surface of a cube containing one gramme of liquid , and y , the surface tension .
It has been assumed , with Eotvos , that the molecular volume raised to the two-thirds power ( My)1 , gives a comparison of surfaces on which equal numbers of molecules lie .
It is fair to assume that we have proved a linear relation to hold for " normal " liquids between y ( My)* and temperature .
The question now arises\#151 ; if certain liquids fail to show a linear relation , to what factor must the variation be ascribed ?
Two of these factors , viz. , y and ( y)* , are deduced from actual measurements , viz. , of the height of ascent in a capillary tube , and of the volume of one gramme of the substance .
But M has been taken as the molecular weight of the simple molecules , C2H402 , CH40 , and C3ll60 .
For acetic acid , at least , this* assumption is acknowledgedly wrong , for it is well-known that its molecular weight , as determined from its gaseous density , is not a constant , but decreases with rise of temperature and fall of pressure .
It has been shown by Ramsay and Young ( 'Phil , Mag. , ' 1887 , p. 20b ) .
VARIATION OF MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .
653 that the volume of one gramme of the vapour of acetic acid at 50 ' , the lowest temperature at which measurements were possible , and at a pressure nearly that of the saturated vapour ( 51'35 millims. , instead of 56'56)is 3567 cub. centims. , corresponding to the molecular weight , 109'6 , instead of 60 , the molecular weight of C3H403 , or 120 , that of C4H804 .
The alcohols show no such deviation in their vapour densities at any observed temperatures and pressures ; but that does not preclude the occurrence of association between simple molecules to form moi*e complex molecular groups in the liquid substances .
It is known that if the molecules in the gaseous state he caused to recede , dissociation takes place ; for instance , at the same temperature , 50 ' , but at a pressure of 13'4 millims. , one gramme of acetic acid gas occupied no less than 15,100 cub. centims. , implying a molecular weight of 99 '2 , considerably greater than that of C3H403 ( 60 ) , but not so great as that of C4fi804 ( 120 ) .
And many other similar instances could be given .
Now , since association is promoted by the approach of molecules , it is clear that as molecules in the liquid state are much nearer each other than in the gaseous state , it is not unreasonable to suppose that some liquids may consist in whole or part of associated molecules , even although their gases show no signs of abnormal density .
These observations are illustrated by the following tables , which show the variation with temperature of the molecular surface-energy of acetic acid , and of methyl and ethyl alcohols , assuming that the molecular weight in each case is that of the simple _ molecule , C3H403 , CH40 , or C3H60 .
By choosing suitable molecular weights , implying a mixture of simple and complex molecules , the relation can , of course , be made a linear one . ?

( See Plate 25 .
) Now it is possible to calculate the amount of association at any temperature for acetic acid and the alcohols , on the assumption that is a constant , which is approximately true for the normal liquids examined , and that if no association occurred with the anomalous liquids , the value of k would be similar to that which it possesses for the normal liquids .
The following values of k were found :\#151 ; VARIATION OF MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .

2H209 Suppose acetic acid gas , consisting of molecules of C2H402 , to undergo molecular condensation , so that 2C2H402 = C4H804 , the pressure of the gas would fall to half of the original pressure , provided volume were kept constant ; i.e. , unit volume would contain only half the original number of molecules .
How would this affect the number of molecules on the sui'face of a cube representing unit volume ?
Clearly , if the number of molecules in unit volume is halved , the number of molecules on unit surface will be altered to ( -|)* ; and a , similar change will take place in the surface energy , one of the factors of which is molecular surface , or ( M-r)b The value of the differential of surface-energy with temperature will be similarly altered ; the amount of association can , therefore , be calculated by the equation where k is the differential found for the dissociating liquid at the temperature chosen , and x the unknown factor of association .
For example , calculating for acetic acid , and for methyl and ethyl alcohols the amount of association at \#151 ; 890,8 , 20 ' , 100 ' , and 150 ' , we obtain the following numbers :\#151 ; Acetic a , cid .

With acetic acid at 20 ' the molecule is chiefly ( 02H403)4 ; with methyl alcohol at \#151 ; 89''8 ( CH40)4 is approached ; ethyl alcohol has not reached so great a degree of association at such a temperature .
65G PROFESSOR W. RAMSAY AND DR. J. SHIELDS ON THE In seeking for other evidence pointing to similar conclusions , attention is naturally drawn to deductions of molecular weight from the depression in freezing-point of a solvent .
But , in such cases , the concentration of the dissolved substance is comparatively small .
Data by E. Beckmann are available for ethyl alcohol dissolved in acetic acid and in benzene , and for acetic acid dissolved in benzene ( ' Zeitschr .
Phys. Chem. , ' vol. 2 , p. 728 ) .
The molecular weight of C2H60 is 46 , but Beckmann found that a solution of alcohol in benzene , containing 32-45 per cent , of alcohol , froze at a temperature which implied a molecular weight of 318 ; i.e. , 6'9 simple molecules of C2HgO had coalesced to form complex molecules .
Here , however , it was not proved that the crystals separating from the solution consisted of pure benzene , and not of a compound .
The same solvent gave a molecular depression , when it contained 22'8 per cent , of acetic acid , corresponding to a molecular weight of 153 for acetic acid ; by dividing this number by 60 , the molecular weight of C2H402 , it appears that approximately three simple molecules have coalesced to form a complex molecule .
The molecular weight of alcohol , determined by the depression in freezing-point of a solution of 14 '2per cent , of alcohol in acetic acid , gave 58 as the molecular weight of alcohol ; and this implies a commencement of association .
Substances which have no , or only a slight , tendency to associate simple to complex molecules , however , such as naphthalene ( molecular weight , 128 ) , show no such large deviations , even in a concentrated solution .
Thus Beckmann found the molecular weight of naphthalene to be 132 , even when 20*5 per cent , of naphthalene was dissolved in benzene .
That such abnormal results are not unknown , even in the gaseous state , is proved by the density of sulphur vapour at temperatures not far removed from its boiling-point under normal pressure ; Biltz 's results ( 'Zeitschr .
Phys. Chem. , ' vol. 2 , p. 920 ) show that whether the formula be accepted as S8 , or whether the association be regarded as proceeding to an indefinite limit , the fact remains that association takes place with fall of temperature .
( See also Thorpe and Hambly 's results with hydrogen fluoride 'Chem .
Soc. Trans. , ' vol. 55 , p. 163 .
) As to the reason of such condensation , it is , perhaps , premature to speak .
A recent paper on Valency , by Elavitzky ( 'J .
Prakt .
Chem. , ' N.F. , vol. 46 , p. 57 ) , however , appears to suggest a clue .
It may be that the oxygen in such molecules as acetic acid and the alcohols has not exerted its maximum valency , on account of the comparatively high temperature , and the distance between the molecules when alcohol is in the gaseous state ; and that valency increases either with fall of temperature , or with closer approach between the molecules .
A further proof that association is furthered by the liquid condition has been furnished by Cundall ( 'Chem .
Soc. Trans. , ' 1891 , p. 1076 ) .
The association of nitric peroxide molecules ( N02 ) is greatly promoted by the liquid condition , for while a 1*44 .per cent , solution in chloroform contains only 0'274 per cent , of N02 , the gas at similar temperature and pressure coi responding to such dilution contains 0'96 per cent. NCb .

Complete Equation expressing the relation between Molecular Surface-energy and Temperature .
All the previous work has been on the assumption that the rectilinear equation of yv* = k(t \#151 ; cl)holds for the substances examined .
But it was mentioned on p. 651 that near the critical point this simple relation no longer holds .
There can be little doubt that as the liquid reaches a higher and higher temperature its surface is exposed to a more vigorous bombardment from the gaseous molecules .
The molecular volume , and therefore the molecular surface , is rapidly increasing near the critical point ; and the surface-tension , as well as the surface-energy , decreases less rapidly as the critical point is approached than at lower temperatures .
The force required to extend a surface is less decreased by unit rise of temperature at high than at low temperatures .
Here we have no analogy to guide us , for gases have never been investigated where p approximates to ^zero , the volume of one gramme being kept constant , or in other words , we know nothing of the behaviour of gases near the absolute zero of temperature .
It is , moreover , possible that the distribution of molecules on the surface of a liquid at high temperatures is different from that in its interior ; and as we have no clear idea of the condition of matters at the surface of a liquid , we can form no theory which would conduct us to a reasonable , and not ' ' empirical form of equation .
It was necessary , therefore , to seek for some expression which would represent this deviation as a function either of molecular surface or of temperature , and Mi* .
Rose-Innes has kindly assisted us in this .

Historical resume .
The first experiments on the influence of temperature on surface-tension were made by Frankenheim ( 'Jour .
Prakt .
Chem. , ' vol. 23 , p. 401 ) .
Laplace and Poisson , it is true , considered the question , but only in the sense that the diminution of density of the liquid would alter the length suspended .
Frankenheim , however , found that the capillary ascent diminishes much more rapidly with rise of temperature than the VARIATION OF MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .
659 density diminishes ; and he discovered that the decrease in length of column supported , is approximately proportional to the rise of temperature .
For water , he found that if the surface-tension , or coefficient of capillarity at 0 ' C. , be placed equal to 1 , the variation with temperature between 0 ' and 100 ' C. may be expressed with fair accuracy by the equation y = 1 \#151 ; 0'00191 Frankenheim was the first to point out that at a certain high temperature , differing for each liquid , the capillary ascent would cease ; and he suggested that the state observed by Cagniarh de la Tour , now known as the critical point , should be that temperature .
Brunner , in 1847 ( 'Pogg .
Ann. , ' vol. 70 , p. 514 ) , and Wolff , in 1857 ( 'Ann .
Chim .
Phys. ' ( 3 ) , vol. 49 , p. 230 ) , also found proportionality between capillary ascent and temperature ; they observed , however , that such proportionality did not always hold .
The next researches on this subject in order of time were by ft. Schiff ( 'Annalen , ' vol. 223 , p. 47 ) , in 1884 ; but as he measured the capillary heights at only two temperatures , no conclusion can be drawn from his work relative to the question .
Moreover , the capillary rise was measured with the surface of the liquid in contact with air , and not with its own vapour .
The problem was again experimentally attacked by Eotvos ( .
cit. ) , in 1886 .
Starting with Van der Waal 's definition that corresponding states for different liquids are those at which / i \ Yi__ ( where Vx and V2 are the molecular volumes of two saturated vapours ; and i\gt ; 2 ; those of their liquids in contact with saturated vapours ; and corresponding pressures ; and T : and T2 , corresponding temperatures on the absolute scale ) , he reasons as follows :\#151 ; For a surface on which n molecules lie , the pressure of the vapour on that surface is npxvp , since is proportional to the mean linear distance between the molecules .
On the other hand , the surface-tension across a line of m molecules is The first force may be measured in dynesper square centimetre , the latter , in dynes per linear centimetre .
The corresponding expressions for another liquid are nptfv^ and Eotvos next assumes that bodies which are in corresponding states should possess similar mechanical properties , especially those which relate to the forces which act between their parts , and to their energies .
On this assumption , he imagines proportionality between yv* , the surface-energy , and the product pv the volume-energy ; and combining the relations given above , he obtains ( 2 ) -2^=^ .
ViL\ hqh 4 r 2 This equation seems to signify that the molecules are in a condition of equilibrium inasmuch as it would imply that ypq* and y2ty , the surface-tensions of the liquids , balance the pressures on the surfaces of the liquids ; but as a vertical pressure cannot be balanced by a horizontal stress , perhaps it is right to assume that only proportionality is meant .
Equation ( 2 ) , by appropriate multiplication , becomes Now from ( l ) hence ( 3 ) 2TT \#151 ; Jfl .

Hence Eotvos argues that T / YiV\ _ T \#177 ; / V2f\ 1 dTV Ti / 2 \ T2 / .
This equation implies that the rate of change of temperature of the molecular surface-energy of any two liquids is the same .
We have deemed it necessary to enter at some length into the views of Eotvos , because , although his conclusion is true for those liquids which we have investigated between wide ranges of temperature , his premises are scarcely justifiable .
This is best tested numerically ; and although Young has done so in numerous papers , it will be convenient to show the magnitude of the error for a specific case .
It is easy to test equation ( 1 ) stated in the form pxv1/ T1 = p2t'2/ /T2 , from data given by Ifamsav and Young ( 'Phil .

* The coefficient , 0227 , is expressed in milligrammes per square millimetre .
It should be remarked that we have confined our criticism to the rectilinear part of our work , and have not unfairly taxed the powers of Eotvos 's equation in covering those parts of the observations where they approach the critical temperature and are represented by a curve . .
At best , Eotvos 's reasoning leads only to a rough similarity , not to numerical identity .
Measurements of the surface-tension of ethyl oxide have recently been made by N. P. Kasterin , by a method which , from the figures and diagrams which he gives , evidently does not lead to trustworthy results .

Experimental Details .
It was necessary during the experiments on this subject to maintain the liquids investigated at constant temperatures , differing from each other by known amounts , and , -when the temperatures were high , under considerable pressures .
In order to Fig. 2 .
satisfy these conditions , the apparatus consisted essentially of three parts , a tube for observing the phenomena , a heating apparatus , and a pressure apparatus .
The liquid under experiment was enclosed air-free in a piece of thick walled barometer-tubing , T , secured in a !
neck N by means of an india-rubber joint comVARIATION OP MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .
663 pressed by a screw ; it entered an iron cylinder C , carrying a screw plunger , not shown in the figure .
The cylinder was filled with mercury , and by screwing the plunger in and out the pressure could be varied within wide limits , and the liquid in the tube could be exposed to any desired pressure , greater than that of the atmosphere .
The temperature of the liquid could be controlled by means of the vapour-jacket , by the arrangement shown in the figure .
The liquids in the bulb B boiled under known pressures , regulated by the gauge and the temperature could be varied at will .
( For further details see \#163 ; Trans. Chem. Soc. , ' vol. 47 , p. 640 , and * Phil. Trans. , ' 1887 , A , p. 69 .
) As in the experiments of Bamsay and Young , the liquids employed to secure constant temperatures were :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Alcohol ( 40 ' to 70 ' ) , ( 2 ) chlorobenzene ( 70c to 130 ' ) , ( 3 ) bromobenzene ( 120 ' to 150 ' ) , ( 4 ) aniline ( 150 ' to 180 ' ) , ( 5 ) quinoline ( 180 ' to 230 ' ) , ( 6 ) bromonaphthalene ( 220 ' to 280 ' ) , and ( 7 ) dibenzylketone ( 280 ' to 330 ' ) .
The method of filling the tube free from air , was as follows :\#151 ; The tube was disconnected , the cap N slipped along T towards the bend , and the projecting end of Fig. 3 .
the glass tube was sealed to a bulb , a constriction being left between the tube and the bulb , and also on the tube on which the bulb was blown , as shown in the figure .
The liquid was then introduced into the bulb , some mercury was added , and the tube A was then connected with an air-pump , the liquid being heated , if necessary .
After it had boiled vigorously for some minutes , and all air had been expelled from tube and bulb , the tube was drawn off at the constriction B. The liquid in the barometer-tube was then repeatedly boiled so as to remove all traces of air from the walls of the tube ; the liquid forms pistons , which are pushed out by its vapour , and effectually expel all traces of air or dissolved gas .
On cooling the barometer-tube , liquid enters ; when a sufficient quantity has entered , the tube is tilted in the direction shown by the arrow , to cause mercury to enter ; and when all is cold , the constriction C is cut , and after the cap has been slipped into position , the tube is inserted into the apparatus .
It is easy to do this without admitting a trace of air , and the capillary ascent takes place , therefore , in presence only of the vapour of the substance .
The measurement of the capillary rise was effected by means of a very fine capillary tube t , enclosed in the wider tube T. This tube , about 6 centims. in length , had a minute hole blown in a small bulb at its lower end , and at this point it was attached to a shorter and less fragile rod , which served as a support , and on which the glass was thickened in several places , so that it maintained a constant position in the tube T. Matters were so arranged that the small bulb with the hole in it was completely covered by the liquid .
The liquid thus gained access to the capillary tube , and the heights to which it rose were measured by screwing in the plunger , so as to raise the meniscus in the capillary tube t to within a millimetre or two of its upper end .
By so doing , all the readings were taken at a portion of the capillary tube of which the diameter had been measured , and corrections for its probably varying bore were thus rendered unnecessary .
The diameter of the capillary tube was originally measured by cutting off a small cylinder of about half a millimetre in length from its upper end , and measuring its internal diameter by a microscope provided with a micrometer scale , the length of whose divisions was determined at the same focus by reading against a standard scale .
The diameter of the tube used was 0,2587 millim. In this way a series of heights was obtained for the liquids investigated ; but these heights obviously do not represent the true capillary rise ; for the liquid in the barometer-tube T always stood at a higher level than if the barometer-tube had been of wider bore .
Corrections.\#151 ; To correct the read heights so as to make them represent the heights in the capillary tube standing in a tube so wide that capillary rise may be neglected , the tube T was opened at its upper end , after the measurement had been completed , and its lower end was sealed to a tube bent twice at right angles , and connected with a tube of about 3 centims. diameter , the axis of which lay parallel to the barometer tube .
Readings of the height to which the liquid in the tube T ( with the capillary tube still enclosed ) ascended above the level of liquid in the wide-bore tube , where capillary rise is too small to be appreciable , were then made with the cathetometer at the ordinary temperature , 15 ' to 20 ' C. , the temperature being accurately observed at each measurement .
Knowing that the capillary rise is zero at the critical point of VARIATION OF MOLECULAR SURFACE-ENERGY WITH TEMPERATURE .
665 the liquid , ' and knowing from our experiments that the relation between capillary ascent and temperature is a nearly linear one , the rise in the tube T could be calculated approximately enough for our purpose by constructing a diagram in which the rise at atmospheric temperature was made one end of a straight line connecting it with the critical temperature , where the rise is zero .
At intermediate temperatures the rise in the tube T was read off from the diagram ; it may be taken as practically accurate ; for any divergence from truth is much less than the limits of error in reading the ascent in the narrow capillary tube .
This rise was therefore added to the apparent rise in the capillary tube , and the sum was taken to represent the total rise .
No correction has been made for the increase in internal diameter of the capillary tube due to rise of temperature .
The surface-tension is directly proportional to the diameter of the tube ; but as the latter is increased by only 0'5 per cent , for a rise of temperature of nearly 400 ' , the correction was neglected .
Nor has any correction been introduced for the form of the meniscus .
The total correction should have amounted to 0'05 millim. But readings were taken with the lowrer edge of the cross-line of the cathetometer on the lower surface of the meniscus , so that the minute error was thereby somewhat compensated .
In calculating the results of experiments so as to ascertain the surface-tension , it has been assumed that there is no angle of contact between the liquid and the glass .
The reasons for this assumption are as follows:\#151 ; * A tube of capillary bore ( 0'65 millim. ) contained ether free from air .
It was connected with the pressure-apparatus , and its temperature was raised .
Bubbles were made to appear in the tube , and it was found possible , at any given temperature , to keep them stationary ; they did not ascend , or more correctly , the rate of ascent was exceedingly slow , so that a bubble might be kept for an hour , without rising a millimetre .
A bubble in such a capillary tube is confined on its lower and upper surfaces by cups of liquid ; the walls of the tube between these cups is wet , it is true , but by an exceedingly thin film of liquid ; so thin that the transference of liquid from the upper to the lower part of the tube is very slow , and hence the almost stationary position of the bubble .
By decreasing the volume of the bubble on screwing in the plunger , the cups approached each other , the lower cup rising nearer to the dome confining the bubble of vapour on its upper side .
The bubble began to ascend rapidly only when its vertical diameter had been made equal to its horizontal diameter ; i.e. , when it was approximately spherical .
Above 160 ' C. a bubble of ether refused to remain stationary in the tube , but at once ascended ; and with ethyl alcohol , the ascent commenced above 220 ' .
These temperatures are evidently conditioned by the stability ot the * Some of these experiments were made in conjunction with Mr. R. W. Stewart , B.Sc. , with whom one of the authors made a preliminary survey of the field in 1891 and to whom he desires to express his acknowledgments .
upper dome of liquid ; and with a narrower tube , the temperature above which the bubble could not be induced to remain stationary was much higher .
In no case did it ascend until it had been made approximately spherical by compression .
Now , had there been an angle of contact , it would have been necessary to compress the bubble until its shape had become lenticular , i.e. , until its vertical diameter had become less than its horizontal diameter .
This was never observed , and we conclude that there is , therefore , no angle of contact between a liquid which wets glass and the glass , if its surface is in presence only of its own vapour .
But we have obtained evidence that the capillary rise in air differs to a small extent from that in the vapour of the liquid , and , under these circumstances , there may well be an angle of contact .
For example , with ethyl oxide , the read height in air was 37'40 millims. , while in contact with its own vapour the rise was 36'5 millims , ; with methyl formate , the numbers are 40'9 and 39'9 ; with carbon tetrachloride , 27'5 and 25'4 ; with benzene , 51'9 and 49'6 .
Such discrepancies might be due to the angle of contact existing in presence of air , but not in presence of vapour ; or it might be due to a film of moisture on the surface of the liquids .
But it is noteworthy that those liquids which are most easily volatile at ordinary temperatures give measurements in air which most nearly corroborate the rectilinear relation .
The surface-energies , moreover , calculated from the rise of a liquid in contact with its own vapour , lie on the curve prolonged to \#151 ; 890,8 ; while those calculated from the capillary rise in air lie off the curves to a greater or less extent .
The reduction of the read heights in the capillary tube to dynes per linear centimetre was effected in the usual manner , by means of the equation y = \r.h.g.- \lt ; r ) , where r is the radius of the tube , h the height to which the liquid is raised , g the gravitation constant , p the density of the liquid , and tr that of the vapour .
In the accompanying Tables the experimental results are stated .

Experiments at Low Temperatures .
To measure the capillary rise at \#151 ; 890,8 , the temperature of nitrous oxide boiling under atmospheric pressure , an arrangement different from that described was resorted to .
A tube , about 2 centims. wide and 20 centims. long , was sealed at one end ; into it was inserted a capillary tube of known diameter , provided with three glass struts or knobs at each end , so as to make it stand vertically in the wider tube .
After the capillary tube had been introduced , the wider tube was drawn off at its upper end , to form a narrow neck , through which it could be exhausted .
The pure liquid was then introduced , and , after the tube had been rinsed with it several times , 3 or 4 cub. centims. were left in ; the tube was then exhausted , and the liquid was made to boil under reduced pressure for some time , so that its vapour might expel all traces of air .
The capillary neck was then sealed .
Observations were made of the capillary ascent at the ordinary temperature , the whole tube having been immersed in water for this purpose .
It was then placed in a double-walled tube containing liquid nitrous oxide , with a few shreds of platinum at the bottom , so as to keep the liquid in constant ebullition .
Such double-walled tubes , from the space between the walls of which the air has been exhausted as recommended by Dewar , make it possible to 072 PROFESSOR W. RAMSAY AND DR. J. SHIELDS ON THE keep a considerable quantity-say , 100 centims.\#151 ; of nitrous oxide liquid for several hours ; and if the liquid be filtered into the tube , to remove particles of ice , it is absolutely limpid and clear ; and the radiation of heat through the walls is so slow that it is only occasionally necessary to wipe off the dew which deposits .
Readings may be made with a cathetometer with perfect ease .
It is , of course , necessary to have the nitrous oxide at a level considerably higher than that of the liquid in the capillary tube , so as to ensure that the surface of the liquid in the capillary tube shall be at the temperature \#151 ; 89'-8 , and some time must be given to allow the liquid to reach the low temperature .
The rise is a slow one ; but in half-an-hour the position of the liquid in the capillary tube is permanent .
The defect of this method is that readings must be taken at different parts of the capillary tube , for there is no means of adjusting the level of the liquid so that its surface is always at a definite point in the capillary .
The differences which we have observed between the actual values of surface energy and the calculated values , which amount to about 2 per cent. , are probably due to this cause , and to a slight error in determining the diameter of the tube ; it was found by weighing the mercury which filled a known length , while the diameter of the other tube was found by the much surer method of direct reading .
Description of Plates 24 and 25 .
Plate 24 shows the height of ascent of liquid in the capillary tube , in millimetres , mapped against temperature as ordinates .
Two points call for special notice .
First , the continuous lines , indicating the rise , end abruptly at the respective critical points .
In no case is there any change of curvature as the critical point is approached .
Hence , although observations near the critical temperature are difficult to make , the correctness of readings from the curve is very probable , inasmuch as the curve could not follow any other course than that drawn .
This enabled us to calculate the surface energy of chlorobenzene , a liquid which was not examined above 333 ' , and , moreover , it confirms the observations at lower temperatures of that and the other liquids .
Second , it is to be remarked that the lines showing the difference of heights with temperature of acetic acid and of the two alcohols are much more curved than those representing the other substances .
The broken lines represent the surface tension in dynes .
Here it is to be noticed that acetic acid and the alcohols give lines of double curvature , while the other substances give continuous curves .
It is difficult to explain the behaviour of methyl formate below 20 ' .
Readings taken on two separate days at \#151 ; 890-8 gave practically the same height , viz. , 39*8 d 40 1 millims. rise , in the wider capillary ; this corresponds to 54'5 and 54'9 variation of molecular surface-energy with temperature .
673 millims. rise in the narrow capillary with which the other observations were made But such observations demand abrupt change of curvature between -f- 20 ' and \#151 ; 90 ' As we have no intermediate observations to guide us , the lines are not drawn " Plate 25 exhibits the variation of surface-energy with temperature .
The close approach to parallelism of the straight lines is noteworthy ; * , in the equation y ( Mr)* = / c ( r - d)has nearly the same numerical value for all substances , except of course , for those which associate .
The steeper slope of the curves of acetic acid and of the alcohols is well marked , and also the reflex curvature ; for at temperatures near the critical temperatures , the deviation , ( 1 - 10~At ) begins to tell ; while at low temperatures the lines are curved owing to association of simple molecules to complex molecular groups .
