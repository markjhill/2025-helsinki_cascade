" Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism.\#151 ; No. XIII .
" By General Sir Edward Sabine , K.C.B. , V.P.R.S. Received June 19 , 1872 .
( Abstract .
) The author presents this paper as the companion of No. XI .
of his Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism , which contained the Magnetic Survey of the Southern Hemisphere from 40 ' south latitude to the extreme limit towards the southern pole , as does the present memoir , No. XIII .
of the same series , the three magnetic elements from 40 ' north latitude to the furthest attained limit towards the northern pole .
In both papers the mean epoch is the same , viz. 1842-5 .
Where it has been possible to do so , corrections to this mean epoch have been obtained and applied to earlier and later observations .
The determinations are derived from observers of all countries , and are arranged in zones , each of 5 ' of latitude , passing round the globe .
The Table thus formed contains between 3000 and 4000 stations at which the magnetic elements have been determined .
The observers are named , and references are made to the sources from whence their observations are taken .
The paper is accompanied by maps of the resulting Isogonic , Isoclinal , and Isodynamic Lines , executed at the Hydrographic Office .

" On the Law of Extraordinary Refraction in Iceland Spar .
" By G. G. Stokes , M.A. , Sec. R.S. Received June 20 , 1872 .
It is now some years since I carried out , in the case of Iceland spar , the method ol examination of the law of refraction which I described in my report on Double Refraction , published in the Report of the British .
Ss'ciation for the year 1862 , p. 272 .
A prism , approximately right-angled isosce es , was cut in such a direction as to admit of scrutiny , across the acute angles , in directions of the wave-normal within the crystal composing lespectively inclinations of 90 ' and 45 ' to the axis .
The directs ^ ' ^ *e CU^ ^aces were referred by reflection to the cleavage-planes , and m^-by to the axis .
The light observed was the bright D of a soda-flame .
vol 6 reSU^ 'bfained was , that Huygens 's construction gives the true law
