( Abstract .
) The following paper is a continuation of the two preceding Memoirs on the same subject .
It has a fourfold object .
In the first place , I calculate the general values of the coefficients in the BinomialTheorem given in the first Memoir .
In the next place , I give an expression for the form of the coefficient of the general term of the multinomial theorem as previously explained .
I then give a theorem for the multiplication of symbolical factors emanating from each other after a given law ; and lastly , I investigate a binomial theorem , reciprocal to the binomial theorem already considered .
