A paper was read , entitled , " On the Position of the North Mag ?
netic Pole .
" By Commander James Clark Ross , R.N. , F.R.S. The author remarks that the discordanc.es in former observations made with a view to determine the position of the magnetic pole , have arisen partly from the irregularity of distribution in the earth of the substances which exert magnetic power , and partly from the great distances from the magnetic poles at which these observations have been made .
The latter cause of uncertainty has been now , in a great measure , removed , by the numerous and accurate observations made during the late arctic expeditions .
The object of the present paper is to put on record those which were made in the last voyage of Captain Ross , in which a spot was reached corresponding to the true north magnetic pole on the surface of the earth .
The nature of the instruments , and the difficulties encountered in their practical employment , under thecircumstancesof theexpedition , are fully stated .
Having arrived , on the 1st of June , at north latitude 70ยง 5 ' 17 ' ' , and west longitude 9Gยง 45'48 " , the horizontal magnetic needle exhibited no determinate directive tendency , and the dipping needle was within a minute of the vertical position , a quantity which may be supposed to come within the limits of the errors of observation ; hence the author concludes that this spot may be considered as the true magnetic pole , or as a very near approximation to it , as far , at least , as could be ascertained with the limited means of determination of which he was then in possession .
A table of the observations , including those on the intensity of the magnetic force at various stations , is subjoined .
