The action of the low temperature produced by liquid air upon the magnetic moment of steel magnets was studied by one of us in a few cases in a preliminary research made some time ago.* We have recently returned to the subject and made further investigations on the influence of the low temperatures thus obtained on magnetised iron and steels of very various compositions , with the object of determining the nature of the changes which take place in the magnetic moment of small magnets constructed of these metals , when cooled gradually or suddenly down to the lowest temperature obtainable by the use of boiling liquid air .
The arrangements adopted in this investigation were as follows :\#151 ; A reflecting magnetometer consisting of three small magnetised needles of watch-spring steel , cemented to a concave glass mirror , suspended by a single cocoon fibre , was placed in a tube so as to be free from disturbance by draughts of air .
The small magnets were 8 to 10 mm. in length .
The image of a portion of the filament of an incandescent lamp was reflected by the mirror on to a divided scale placed at a distance of 70 cm .
from the mirror .
The edge of the very sharp image of the filament , focussed upon the scale , * Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution , " On the Scientific Uses .of Liquid Air , " by Janies Denar , LL. D. , F.R.S. , January 19 , 1894 .

Changes produced enabled any angular displacement of the magnetometer needle to be easily determined .
The position of this magnetometer needle was regulated by the field produced by an external controlling magnet .
The small magnet , the behaviour of which at low temperatures was to be studied , was placed behind the magnetometer , with its oentre at a distance of 1 to 10 cm .
from the centre of the magnetometer needle and its axis in a direction passing through the centre of the magnetometer needle , and at right angles to the direction of the undisturbed magnetometer needle .
The magnet to be examined was fixed to a brass wire , held in a wooden support in such fashion that the magnet under examination , could be easily removed from its position behind the magnetometer , and restored to it again exactly .
A large number of samples of steel and iron were then prepared in the form of small needles , generally 15 mm. long and about 1 mm. in diameter .
These steels comprised nickel steels , with various percentages of nickel ; chromium steels , with various percentages of chromium ; aluminium steels , with various percentages of aluminium ; tungsten steels , manganese steels , silicon steel , ordinary carbon steels in various states of tempering , soft-annealed transformer iron , soft-iron wire , and the same irons hardened by hammering .
For most of these samples of steels we were indebted to Mr. R. A. Hadfield , of Sheffield , who kindly furnished them to one of us in the form of wires .
These short steel magnets were then all magnetised to " saturation " by placing them for a few moments between the poles of a powerful electro-magnet .
One by one they were then placed in position behind the magnetometer , and the deflection produced on the magnetometer needle observed .
In any particular case this deflection may be taken as approximately representing the intensity of magnetisation of the sample , although , owing to the varying sizes of the sample and distance from the magnetometer , the deflections in the case of different magnets are not comparable with one another , and cannot be taken as indicating the relative intensities of magnetisation of two different samples .
This , however , was not important , as our object was not to compare the absolute values of the magnetisation of different classes of steels , but to observe the mode of variation of the magnetisation of any one sample when cooled from ordinary temperatures down to the temperature of liquid air .
The method of proceeding was then as follows :\#151 ; Having adjusted the image of the lamp filament to the zero of the scale , the small magnet under observation was placed behind the magnetometer , and the deflection of the magnetometer needle observed .
A small vacuum-jacketed cup , filled with liquid ah , was then brought up underneath the sample , and by its aid the magnet cooled suddenly in situ to a temperature in the neighbourhood of \#151 ; 186 ' C. In the Magnetised Iron , Spc .
, cooled to of Liquid Air .
59 ?
nany cases this sudden cooling immediately deprived the magnet of a considerable percentage of its magnetisation , and the magnetic moment was reduced .
This , however , was not universally the case .
In some cases , as in that of the chromium steels , the first effect of this sudden cooling was an increase in the magnetic moment of the magnet ; in other cases hardly any change in the magnetic moment at all .
The vessel of liquid air was then removed , and the magnet allowed to heat up again , which it very quickly did , to the temperature of the room , or rather to a temperature at which the deposit of snow formed upon the needle immediately on coming out of the liquid air , fully melted .
This was taken to be at about 5 ' C. It was found that each magnet had certain peculiarities of its own .
Taking first the ordinary carbon steel ( a sample of knitting-needle steel ) we observe the following facts :\#151 ; Knitting-needle Steel ( a ) Tempered Glass Hard.\#151 ; The first effect of cooling this magnet was to diminish the magnetic moment by 6 per cent. On allowing the magnet to heat up again to the ordinary temperature , the magnetic moment still further diminished by about 16 per cent. On cooling again the magnetic moment increased 10 per cent. , and from and after that time cooling the magnet always increased the magnetic moment , and allowing to heat , up again to ordinary temperature always diminished the magnetic moment , the magnetic moment at \#151 ; 185 ' C. being about 10 per cent , greater than the magnetic moment at 5 ' 0 .
The first effect , therefore , of the cooling was to permanently diminish the magnetic moment , but after a few alternations of heating and cooling , the magnet reached a permanent condition in which its moment , when cold , was greater than its moment when warm .
These changes of magnetisation may be best represented as in the diagram in fig. 1 , in which the firm lines represent to some arbitrary scale the moment of the magnet when at its ordinary temperature of 5 ' C. , and the dotted lines represent to the same scale the moment of the magnet when cooled to \#151 ; 185 ' C. Knitting-needle Steel ( b ) Medium Temper.\#151 ; The same general results were obtained with knitting-needle steel tempered to a medium temper .
The first effect of the cooling to the low temperature was to diminish the moment of the magnet .
On allowing it to heat up again the moment of the magnet diminished still more .
The next cooling caused an increase of magnetic moment , and from and after that time the steel settled down into a permanent condition in which the magnetic moment was greater at \#151 ; 185 ' C. than at 5 ' C. by nearly 20 per cent , of its value at 5 ' C. ( see fig. 2 ) .
Knitting-needle Steel ( c ) Annealed Soft.\#151 ; The same general course of events was noticed in the case of the knitting-needle steel when made soft by heating to a red heat and allowing it to cool very 60 Profs .

slowly .
In this case , however , the first diminution of magnetic moment was still greater .
On first immersion in the liquid air the magnet lost about 33 per cent , of its moment .
On allowing if to heat up again to 5 ' C. it still further diminished in moment , and from and after that point it arrived soon at a permanent condition , in which its moment , when cold , was greater than its moment when warm by 30 per cent , of its moment at 5 ' C. These Magnetised Iron , $c .

changes of the medium- and soft-tempered steel are represented by the lines in the diagrams 2 and 3 , in which the firm lines are proportional to the magnetic moment of the magnet at 5 ' C. , and the dotted lines proportional to the magnetic moment at \#151 ; 185 ' C. It will be seen that , in the case of this carbon steel , the effect of softening the steel is to make more pronounced the effect of the final temperature changes ; the change of moment caused by cooling from the ordinary temperature to the temperature of liquid air , when the permanent condition has been reached , being in the case of the glass-hard steel an increase of magnetic moment of about 12 per cent. ; in the case of the same steel with a medium temper about 22 per cent. , and in the case of the same steel tempered very soft about 33 per cent , ( see fig. 3 ) .
Chromium Steels.\#151 ; Observations were then made with the magnets of chromium steel , having respectively 0'29 per cent. , 1*18 per cent. , 5*44 per cent. , and 9'18 per cent , of chromium .
In all these cases the first effect of cooling the magnet was to cause at once an increase of magnetic moment , and the subsequent heating up again to the ordinary temperature caused a decrease of magnetic moment .

The variation of magnetic moment in the case of these magnets is shown by the diagrams 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 , in which the firm lines represent the magnetic moment when the magnet is at 5 ' 0 .
, and the dotted lines the magnetic moment at \#151 ; 185 ' C. It will be seen , therefore , that in the case of the magnets there was no such initial decrease of magnetisation as in the case of the carbon steel magnets .
The analysis of these steels was furnished to us by Mr. Hadfield , and is appended to the diagrams .
These steels are all in their hard condition , and possess considerable coercive force .
Aluminium Steels.\#151 ; the aluminium steels employed had the following percentages of aluminium , viz. : 0'72 , 1T6 , and 1'60 .
In all these cases the first effect of cooling the magnet made of these steels was to cause a very small diminution in the magnetic moment , but not more than about 2 per cent , ( see figs. 8 , 9 , and 10 ) .

J. Dewar and J. A. Fleming .
Changes produced liquid air was to cause the magnet to possess a magnetic moment about 10 per cent , greater at \#151 ; 185 ' C. than at 5 ' 0 .
It will be seen , therefore , that these steels differ from the chromium steels in this respect , that whereas in the chromium steels the effect of the first cooling is to cause an increase in magnetic moment ; in the case of the aluminium steels , the effect of the first cooling was to cause a decrease of magnetic moment , although much smaller relatively than in the case of the carbon steels .
Nickel Steels.\#151 ; Experiments were then made with samples of nickel steel containing 094 , 3'82 , 7'6-5 , 19'64 , and ' 29 per cent , of nickel .
These steels exhibited some rather interesting peculiarities .
In the case of the nickel steel with 094 per cent , of nickel , the effect of the first cooling in liquid air was to cause a very small decrease in magnetic moment ( see fig. 11 ) , and the subsequent heating and cooling Fig- , 11.\#151 ; Nickel steel .
Ni = 0-94 C =0*13 Si = 0 *23 Mn = 0-72 Fe = 97-98 brought the steel into a condition in which its magnetic moment , when cold , was always greater than its magnetic moment when warm , by about 10 or 11 per cent. In the case of the nickel steel with 3'82 per cent , of nickel , the effect of the changes of temperature was very similar ( see fig. 12 ) , and also in the case of the nickel steel having 7 65 per cent , of nickel the order of the changes was not very different in this respect , that the magnetic moment when cold was Fig. 12.\#151 ; Nickel steel .

65 greater than the magnetic moment when warm , when the permanent state had been reached .
But it will be noticed from the diagrams ( see 13 ) that in the case of the 7'65 per cent , nickel stee ] , the effect of the first cooling was to cause a slight increase in magnetic moment .
A remarkable peculiarity , however , was found in the case of the 19'64 per cent , nickel steel .
In this case the effect of the first cooling was to cause a very considerable reduction of magnetic moment , very nearly 50 per cent. , that is to say , the magnetic moment fell instantly , on cooling in the liquid air , to about half the value that it had at the beginning of the experiment .
On taking the magnet out of the liquid air and allowing it to warm up again to the temperature of the room , the magnetic moment immediately increased again , and from and after that time the effect of the temperature change on the magnetic moment was such that the magnetic moment , when cooled to the \#166 ; temperature of liquid air , was always less than the magnetic moment at 5 ' C. by about 25 per cent , of the latter value .
These relative changes are shown in the diagram ( fig. 14 ) .

The sample of 29 per cent , nickel steel was then examined , and it was found that the magnetic changes produced in it on heating and cooling were of the same general character as in the case of the 19 per cent , sample , only less 66 Profs .

Changes produced marked .
Steels having these high percentages of nickel are , as Dr. J. Hopkinson has pointed out , * remarkable for the wide range of temperature within which they can exist in two states , one considerably magnetic , and one practically non-magnefcic or but feebly magnetic .
In these two states their mechanical and other physical properties are entirely different .
In the experiments here mentioned , the nickel steel samples were iu the magnetic condition .
They are put into this condition by dipping for one moment in liquid air , and are only transformed back into the feebly magnetic condition by heating to a cherry-red heat .
The 29 per cent , sample of nickel steel being in the magnetic condition was magnetised by contact with the poles of the electromagnet .
On cooling it in liquid air it immediately lost about 20 per cent , of its moment , on warming up again to 5 ' C. it lost about 5 per cent , more , and from and after that point remained in a condition in which cqoling the magnet to \#151 ; 185 ' C. caused its moment to become about 10 per cent , less than it was at 5 ' C. Hence the 29 per cent , nickel steel exhibits the same quality but in a less marked degree than the 19 per cent. , in that its magnetic moment is decreased by cooling to \#151 ; 185 ' C. , and recovers again on heating up to 5 ' C. In this respect the two samples of nickel steel differ from all other samples of steel which we have examined , in that they have a negative temperature coefficient for magnetic moment change with temperature , after the first change on cooling has taken place .
Pure Nickel.\#151 ; In order to see if this peculiarity extended to pure nickel , we examined the behaviour of a small magnet made with Mr. Mond 's pure nickel , but we found that such a nickel magnet , magnetised to saturation , behaved exactly as did a carbon steel magnet ( see fig. 15 ) .
The effect of the first cooling to the temperature of liquid air was to diminish the magnetic moment .
On allowing the magnet to heat up again to the ordinary temperature the moment diminished still more , and from and after that time the behaviour of the magnet was perfectly normal , that is to say , its magnetic moment when at 5 ' C. was less than its magnetic moment at \#151 ; 186 ' C. , but only by about 3 or 4 per cent , of the latter value .
Silicon Steel.\#151 ; A sample of silicon steel , containing 2'67 per cent , of silicon , behaved in a normal manner ( see fig. 16 ) .
The magnet experienced a permanent diminution of moment on cooling for the first time , and after that , its magnetic moment when cold was greater than its magnetic moment when warm .
Soft Iron.\#151 ; In order to determine if similar changes of magnetic moment could be produced in the case of soft annealed iron , small magnets of Swedish iron were prepared , formed of a short length , about 15 mm. , of soft iron , or a small slip of annealed transformer iron .

those in the case of the carbon steels , only with very much narrower limits of variation .
The first cooling hardly produced any change whatever in the magnetic moment of the magnet .
On allowing it to heat up again , the magnetic moment was very slightly diminished , and thenceforth the changes of moment were such that the magnetic moment was greater when the magnet was cold than when it was warm , by about 2 or 3 per cent , of the latter value .
In the case of a straight , soft iron magnet , formed of annealed transformer iron , the curious fact was noticed that whereas a rapid cooling of the magnet by plunging into liquid air hardly produced any effect on the magnetic moment after the first initial loss of magnetism had taken place on cooling , the effect of a slow cooling down to the temperature of \#151 ; 185 ' C. was always to produce a permanent diminution of magnetic moment .
Hence the magnetism of this soft iron sample could be frittered away by a process of slow cooling to ~185'C .
, and intermediate heating up to 5'C .
These changes of moment are represented in the diagram of fig. 18 .

glass-6ard carbon steel ( see fig. 19 ) , the changes in magnetic moment being relatively about the same percentage for the same temperature change : that is to say , the magnet had a moment of about 10 per cent , greater at \#151 ; 185 ' C. than at 5 ' C. A series of tungsten steels were then examined , having respectively 1 , 7*5 , and 15 per cent , of tungsten in them .
Magnets were prepared of these steels , both in the glass-hard condition and in a carefully annealed condition .
These steels were found to resemble the simple carbon steels in that the first effect of cooling the magnet to \#151 ; 186'C .
was to cause a diminution of magnetic moment , and the subsequent -warming up again to 5 ' C. , a still further decrease in magnetic moment .
From that time forth cooling the magnet always caused an increase of magnetic moment .
The effect of increasing the percentage of tungsten was to cause a decrease in the variation of the magnetic moment over a given temperature range .
That is to say , the hardened 15 per cent , tungsten steel temporarily lost magnetic moment to the extent of about 6 per cent , by heating up from \#151 ; 185 ' C. to 5 ' C. when once the initial condition had been passed .
The 7'5 per cent , tungsten steel lost moment to the extent of about 10 per cent. , and the 1 per cent , tungsten steel lost moment to the extent of about 12 per cent , when the temperatures rose between the same limits .
As regards these tungsten steels , softening the steel caused the magnetic moment to decrease by a greater percentage when heated up from \#151 ; 185 ' C. to 5 ' C. than was found to be the case when the steel was in its hard condition .
A sample of manganese steel containing 12 per cent , of manganese was rendered magnetic by heating for 24 hours to a dull red heat .
A small magnet prepared from this steel was found capable of retaining 70 Profs .
J. Dewar and J. A. Fleming .
Changes produced magnetism .
On cooling it to \#151 ; 185 ' C. , it slightly increased in magnetic moment , and on heating np again to 5 ' C. , its magnetic moment decreased to the extent of about 3 per cent , of its moment at \#151 ; 185'C .
There was no initial decrease of moment in this case .
In this respect , therefore , it resembled the chromium steel magnets .
Broadly speaking , the results so far obtained are:\#151 ; ( 1 ) That the sudden cooling to the temperature of liquid air usually permanently decreases the magnetic moment of short magnets made of many varieties of steel , assuming them to have been initially magnetised in a strong field .
( 2 ) This initial decrease is .
found both in hardened steels bavins ' great coercive force , and also in the same steels in a soft or annealed condition , and is especially conspicuous in the case of the 19 percent , nickel steel .
( 3 ) In the case of most steels so far examined , the effect of cooling magnets made of them to \#151 ; 185 ' C. is to temporarily increase the magnetic moment after the permanent magnetic condition has been reached .
( 4 ) The exceptions to the above rule so far noted are the nickel steels with percentages of nickel from 19 to 29 per cent. , in which case the magnetic moment is always decreased temporarily by cooling to \#151 ; 185 ' C. , after the permanent magnetic condition has been reached .
( 5 ) It appears from these experiments that one of the best ways of ageing a permanent magnet is to dip it several times into liquid air .
It then arrives at a constant condition in which subsequent temperature changes have a definite effect , and in which the subpermanent magnetism is removed .
Note added May 4 .
Since the 19 per cent , nickel steel magnet increases in magnetic moment when heated from \#151 ; 185 ' C. to +o'C .
, and since it is well known that at some higher temperature it would lose magnetic moment altogether , it was considered very desirable to ascertain the temperature at which it would have its maximum magnetic moment .
The magnet was accordingly heated ( on April 2 ) in an oil bath gradually up to a temperature of about 300 ' C. , and the deflections of the magnetometer observed at intervals , both as the temperature rose and as it fell .
The result showed that this nickel steel magnet continued to increase in magnetic moment , until a temperature of about 30J 0 .
was reached , and the magnetic moment then began to decrease .
At a temperature of +300 ' C. , the moment of the magnet was not much greater than it was at \#151 ; 185 ' C. On cooling down again from Magnetised Iron , $c .
, cooled to Temperature of Liquid Air .
71 300 ' C. , the moment increased , but not to the same maximum as before , and on repeating the cycle of temperature from about 15c C. to 300c C. , the magnetic moment gradually varied , in the manner shown in fig. 20 , and the temperature of maximum magnetic moment t/ ariation of MdgneC/ c Moment : of A Niche/ Steel Mag with Temperature .

gradually shifted upwards to about 56 ' C. This magnet is , therefore , an interesting case of a sample of steel which , when magnetised , has a maximum magnetic moment at a certain temperature .
