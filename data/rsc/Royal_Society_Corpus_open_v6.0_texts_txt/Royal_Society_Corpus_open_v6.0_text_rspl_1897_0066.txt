The effect has also been shown by obtaining two photographs on the one plate ; one photograph being the result of an exposure to the light from two fluorescing cubes one behind the other , and the second photograph the result of superposing the effect of the Light from A alone , when fluorescing , upon that from B after having passed through A , when the latter was not fluorescing .
The exposure in each of the three cases being the same , a very distinct difference is shown in the result ; the superposed photographs being always the darker in the negative , notwithstanding the fact that the resultant-effect of superposing two photographs due to light of the same intensity , or nearly so , has been found not to be equal to but less than that due to light of double the intensity acting for half the time .
If the resultant effect were equal to the sum of the separate ones , the effect caused by the change of absorption would have been still more marked .
In the determinations of a. and ft a null method has been employed by which any appreciable want of uniformity in the illumination can be detected .
The source of illumination has been almost invariably the spark discharge of a Leyden jar between cadmium electrodes , being one of the richest sources of the fluorescence-exciting rays , and the photometer one specially constructed for the purpose .

( Abstract .
) In Mr. Larmor 's Brit. Assoc. Report ( 1893 ) on the Action of Magnetism on Light , it is pointed out ( S 20 ) that there are two ways in which the magnetic field may affect the phenomena of light propagation , and two corresponding types of magneto-optic theory .
It is the object of the present paper to take the fundamental equations of the second type of theory in a general form on the lines of Mr. Larmor 's recent papers on Electrodynamics , and to develop them so as to obtain the solutions of the problems of magnetic reflection and of transmission through magnetised films ; the formulae so obtained are compared with the available experimental results , and the agreement of the theory with experiment thus put to the test .

The notation is nearly the same as Maxwell 's , ( P , Q , R ) , w ) , ( a , b , c ) , and K , having their usual significations ; a is specific conductivity , and C the velocity of radiation ; ( / , , ) corresponds to Maxwell 's total electric displacement , and has components ( / , h ) and ( / ' , g ' , h ' ) , of which the former is the displacement involved in the ether strain , and the latter that involved in the polarisation of the matter .
It being as usual assumed that for light oscillations the effective magnetic permeability is unity , the fundamental equations of the theory are as follows:\#151 ; ( i ) The two circuital relations , dc die db dz 47TU and dR dQ da dt ( ii ) The equations of the current , tt = \lt ; jP+y3Q\#151 ; 02R where the vector ( gu g2 , gO represents the Hall effect .

Sissingh and Zeeman on magnetic reflection their observations being measurements of the phase m and amplitude p of the " magneto-optic component " of the reflected light , for various angles of incidence .
It is noteworthy that the value of to derived from the theory involves \#174 ; , but not C0while the theoretical value of / i is proportional to Co , but does not involve * : this circumstance makes the test a severe one .

The following table will serve to indicate what sort of agreement is found to exist between the theory and the experiments .

Experiments on polar reflection from iron point to almost exactly the same value for x. If we suppose the value of Co to be given by -Co = 7-283 x 10-n , the ratios of the calculated to the observed values of / t for the above angles of incidence are found to be respectively 1T3 , 0 96 , 0'99 , 0-97 , l'Ol , 1-03 , and 0"97 ; so that in the case of the amplitudes also there is good agreement .

Eor nickel the agreement of theory with experiment , though not so exact as in the case of iron , is still very good .
The values indicated for the constants are x = 76 ' to 80 ' , \#151 ; C0 = 9-225 x 10"13 .
The agreement is better for cobalt , being specially good m the amplitude experiments .
Eor polar reflection at incidences of 45 , 60 ' , and 73 ' , the ratios of the calculated to the observed values of / t are ' found to be 0'98 , 0'97 , and T07 respectively .
The values indicated for the constants are a ; = 64 ' , -C " = 1'227 X KT10 .
7 .
The theory gives a satisfactory account of a phenomenon which has only recently been discovered , namely an effect of the component of magnetisation perpendicular to the plane of incidence .
The change of phase which measures this effect has been observed by Zeeman , who , in a particular case , found it to be 0003 X 90 ' , with a mean error of 0-001 X 90 ' .
The value indicated by the theory is 0-00243x90 ' .
8 .
Two of the many available experiments on transmission through magnetised metallic films are used to test the theory .
In one of these the rotation observed by Lobach is 1-62 ' , while the value indicated by the theory is 0-961 ' .
In the other the rotation observed by 490 Magnetic Properties of Iron at High Temperatures .
Drude is 4-25 ' , the theoretical value being 2'972 ' .
When it is borne in mind that the value of the magneto-optic constant derived from reflection experiments has here been applied to test experiments on transmission through films , with results not only of the same ordei of magnitude , but identical within the limits of uncertainty of the intensity of magnetisation , the agreement must be considered as a very satisfactory vindication both of the theory and of the experiments .
9 .
It is to be noticed that , as h , 6a , b3 are necessarily real , the imaginary part of CoeLX must be entirely accounted for by the Hall effect .
Hence the present theory involves the supposition that the Hall effect is very much greater for exceedingly rapidly alternating currents than for steady ones .
There is nothing unnatural in this supposition , which may be compared with the fact discovered by Maxwell , that the ordinary coefficients of conductivity are very much smaller in the optical circumstances .

The present note is for the purpose of correcting two points in my paper in the * Philosophical Transactions , A , vol. 180 .
First.\#151 ; I was of opinion that my experiments showed that heating iron above its critical point did not entirely destroy the effects of previous magnetisation .
Recent experiments I have made do not confiim this opinion .
I would therefore wish to delete the following sentences in which the matter is referred to , viz. Page 414 , lines 12 and 13 ; the first paragraph on page 454 ; the first two lines on page 4o5 ; ^the first paragraph on page 457 ; and from the words two things on line 5 to the word " second " on the same page .
Also in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' vol. 45 , page 321 , strike out the two paragraphs at the top of the page .
Second.\#151 ; I have since been unable to obtain so great recalescence with approximately pure iron as is shown in Curve XXXIX , and can only conclude that I must have been in error as to the composition of the sample examined .
I therefore wish in the last paragraph of the paper to speak of the sample as of unknown composition ; to strike out the words " This shows why soft iron apparently does not recalesce to substitute " this " for " the " and strike out " of the soft iron 99 in the last line .
I also take the opportunity of correcting an error in the joint paper of myself and Mr. Wilson , vol. 189 , pages 109\#151 ; 136 .
