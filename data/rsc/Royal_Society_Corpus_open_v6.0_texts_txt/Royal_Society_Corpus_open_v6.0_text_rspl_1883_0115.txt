The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " On some Relations of Chemical Corrosion to Voltaic Current .
" By G. Goke , F.R.S. , LL. D. Received February 11 , 1884 .
The chief object of this research was to ascertain the amounts of voltaic current produced by the chemical corrosion of known weights of various metals in different liquids .
The research was also made to throw light upon the conditions which determine the entire conversion of potential molecular energy into external ( i.e. , available ) electric current .
The method adopted was to take about six or eight ounces by measure of a corrosive electrolyte and divide it into two equal volumes in two similar glass vessels .
Two pieces of metal of equal dimensions were then cut from the same sheet , cleaned perfectly , and weighed .
One of the pieces was employed as the positive plate of a voltaic cell in one of the portions of liquid , and the other as a comparison corrosion , sheet in the other portion .
The negative metal of the voltaic cell was in nearly all cases a large cylinder of sheet platinum , and surrounded the positive one .
The positive and comparison plates were wholly immersed in the separate portions of liquid , except that the former had a narrow exterior projecting strip for connexion in a circuit .
The current from the cell was passed by means of a small sheet silver anode inch by ; S inch ) , and a smaller silver cathode ( \#163 ; inch by \#166 ; S. inch ) in a third vessel , through a cyanide of silver plating solution containing the least practicable proportion of free potassic cyanide in order to obtain the maximum amount of silver deposit .
During each experiment observations were made of any liberation 332 Dr. G. Gore .
On Relations of [ Feb. 2l of gas or formation of solid coating npon the plates , and of am other circumstance which appeared likely to affect the speed of corrosion , or weight of the plates , or of the deposited silver ; and in any case where any solid coating was found , it was entirely removed after the experiment , and previous to ascertaining the losses of weight by corrosion .
After the experiment the plates were well washed and carefully dried between hot sheets of filter-paper before weighing .
The metals and liquids employed were as pure as could conveniently be obtained , and distilled water was used for all the solutions .
The sample of potassic cyanide usually employed was found by analysis to contain 89'14 per cent , of the actual substance .
Nearly all the liquids were at the atmospheric temperature , and in nearly every case the comparison sheet was employed .
As the proportion of silver deposited to the amount of external !
current generated , and therefore also to the amount of positive metal ) corroded , varied to a very small extent with the density of the current !
at the cathode in the depositing solution ( see " Electrolytic Balance of Chemical Corrosion , " " Proc. Birm .
Phil. Soc. , " vol. iii , 1888 , pp. 278-304 ) , the amount of cathode surface was usually varied according to the apparent strength of the current and rate of deposition , being smaller as the strength of current was less .
The degrees of electromotive force were measured by the aid of two thermoelectric batteries , each consisting of about 300 pairs of iron and German silver , together with a Clark 's Standard cell ( see " Proc. Birm .
Phil. Soc. , " vol. iv , Pt. I ) .
The following table exhibits the results .
In the table the number of square inches given includes in each case the immersed portion of both surfaces of the positive metal and comparison plate .
The losses of the plates , and the weight of deposited silver , are in every instance expressed in grains , and the rates of loss of the positive plate are given in column 6 in grains per square inch per hour .
If the whole of the corroded portion of the positive metal produced external current , consistent in amount with the atomic weights and valencies of the metals as given in the table , and if that -amount be called 100 , then the proportions of such current actually obtained in the experiments are those given in column No. 9 .
The quantities of substance mentioned in column No. 1 were in each case per ounce of water .
Remarks .
Only those results which appeared reliable are inserted in the table ; many uncertain ones were omitted .
In some cases coatings of solid matter formed either upon the positive or comparison plates , or gas was evolved by the plates .
Cases in which the coatings could not be perfectly removed were rejected .

On Relations of [ Feb. 21 solid deposit containing black suboxide of magnesium formed upon the positive plate only.* And with aluminium in solution of iodic acid a compound of iodine was absorbed , and both the plate* increased about 16 per cent , in weight.t In seven cases ( Nos 6 , 7,14 , 28 , 65 , 67 , 81 ) , from causes which were not very apparent the comparison sheets lost weight more than the positive ones .
The considerable degree of variability of rate of ordinary corrosion detracted greatly from the usefulness of the comparison sheet .
The results show that the proportion of loss of the positive plate by ** local action " to that by corrosion attending external current , varied greatly in different cases ; with silver in a dilute solution of ferric sulphate , the latter amounted to only about 1*3 per cent , of the total corrosion , whilst with tin in weak hydrochloric acid it was as much as 95'25 per cent. In no instance was the whole of the metal dissolved ] by " local action , " and in no case was the whole of the corrosion ) attended by external current .
The amount of corrosion of the positive plate was in nearly all cases greater than that of the comparison one .
Six cases were selected from the table , in which the apparent corrosion of the latter sheet was the greatest , and some trouble was taken to ascertain by experiment whether either of these was a real one .
After varying the conditions of the trial in several ways , with pure copper in a mixture of 50 minims of pure nitric acid per ounce of distilled water , it was found that in this instance the comparison plate was always corroded the fastest .
As the amount of corrosion of the positive plate was in nearly all cases greater than that of the comparison one , and the proportion of gas to corrosion was also frequently less with the former than with the latter , a solid deposit was usually more readily formed on the positive plate than upon the comparison one , and the chemical products were not always exactly the same upon the two plates .
An instance of this kind occurred with amalgamated silver in a solution of potassic cyanide ; the positive plate alone became brown .
As the chemical products of " local action , " and of corrosion attended by external current , are usually the same , in cases where they are different , though resulting from the same materials , the total expenditure of potential molecular motion would probably be different , because the quantities of residual molecular energy of the ingredients would not be the same .
The proportion of corrosion of the positive plate accompanying external current , to that produced by " local action , " may be approximately arrived at , either by deducting from the total amount of corrosion of that plate the loss by weight of the comparison one , or by * See " Proc. Birin .

339 \#166 ; alculating from the quantity of deposited silver , together with the ralencies and atomic weights of the positive metal and of silver , the mount of the positive metal required to produce the current .
Each \gt ; f these methods however is imperfect ; the second is usually mueh the least so .
In several cases , by employing the former one , the amount jf deposited metal was found to be nearly equivalent to the amount )f corrosion accompanying external current , after making allowance for a small deficiency of deposited silver caused by a portion of the current traversing the free potassic cyanide in the depositing liquidThat the external current affects in some cases the amount of " local action " was shown by the following experiment:\#151 ; A sheet of platinum and one of ordinary zinc , not connected together , were partly immersed in dilute sulphuric acid , until a moderate stream of gas arose from the zinc .
On now connecting the two plates together by means of a wire , the stream from the zinc was conspicuously dimi-jnished .
The contact of a negative metal with the positive one iusually increased the total loss by corrosion , whilst it commonly decreased that caused by " local action .
" The results contained in the table further show that the proportion of corrosion attending external current ( as measured by the \#166 ; amount of silver deposited ) to that by " local action , " depends upon several conditions:\#151 ; 1st , upon the kind of metal ; thus it was usually greater with cadmium ( average 75*63 per cent. ) than with copper ( 3033 per cent. ) .
2nd , upon the kind of liquid ; it was greater with solution of potassic cyanide ( average 63*27 per cent. ) than with dilute nitric acid ( 31*14 per cent. ) .
And 3rd , upon the degree of concentration of the liquid ; a greater strength of solution frequently increased , and as frequently decreased , the proportion of corrosion accompanying external current to that by " local action .
" A variation of kind of metal also was attended by a greater change in the proportion of such corrosions than a variation of kind of liquid .
This latter circumstance is in harmony with the view that the potential molecular activity of metals is usually greater than that of electrolytes ( see " Relations of Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-Electric Action , " " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 36 , p. 50 ) .
The effect of amalgamation of the plates upon the proportion of those actions to each other was usually distinct .
In ten cases it increased , and in five decreased , the proportion of external electric current to " local action " currents .
With tin in dilute nitric acid , it greatly increased the proportion of external current to total corrosion , whilst with lead in a solution of potassic hydrate it had the opposite effect .
It appeared to increase that proportion the most in cases where much hydrogen was evolved , as with zinc in dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid .
In seven cases it increased and in nine 340 Chemical Corrosion and Voltaic Current .
[ Feb. 21 decreased the rate of total corrosion of the positive plate , and tht amount of the latter was five times that of the former ; and in sever instances it increased and in eleven decreased the loss of weight oi the comparison plate , and the amount of the latter was fourteen times that of the former .
The rate of total corrosion of the positive plate appeared to be related to the degree of electromotive force .
By comparing together Columns 4 and 6 of the table it was found that the instances of least electromotive force and lowest rate of corrosion coincided in the case of magnesium , zinc , tin , aluminium , iron , nickel , and copper ; and of greatest coincided in the case of lead and copper .
With magnesium the order of electromotive force was almost the same as that of total corrosion , and with copper it was partly so .
No. 24 in the tablet further illustrates the influence of decreased electromotive force .
The simple and chief explanation of the great variation in the proportion of corrosion by " local action " to that attended by external !
electric current , appears to be difference of electric-conduction-resistance .
Where there is no external circuit and the external resistance is infinite , as in cases of deposit of metal or hydrogen by simple immersion , the whole of the electricity flows through the local circuits and deposits its complete equivalent of metal , hydrogen , or both , on the negative parts of the positive plate ; but when the external resistance is least , and the resistance to circulation of local currents is greatest , nearly the whole of the electricity passes through the external circuit , and nearly the whole of the deposition of hydrogen or metal occurs on the negative plate .
In either case the full equivalent of electricity circulates .
With zinc and platinum in dilute sulphuric acid , the " local action " was diminished by closing the circuit .
By diminishing also the external resistance in relation to that in the battery by the employment of two voltaic cells in series , instead of one ( see No. 24 ) , the proportion of silver deposited was increased from 90'02 to 93'83 per cent , of the theoretical quantity .
Rate of corrosion depends chiefly upon the particular combination of metal and liquid , and is limited by the substance of weakest molecular action .
Thus the rates of corrodibility of magnesium in solution of potassic cyanide ( or in dilute hydrofluoric acid ) and in dilute sulphuric acid , are just the opposite of those of aluminium in the same liquids ; while magnesium dissolves very slowly in the former liquid and very rapidly in the latter , aluminium does quite the reverse ( see " Relations of Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-Electric Action , " " Proc.
