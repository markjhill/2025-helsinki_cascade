On the Developement of Exponential F1'unctions ; together with several new Theorems relating to finite Differences .
By John Frederick W. Herschel , Esq. F.R.S.Read December 14 , 1815 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1816 , p. 25 .
] The subject here considered by Mr. Herschel relates to the celebrated theorems of Lagrange , expressing the connection between simple exponential indices and those of differentiation and of integration .
Since the theorems have been demonstrated by various subsequent analysts , as by Laplace , by Arbogast , and by Dr. Brinkley , the author takes them for granted ; but observes that in their original form they are but abridged expressions of their meaning ; and that in order to become practically useful , their exponential functions require further development .
And though this part of the subject has been treated with great ability by Dr. Brinkley , who has deduced formulae respecting the first of the two theoremns far more simple than could have been expected from the complex nature of the subject ; yet since his method , when applied to the second more general theorem , would lead to details of extreme complexity , Mr. Herschel has taken a different view of the subject ; and beginning with the more general theorem has arrived at a general formula , which he believes to have been hitherto wholly unnoticed , and which , when applied to certain particular cases treated of by Dr. Brinkley , affords precisely the same results .
But the mode in which this subject is treated , or even the results , were not of a nature to admit of being read in public .
