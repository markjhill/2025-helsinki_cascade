Extract of a Letter from Mr. Edmund Pitt , Alderman of Worcester , a very knowing Botanist ; concerning the Sorbus Pyriformis .
LAst year I found a Rarity growing wild in a Forest of this County of Worcester .
It is described by L'Obelius under the name of Sorbus Pyriformis : as also by Mathiolus upon Dioscorides .
And by Bauhimus , under the name of Sorbus Procera .
And they agree , that in France , Germany , and Italy they are commonly found .
But neither These , nor any of our own Country-men , as Gerard , Parkinson , Johnson , How , nor those Learned Authors Merret or Ray , have taken notice of its being a Native of England .
Nor have any of our English Writers so much as mentioned it .
Saving , that Mr. Lyte , in his Translation of Dodonaeus , describes it under the name of the Sorb-Apple .
But saith no more of the place , but that it grows in DutchLand .
It resembles the Ornus or Quicken Tree ; only the Ornus bears the Flowers and Fruit at the end , This , on the sides of the Branch .
Next the Sun , the Fruit hath a dark-red blush : and is about the bigness of a small Juneting Pear .
In September , so rough , as to be ready to strangle one .
But being then gathered , and kept till October , they eat as well as any Medlar .
Thus far the Letter .
Q. Whether a Verjuyce made of this Fruit , either ground with Crabs , or Grapes , or if plentiful , alone , would not , being kept for some time , prove one of the best acid-astringent Sauces , that Nature affords .
