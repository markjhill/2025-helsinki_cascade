The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " On Crookes 's Force .
" By G. Johnstone Stony , M.A. , F.R.S. , and Richard J. Moss , F.C.S. Received January 12 , 1877 .
In two papers by one of the authors of the present communication , which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for March and April 1876 , it has been shown that the motion of the blackened disks of a Crookes 's radiometer can be explained by the known dynamical properties of the trace of gas which is present , and the term " Crookes s force is pio-posed to designate the reaction which comes into play between the blackened disks and the walls of the exhausted chamber when a difference of temperature exists between them .
Shortly after the first of these papers appeared we commenced an experimental investigation of the subject with the view of learning , if possible , the laws to which the force conforms .
The investigation is still in progress , and , being exceedingly tedious , it will require a great expenditure of time before it is completed ; we propose , however , in this preliminary paper to describe the apparatus and methods of observation employed , and to give some of the results already obtained .
If the pressure which is exerted on the blackened pith surfaces reacts on the sides of the glass envelope , it follows that a transparent disk delicately suspended close to a stationary disk of blackened pith ought to move away from the pith , and therefore towards the light , when the Messrs. G. J. Stony and R. J. Moss [ Feb. 22 , pith is illuminated .
This inference was submitted to the test of experiment by means of an apparatus represented in fig. 1 and constructed as follows :\#151 ; A piece of elder-pith 2*5 centims. in length and 1-2 centim. in breadth , blackened on one side , was fastened by one end to the interior sui'face of the bulb of an ordinary boiling-flask ( of about 200 cub. centims. capacity ) in such a manner that the free end of the pith extended towards the middle of the bulb .
A light glass rod with a small magnet on one end , and a disk of thin microscope-glass on the other end , was so suspended in the bulb that the glass disk could be readily balanced in a position nearly parallel with the surface of the blackened pith , and a few millims. distant from it .
The silk fibre from which the glass rod was suspended hung from a fixed arm at the upper end of a tube , the lower end of which was hermetically fastened into the neck of the flask .
An elongation of this tube ( not shown in the figure ) with a contraction for sealing , served to connect the apparatus with the exhaust-tube of a Sprengel pump .
The pump was set in action , and occasionally the flame of an ordinary gas-burner was held at a distance of about 10 centims. from the blackened pith , while the microscope-glass was closely watched .

] When the gauge of the pump showed a tension of 7 millims. , as compared with the mercurial column of a barometer standing in the same vessel of mercury , the glass disk was distinctly repelled from the pith and towards the source of light .
As the exhaustion was continued the repulsion between the pith and the glass increased .
The apparatus was sealed off from the pump when the mercury falling in the exhaust tube had for some days produced a metallic sound .
Feeble illumination now caused the glass disk to be forcibly driven away from the pith* .
We now endeavoured to determine quantitatively the influence of variations in the tension of the residual gas , and also the influence of variations in distance between the reacting surfaces .
For this purpose we constructed the apparatus represented in fig. 2 .
On a wooden stand supported by three levelling-screws rests a glass tube 20 centims. in length and 3-8 centims. in diameter , having a tubular opening at one side , into which is cemented horizontally a smaller tube 1*5 centim. in diameter .
In the larger tube there is a circular disk of elder-pith 2*3 centims. in diameter , having one side blackened with lampblack ; it is supported in a vertical position on a movable stand of iron wire .
By means of a magnet the pith disk can be moved up and down the tube , and thus placed at any required distance ( within 12 centims. ) from a delicately suspended circular disk of thin microscope-glass , 3 centims. in diameter and 0*3 millim. in thickness .
The glass disk is attached to the end of a glass arm , which is suspended in the smaller tube by means of a silk cocoon fibre contained in a vertical limb 38 centims. in length and 9 millims. in diameter .
In order that the torsion of the silk fibre may be conveniently regulated , there is a small fl - shaped piece of iron wire attached to it a few centimetres below the end from which it hangs .
A horseshoe magnet is suspended outside the tube with the piece of wire between its poles .
By turning the magnet round torsion may be imparted to the silk fibre .
The balance of the glass arm is adjusted by means of a small iron ring which it carries ; the position of the ring can be altered at will by an external magnet .
There is a small silvered mirror attached to the arm at the point of suspension ; this reflects the image of a narrow illuminated slit on to a scale divided into degrees 2*5 millims. each .
An alteration in the position of the index amounting to 0*5 millim. is readily observed ; this corresponds with a change in the position of the outer edge of the glass disk amounting to 0*033 millim. One end of the large tube is ground perfectly flat and closed by cementing to it a plate of glass 4 millims. in thickness ; through this light is admitted to the pith disk by an arrangement to be presently referred to .
The other end of the large tube is contracted and terminates in a narrow tube bent upwards , partly packed with gold leaf ( to intercept mercury vapour ) , and attached to the exhaust-tube of a * The apparatus was sealed off on the 14th of April , 1876 .
The experiments described above were made in March .
556 Messrs. G. J. Stony and R. J. Moss [ Feb. Sprengel pump .
The smaller tube terminates in a contraction bearing a stopcock which serves for admitting the gases to be experimented upon .
" We found it necessary to avoid the irregular actions which arose when the incident light was allowed to shine on the inside of the glass tube .
This was accomplished by projecting on the disk the image of a uniformly illuminated circular aperture in a screen of copper foil placed outside the glass chimney of an Argand gas-burner .
The lens employed for this purpose is permanently attached to a stand on which the lamp is secured .
When the position of the pith disk is altered , the position of the stand carrying the lamp and lens is altered to the same extent , so that the pith disk is always in focus8 The burner is automatically supplied with coal-gas at the uniform rate of 3*2 cubic feet per hour , this being the quantity that gives a flame of the required size .
We found that the torsion of a cocoon fibre furnishes a force which is too variable to admit of its being delicately controlled by the method just referred to ; but a very accurate adjustment was secured by a supplementary arrangement .
It has already been mentioned that the arm which bears the thin glass disk carries a small iron weight by which its balance is regulated .
This weight was made to serve for balancing the torsion of the silk fibre .
For this purpose a small bar magnet sliding in a groove is so placed that one pole acts on the weight .
With a little care the distance of the magnet from the weight can be adjusted so as to bring the index to zero , and thus exactly counterbalance the torsion of the silk , the index remaining practically stationary .
In this condition the apparatus is sensitive to an extreme degree .
It will be observed that in this apparatus the cooler of the heat-engine consists of the swinging disk along with that part of the containing tube which lies between the swinging disk and the disk of blackened pith .
By thus making a portion of the cooler freely movable , we hoped to be able to ascertain the thickness of the layer of gas within which Crookes 's force exists .
It would not have answered for this part of our investigation to have made the heater the part freely movable , as in all apparatus of the kind that had been previously constructed , because the heater cannot be placed far from the cooler in apparatus that is not inconveniently large for the Sprengel pump , since when the containing .
tube is of any moderate size its sides become the principal part of the cooler* when the glass disk is at a distance . .
* is obvious , from the dynamical theory , that if the molecules tending in one direction within a stationary gas are at one temperature , while the rest of the molecules of the gas and the surface of a solid with which they come in contact are at another temperature , then the Crookes 's force which arises may be either normal to .
that surface like the pressure of a gas , or tangential to it like friction , or in any way compounded of these two , being in each case in the direction spoken , of above .
Accordingly the forces that act upon the containing vessel and the vanes of radiometers are in general partly tangential and partly normal ; so that in estimating the on Crookes 's .

] With the improved apparatus repulsion at first appeared to exist at all tensions in hydrogen , the distance between the disks being 1 millim. This repulsion was not perceptibly increased by alterations in tension , until the latter was reduced to about 200 millims. , when a slight increase of repulsion took place , and further reductions of tensions were in each case followed by an increase of repulsion .
It was observed that when repulsion was detected at ordinary tensions the glass disk occupied the upper portion of the containing tube , and that when the disk was made to swing in the lower portion of the tube , instead of being repelled it was attracted towards the pith when illuminated .
These results are obviously due to convection-currents .
By carefully balancing the glass disk as nearly as possible in the centrejof the tube the effects are greatly reduced ; but it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to balance the disk in a perfectly neutral position .
In an atmosphere of hydrogen at ordinary atmospheric tensions there is no indication of attraction or repulsion when the distance between the pith and glass disks is 100 millims. and the time of illumination-15 seconds , a period which experience has led us to adopt .
The first unmistakable indications of pressure on the swinging disk at this distance occur when the tension is about 50 millims. , at which tension there is a very feeble repulsion .
As the tension is reduced the repulsion increases .
An extensive series of experiments have been made for the purpose of determining the ratio in which the repulsion increases for given reductions in the tension of the residual gas .
The accompanying Table exhibits the results of one set of experiments :\#151 ; T = tension of the residual gas .

T. D. 50 100 intensity of these forces the matters to be considered along with the directions of the motions in the intervening gas , are the proximity and extent of the opposed surfaces , and not the degree of their parallelism .
It is probable that all the phenomena of radiometers with crumpled or inclined vanes , which Mr. Crookes has lately investigated , admit of explanation by these considerations .
It is manifest that in the apparatus described in the-text the chief part of the reaction on the containing vessel , when the disks are at a considerable distance asunder , consists of tangential forces acting on the inside of the tube .
On Crookes 's Force .
[ Feb. In the above experiments it will be observed that the distance between the pith disk and the swinging glass disk was constant , viz. 100 minims .
We have made several series of experiments with the disks at various distances in atmospheres of various tensions .
The means of several of these series are graphically represented in the following diagram .
The ordinates represent the distance in millimetres through which the index moved in a period of 15 seconds ; the abscissas represent the distance in millimetres between the disks .
Our expectation of being able to ascertain the thickness of the Crookes 's layer has not been entirely fulfilled with the apparatus as at present constructed , owing to the presence of the exceedingly feeble force that is represented by the horizontal portions of the diagram .
We have found this feeble force nearly constant at each tension when the two disks are at any distances asunder exceeding 20 millims. So far as we have been able to ascertain , it seems to arise partly from the sudden expansion of the gas throughout the extent of the Crookes 's layer as soon as the light is turned on , an expansion which acts on the swinging disk as if a feeble explosion had taken place in front of it ; and partly from a Crookes 's force acting between the upperside of the tube and the swinging disk , caused by the inside of the tube becoming sensibly heated by the convection-current that commences as soon as the Crookes 's layer is established .
We do not think that any appreciable part of it is due to the direct action of the convection-current .

] On the Structure of Magelona .
The rest of the diagram represents the forces which we found when the disks were at distances of 10 and 5 millims. asunder .
The forces which presented themselves at these distances are to be attributed mainly to a true Crookes 's reaction between the disks ; and they seem to warrant the conclusion that Crookes 's reaction was manifested at a distance of at least 10 millims. in a hydrogen vacuum , when the outstanding tension was as much as 5 millims. of mercury .
At distances of from 20 to 80 millims. the very feeble force acting on the glass disk in our apparatus seemed to vary about inversely as the tension .
As already mentioned , it appeared to be nearly independent of the distance when the distance exceeded 20 millims. _ At distances of 5 , 10 , and 20 millims. the force on the swinging disk made some approach to varying at each tension inversely as the distance .
But , so far as may be judged from our measures of such exceedingly feeble forces , there is a sensible deviation from this law at most of the Moreover the diagram , taken as a whole , seems to suggest , m conformity with the dynamical theory , that the law changes with variations of density .
Bor if the law were the same at all the observed tensions , the converging lines in the diagram should converge to points in the axis of abscissas , whereas they converge towards points lower down .
We will postpone the further discussion of the observations already made with this apparatus until we can supplement them by others .
