A paper was read , entitled , " On the Specific Inductive Capacities of certain Electric Substances .
" By Wiliiam Snow Harris , Esq. , F.R.S. The author , pursuing the experimental inquiry suggested by the theory of Mr. Faraday relative to the differences in specific induc ?
tive capacity exhibited by different dialectric substances , instituted a series of experiments for determining with precision their compa ?
rative powers of insulation , and of sustaining by induction charges of electricity .
The substances to be examined were east into the form of circular plates and furnished on both their surfaces with circular coatings of tinfoil of a diameter equal to one-half that of the plate , and the electric intensities were measured by electrometers of the same construction as those which he used in his former experiments , and which he has described in his papers already published in the Philosophical Transactions for 18S9 .
The results are stated in ta ?
bless ; from the last of which it appears that the inductive capacities of the dialectric bodies tried , that of air being expressed by unity , are proportional to the following numbers : ?
Substances .
Relative capacities .
Air .
1 Rosin .
1-77 Pitch .
1-8 Bees'wax .
1*86 Glass .
1-9 Brimstone .
1*93 Shell-lac .
P95 The author , in conclusion , offers some observations on the exporimental processes employed in his investigation ; and points out several circumstances which require to be attended to in order to ensure success .
