Sir JOSEPH HOOKER , K.O.S.I. , President , in the Chair .
The Presents received were laid on the table , and thanks ordered for them .
The following papers were read :\#151 ; I. " Magnetic Observations taken during the Transit of Venus Expedition to and from Kerguelen Island .
" By the Rev. S. J. Perry , S.J. , F.R.S. Received October 13 , 1877 .
In a previous paper , on the elements of terrestrial magnetism observed at Kerguelen , the reason is mentioned why it was not deemed advisable to take magnetic observations at sea during the voyage ; the results , therefore , in this paper are entirely confined to the determinations of the Dip , Intensity , and Declination of the earth 's magnetic force at the several places at which we landed .
On our outward journey we had no opportunity of using our instruments , except at the Cape of Good Hope , but on our return we were much more fortunate , as H.M.S. " Volage " made a stay of at least two days at Point de Gall , at Bombay , Aden , Port Said , and Malta , and we utilised all these opportunities except the first .
From Malta , the Rev. YV\ Sid-greaves and myself returned to England by Sicily , Italy , and France , and , taking our magnetic instruments with us , we were able to observe at Palermo , Naples , Rome , Florence , and Moncalieri .
As we had previously made a complete survey of France in 1868 and 1869 , we thought it too early to repeat the observations .
The instrumental corrections and constants have already been given in the former paper on Kerguelen , it will , therefore , suffice to refer to that communication for any necessary details .

The Magnetic Dip .
The long sea voyage , with its great variation , of temperature , was very trying for the delicate portions of the instruments , and as we found that No. 1 Needle had been slightly injured by rust , it was never used during our home journey .
In the last column of Table II the daily mean values of the dip are entered , but it was only at Cape Town and at Bombay that observations could be taken on more than a single day .
Needle No. 2 seems to read about 30 " higher than No. 3 , but no correction has been applied to either , as the amount is considerably less than the usual errors of observations .

The quantity in Table III shows that this decrease in the acceleration is still continuing .
The inclination observed at the College in Bombay is very extraordinary , and would at first sight appear to have been entered incorrectly .
The result , however , agrees perfectly with the observed angles , and as two complete observations were taken with Needle No. 3 , and these fairly agree , it may be supposed that the instrument was standing at the time over an unsuspected mass of iron capable of deflecting the suspended needle , through an angle of nearly a degree .
The paper by Mr. C. Chambers , in the Phil. Trans , for last year , gives 19 ' 8 , -5 as the most probable value of the dip for January 1st , 1871 , at the Colaba Observatory , with a secular change of + l , -9 .
This magnetic element would , therefore , appear to be altering more rapidly at present than its mean rate of change during the last 30 years .
The angle observed in 1875 is very slightly in excess of that computed for the same epoch from the data of Mr. Chambers .
The low value of the secular change at Home is quite exceptional , but if we compute this quantity for the epoch 1849 from the figures given in Sir E. Sabine 's report , we again obtain \#151 ; 2'"09 , showing that , if there be an error , it is due to local causes .
The Magnetic Intensity .
At each station the horizontal component of the magnetic force was determined absolutely by vibrations and deflections , and the total intensity deduced from the horizontal force combined with the dip .
The magnets employed throughout were the same as those used at Kerguelen , and no departure from the usual methods was ever found necessary .

Trans. , 1868 ) furnish very few details from which to deduce the secular variation of the intensity at the above stations .
The total force at the Cape Observatory in 1845 was 7*58 , and this combined with 7'7152 , the value for 1874 , will give + 0*0047 as the annual change .
In the Cape Magnetic Observations , vol. i,.we find -j- 0*0066 as the corresponding value for 1848 .
Taking the mean of the observations at Bombay in 1845 and 1847 , and also the mean for 1856 and 1867 , we find 8*285 and 8*505 as the values of the intensity for the epochs 1846 and 1861\#151 ; 5 .
Comparing this last value with 8*5633 of 1875 , gives a yearly change of f- 0*0043 , whilst the apparent change in 1854 was 0*0142 .
Turning now to the Colaba results from 1867 to 1873 we see that , for January 1st , 1871 , the absolute value of the total force was 8*5391 , with an annual change of + 0*0064 .
This would make the magnetic intensity 8*5663 for April , 1875 , which agrees well with the observed value .
The mean annual acceleration from 1861 to 1875 is considerably less than the value deduced from the observations of the last few years .
The intensity , 9*27 , observed by Caligny at Malta in 1839 , combined with that of 1875 , makes the annual variation 0*0052 .
At Rome , 9*6575 in 1849 gives also an annual variation of 0*0052 ; but at Naples , 9*55 in 1845 , makes the yearly change only 0*0033 .
The Magnetic Declination .
The observations , on which the determination of this element depend , 6 Rev. S. J. Perry on Magnetic Observations [ Jan. 10 , are necessarily affected by many possible sources of error , when the work has to be done in the course of a long and difficult journey .
The carriage of the instruments by land and sea ; the frequent packing and unpacking ; the great variations of temperature ; the shortness of time at each station , scarcely allowing sufficient attention to be paid to choice of locality or examination of instruments ; all tell more against the magnetic declination than against the other elements of terrestrial magnetism .
As we were detained a considerable time at the Cape of Good Hope , it was thought advisable to examine thoroughly all the instruments , and to take a very complete set of observations at the Cape Observatory , in- order to make this well-known station the point of departure for all our work in Kerguelen and elsewhere .
It was fortunate that this could be done leisurely , as we found on examination that the declination magnet was useless , the bar not being magnetic , nor capable of retaining a sufficient amount of magnetism to secure accurate results .
On July 30th the bar was magnetised by aid of large permanent magnets , and then subsequent declination observations led to most unsatisfactory results .
On August the 19th a coil was made use of to magnetise the same bar , but two series of readings then taken with the needle , and with the Observatory magnet , shewed the utter untrustworthiness of our needle .
As the Rev. W. Sidgreaves , though most kindly assisted by the Government Astronomer , Mr. E. J. Stone , was unable to magnetise satisfactorily our reversible declination needle , we were forced to substitute in its place the vibration magnet .
The latter not being arranged for rapid reversal , the zero of the scale was very carefully determined both at the Cape Observatory and afterwards at Kerguelen , and the scale value accnrately tested .
The method of observation usually adopted , was to fix the position of a well defined distant mark , by aid of sun or star transits , with the Simms theodolite , and then to note the bearing of the magnetic needle with respect to the same mark with the Jones ' unifilar .
At Florence the confined space , and still more the badness of the weather , made it advisable to trust wholly to the unifilar , and therefore no fixed mark was used , but the position of the magnet was referred directly to that of the sun , observed by aid of the mirror attached to the instrument .
^ e same method was used at Moncalieri , and the corrections for the displacement of the mirror , deduced from the latter observations , serve to correct the single reading at Florence* The necessary correction for any error in the mirror is explained in a former paper on the magnetic survey of the west of France ( Phil. Trans. 1869 , p. Tit ) ) , The chronometer made use of throughout the whole series of observations was a good pocket instrument from Greenwich Observatory , Maurice 6144 .
It was compared on every possible occasion with the during Transit of Venus Expedition .

" No direct observations were taken with the transit theodolite to check the error and rate of the chronometer , but these depend entirely on the comparisons .
It will not be necessary to give in full the details of each comparison , but all the requisite information is contained in the following table .

The great change in the daily rate between Naples and Rome will not affect the results at Rome , as the declination was measured from the standard mark at the Roman College Observatory .
Before reaching Moncalieri the chronometer appears to have met with an accident which entirely altered its rate , but the double comparison at this station renders this change of less moment .

] during Transit of Venus 10 Rev. S. J. Perry on Magnetic etc. [ Jan. 10 , At the Observatories of the Cape , of Colaba at Bombay , and of Rome , it was only necessary to enter the approximate local mean time under the heading , " Chronometer , " as the declination at these stations was measured from the standard marks .
The bearing of these magnetic marks is respectively 0 ' 31/ 51 " , 0 ' 26 ' 26 " , and 21 ' 26 ' 54 " E. of the Astronomical North Point .
At the remaining stations the sun 's azimuth was computed for the hour angle of the sun given by the chronometer , except at the college of Bombay , where it was found more convenient to observe the stars Aldebaran and Capella , instead of the sun .
The observations marked with an asterisk were taken with the needle of the Cape Observatory .
The computed altitudes of the sun for the three observations at Moncalieri , were 63 ' 3 ' 33"-60 , 63 ' 48 ' 57"-69 , and 64 ' 29'17"78 . .
This difference of altitude being so slight makes the correction for the perpendicularity of the mirror much less reliable than it might otherwise have been .
The declination observations at the Cape of Good Hope date back as far as 1600 , and the mean yearly amount of the secular variation for the first 240 years was found to be + 7''66 W. It then diminished , and was + 0'*49 from 1841 to 1846 , +1'-41 from 1843 to 1848 , and 2''16 from 1846 to 1850 .
The renewed acceleration in the annual variation seems to have lasted but for a short period , as a comparison of the mean value for 1874 , with 29 ' 14'*62 , the mean for 1848 , gives only l'-68 as the annual change .
Prom observations of this magnetic element at Bombay in 1845 , Ib56 , 1867 , and 1875 , we notice a gradual easterly motion of the needle , it being at the above dates 0 ' 13 ' W. , 0 ' 19 ' E. , 0 ' 42 ' E. , and 0 ' 56 ' E. , shewing a decreasing yearly change of 2'-91 , 2'-09 and 75 The amount of the mean annual variation given by tl series of monthly observations at the Colaba Observatory from 1867 to 1873 is 1*77 , which may be considered identical with the above .
At Aden the heat of the sun was so great that it was imprudent to remain long near the theodolite whilst taking the solar observation , the decimation was therefore obtained under very disadvantageous circumstances , and consequently less weight can be attached to the result .
This is apparent also from the abnormal increase in the secular acceleration .
Thus the declination which was 5 ' 2 ' W. in 1834 \#151 ; 4 W ; ^ 1 ?
57 , the annual variation being , therefore ' 4 , whilst in 1875 the angle observed was 2 ' 19 ' 39 " W. which increases the yearly change to \#151 ; 6 , #41 .

In conclusion I will subjoin in a single table the mean results for all the elements of terrestrial magnetism at the different stations .

" On the Limits to the Order and Degree of the Fundamental Invariants of Binary Quantics .
" By J. J. Sylvester , M.A. , LL. D. , F.R.S. , Professor in the Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , U.S. Received December 26 , 1877 .
The developments which I have recently given to Professor Cayley 's second method of dealing with invariants ( the first method being that which has been exclusively used by Professor Gordan ) , has led me through the theory of the Canonical Generating Fraction to the following results , showing that the degree and order of the fundamental invariants and covariants to a quantic or system of quantics are subject to algebraical limits of a very simple kind , and I think it right that these results should not be withheld from the knowlege of those who are pursuing another and , as it seems to me , much more arduous and less promising direction of inquiry into the same subject .
By order I mean the dimensions of a derived form in the coefficients of its primitive ( Clebsch and Gordan 's grad ' ) , and by degree the dimensions in the variables ( Clebsch and Gordan 's First as to degree .
