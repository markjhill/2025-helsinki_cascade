" On the Difference of Colour in different parts of the Bodies of Animals .
" By James Alderson , M.A. , M.D. , late Fellow of Pembroke College , Cambridge .
Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. The hypothesis advanced by the author in explanation of the wellknown partial absence of the coloured pigment or rete mucosum , in different parts of the human body , and that of other animals , is that it is due to the union or adhesion of the epidermis and the true skin , so as to exclude the rete mucosum .
He supports this hypothesis by the analogy of a cicatrix , which is the result of an organization of a certain portion of lymph , poured out from the cut surfaces of a wound , as part of the process of nutrition , or as the consequence of a small amount of infiammation , induced either from mechanical irritation , or other accidental circumstance .
This hypothesis was suggested by the colourless appearance of the cicatrix from the section of the umbilical cord in the negro , and also of that seen by the author at the umbilicus of the bottle-nosed whale , the Hyperoodon bidentatus .
