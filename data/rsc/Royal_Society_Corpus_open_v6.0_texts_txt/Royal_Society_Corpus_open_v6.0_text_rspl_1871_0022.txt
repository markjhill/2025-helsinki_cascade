The agreement of these ratios with each other , and the small differences from the mean of the single ratios , justify us in the mean time , until a greater numbjer of periods are before us , to state the connexion between the two branches of the periodic curve from one minimum to another in the following more precise terms :\#151 ; If T be the time of duration of sun-spot increase from a minimum to a maximum , then 2*15 X T ( with a probable error of less than +0*05 ) be the duration of the sun-spot decrease until the next minimum .
This law , together with the fact which we have previously established , that a longer period shows generally a depressed curve , while a shorter is characterized by great peaks , points strongly to the conclusion that the energy of the ultimate causes of sun-spot production , whether these causes be intrasolar or extrasolar , is for every period constant .

" Note on the Telescopic Appearance of Encke 's Comet .
" By William Huggins , D.C.L. , LL. D. , F.Il .
S. Received December 16 , 1871 .
The first three figures which accompany this note represent the comet on evenings on which its appearance was described in a note on the spectrum of the comet which I had the honour to present to the Royal Society* .
A continuance of bad weather prevented me from making later observations of the comet , with the exception of one evening , December 5 , when figure 4 was obtained under unfavourable circumstances .
Fig. 1 .
November 7 , 7.30 p.m.\#151 ; From Oct. 17 , when the comet consisted of a nearly round nebulosity without condensation in any part , to Nov. 7 no observations could be obtained .
At the latter date , the remarkable fan-form which distinguishes this appearance of the comet was already distinctly presented .
The faint light by which the comet was surrounded terminated on the side from the sun , that from which the tail is usually projected , in a straight boundary at right angles to the longer axis of the comet .
At the opposite side , that towards the sun , the faint nebulosity expanded and became fainter until it could be no longer traced .

89 minute stellar nucleus which was suspected at the eastern extremity of the fan is not marked in the figure .
Fig. 2 .
November 8 , 7 p.m.\#151 ; The fan was now brighter and more defined in form .
The nucleus , as a minute bright point , appeared to be situated not at the extreme western point , but a little within it , towards the north .
The sides of the fan were slightly curved , suggesting an approach to a parabolic form .
The fan was brighter on the southern side .
The eastern edge of the faint light by which the comet was surrounded still preserved a right line from north to south .
Fig. 3 .
November 14 , 6.40 p.m.\#151 ; The appearance of the comet was essentially the same as on Nov. 8 .
The bounding lines of the fan were perhaps less curved j they enclosed an angle of from 85 ' to 90 ' .
The nucleus had become brighter , and now appeared to form the extreme eastern point of the fan .
No prolongation of the eastern boundary , where the tail is usually formed , was seen .
Fig. 4 .
December 5 , 5.30 p.m.\#151 ; Thin mist in the atmosphere allowed the brighter parts only of the comet to be satisfactorily observed .
The condensation of light was now much stronger at the eastern end , but a defined nucleus was not detected .
The fan form was less marked ; the brighter part of the comet more resembled a brush-like flame .
The atmospheric haze nearly concealed the faint light surrounding the comet , but , by glimpses , a tail was now seen to project towards the east ; it was traced to a distance of about twice the length of the bright brush .
The tail appeared to come from the northern side of the longer axis of the comet , and to consist of a faint ray with sides nearly parallel .
As I am at present without a suitable micrometer , I was not able to take measures of the comet .
The Society then adjourned over the Christmas Recess to Thursday , January 11 , 1872 .
