" Second Communication .
By AuGUSTUsWALLER , M.D. , F.R.S. Received April 12 , 1862 .
In the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society , ' No. 46 , I have given a brief account of the effects of refrigeration of the ulnar nerve in man , by the application of ice .
After repeated experiments on this nerve on myself , I never had occasion to witness any permanent disturbance in the nerve from the application of the ice , beyond a slight hyperoesthesia , which may have been partly due to the increased attention of the mind directed to the part whose functions were under investigation .
The like immunity does not extend to experiments in which a much greater degree of cold is employed , as will be seen from the following instance : September 13 , 1861.-A freezing mixture , consisting of equal parts of pounded ice and common salt , was applied to the elbow of the left arm over the ulnar nerve .
The subject of the observation was a gentleman in perfectly sound health , aged twenty-seven .
Before the application of the mixture , the temperature between the little and ring fingers and the index and median was the same .
Successive observations gave the following results : Duration of appliTemperature Cent. Temperature Cent. cation of refrigebetween ring and little between index and rating mixture .

26-0 At this time the freezing mixture was removed .
In the course of the application the following results were observed : Soon after the application of the freezing mixture , the nerve began to be painful from the elbow downwards ; after twenty-seven minutes ' application the little finger was already somewhat paralysed and insensible .
When the nerve was compressed or vibrated , it was found to be very sensitive and tender , and its excitability much increased * .
After thirty-two minutes the symptoms were 1st .
Paralysis of the movements of the little finger almost complete .
2nd .
A state of semi-flexion of all the fingers , diminishing from the little one outwards , so that they could not be straightened completely by the extensor muscles .
3rd .
Great weakness in all the fingers and thumb , so that great difficulty was experienced in grasping or holding any object .
4th .
Complete loss of the power of abduction and adduction of the fingers , so that when they were extended as far as possible they remained spread out without there being any power of bringing them together .
After fifty-two minutes the freezing mixture was withdrawn , and the skin at the elbow , which was completely frozen , was allowed to thaw .
During this process the arm and hand became'rapidly verypainful upwards and downwards in the course of the nerve , the pain even extending to the chest , where there was a feeling of great uneasiness and constriction .
At the same time the heart 's action was so much lowered as to threaten immediate syncope , which was , however , prevented by a free administration of ammonia and spirits .
An hour after the removal of the freezing mixture the temperature ( Cent. ) was as follows : Left hand , between the index and median ... ... 20'5 , , between the little and ring fingers ... .
21'2 Right hand , between the index and median ... .
21'8 , , between the little and ring fingers. .
21'8 September 16th.-Over the skin which had been frozen there was vesication and inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue , which was swollen around the part blistered to the extent of 2 or 3 inches over the arm and forearm .
Over the prominent parts of the elbow-joint the bones were very tender on pressure .
The ulnar nerve was likewise exceedingly painful to the touch up the arm and down the forearm and the hand .
The brachial plexus was very tender at some points .
Over the little finger and the inner side of the ring finger the skin was nearly insensible .
Friction over these parts caused a sensation of heat , pricking , and discomfort .
The temperature of these parts was not more elevated than other parts of the hand .
The paralysis of the muscles of the hand was in the same condition as on the 14th .
The two points of compasses , when more than an inch apart , were felt as one over the palmar surface of the little finger .
September 17th.-Paralysis and anaesthesia the same as the day before .
The hyperesthesia of the ulnar nerve was diminished .
September 22nd , one week after application of ice.-Considerable and constant hyperaesthesia is experienced in the little finger and down the ulnar side of the hand .
The power of motion is somewhat restored , but neither the little nor any of the other fingers can 1862 .

September 27th.--The power of motion in the little finger is 92 [ May 15 , almost restored ; but there is still sensible hyperoesthesia in it , as well as on the inner side of the palm of the hand .
There is also some stiffness in that finger , and a complete inability , when the fingers are extended , to bring them into opposition with one another .
The spot on the upper arm to which cold was applied is now quite healed , and all swelling has subsided ; but the ulnar nerve is still very sensitive on being touched .
The weakness of the left hand in grasping objects , as In using a fork at dinner , &amp;c. , even ten days after the experiment , was most perceptible .

The fingers could now be extended almost as completely as those of the right hand , but they could not be easily expanded , or brought into opposition with one another .
At times the nerve was very painful along its whole course , from the elbow downwards .
This is mostly the case after the arm has been used a little .
Pain at these times , even if not actually present , was easily induced by placing the arm in a dependent position so as to cause congestion of its vessels , and it was immediately relieved by elevating the limb above the head so as to deplete the vessels .
The nerve was very sensitive to pressure all along its course , from the elbow downwards , although all painfulness arising from the inflammation produced in the cutaneous tissue by the cold had disappeared for some days .

19'8 1 9'68 There is still a feeling of stiffness in the little finger , accompanied with slight inability to move it .
There is also considerable sensitiveness along the course of the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand when compressed or percussed .
The fingers can be moved to and from one another more freely , but the power of so doing is still imperfect ; and that of grasping , so far as the whole hand is concerned , is much weaker than in the other hand .
Cutaneous sensibility is decidedly inferior over the dorsal and palmar surface of the inner part of the hand and two corresponding fingers when compared with the right , but the sensibility to cold is the reverse ; whenever the left hand becomes cooled by exposure , the little finger is always more or less painful .
Vibration of the nerve at the elbow produces the same effect on both sides .
94 [ May 15 , For about two weeks during the cold weather in this month there existed over the palmar surface of the left little finger a chilblain , the only one to be found on either hand .
The left hypothenar eminence was likewise then discovered for the first time to be less firm and smaller than on the right hand , as if atrophied in consequence of the results of the experiment ; and to such a degree that the swelling formed by this eminence on the inner side of the hand , which was considerable on the right hand , was nearly absent on the left .
To ascertain how far this difference is normal in right-handed persons , I examined the hands of several persons accustomed to manual labour , where the preponderance of the upper right limb is great ; but I found much less than in the present instance .
I must therefore attribute this atrophy of the left hypothenar eminence partly to the semi-paralysis of the muscles , and especially to the diminished nutrition from constriction of the vessels .
Compression of the Ulnar Nerve .
I compress this nerve simply by resting the elbow on some hard body slightly padded , and holding a heavy book in the hand to increase the weight on the elbow , which would otherwise be insufficient .
The symptoms are sensory , motory , and vaso-motory .
The sensory symptoms are those first perceived , being the wellknown formication over the palmar territory of the nerve , viz. the little finger , the inner side of the annular , and the hypothenar eminence .
The symptoms of anaesthesia over the dorsal surface of the hand and fingers do not appear until a later period , when the anaesthesia is considerably advanced in the palmar portion .
While the anaesthesia is gradually progressing , the muscles of the hand governed by the ulnar nerve become weakened , stiff , and imperfect in their movements .
The first muscles which lose their power are the interosseous , which govern the adductive and abductive movements of the fingers .
On trying alternately to spread out and to bring the fingers in contact , we find them to move imperfectly and weakly , in a trembling uncertain way , like the movements of old age .
Later still the little 1862 .
] 95 finger cannot be placed in apposition with the annular , but remains apart at an angle of 10 or 15 degrees .
At the same time paralysis of the abductor and adductor muscles of the other fingers takes place .
The index and thumb alone retain some of their powers of adduction and abduction ; the former probably from the action of its proper extensor ; the latter from its abduction not being animated by the ulnar nerve .
When paralysis of these muscles is complete , the appearance of the hand , when the fingers are in extension , is pathognomic , and as follows : The little finger in complete adduction at about an angle of 40 ?
from the annular , which is likewise a little apart from the median .
Both these fingers are slightly flexed and incapable of complete extension .
The flexor muscles are much weakened , as might be anticipated from the distribution of the ulnar nerve .
In addition , the flexion movements of the thumb and the extensor power of this and all the fingers are considerably weakened .
The tendency of the fingers to semiflexion , and the inability of the little , the annular , and even to a slight extent the median finger to accomplish complete extension is probably referable to the state of tonicity of the paralysed flexors .
The weakness of the extensor and flexor powers of the thumb are not , in my opinion , sufficiently accounted for by the lost power of its adductor muscle .
Still less can we account for the diminished power of extension of the other fingers by any direct or descending action of the ulnar nerve .
I am led therefore to refer the diminished power , in this case , of the extensor muscles of the fingers to reflex action of the ulnar nerve .
In support of this view , I may state that I have not unfrequently experienced , after vibrating the ulnar nerve at the elbow , a great lassitude of the whole limb , particularly marked over the deltoid muscle , to so great an extent as to occasion much discomfort for at least an hour afterwards .
Vaso-motory symptoms.-Under this head I include all the perturbations of temperature of the integuments animated by the ulnar nerve , which attend its compression .
Mechanical irritation of this nerve , such as vibrating it , will frequently cause an immediate fall of 0 ?
'5 Cent. to 1 ?
'0 Cent. of the 96 [ May 15 , mercury in a thermometer placed between the little and annular fingers , while the others remain nearly unaffected .
It is still more easy to ascertain this influence when the nerve is paralysed by pressure .

22'3 The temperature of the right hand between the fingers remained nearly stationary ... ... ... ... 24'0 In other experiments on compression of the ulnar nerve I have observed a much greater fall of temperature as the integuments became insensible .
With regard to the elevation of temperature , I have never been able to obtain it by compression of the ulnar nerve to the extent produced by refrigeration .
Compression of the Left Radial Nerve .
Feb. 10 , 1862.-This nerve was compressed at the lower part of its course at the arm , where it winds round the humerus to its external side .
This was effected simply by pressing the outer part of the arm against the padded arm of a chair .
In about half an hour the skin of the back of the hand had become somewhat insensible , and the muscles of the forearm so much weakened that the hand dropped by its own weight .
These symptoms continued to increase until the extensor muscles of the forearm were quite paralysed .
Examination three-quarters of an hour after the commencement of the experiment gave as follows : The skin over the back of the forearm , that of the carpus , of the thumb , of the two first phalanges of the index , and over the outer half of the thenar eminence was nearly insensible to the contact of external bodies ; but when pricked or pinched , pain was produced of a hot , burning character , which lasted for about a minute after the removal of the cause .
Over the back of the other fingers , i. e. the median , annular and little fingers , and the last phalanx of the index , no loss of sensibility could be detected .
Flexion of the fingers was very imperfect ; their tips with difficulty could be made to touch the palm of the hand .
The movements of the last phalanx of the thumb were almost paralysed , while those of its second phalanx and metacarpal bone appeared little affected .
The apposition of the tips of the thumb and index , as well as that of the thumb and median , could be made , but not that of the thumb and tips of the two last fingers .
All extension of the carpus on the forearm was impossible .
The hand , when left to itself , fell into a state of semiflexion of the carpus on the forearm , with semiflexion of the fingers ; while the thumb placed itself on the palm of the hand by the flexion of its metacarpal bone and first phalanx , the second phalanx remaining unbent .
The movements of supination of the forearm and abduction of the carpus were almost entirely paralysed .

The skin over the part supplied by the nerve was rather less numb. Two minutes later the carpus could be placed in a straight line with the forearm , but could not be retained in that position .
Thirteen minutes later the hand was in the same condition .
All delicate movements , such as buttoning and unbuttoning the dress , were impossible , although the sensibility at the tips of the index and thumb was equally acute in both hands .

On the following days the sensibility of the skin continued gradually to improve , and also the motor powers , and after the lapse of twelve days from the date of the experiment there existed no difference in the sensibility , motor power , and the temperature of the two hands .
Compression of the Right Median Nerve .
January 2 , 11 A.M.-The arm was allowed to hang over the back of a chair so as to compress the median nerve and brachial 1862 .
] 101 vessels about 2 inches above the bend of the arm .
In the course of about half an hour the nerve became paralysed , and the following symptoms were observed .
Motory Symptomis.-The thumb was incapable of flexion at the last joint , but could be flexed on the metacarpal bone , so as to be brought in contact with the tips of the three first fingers , but not with that of the little finger .
There was considerable stiffness of the thenar muscles , particularly of the abductors .
The index and median fingers remained slightly flexed , but by an effort of the will they could be straightened and could perform all movements of adduction and abduction .
The index could only be made to flex very slightly , but the median could be completely flexed .
The annular and little fingers retained all their movements , but felt weak .
Flexion of the entire hand on the forearm was imperfect , and the muscles of the external part of the forearm felt very stiff .
Sensory Symptoms.-The thumb and two first fingers felt cold and numb , and nearly insensible , but when pressed , a sensation of heat was experienced .
The insensibility at the tips of the thumb and two first fingers was nearly complete when objects were brought in contact with them .
Numbness of the skin existed at the anterior part of the forearm .
