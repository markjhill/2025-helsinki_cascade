Communicatel by Professor Sir WILLIAII THOMSON , F.R. Received November 30 , \mdash ; Read January 18 , 1877 .
I. BEFORE proceeding to comparative experiments on different glasses , it appeared desirable to verify experimentally the two following propositions:\mdash ; ( a ) If two jars be made of the same glass but of different thicknesses , if they be charged to the same potential for equal times , discharged for equal times and then insulated , the residual charge will after equal times have the same potential in each .
In experiments in which potentials and not quantities of electricity are measured the thickness of the jar may be chosen arbitrarily , nor need any inconvemence be feared from irregularities of thickness .
( b ) Residual charge is proportional to exciting charge .
These propositions may be included in one law\mdash ; that superposition of simultaneous forces is applicable to the phenomena of residual charge .
To verify ( a ) two flasks were prepaled of the glass afterwards referred to as No. 1 .
One was estimated to be about 1 millim. , the other 6 or 7 millims. thick .
These were cleansed and insulated in the usual way by filling with strong sulphuric acid without soiling the neck of the flask .
They were placed in the same basin of water , which was electrically connected with the outside of the quadrant electrometer .
The interiors of the flasks were respectively connected with the two quadrants ; they were also connected together by a wire which could at any instant be removed .
One DANIELL'S element gave a deflection of 69 scale-divisions .
The two flasks were charged together with 48 elements for some minutes , and it was observed that the equal charge of the two quadrants did not deflect the needle .
The flasks were discharged for 15 to 20 seconds and insulated , still connected .
The connecting wire was then removed , and the subsequent movement of the image observed .
Ifleft undisturbed a maximum of about 20 divisions of the fcale was attained .
But usually the deflection in from 20 to 30 seconds reaching 10 divisions , the thick flask was discharged , and the image was driven from the scale , showing that at that time the potential of either flask was represented by more than 500 scale-divisions , and hence that the difference between them was less than 2 per cent. of either of them .
When the charge was negative the error was in favour of the thin flask .
This is in complete accord with anomalous results subsequently obtained with the same glass .
Correcting for this peculiarity of the glass we may conclude that the law is verified within the limits of these exper.iments .
The second proposition was confirmed with two different glasseS ; but the results in one case are not quite accordant , possibly owing to variations of temperature , or to slight unremoved effects of previous chargings ; but the irregularities indicate no continuous deviation from the law .
In these and all the subsequent experiments theflasks were blown as thin as possible in the body , but with thick necks , the neck being thick that the capacity of any zone might be small .

RESIDUAL CHARGE OF TlfE LEYDEN JAR .

The following method of treating the question of residual charge was suggested to the author by Professor CLERK MAXWIBLL ; it is essentially similar to that used by BOLTZMANN for the after.effects of mechanical strain Sir Theory der elastischen Nachwirkung aus dem lxx .

Let be the couple tending to twist awire or fibre about its axis , the whole angle of torsion at time ; then at time depends upon , but not wholly on , for the torsion to which the wire has been submitted at all times previous to will slightly affect the value of L. Assume only that the effects of the torsion at all previous times can be superposed .
The effect of a torsion at a time before the time considered , acting for a short time , will continually diminish as increases ; it may be expressed by , where is a function of , which diminishes as increases .
Addin all the effects of the torsion at all times , we have In the case of a glass fibre } JANUARY finds that , where A is constant for moderate value of , but decreases when is very great .
The after-effects of electromotive force on a dielectric are very similar ; to strain corresponds electric displacement , to stress electromotive force .
Let be the potential at time as measured by the electrometer , and the surface-integral of electric displacement divided by the instantaneous capacity of the jar ; then , assuming only the law of superposition already proved to be true for simultaneous forces , we may write , ( 1 ) where is a function decreasing as increases .
This formula is precisely analogous to that of BOLTZMANN ; but in the case of a glass jar the capacity of which is too small to give continuous currents , it is not easy to measure ; hence it is necessary to make the independent variable .
From the linearity of the equation ( 1 ) as regards and the value of for each value of , and from the linearity of the equation expressing for each value .
, it follows that where decreases as increases .
The statement of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) could be expressed in the language of action at a distance and electrical polarization of the glass , being replaced by the polarization as measured by the potential of the charge which would be liberated if the polarization were suddenly reduced to zero , the jar being insulated .
It should be noted that the view of this subject adopted by the author in the previous paper*can be included in equation ( 2 ) by assuming that ) is the sum of a series of exponentials .

If is determined for all values of , the properties of the glass , as regards conduction and residual charge , are completely expressed .
Suppose that in equation ( 2 ) till , and that after that time a constant , , ; now when is very great , is the steady flow of electricity through the glass divided by the capacity .
Hence .

We have no practicable method of determining ; but we may proceed thus : During insulation is constant ; we have then ; ( 4 ) and alone can be measured ; ( 4 ) is , then , the equation by aid of which must be determined .

Glass No. l.\mdash ; This glass is a compound of silica , soda , and lime .
In a damp atmosphere it " " sweats the surface showing a crystalline deposit easily wiped off .
For a soda glass it is very white .
Density When the flask was mounted , connected with the electrometer , the image from which was deflected 70 divisions by one Daniell 's element , and insulated , it was found to steadily develop a negative charge , amounting to 11 scale-divisions in 10 scconds , and increasing to a maximum of 25 divisions .
The cause of this the author cannot explain .
Two otherflasks of the same 50 ass behaved in a similar manner\mdash ; in one case , with the thin flask of SI .
, the charge rising to 40 divisions , with the thick flask to only 15 divisions .
No sensible effect of the same kind was noticed with other glass .
The effect does not appear to be due to the connecting wires ( for these were lepeatedl removed and replaced by fresh ones ) , nor to difference between the acid within and that outside the flask , as this also was changed .
Experiment \mdash ; The flask was charged to 500 divisions for half an hour , insulated , and the potential observed after 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 seconds .
The mean of several gave for these times 372 , 275 , 216 , 170 : hence the loss in 5 seconds is about 25 cent. ; and from this we may readily deduce , since the percentage of loss is not materially different in the second interval of 5 seconds , , the minute being unit of time .
Experiment \mdash ; An attempt was made to estimate .
The charging lasted one second .
In two seconds from insulation the charge fell from 500 to about 330 , gives certainly greater than .
This can , of course , only be legarded as the roughest approximation .
Experiment 7.\mdash ; The flask was charged positively for about 19 hours with 48 elements , the electromotive force of which is represented by about 3360 scale-divisions .
It then discharged , and at intervals insulated for 10 seconds , and the residual charge deve- loped in that time observed .

These results are certainly much below the true values , for the image moved over the scale much more rapidly in the first than in the second five seconds ; but their ratios are probably fair approximations .

experiments and were made by the following modified method : battery of 48 elements was used , one pole being connected with the case of the electrometer and the exterior of the flask , the other with the interior of the flask by a cup of mercury and also with one electrode of the electrometer .
The other electrodc was permanently connected with the interior of the flask .
It was ascertained that the image emained at zero whether both quadrants wele charged equally or both discharged .
The potential of the 48 elements was measured by 6 elements at a time ; the extremes were 432 and 437 , and the total 3475 scale-divisions .

It was insulated after 44 minutes ; in 12 minutes the charge was 10# , giving Since the loss by conduction is so small , the flask may be strongly charged by an electrophorus instead of with the battery .
If it is left insulated for a considerable time , and then discharged , and the return charge observed , it may be assumed that the exciting charge has been sensibly constant during the latter portion of the period of insulation .

soda-lime glasses , although the composition and coloul vary widely , agree in MR. J. HOPKINSON ON THE possessing small insulating power , but exhibit very great return charge .
The values of the function for the three glasses agree almost within the limits of these roughly approximate experiments .
At the opposite extreme are the flints or potash-lead glasses , which have great specific .
resistance .
The experiment does not prove that No. 7 conducts electricity at all ; for it is not celCain that the very slight loss of charge may not be due to conduction over the surface of the glass ; but it is certainly not less than 100,000 times as resistant as No. 1 .
The flints also have very similar values of , much smaller than the soda-lime glasses .
IV .
It is that glass at a moderately high conducts electricity electrolytically .
The following experiment shows that with the conductive glasses electrolytic conduction occurs at the ordinary temperature of the air .
A flask of blue glass , No. 2 , was very carefully insulated with strong sulphuric acid within the flask , and was placed in a vessel of caustic potash .
Platinum wires dipping in the two liquids communicated with the quadrants of the electrometer .
On insulation the acid developed a positive charge as follows:\mdash ; In minute 15 divisions of the scale .
2 minutes \ldquo ; , , , , , one DANIELL'S element giving 68 divisions of the scale .
The experiment was repeated after the flask had stood some days with the two liquids connected by a platinum wire ; the potential developed much more slowly , and in minutes was stationary at divisions .
\mdash ; These experiments are subject to many causes of error .
Deducing from an observation of in a period of many seconds or even minutes gives values of necessarily too low , in some cases very much too low .
No attempt was made to keep the glass at a constant temperature ; the temperature of the room was occa .
sionally noted , but is not given here , as no conclusion is based upon it .
The experiments performed irregularly at such times as other circumstances permitted .
It will be observed that the discords of the experiments of verification are considerable , but they irregular .
It may , perhaps , be assumed that they are within the limits of error , and we may infer that the fundamental hypothesis is verified , viz. that the effects on a dielectric of past and present electromotiye forces are superposable .
OHM'S law asserts the principle of superposition in bodies in which conduction is not complicated by residual charge .
Conduction and residual charge may be eated as of the RESIDUAL CHARGE OF THE LEYDEN JAR .
same phenomenon , viz. an after-effect , as regards electric displacement , of electromotive force .
The experiments appear to show , though very roughly , that the principle of is applicable to the whole phenomenon of conduction through glass .
V. Effect of Temperature .
The purpose of the previous experiments being to examine generally the applicability of the formulae and to compare the values of for different glasses of known composition , no account was taken of temperature , and no attempt made to maintain it constant , although it is well known that changes of temperature greatly affect both conduction and polarization in glass* .
It appeared , vever , desirable to compare the same glass at diffelent temperatures in the same manner as different glasses at the same temperature .
The flask , carefully filled with sulphuric acid as before , was placed in au earthenware jar containing sulphuric acid , which was in its tuln placed in a double cylindrical shell of copper , with oil or water between the cylinders .
The jar was covered by two disks of wood , through holes in the centre of which the neck of the flask projected .
cap of sealing-wax , carrying a small cup of mercury for making electrical connexions with the interiol , closed the flask .
A thermometer dipped into the acid outside the flask for reading the temperature of the glass , whilst a second thermometer was insel.ted between the cylinders in the oil or water to help the observer in the temperature by means of a spirit-lamp .
In the two experiments below freezing-point the earthenware jar was removed the oil-bath and placed in a freezing-mixture of hydrochloric acid and sulphate of soda .
In all cases the tempelature was maintained approximately constant for some time before .
It will be remarked that , as the acid was not stirred , the temperature-readings are subject to a greater probable error than that due to the thermometer itself .
But as the changes of temperature of the acid were always very slow , the error thus introduced cannot seriously affect the results .
All temperatures are Centigrade .
The actual readings are given , and also the temperature , roughly corrected when necessary , for the exposed portion of the stem of the thermometer .
The times in these and in most of the previous experiments were taken by ear from a dead-beat seconds clock , the eye being fixed on the image and the scale .
In the intervals between the short insulations to determine ' the flask was either connected with the battery or discharged .
In all cases the registered time observation is taken at the middle of the period of insulation ; thus , in the experiment at below , insulation was made one second before the minute , and the one second after .
glasses were examined , Nos. 2 and 7 , selected as extreme cases .
The whole of the observations made are givcn , excepting three manifestly in error , although *Vide Mr. PERRT , Proceedings of the Royal Society , 1875 , p. 468 ; Prof. CrBItx lwDLL , ' Electricity and Magnetism Art .

J. JiOPKINSON ON THB only a portion are used .
The values of and , for glasses2 and 7 respectively , are taken as sensibly equal to , and are calculated on the assumption that during the short time of insulation the rate of loss at any instant is proportional to the then charge .
The values of and are deduced as , were constant during the time of insulation , and are thelefore considerably below the truth in all cases .
It will be observed that the battery was not quite constant ; but the value of 48 elements may be taken as 3160 scale-divisions without serious error .
Glass No. 2.\mdash ; Temperature .
It was roughly estimated that on insulation of the charge was lost within 1 second .
Notwithstanding this high conductivity , the residual char was capable of rising to more than 400 scale-divisions when the flask had been charged with 48 elements and then discharged for a few seconds .
This differentiates the polarization in even highly conductive glass from the trochemical polarization in a voltametel , in a single element of which no electromotive force can give rise to a return force greater than that due to the energy of mbination of the constituents of the electrolyte .
Subsequently , considerable char were obtained with the same glass up to 15 : at 18 the residual charge lvas so rapidly lost that it lvas hardly sensible .

The following Table gives the observed and calculated values:\mdash ; 2.2 The residual charge results do not show so great a degree of regularity , probably because the direct deduction of as equal to gives a greater error than the method used for obtaining B.

Temperature at With this glass the results do not agree so closely with the exponential formula as with glass No. 2 .
This is pelhaps not surprising when it is considered that the temperatures differ more from that of the room , and , consequently , that errors due to unequal heating of the acid , and to exposure of the stem of the thermometer , will be greater .
The observed values of , and those calculated the are given in the following Table:\mdash ; ON Ilffl RESIDUAL rARGE OF Tlffl LEYDEN JAR . .

Calculated .
12 The values obtained for and do not in general give a value of , which rees very closely with that obtained by residual charge .
This is not astonishing , for and both subject to a considerable probable error , and do not differ greatly from each other .
On the other hand , at high temperatures , the values of and , obtained by residual charge , are undoubtedly much too low .
It is interesting to lemark , that hereas the alues of and from residual charge do not increase with temperature above , the values of obtained by difference show a continually accelelated increase .
The observed values of and are collected in the following Table .
The values above l40o , if admitted at all , must legarded as subject to an enormous error .
Temperature .
It should be mentioned that the temperature experiments were not made on the same flask as flask No. 7 of the previous experiments , but on a flask of the same composition .
