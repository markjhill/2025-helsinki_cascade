) I. Effect of Acid and Alkali on the Eggs of Pleuronectes .
While working last spring at the Port Erin Biological Station on the effect of acids and alkalies upon the development of Echinus eggs , it was suggested to me that it might be interesting to try the general effect of similar solutions upon some other type of organism .
For this purpose the eggs of the Plaice ( Pleuronectes were selected , as they were to be obtained in abundance from the fish-hatchery attached to the station , but , as time pressed , it was only found possible to experiment with one acid and one alkali , and decinormal solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydrate were accordingly used .
In a pond attached to the hatchery numbers of plaice are kept in the spawning season , and the surface of the pond is skimmed each morning for the purpose of collecting the eggs , which are then placed in the hatching apparatus .
Three batches of these eggs of different ages were taken for experimentation\#151 ; those freshly skimmed from the pond , those which had been removed two days before and had remained since in the hatching apparatus , and those taken 10 days before and similarly treated .
Some few eggs always escape the net in the process of skimming , and are taken in the catch of later days , so that , when 10 days old eggs , for instance , are spoken of , what is meant is that none can be younger than that , although some few may be slightly older .
Such as showed obvious differences in age from the majority of each batch were removed .
The eggs were treated in a similar way to that employed in a research carried out at the same time on Echinus eggs , * namely , they were placed in small batches in a number of tumblers , each containing 200 c.c. of seawater , to which measured amounts of the decinormal solutions of acid or alkali were added .
A summary of previous work on the effects of acid and alkaline solutions upon development will be found in the paper above referred to .
* See preceding paper .
Mr. E. Whitley .
Effect of , on [ Nov. 14 , The accelerating effect of small quantities of alkali on growth observed by Loeb in the case of Tubularia * and the eggs of Arbacia , f and in those of Echinus , in the research mentioned above , was not noticed , but attention may be drawn to the very powerful results of even a small disturbance of the chemical equilibrium , which can be seen from Table I , where it will be observed that , after six days , 4 c.c. of decinormal acid or alkali in 200 c.c. of sea-water ( i.e. , a five-hundredth normal solution ) produces a death-rate among fresh eggs of 75 and 44 per cent , respectively , against only 5 per cent , in the Control .
In the experiments above alluded to with the eggs of Echinus escalentus , it was found that acids and acid salts above a very small concentration produced more deadly effects than corresponding quantities of alkalies and alkaline salts , and this was also found to be the case with Pleuronectes , and can be well seen in the same table ( I ) for strengths of 2'5 c.c. and upwards , especially with the younger eggs .
Probably three factors enter into the explanation :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The fact that part of the alkali added is immediately thrown out of solution as insoluble hydrates or carbonates .
( 2 ) Alkali is constantly being used up to neutralise the acid products of metabolism\#151 ; chiefly CO2 .
( 3 ) According to Loeb , the presence of weak alkali assists the absorption of oxygen by the organism .
If this be the case , the eggs in the acid solutions not being able to absorb oxygen so readily as the others , might probably be less resistant to the action of the reagent .
The tables seem also to show conclusively that the younger eggs are far more sensitive to the action of the acid or alkali , and generally to the influences of their environment than are the older eggs , or newly-hatched larvae , which are , indeed , extraordinarily resistant .
Thus , on referring again to Table I , it will be seen that a very large percentage of the older eggs survived 7 , and even 11 , days ' treatment , whereas , of the fresh eggs , over 25 per cent , in the Control , and a much larger number in all the other cases were dead within 10 days .
In this table the effect only of very small quantities of acid or alkali is given ( five-hundredth normal and under ) , but experimentation with somewhat larger amounts gave the same result as shown in Table II .
Thus , it needed only 6 c.c. of decinormal sodium hydrate to kill all the fresh eggs in four days , but more than 8 c.c. to kill all those of two days old in the same time , while , by the end of that period , 30 c.c. of alkali * * Univ. of California Publications , Physiol. , ' vol. 1 , 1904 , p. 137 , and ' Arch. f. gesaut .

which was the greatest strength employed , had killed , only 65 per cent , of the 10-days-old eggs .
Acids , above a small concentration , had a remarkably stronger effect\#151 ; in one day even 10-days-old eggs being killed by 10 c.c. , and the two other batches by 6 c.c. When working with the larger quantities of alkalies , it was very difficult to tell exactly when an egg was dead .
In the first experiments the point was taken at which the egg began to become opaque , but , as soon as the percentage of alkali present exceeds a very small amount , precipitation of calcium and magnesium hydrates takes place , which renders observation of such a change in the transparency of the egg difficult .
Loeb , in his experiments on Fundulus , * finds that the precipitate itself acts injuriously upon the eggs , and that , if this be filtered off , the eggs will live and develop in much stronger solutions than they would otherwise do .
The process of filtering off the precipitate before placing the eggs in the solutions was not tried in the course of these experiments , they having been carried out previously to the reading of Loeb 's paper .
Hitherto , it has always been considered that the young larva , on first hatching from the egg , enters upon the most critical stages in its career , and is at that time most susceptible to external influences , but the experiments here carried out appear to show a resistance steadily increasing with age , and that , even after the rupture of the egg-capsule , the young larva is , at all events , no more susceptible than just before that event .
It may be suggested that this steadily increasing resistance is due to the gradual development of the epidermal cells , which would form a protection to the young embryo more or less impervious to the surrounding solution .
Tables III , IY , and Y give the actual experimental data on which Table I is founded , and of which it is a resume .
Table YI is introduced with the object of laying emphasis on the statement as to the resisting powers of the older eggs .
It shows the percentage of these eggs which succeeded in hatching in spite of the very unnatural conditions ( stagnant water , possible overcrowding , etc. ) in which they were placed .
Incidentally may be noticed the very deadly effect of " di-methyl , " to which attention is now to be drawn .
II .
Effect of Indicators on Pleuronectes and Echinus .
The effects which di-methyl-amido-azo-benzol and phenol-phthalein produce upon living organisms , as illustrated by the eggs of Pleuronectes and Echinus esculentus , were accidentally discovered in the course of these experiments .
These indicators were originally added to the contents of some of the * ' Arch. f. Entwickelungsmechanik , ' vol. 7 , p. 631 .
Mr. E. Whitley .
Effect of Acid , etc. , on [ Nov. 14 , tumblers , to show any changes in reaction that might take place during growth .
When it was observed that they had a specific action upon the eggs , a series of experiments was undertaken with them , the results of which are shown in Tables VII\#151 ; X. In all the experiments , except those recorded in Table X , two drops of the indicator were added to 200 c.c. of sea-water , or sea-water plus varying quantities of alkali , in a tumbler .
Table X records the results of varying the amount of phenol-phthalein employed .
It will be seen that , although the indicators were made up in alcoholic solution , the amount of alcohol added in each case to 200 c.c. of liquid , was quite insufficient to materially influence the result .
The experiments without indicators , recorded in Tables VIII and IX , are included for purposes of comparison .
It will be observed from the figures obtained that dimethyl is very deadly to the eggs of Pleuronectes and phenol-phthalein innocuous , while the opposite holds good with Echinus , the dimethyl having , if anything , a favouring effect on growth , and the phenol-phthalein being very injurious .
Before killing , phenol-phthalein appears to be very effective in producing irregular divisions .
The dimethyl was readily absorbed as such by both the organisms , staining them a deep yellow , so there can be no question as to its having thoroughly penetrated the tissues .
So far as can be ascertained , this specific action of indicators has not been noted before , and no explanation can be given of the fact of the different indicators affecting the two organisms in exactly opposite ways .
Tadpoles in tap-water , to which the same , and even much larger amounts of these indicators had been added , appeared to be totally unaffected by either .
It might be of interest to repeat the experiments with other organisms , and with other organic compounds not known already to act as poisons .
Summary .
( 1 ) The amount of variation from the normal concentration of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in sea-water which the eggs of Pleuronectes will tolerate is very small .
( 2 ) A disturbance of the equilibrium towards the acid side is much more fatal than the opposite .
( 3 ) A progressive development of resistance to an unfavourable action of the environment takes place in proportion to the age of the eggs .
( 4 ) Phenol-phthalein is deadly to the eggs of Echinus esculentus , but harmless to those of Pleuronectes , while dimethyl quickly kills the latter , and appears , if anything , to have a favourable influence upon the development of the former .
