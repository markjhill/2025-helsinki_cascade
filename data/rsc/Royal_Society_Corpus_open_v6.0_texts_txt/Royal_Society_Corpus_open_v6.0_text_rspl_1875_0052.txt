theory , the communication of heat to a gas must cause a force reactionary on the surface , viz. whether this reaction was adequate in amount to cause the results seen to take place .
He adds a suggestion as to a new form of light-mill to have vanes inclined like the sails of a windmill , and not having one side white and the other black , like the .light-mills at present constructed , arguing that the forces act perpendicularly to the surface , and in a direction independent of that from which the light comes ; so that such a mill would turn like a windmill with the full and not merely the differential effect of the light .
Such a mill , he concludes , would furnish another test as to whether or not the force is directly referable to radiation .

( Abstract .
) Mr. Crookes has lately drawn attention to the mechanical action of a source of light on delicately suspended bodies vacuo ; I have made a few experiments which will , I think , throw some light on the cause of the phenomenon , and assist us in the explanation of the manifold and striking experiments made by Mr. Crookes .
I Whenever we observe a force tending to drive a body in a certain direction , we are sure to find a force equal in amount acting in the opposite direction on the body from which the force emanates .
It was with the view of finding the seat of this reaction that I have made a few experiments .
; If the force is directly due to radiation the reaction will be on the radiating body ; if , on the other hand , it is due to any interior action , such as the one suggested by Prof. Reynolds , the reaction will be on the enclosure of the moving bodies .
I have been able to test this by experiment , and I have found that the action and reaction is entirely between the light bodies suspended in vacuo and the exhausted vessel , f. The instrument best fitted for an experimental investigation of this kind is the one which has been called " radiometer " by Mr. Crookes .
These instruments have been made in great perfection by Dr. G-eissler , of Bonn , under the name of " light-mills .
" Thanks to the courtesy of Prof. Reynolds , I have been enabled to work with such an instrument .
The " light-mill " was suspended by means of two cocoon fibres , forming a bifilar suspension , from the top of a vessel which could be exhausted .
A slight movement of the enclosure could be easily detected by means of a concave mirror attached to it .
A beam of the oxyhydrogen lamp 392 Motion of a Body exposed to Heat and Light .
[ Mar. 23 , was concentrated on the light-mill , which then revolved about 200 times a minute .
The light was cut of\#163 ; at the beginning of the experiment by means of a screen , and the position of rest of the glass vessel was read off by means of the dot of light on the scale .
The screen waa then suddenly removed , and in every case a large deflection of the glass vessel was observed .
The vessel was deflected in the opposite direction to that in which the mill turned .
When the velocity of the mill had become constant , the vessel returned to its original position .
On suddenly cutting off the light the vessel was again deflected , but in the opposite direction to that on starting the experiment .
The vessel therefore now turned in the same direction in which the mill turned .
These experiments are easily explained on the assumption that the force acting on the vessel enclosing the light-mill is exactly equal and opposite to that acting on the mill itself .
While the velocity of the mill in one direction is increasing , a force acts in the opposite direction on the vessel .
When the velocity has become constant , the force which tends to drive the mill round is exactly counterbalanced by the resistance which opposes the motion of the mill .
The two forces acting on the vessel will therefore counterbalance , and the vessel will return to its original position of rest .
When the light is cut off , the resistance will stop the motion of the mill .
The reaction of the resistance will act on the enclosure , and the enclosure will turn in the same direction as the mill .
By means of the reaction on the enclosure I have been able to calculate the strength of the force ; and I have found that the pressure on a surface on which light of equal intensity to that used in my experiments falls , is equal to that produced by the weight of a film of water on a horizontal surface equal in thickness to the length of a wave of violet light .
