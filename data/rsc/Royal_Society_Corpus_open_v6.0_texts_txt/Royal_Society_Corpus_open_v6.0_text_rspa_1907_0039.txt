Space described in a Given Time by a Projectile Moving in Air .
By A. Mallock , F.R.S. ( Received March 22 , \#151 ; Read May 2 , 1907 .
) It was pointed out in the paper on " The Resistance of Air , " recently read before the Society , that for velocities from 1100 to 3000 feet per second , the resistance curve of a pointed projectile was approximately represented by a straight line which , if produced , would cut the axis of abscissae at = 850 f.s. The equation of this line is R = 2*53 ( ' ) , where R is the resistance in pounds per square foot of cross-sectional area , the velocities being in feet per second , and where v ' 850 f.s. The retardation ( / ) of the shot is given by ( v - v ' ) , where is the weight of the unit volume of material , and l the equivalent length of the projectile .
( By equivalent length is meant the length of a cylinder of the same weight and density as the projectile .
) The quantity pi is another , and for many purposes a more convenient , form of the ballistic coefficient , which is usually stated as 2 .
It represents the mass of the projectile per unit area of cross-section on which the retardation acts .
From equation for / , it is easy to deduce a formula for the space traversed by the projectile in a given time , and in this paper I give a few examples of ranges in terms of time computed from it .
The formula for the distance s , traversed by the shot in time t is* s=:v't + \#151 ; ( 1\#151 ; e at ) , -a and for the remaining velocity Vi = v ' + u0e~at , where v ' = 850 f.s. and v = initial velocity It is easy to plot curves of s and v in terms of t from this formula , by making a table for e~x and finding the times which correspond to the various values of x. Three examples of such curves are appended in the diagram , viz. , for 12-inch , 6-inch , and 0'303-inch projectiles .
The results of actual practice * Let the straight line AC be the diagram of retarding force in terms of velocity , where OB ( = v0 ) is the initial velocity and OA ( = v ' ) is 850 f.s. Space described in a Given Time by a Projectile Moving Air .

It will be seen that the results agree very closely with actual practice , so closely indeed as to be within the error of observation .
The equation of AC is / = \#151 ; a(v \#151 ; v ' ) .
Put v \#151 ; v ' \#151 ; u , v0 \#151 ; v ' \#151 ; u0 , so that a = fju0 .

( 2 ) Experiment shows that the resistance in lbs. per square foot is nearly represented U 2 276 Space described in a Given Time by a Projectile Moving in Air .
I think it is worthy of remark that this formula used with data derived solely from the weight and dimensions of the shot , together with the value for resistance above given , leads to results which are scarcely distinguishable from ( but probably more accurate than ) those obtained from actual firing , and this from the 12-inch shot , weighing 850 lbs. , down to the O'SOS-inch , which weighs 26,000 times less .
It remains , in order to construct a general formula for the range of all pointed projectiles , to find at what angle to the horizontal the trajectory must start in order that the shot may remain in the air for a given time .
This involves rather intricate questions relating to the effect which the spin of the rifled projectile has in keeping its axis nearly in the tangent to the trajectory , and will be touched on in another paper .

The number 2*53 refers to an ogival head with a radius of ogive of two diameters .
The coefficient for the 0303 projectile is 2'60 .
