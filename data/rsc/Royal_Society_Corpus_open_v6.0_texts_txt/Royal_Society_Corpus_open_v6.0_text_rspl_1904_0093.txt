If the amplitude of the fork dies down still further or the pressure between the card and the fork is increased , the lines disappear from the interior of the band and that at the end next to the fork becomes as strongly marked as the line at the other end .
This , of course , indicates that contact has ceased to be broken , and the only audible note given by the card is now the fundamental note of the fork .

( Abstract .
) This paper is a continuation of one already , * " On the Discovery of a Pigmy Elephant in the Pleistocene of Cyprus , " and enters into a detailed description of the teeth of this small proboscidean , whose remains are now in the British Museum of Natural History .
The collection includes incisors , milk molars , and permanent molars .
Several of the latter still retain their position in the jaws and , in some instances , the teeth of both sides of the same individual were found .
The permanent incisor tusks of two forms , presumably belonging to males and females , were found .
They dilfer from the same teeth of the Maltese dwarf elephants in being considerably compressed laterally .
The largest specimen measures 29-7 cm .
along the outside of the curve , with a maximum diameter of 3'7 cm .
Of the upper cheek teeth the third and fourth of the milk series as-well as the three permanent molars are described in detail .
There was a small third milk molar ( mm. 2 ) implanted by a single root , but no specimen was collected .
Of the lower series the third and fourth milk molars and the three permanent teeth were represented by numerous examples and are fully described .
An almost entire left ramus of one young individual and the symphysial portion of another are also described .
The only limb bone obtained was the distal portion of a femur .
A corrected ridge formula for the molars of E. Cypriotes is furnished , which , exclusive of talons , will stand as follows:\#151 ; ^ 5 7'_8 7\#151 ; 8 8\#151 ; 9 11\#151 ; 12 ' ' 5 ' 7^8 ' 7\#151 ; ^8 ' 8\#151 ; 9 ' 11\#151 ; 12* * Bead before the*Royal Society , May 7 , 1903 .

121 11 Dr. Leith Adams gives E. melitensis as follows:\#151 ; 3 5 8\#151 ; 9 8\#151 ; 9 10 12 3 ' 5 ' 8\#151 ; 9 ' 8\#151 ; 9 ' 10 ' 12* | I There appears to be a strong resemblance between the teeth of E. Cypriotes and those of the Maltese and Sicilian pigmy forms , more i| especially E. melitensis , but the marked lateral compression of the tusks in E. Cypriotes , which is a constant character in all the specimens so far obtained , would in itself be almost sufficient to distinguish this species from the other pigmy elephants of the Mediterranean region .
There ; seems to be good evidence that E. Cypriotes was isolated and subsequently differentiated at an earlier period than the other small Mediterranean species in Malta and Sicily , the zoological evidence giving considerable support to the belief that Cyprus became an island at an earlier period , an idea which is further strengthened by the fact that the whole island is surrounded by deep water , and is not connected ; with the neighbouring lands by submerged banks as is the case with the Maltese Islands .
The Maltese pigmy species have been considered most closely allied to E. antiquus and E. Africanus .
On the other hand it seems probable that E. Cypriotes , which shows no affinity to the African species , is rather connected with E. antiquus and E. meridionalis .
It may be remarked that the remains of E. Cypriotes and of s potamus minutus , with which it is associated , vary but little in size , whereas in the dwarf species of elephants and hippopotami from Malta and Sicily a considerable variation in size is observable , so much so indeed that molars may be seen intermediate in size connecting [ H.melitensis ( = minutus ) , H. pentlandi and H. amphibius .
