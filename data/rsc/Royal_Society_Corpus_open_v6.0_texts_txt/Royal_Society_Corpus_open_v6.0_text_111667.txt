" On the Application of Electrical Discharges from the Induction Coil to the purposes of Illumination .
" By J. P. GASSIOT , Esq. , F.R.S. Received March 29 , 1860 .
The subjoined figure represents a carbonic acid vacuum-tube of about I of an inch inter nal diameter , wounid in the form of a flattened spiral .
The wider ends of the tube , in which the platinum wires are sealed , are 2 inches in length and about I an inch ill diameter , and are shown by the dotted lines ; they are enclosed in a wooden case ( indicated by the surrounding entire line ) , so as to permit only the spiral to be exposed .
Whenl the discharge from a RIuhmkorff 's indu-ction apparatus ispassed throughthe vacuumtube , the spiral becomes intensely luminous , exhibiting a brillianit white light .
Mr. Gassiot , + who exhibited the experiment at the meeting of the Society , caused the discharge from the vj induction coil to pass through two miles of copper wire ; with the same coil excited so as to give a spark through air of onie inch in length , he ascertained that the luminosity in the spiral was not reduced when the discharge passed through 14 miles of No. 32 copper wire .
