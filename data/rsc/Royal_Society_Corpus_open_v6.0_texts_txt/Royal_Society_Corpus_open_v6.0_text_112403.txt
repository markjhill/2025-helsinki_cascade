V. Note by Professor CAYLEY on his Memoir ' " On the Conditions for the Existence of Three Equal Roots , or of Two Pairs of Equal Roots , of a Binary Quartic or Quintic .
" Received February 20 , 1869 .
The title is a misnomer ; I have in fact , in regard to the quintic , considered not ( as according to the title and introductory paragraph I should have done ) the twofold relations belonging to the root-systems 311 and 221 respectively , but the threefold relations belonging to the root-systems 41 and 32 respectively .
The word " quadric , " p. 582 , line 1 , should be read '"cubic .
" The proper title is , " On the Conditions for the Existence of certain Systems of Equal Roots of a Binary Quartic or Quintic .
