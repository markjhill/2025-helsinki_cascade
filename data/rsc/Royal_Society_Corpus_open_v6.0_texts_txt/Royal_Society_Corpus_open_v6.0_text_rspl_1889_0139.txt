1-356 " 0 -636 " Similarly , in attributing the diminution of the E.M.F. of gas batteries below the calculated amount to the circumstance that heat is evolved during the condensation of gases on surfaces like spongy metals , the authors appear to have been unacquainted with numerous previous papers by one of us , and more especially with one published in 1881 , in which this and various allied matters were pretty fully discussed , * and the conclusion arrived at ( inter alia ) , that " the heats of condensation of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum , \amp ; c. , may jointly amount to almost as large a quantity as that developed by their union to form liquid water."\#151 ; July 30th , 1889 .
