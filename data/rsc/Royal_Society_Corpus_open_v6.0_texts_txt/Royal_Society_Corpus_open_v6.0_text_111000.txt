" On the Protection of Iron from Oxidation and from becoming foul when it is exposed to the action of sea and other waters .
" By Mr. William John Hay .
Communicated by Admiral Beaufort , F.R.S. For attaining the objects mentioned in the title of this paper , the author was led by a process of experimental research , founded on chemical principle , to the discovery of the superior efficacy of a varnish consisting of one part of pitch and two parts of naphtha , together with ten pounds of the suband per-oxides of copper to each quart of the varnish .
This varnish is made to adhere by applying it to the iron previously rendered hot by placing underneath it braziers of ignited charcoal .
He found that this coating of varnish not only protected the iron from oxidation , but formed a perfect barrier to electro-chemical action between the copper oxide and the iron .
Two or three of these coats are applied in succession , each being laid on after the preceding one has become hardened .
The trials made of this method on various ships , the results of which aro detailed in an appendix to the paper , have proved perfectly satisfactory .
