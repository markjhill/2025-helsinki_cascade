A Letter on a Canal in the Medulla Spinalis of some Quadrupeds .
In a Letterfrom Mr. William Sewell , to Everard Home , Esq. F.R.S. Read December 8 , 1808 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1809 , p. 146 .
] The canal , which is the subject of this letter , appears to have been discovered by the author in the year 1803 , although no account has been given of it till the present description was drawn up at the request of Mr. Home .
From the extremity of the sixth ventricle of the brain in the horse , bullock , sheep , hog , and dog ( which corresponds to the fourth ventricle in the human subject ) , a canal passes in a direct course to the centre of the spinal marrow , and may be discovered in its course by a transverse section of the spinal marrow in any part of its length , having a diameter sufficient to admit a large-sized pin ; and it is proved to be a continued tube , from one extremity to the other , by the passage of quicksilver in a small stream in either direction through it .
This canal is lined by a membrane resembling the tunica arachnoidea ; and it is most easily distinguished where the large nerves are given off in the bend of the neck , and at the sacrum .
