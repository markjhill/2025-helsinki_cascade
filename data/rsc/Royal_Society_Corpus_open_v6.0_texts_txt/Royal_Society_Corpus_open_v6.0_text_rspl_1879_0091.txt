hence we obtain at once , and , which will render the solution of the equations easy , at all events , in all possible cases .
I would moreover remark that the validity of the process depends on expanding in a converging series , so that the method of evaluation here , of course in ( 109 ) , ( 110 ) , depends on certain conditions , to which the constants in the integrals must be subjcct .

By a development of the methods indicated in the former papers we obtain the following integrals:\mdash ; ( 115 .

) Hence we see the values of By a similar method we may find ( 130 .

) We may also find when ( r ) is even , with a similar expression when ( r ) is odd .
I shall now hope to prove that every function of an algebraical magnitude may be regarded as a centre , from which systems of definite integrals emanate in all directions , like rays from a stal .
, in such a manner , that the value of each integral is equivalent to the original function transformed by a known symbol .
