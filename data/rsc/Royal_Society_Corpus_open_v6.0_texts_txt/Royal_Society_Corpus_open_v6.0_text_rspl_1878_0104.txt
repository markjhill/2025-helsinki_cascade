, when introduced into my calculation of Mr. Darwin 's problem , p. 182 , will double the result , and give 19,350 years to represent the 19,200 years , found by Mr. Darwin .
I would wish to add , that Mr. Darwin , in a letter to myself , proposes to call the cycloidal wabble described by him , a " lopsided wabble , " as distinguished from the simple circular " " described by me ; the one being caused by continuous motion of the axis of figure , and the other caused by sudden displacement of that axis .

On the Specific Inductive Capacities of Certain Dielectrics .

( Abstract .
) A paper of mine with the above title was communicated to the Royal Society by Professor J. Clerk Maxwell , F.R.S. , on March 9th , 1878 .
It was read on March 28th , and an abstract of it appeared in the " Proceedings."* * In the course of the summer it was pointed out to me that owing to a mistake in the formula of calculation all the results were wrong .
I , therefore , requested permission to withdraw my paper , in order to recalculate the results .
The new values of K arrived at led me to make some determinations of refractive indices and to re-write the theoretical deductions at the close of the paper .
I now beg through Professor Maxwell to present the paper in an amended form , in the hope that it may be found not entirely unworthy of the attention of the Royal Society.^ As it would be impossible within the limits of an abstract to give any intelligible account of the new method of experiment ( due to Professor Maxwell ) , which has been employed , I will merely give the table of results , reserving all discussion and explanation until the publication of my paper in full .
I may , however , state that the method is a zero method , that the electrified metal plates never touch the dielectrics , and that the electrification , which is produced by an induction coil , has an electromotive force equal to that of about 2,050 chloride of silver cells , and is reversed some 12,000 times per second .

V J The following table compares the refractive indices of the transparent dielectrics with the square roots of the specific inductive capacities .
Tn cases where there is a wide difference is taken from books on physics ; wherever there was a close agreement it was carefully determined by the author , except in the case of paraffin , where the value is that given in Maxwell 's " Electricity .
" * Messrs. Gibson and Barclay , " Phil. Trans. , " 1871 , using a method entirely different from mine , obtained K = 1'977 for paraffin .
Correcting for a slight difference of density , I find that if they had used my paraffin their result would have been 1-9833 .
f I am not quite certain of the accuracy of this result .

Discussion of the WorTcing Hypothesis that the so-called Elements are Compound Bodies .
Part I. It is known to many Fellows of the Society that I have for the last four years been engaged opon the preparation of a map of the solar spectrum on a large scale , the work including a comparison of the Fraunhofer lines with those visible in the spectrum of the vapour of each of the metallic elements in the electric arc .
To give an idea of the thoroughness of the work , at all events in intention , I may state that the complete spectrum of the sun , on the scale of the working map , will be half a furlong long ; that to map the metallic lines and purify the spectra in the manner which has already been described to the Society , more than 100,000 observations have been made and about 2,000 photographs taken .
In some of these photographs we have vapours compared with the sun ; in others vapours compared with each other ; and others again have been taken to show which lines are long and which are short in the spectra .
I may state by way of reminder that the process of purification consisted in this : When , for instance , an impurity of Mn was searched for in Fe , if the longest line of Mn was absent , the short lines must also be absent on the hypothesis that the elements are elementary ; if the longest line were present , then the impurity was traced down to the shortest line present .
