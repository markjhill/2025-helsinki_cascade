The following Paper was read:\#151 ; I. " Experiments on the Nutritive Value of Wheat Meal .
" By A. Winter Blithe .
Communicated by Dr. Lauder Brunton , F.R.S. Received March 30 , 1889 .
A physician , who may be designated as A , undertook to live for twenty-eight days on distilled water and whole meal .
Each day a certain quantity of the meal was ground by himself , weighed , and made either into cakes or porridge by means of distilled water .
The excreta were forwarded to me for analysis .
The experiment may be divided into three stages:\#151 ; ( 1 ) A period of eight days , during which the insufficient quantity of 16 ozs .
( 453'59 grams ) of whole meal was taken ; ( 2 ) a period of fourteen days , during which 20 ozs .
( 566'98 grams ) of whole meal were taken ; ( 3 ) a period of seven days during which 28 ozs .
( 793'77 grams ) of whole meal were taken .
General Physiological Effects .
The condition of A was carefully tested by Mr. Randall at Mr. Francis Galton 's laboratory , before and during these periods .

Mr. A. W. Blithe .
[ Apr. H , At the end of the first period , during which the insufficient quantity of 16 ozs .
was taken , there was a loss in weight of 7 lbs. , the breathing capacity seemed a little increased , but the tests showed no other marked deviation from the above .
During the second period , in which the meal was increased to 20 ozs .
, there was a farther loss of 3 lbs. During the third period , when 28 ozs .
were taken , this loss of weight ceased and a slight gain was recorded .
During the whole twenty-eight days , A suffered , according to his own account , but trifling inconvenience : the bodily functions were regularly performed , the mental capacity unaltered ; there was a marked absence of indigestion , the sleep was sound , and there was no deterioration of muscular power .
On the other hand there was a marked decrease of sexual power as well as desire .
The appearance of A during and at the end of the experiment was not that of perfect health .
The features were pinched ; there was slight anaemia .

The whole meal was analysed by ordinary methods , the nitrogen being determined by Kjeldahl 's process , the fat in a Soxhlet 's apparatus by exhaustion with petroleum ether .
The faeces were passed into strong redistilled methyl alcohol , dried , powdered and treated simi* Reaction time for sound and sight in hundredths of a second .

The urine was also treated by Kjeldahl for nitrogen , the solid residue by evaporating several 5 c.c. in platinum dishes to dryness , and the phosphoric acid by the volumetric uranium method .

The table shows that 82'6 per cent , of the dry substance was assimilated , of the fat 69 per cent , disappeared , 2'22 grams of nitrogen were excreted in excess of that ingested , there was ( practically ) phosphoric acid equilibrium , there were more salts excreted than taken in , and there was excretion of sulphur and chlorine , although the water taken as a drink and mixed with the food was distilled , and only a small quantity of unoxidised sulphur could be detected in the flour .

1-06 +1 *06 Paring this last period there was retention of nitrogen .
The phosphates were pretty well balanced , that is , ingestion was nearly equal to excretion , 83'6 per cent , of the total dry substance was digested , but only 36 per cent , of the fat .
It is to be noted that there was an undiminished urinary output of chlorine and sulphur .
The constant undiminished excretion of sulphuric acid as sulphate by the urine and a small quantity of unoxidised sulphur by the intestinal canal , although only traces were found in the flour itself , rendered it desirable that there should be a control experiment upon some other person .
Accordingly , an Oxford graduate , upon whom every reliance could be placed , undertook to live for one week upon whole meal and distilled water .
This gentleman will be referred to as O. O lived a sedentary life , was of a slight build , and weighed 137 lbs. at the commencement of the experiment .
He took also each day a measured quantity of olive oil , the oil being mixed with the whole meal and baked with it .
The quantity of whole meal taken daily varied from 16\#151 ; 22 ozs .
The solid excreta of the last three days only were collected for analysis , and the urine of the last two days .

There was ( practically ) nitrogenous and phosphoric acid equilibrium ; there was some retention of salts , perhaps to be attributed to the small quantity of liquid 0 drank .
Sulphnr was excreted , although only traces were ingested , and the excretion of chlorine was small .
At the end of the experiment 0 was in good health .
He had lost a little in weight\#151 ; 1*25 lbs. The importance of obtaining exact information of the nutritive powers of bread as the basis of ordinary diet need scarcely be accentuated .
The quantities of whole meal consumed per diem were , it is obvious , deficient in nitrogen , in fat , and in salts .
Both of the gentlemen who undertook the experiment lived an ordinary town life , that is , they daily took moderate exercise , but their pursuits involved no manual or hard labour , and therefore must be classed as sedentary ; but a less supply than 18 grams of nitrogen and 5 grams of fat would not be likely to keep either of them for a long period in the highest health .
The excretion of sulphate by the urine and of unoxidised sulphur by the bowel is interesting and demands still further experiment ; considering that sulphur is an essential component of albumen , too little attention has hitherto been paid to its study as a food , but it is obvious that once it is accepted that the external supplies of sulphur were cut off , the sulphur found must have been derived from sulphur stores in the body , with possibly a trifling amoxint condensed in the lung from breathing London air .
If the excretion by the bowel be considered waste , then on an average 15*6 per cent , of the total nitrogen in the bread or whole nieal is not in an assimilable form ; about 37 per cent , of the fat is also not digested , and 51 " 8 per cent , of the ash also passes away .
