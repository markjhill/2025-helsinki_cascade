] The accompanying map of the solar spectrum between the limits of X 7150 and X 10,000 is made from photographs taken with the diffraction gratings , and is more complete in every respect than the map from X 7600 to X 10,000 which appeared in the Phil. Trans , for 1880 , under the title of " The Method of Mapping the Least Refrangible End of the Spectrum .
" In the map which accompanied the paper above referred to the scale numbers attached to the different lines have more accuracy than the wave numbers , and it was to correct the latter that the new series of photographs have been taken .
It is my intention at some future and indeterminate time to publish the photographs of this region in connexion with Professor Rowland 's new photographic spectrum which he has in hand , and these will show the minute features of the spectrum down to a wave-length of nearly double that shown ; but as the wave-lengths adopted for the visible spectrum by Professor Rowland differ slightly from those given by Angstrom , I Lave thought it better to publish the part which , is to supersede the map of 1880 on the latter scale , leaving the discussion of the true wave-numbers to a later period .
It must be recollected at the time the first map of this region was made that the photographic process employed was comparatively new\#151 ; that is to say , it had been brought to its true state of perfection but a short time .
Four years have elapsed since then , and much experimental work has been undertaken in connexion with it ; and moreover the instrumental defects which were then present have been remedied to a large extent , new apparatus having been procured and finer gratings having been employed .
Process employed .
A reference to the paper of 1880 will give the idea of the sensitive salt of silver which I then employed , and as regards its nature I have not found any marked improvement to note ; but in the development I have succeeded in effecting an advance .
My developer now , as then , is the ferrous oxalate developer , but I have found that by employing a glass plate which is previously coated with gelatine emul-sion instead of a bare glass plate to receive the sensitive salt , a more powerful solution of ferrous oxalate , without any large addition of restrainer , is capable of being used .
The mode of preparation of the collodion emulsion is nearly the same as that given in the Phil. Trans , for 1880 , except that I find the addition of nitric acid is not necessary to he present whilst the emulsion is formed , though in the subsequent washings it is convenient to use it .
This may be avoided , however , by washing first with water , and using a dilute solution of iodine to eliminate the veil which is nearly always present after the emulsion is boiled .
To the emulsion when prepared I add about ^ per cent , of good soluble cotton ; that known as Anthony 's No. 1 I find the most satisfactory .
A very sensitive gelatine emulsion plate is coated with the collodion emulsion , washed , and then allowed to dry in a warm chamber .
The washing causes a minute portion of the underlying gelatine to mingle with the collodion film surrounding the sensitive salt , and to protect it from premature reduction by the ferrous oxalate solution .
As I have pointed out in other communications , gelatine acts as a physical restrainer , in contradistinction to a soluble alkaline bromide , which acts as a chemical restrainer .
When the former is used there is no partial obliteration of the effect of radiation on the salt , as is the case when the latter is employed ; and as a consequence a shorter exposure is necessary .
Apparatus employed .
At first I used the grating with which I had worked for some time previously in my preliminary work .
It had a surface of 1^ inches square and about 17,200 wires to the inch , and it is excellent in its performance though with spectra of high orders , ghosts can be traced .
Wishing to use less dispersion to obtain a higher wavelength , I secured from Mr. Chapman , of New York , a grating ruled on parallel glass which Mr. A. Hilger had prepared .
For the visible spectrum this glass grating gives excellent results , but it is otherwise for the infra-red .
When I obtained the grating I backed it with a mercury amalgam , intending to use it as a reflection grating through the glass , but on trying it I found that the spectrum in the first order ceased about X 8300 .
This want of success I laid to the metallic backing , and removed it to replace it with one of silver .
The glass was carefully cleaned with nitric acid and very dilute potash and alcohol , and silvered by Martin 's process .
On taking it from the bath I was surprised to find that the layer of silver was so delicate that it took in the grooves formed by the rulings , and that reflection spectra could be taken from both surfaces , ^.e .
, from the silvered surface direct or through the glass .
A grating such as this would have proved of the very greatest service , since all that is necessary to have a perfect reflecting surface is to remove the silver film and to re-silver again .
Unfortunately the grating thus silvered proved to be useless for my purpose , for there was no infra-red spectrum , probably owing to some peculiarity in the shape of the grooves formed in ruling .
That such phenomena are by no means uncommon would now appear to be recognised .
Professor Rowland most generously gave me several gratings , and amongst them is one ruled on a spherical concave surface , of a radius of 7 feet 9 inches .
This grating is so ruled that there is one really bright spectrum , and that one of the first order ; all the other spectra are faint .
In another grating the CAPTAIN W. DE W. ABNEY ON THE SOLAR SPECTRUM .
spectrum of the third order is brighter than the second order on one side , and the second order brighter than the first order on the other side .
This shows that the very-greatest care must always be taken in deducing any value for radiation in any particular region unless the constants of the particular grating employed are known .
Both nf these last-mentioned gratings have been employed for the producing the photographs to which the map is referred .
Besides these , Professor Rowland sent me for this work two beautiful concave gratings of about 3600 lines to the inch , of 5 feet 7 inches and 4 feet 8 inches radii respectively .
These have been employed for the still lower regions of the spectrum .
Taking a hint from Professor Rowland , I used the concave gratings with their axes perpendicular to the photographic plate , but I adopted a plan which is somewhat different to that proposed and utilised by Professor Rowland .
The annexed figure will give an idea of a mounting for the 7 feet 6 inches concave grating .
Fig. 3 .
A A is a plank some 8 feet 6 inches long ; at one end of it , E , is placed the grating , with its axis lying along the centre of the plank ; G G is a camera , as shown , the plate being inserted at H at exactly the distance of the radius of the grating from its centre .
At a point bisecting the radius of the grating a pivot is fixed in the plank A , round which the plank B can turn , and another pin or pivot is placed at D , also exactly at a distance of half the radius from the first pivot .
Round D the plank C C can turn , which carries a tube , F , with the slit S attached .
S is placed exactly over D. By this arrangement the slit S and the tube F can always be made to point towards E , no matter to what angle the plank B is turned away from A ; and as D travels on the circumference of a circle in which the plane of the plate and the grating lie , the diffraction spectra are always in focus on H , and the scale of the spectrum is invariable .
This plan I adopted for portability 's sake , and also because my laboratory is somewhat confined in extent .
At K is a slow motion screw , of which Fig. 2 is a representation on a larger scale , which turns the tube bearing the slit , and I found this arrangement better than turning the slit itself : a is a band encircling the brass tube , is a screw turned by K , which screws into a swivel at c ; when K is turned the tube F turns in 3 n 2 its bearings with a slow motion .
In reference to this I may mention that nearly all friction between the brass tube and the wood is avoided by placing between them pieces of baize or cloth .
With a concave grating the necessity of the slit being accurately parallel to the lines of the ruling cannot be too much insisted upon , since the definition very largely depends upon it .
Fig. 2 .
The majority of the photographs which have been measured were taken with the flat grating , and as the apparatus differs slightly in its details from that previously described , I annex a drawing showing how it was employed .
S is the slit ; a beam of light falls on the right-angle prism which reflects it to the mirror M ' , whence it by successive reflections from G and M7/ falls on P , the photographic plate .
The mirrors M7 and M77 have radii of curvature of about 7 feet each ; M ' is so placed that the rays from S are made parallel and fall on the grating G. The spectra thus formed are very bright and the definition excellent , and I can strongly recommend this arrangement for spectrum work , whether gratings or prisms are employed .
The object in using this arrangement was to secure the focus of all overlapping rays being in the same plane , thus allowing coincidences between the first and second and the second and third orders to be discussed .
For filling the gratings with light a quartz or glass condensing lens was employed , though a silvered mirror was also utilised .
The sunlight was reflected from a helio-stat , the mirror being silvered on the front surface .
In reference to this I may say that Colonel Festing and myself have examined the reflective power of silver and a CAPTAIN W. DE W. ABNEY ON THE SOLAR SPECTRUM .
variety of other metals for radiation , extending from X 6600 to 27,000 , which we hope to submit shortly to the Royal Society .
Measurement of the negatives .
The negatives , some 30 in number , were all measured by a micrometer by A. Hilger , which was placed at my disposal by the Department of Science and Art .
Of the performance of this instrument I cannot speak too highly .
It is capable of measuring to the xo(H)o~o of an inch , but for any photographs which I have obtained , or which I believe can be obtained , this is too delicate ; the 10o0-q of an inch is the unit which alone is necessary , any readings for a well defined line rarely differing more than 1 or 2 of these units from the mean of a series .
In most of the photographs measured , a o wave-length on Angstrom 's scale is nearly o 'f an inch ; any error in wave-length through had measurement would therefore only be effected in the second place of decimals : a degree of accuracy which is , for the present , sufficient , since the wavelengths are only carried to the first place .
In obtaining fiducial wave-lengths the numbers given by Angstrom for the visible spectra of the higher order of spectrum with which the infra red had to be compared have been generally adopted , though in some cases the corrections found in Vogel 's map have been utilised when it was found that the interpolation formula better agreed with the latter than with the former .
Cornu 's map was used for the ultra violet comparisons , together with photographs on the normal scale made by Professor Rowland .
In many instances the wave-lengths have also been checked by photographs taken on the normal scale , the measures obtained being proportional to the differences in wave-lengths .
The labour of mapping the spectrum has been much augmented by this process , as every difference in the first decimal place between Angstrom 's and my own determination had to he discussed .
In the tables the first column shows the number assigned to each line , the second column the measures of the photographs , the third the deduced wave-lengths , and the fourth check measures taken from other photographs .
Atmospheric Lines .
In previous papers by Colonel Resting and myself we have discussed the effect of water in the atmosphere , and shown that it has a marked effect in shortening the solar spectrum when present in any quantity .
We have also shown that the A line is not due to aqueous vapour .
It has been asserted by Eggeroff that this line is due to oxygen .
This may be so ; but if it be , the absorption by this gas is very intense , since I have found that it does not vary in intensity when observed and photographed at a height of about 9000 feet , at Zermatt at the end of June , from that observed in England at sea level .
That many lines are due to aqueous vapour there is no doubt , but there are an equal number of lines which cannot be so disposed of .
Part of the group , for instance , extending from A to 8200 , alter in appearance at sunset and midday , whilst other lines below it do not appear to vary .
Again , X/ 5 X/ /5 X/ // } are unmistakably not due to ordinary atmospheric absorptions , nor are the pair which I have called Y. There are some metallic lines present which appear to be coincident with certain lines in the spectrum , and as I have before pointed out in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , these are all metals of a low melting-point .
My observations have been confirmed recently by Henri Becquerel in an unmistakable manner , since he was , at the time he made his research , I believe , unaware of the paper alluded to .
I have finally to record my thanks to Sergeant H. Jackson , RE .
, and Mr. Walter Bradfield , my two assistants , for the care they have taken in the work , which has been long and arduous , extending over the best of five years to complete .
