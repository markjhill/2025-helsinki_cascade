( Abstract .
) The first part of the author 's researches on the Tides of the Arctic Seas was forwarded to the Royal Society in November 1861 , and contained the discussion of the Diurnal Tides of Port Leopold .
In the present communication the Semidiurnal Tides of the same port are discussed , and the following results obtained .
The eccentricity of the moon 's orbit is calculated from the parallactic inequality , and found to be 0-5303 .
The solitidal interval is 56m .
The lunitidal interval 41 ' 54m .
The ratio of the solar to the lunar coefficient is found to be 0'3956 .
The mass of the moon 7-iltth .
And the depth of the Atlantic is calculated from received tidal theories .
The most probable results are found to be , From semidiurnal tidal intervals .
3'529 miles .
From diurnal coefficients ... 3-690 , , There are other values of the depth of the sea , much greater than these , which follow from other considerations of the tidal theory ; and the author is unable to explain why theory should give results so different .
The preceding , however , he believes to be most in accordance with facts .
