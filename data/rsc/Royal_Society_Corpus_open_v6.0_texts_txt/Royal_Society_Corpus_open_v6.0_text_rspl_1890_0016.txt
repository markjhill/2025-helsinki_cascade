[ June 5 , But when the observations came to be finally reduced , it was found that the difference between Colonel Herschel 's results at Kew and Greenwich , as shown independently by the three pendulums , had an extreme range of about seven vibrations in the daily vibration number .
The cause of theso differences was mysterious and inexplicable , and there was no alternative but to swing the pendulums a second time at the two observatories .
The revisionary work was undertaken by the observatory staff at each place , in such intervals of leisure as they could obtain from their regular operations .
The final results , by the three pendulums , make the vibration number at Kew in excess of that at Greenwich by 1'56 , 150 , and 0'59 , giving an average excess of 1*22 .
The correction to this quantity for the excess of height of the Greenwich over the Kew Observatory is \#151 ; 0'58 .
Thus , the revisionary operations , reduced to the mean sea-level , make the excess of Kew over Greenwich = 0*64 of a vibration , which may be accepted as very fairly probable .

The Plasticity of Ice .
In a paper , ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , 1886 , p. 544 , I recorded the result of " Observations on Pure Ice and Snow , " and having subsequently had occasion to use large quantities of low temperature freezing mixtures in the prosecution of other investigations , it seemed desirable to take advantage of the opportunity , and to further utilise the freezing mixtures in making collaterally the following additional experiments bearing on some of the plastic or viscous properties of ice at various temperatures .
Messrs. J. C. McConnel and D. A. Kidd , in their valuable and interesting paper on " The Plasticity of Glacier and other Ice ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 44 , 1888 , p. 331 ) , remark that " the variation of the plasticity of ice with the temperature is of great interest both for the theory of glaciers and for the explanation of the plasticity itself .
" I hope , therefore , that the experiments now recorded may assist in affording some information in connexion with this subject .
An acquaintance with the causes of the flow of glaciers can scarcely be complete without some accurate experimental knowledge of the plasticity of ice at various temperatures , and it was partly with this object that the following experiments were commenced .
The experiments form a continuation of those contained in my former paper .
The arrangement of apparatus is described below , and illustrated by the accompanying sketch , fig. 1 .

] Observations on Pure Ice .
Fig. l. 4 .
A The ice for the pure ice experiments was frozen from distilled water contained in a sheet-iron vessel .
The inner tank was surrounded both at the sides and bottom by an outer jacket of iron , which was provided with holes at the bottom for the waste liquids to escape .
The coolest freezing mixture used , No. 1 , consisting of three parts by weight of crystallised calcium chloride and two parts by weight of snow , was placed in the compartment A , which yielded a constant temperature of \#151 ; 35 ' F. There was also provided a larger outer compartment B , filled with the freezing mixture No. 2 , of snow and ordinary salt , giving a steady temperature of 0 ' F. , the latter mixture , No 2 , completely enclosing the inner and coolest freezing preparation , No. 1 .
Good results were obtained by using this arrangement .
Previous to mixing , large quantities of the snow and calcium chloride crystals were stored and maintained separately at a temperature of 9 F. in other vessels , and the respective freezing mixtures , No. 1 in compartment A , and No. 2 in compartment B , surrounding the ice tank were constantly renewed during the experiments from these cold stores .
Thermometers were inserted in the mixtures and also in the ice during the experiments .
The preceding description refers to the maintenance of the ice block at the lower temperature of \#151 ; 35 ' F. for the observations required at that temperature .
For the observations at 0 ' F. the ice block was surrounded only by the freezing mixture of snow and salt placed for these experiments in compartment A , and the ice block was encircled by snow only for Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 5 , ' the experiments at 32 ' F. On repeating the experiments in every instance , the water for the ice block was first frozen by the application of a temperature of 0 ' F. , which was afterwards reduced to __35 ' F. In making the observations , the extent of the penetration of the steel rod at the latter low temperature was first taken ; the ice was then allowed gradually to acquire throughout a temperature of ?
0 ' F. , and its penetrability ascertained ; the ice block was afterwards allowed to reach the temperature of 28 ' and 32 ' F. , and the final measurements obtained .
The results recorded are the average of numerous measurements taken directly at different places on the ice block a sufficient distance apart , the indentation caused by the previous penetration of the rod being filled with water , which rapidly froze up .
The variation in penetrability at different places on the ice block when measurements were taken at the same temperature was not great .
The polished steel rod used for ascertaining the penetrability was 16 inches long and 0'292 inch diameter ; its extremity was a flat disk , so as to avoid any liability of shearing action .
The rod was maintained in an upright position by a suitable arrangement of guides , and error arising from its conductivity was obviated by surrounding it throughout its length with fine sawdust contained in a loosely fitting bag which surrounded it .
The weight , of 181^ lb. ( inclusive of the weight of the platform and guides ) , was placed on a sliding wood platform working in a frame , the whole weight resting during experimentation on the top of the steel rod ( see fig. 1 ) .
Repeated observations were made in the above manner with the results recorded on Diagram I. I also made a large number of experiments on the plasticity of natural lake or pond ice , which were conducted in a somewhat similar manner ; the results showed a greater absence of uniformity in the amount of penetration when compared with results at a similar temperature obtained from the specially prepared pure ice blocks .
The observations were taken on the surface of the ice of a large artificial lake or dam , being a storage reservoir for Wortley IronWorks , about 4 acres in extent , the depth varying from about 8 to 10 feet , the thickness of the ice being given on Diagram II .
The water of this pond is still , no current of water passing through it ; it is therefore practically a small lake .
The observations were taken after sunset , and mostly throughout the long cold nights , so as to avoid , as far as possible , any influence of the sun on the surface of the pond ice .
A number of measurements were taken adjacently in one locality of the pond , the apparatus being removed to another part for another set of observations , and so on , till the completion of the results .
The observations were taken at various periods extending over some time .
Thermometers were inserted in the ice , and the atmospheric ternObservations on Pure .

The results are given on Diagram TI .
In connexion with the influence of the composition of water on the plasticity of the ice frozen therefrom , it may be desirable to give an analysis of the water supplying the pond , which was as under:\#151 ; Table I.\#151 ; Analyses of Water .

The reaction of the water with litmus was slightly acid , and sulphates were generally present in quantity .
A number of experiments were made to ascertain whether any portion of the saline constituents of the pond water was taken up into the ice during crystallisation .
Contrary to expectation , and instead of the ice being found perfectly pure and free from saline matters , it was noticed that the composition of the natural ice was materially affected by the presence of a proportion of the salts of the water from which the ice was crystallised .
Roughly speaking , the proportion of inorganic matter found in the melted ice would be about 10 per cent , of the total inorganic salts contained in the pond water from which it was frozen ; it was also observed that there was a great propor110 Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 5 , tionate preponderance of organic matter in the ice compared with the water .
The experiments were made as follows:\#151 ; Portions of the ice were taken from numerous places on the pond , and very thoroughly washed with distilled water , the ice was then melted in large glass beakers , and the melted ice was found to be perfectly clear and translucent , there being no deposit after the water had stood for a considerable time .
The melted ice , in quantities of half a gallon , was evaporated to dryness in a platinum basin , the residue dried at 212 ' and weighed , being subsequently ignited and again re-weighed .
The results are given on Table II .
The results obtained confirm the observations made by Buchanan on the composition of ice in Arctic seas ; see remarks hereon towards the close of this Memoir .

These experiments show that the plasticity of the ice was very Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 5 , rapidly and considerably increased after reaching , and whilst it after , w ards remained at , a temperature of 32 ' F. General Remarks .
1st .
Referring to the results of Diagram I , and taking the relative penetration of the steel rod at the respective temperatures as an in-dication of the plasticity of the ice , it will be noticed that there was a considerable reduction of plasticity as the temperature lowered .
Regarding as a guide the total depth penetrated by the steel rod , during equal and comparative periods of time ( as , for instance , the results at 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , \amp ; c. , hours , Diagram I , curves 1 , 2 , 3 ) , into ice at different temperatures , these comparative experiments show , in a majority of instances , that , if the plasticity of the ice at \#151 ; 35 ' P. be called one , at 0 ' F. it would be about twice as much , and at 28 ' P. the plasticity would be about four times as great as at 0 ' F. , or eight times as much as at \#151 ; 35 ' F. When the ice was maintained at a temperature of 32 ' F. , it will be seen that the plasticity very considerably increased , this being probably owing to the reduced cohesion at this temperature between the faces of the ice crystals forming the mass .
2nd .
It will be further noticed that the plasticity was greater during the gradual molecular changes occurring in course of the slow rising of temperature from 0 ' F. to 32 ' F. , see results on Table III , than when the ice was maintained at even temperatures , as in the experiments on Diagram I. 3rd .
Reverting to the observations on Table IV , if the time required for the steel rod to penetrate a certain depth , say , 6^ inches , into the ice under conditions of experiments 1 , 2 , and 3 , Table IV , be taken as an indication of the relative plasticity of the ice under conditions of these experiments , it will be seen that the plasticity was roughly aboiit 579 per cent , greater in No. 2 than No. 1 , and 1400 per cent , greater in No. 3 than in No. 2 , these results showing proportionately the rapid manner in which the mass of ice was becoming internally plastic , although retaining an outward apparent rigidity .
The Rev. Coutts Trotter , in his paper ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 38 , 1885 , p. 92 ) , states that " the 'viscosity of ice probably diminishes very rapidly with the temperature , " and it appears probable from the experiments of M. Person ( ' Comptes Rendus , ' vol. 30 , 1850 , pp. 528 ) that \#151 ; 2 0 .
is the temperature at which ice begins to soften .
The Rev. O. Trotter , after summarising the experimental evidence , also arrives at the conclusion that the general interior and bottom portions of a glacier , near the surface of the earth , are of a constant temperature of about 0 ' C. , and my experiments recorded on Diagrams I and II and Tables III and IV demonstrate the greater Observations on Pure Tee .
1890 .
] plasticity of ice , in the mass , at similar temperatures .
Mr. Trotter further remarks that " the supposition that , while ice at 0 ' C. is sensibly viscous , the viscosity diminishes rapidly with the temperature is in complete accordance with the facts of the changes which take place in a glacier during the winter .
" The comparatively great contraeti-bility in ice observed at considerably reduced temperatures , see my paper on " Observations on Pure Ice and Snow " ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , 1886 , p. 544 ) , accounts for the great reduction in its plastic properties .
This is in full accord with the practical cessation of motion in glaciers during the cold of winter .
I believe that the plastic properties of ice in the mass are variable , and are also , to some extent , influenced by the rapidity or otherwise of its crystallisation .
Thus , a mass of water rapidly frozen at an intensely low temperature would , no doubt , crystallise into a larger number of smaller crystals than those which would result from a more slow solidification of the mass of water at a comparatively higher temperature of freezing .
4th .
It will be noticed , on comparing the results of Diagrams I and II , that the plasticity of the naturally frozen pond ice was manifestly greater than that of the artificially prepared pure ice , and the difference in results may , to a. certain extent , probably be accounted for by difference of composition of the respective frozen waters and ice ( the block ice being frozen from pure distilled water , the composition of the pond water and ice frozen therefrom being given on Tables I and II ) ; I think , also , the difference was , to some extent , owing to the direction from which the pond ice was frozen , viz. , from the surface only .
Further , this comparative difference in the behaviour of the pond ice was doubtless owing to a portion of the saline constituents of the water interspersing , during congelation , between the faces of the individual crystals of ice , thereby tending to reduce the cohesion of the mass as a whole and increasing its plasticity .
Mr. J. Y. Buchanan , F.R.S. , has shown that in Arctic ice , contrary to expectation , the whole of the salts do not separate from sea-water ice during congelation , but that they remain interspersed amongst the interstices of the crystalline mass ( " Ice and Brine , " 'Edinburgh Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 14 , 1888 , p. 129 ) .
My experiments on Table II also show that the composition of pond or natural river ice is affected in a similar manner , and afford confirmation of the views held by Buchanan on the composition of sea-water ice in Arctic regions .
The fact of the pond ice having been slowly crystallised would further tend to modify its physical properties , compared with ice rapidly crystallised by an intensely low temperature , simultaneously acting only from the bottom and sides of the mould or tank .
Measurements of the expansibility of ice may also be affected accordingly as such measurements are taken either longitudinally or Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 5 , transversely to the line of the cold crystallising force , and from my former experiments in this direction ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 40 , 1886 p. 544 ) , I think there appear substantial indications that ice may expand unequally in different directions .
Messrs. McConnel and Kidd have shown , in their experiments with glacier ice , that " ordinary ice , consisting of an irregular aggregation of crystals , exhibits plasticity , both under pressure and under tension at temperatures far below the freezing point , down to \#151 ; 9 ' at least , and probably much lower .
" The experiments recorded on Diagram I now practically demonstrate the latter supposition , and I found the plasticity at the lower temperature to be very considerably reduced .
Mr. J. Y. Buchanan , F.R.S. , in his paper on " Ice and Brine " ( ' Edinburgh Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 14 , 1888 , p. 129 ) , has expressed notions of the plasticity and flow of glacier ice which tend to confirm the views of Messrs. McConnel and Kidd on this subject .
In this direction the experiments on pure ice , Diagram I , compared with those on pond ice , Diagram II , have shown that ice frozen from water containing saline constituents is more plastic than the ice frozen from pure distilled water .
I hope that the experiments of this memoir may help to afford information in connexion with the interesting subject of the plasticity of ice .
Appendix .
Attention has very recently been drawn to the manner in which lake ice has a tendency to crystallise , in a series of interesting letters published in 'Nature , ' 1889 , by Mr. Thomas H. Holland , Mr. T. W. Backhouse , Mr. T. D. Latouche , Messrs McConnel and Kidd , and others .
I have myself also frequently noticed the six-rayed starlike figures and skeleton triangular forms on natural pond ice , and other similar indications of the tendency of lake ice to the hexagonal form of crystallisation .
