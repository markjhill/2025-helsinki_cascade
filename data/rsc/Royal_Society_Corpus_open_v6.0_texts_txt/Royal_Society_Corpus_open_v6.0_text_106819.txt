AIbstract of a Register of the Barometer , Thermometer , and !
Rainn at Lyndon , in Rutland By lL5homas Barker , Esq. , with the Rain in Surrey and Hampshire , tor the Cear 1792 ; and a Comparison of wet Seasons .
Cornanunicated !

THE winter was a severe one ; there was a sharp frost every month from December to Marchn chiefly between the full and the new moons , and the intervals were often stormy and wet ; but t-hose in February , both at the middle and latter end of the month , were milder , and less w-et .
the beginning of March continued mild , with frequent though $mall rains theri followed as sharp a frest , for a week , as any in the winter .
After that s-tormy weather into April , but warm and growirlg9 till a violent thunder storm toward Stamforcl the th , and two days continued rain here , and i &lt; most other places about the 18thn renewed the wet season , which lasted all summer , and was perhaps wetter in many places than here , for we 11a(1 no iheavy thunder storms all the sunlmer , as they had in some parts .
Whenever there was thander this year , it was almost always cold after itn and often cold weather without it very little sunshine and marly sharp frosty uornings both in May and June , which cut off the apples after they appeared to be set .
The greatest rains this sulnmer were after the middle of April ; before the middle of Mayv about the 8th of June : the 2ts-t of July v the r8th of August ; and 14uth of September : those in April , June , and July , made floods , the two latter of which did great damage to the mea dow hay v and there vere frequent sometimes almost dailyS lesser rains .
The intervals of fair and fine weather were shortn an not many , and those not always warm n the beginning of May , and about the 2lSt ; the beginning and end of Julne ; the beginnin-g of July ; and , what was the firiest time this summers the first half of August .
During this in general so very wet a season , the hay and harvest were got in , and , where they were not floodedn I think with less damage than might have been expec &lt; ed. The latter llay was got up during the fine time in August , some of the harvest in a tolerable time the beginlling of September v and what was delayed by the al most dity lsains for twothirds of September , was finished in a fine time the beginning of October , the crop of wheat was tolelrable wellS but barleyf oats , and peas , were dear .
this year was the wettest since 178g , which , with 1*774g and some othersn exceeded it , and this , like those two yearsj , began to grow less wet the beginning of October .
Yet the frequent rains aft ; er that , though less in quantity , kept the grourld from drying , which was already too wet , and the roads continued uncommoxlly torn up all winter , and Decemberf keing wetter , increased it .
The last six weeks of the year were in general dark and cloudy , or misty , very little sun and not much frost , and so far seems to promise an open winter7 but December was a stormy time ; several great ones , and some great rains and flOodse I1lches .

92 The year ry92 was a very wet one , and by many imagined to exceed all others , but that does not appear to be fact , the wYet of last year is fresh in memory , that of former years is more forgotten .
It might seel:n the wetterf because the autumn of 1791 was wet , so that there was a long continuance of it , and perhaps there might be more rain in some other places than here , as we had no great thun-der storms all the summer at this place , which they had in several parts , some not many miles off.\ T &gt; he wettest year\#171 ; No. VIII .
Abstract .
here were about *774 and 178e , which I have therefore compared with last year , in-No .
Ie where I have set down the whole rain , and cast up the sum from January the firstn to the end of every 3rnonth , in each year : and it appears , that to the end of January , to the end of February , and of March , the wettest was 1774 , the nex-t 1y8e and 1y92 was less wet than either of them .
the very wet April and WIay in 1782 altered the order of them ; antl to the end of Apriln of M[ay ?
of June of July , and of August7 the wettest wTas 1782 1 the laext 17y4 ; and the last 1792 .
Septem1ser , y7q that wettest of all mollths in fifty-seven years , altered the order again to &lt; 774 , 1782 1792 ; and it continued so to the end of the Jrear .
In No. .
IIv I have given some of the greatest twelve months , whether beginnirg with January or not 7 and the greatest 3645 days is from ( )ctober z77g to October 2 , 1774 , which is 39,724 inches ; and all that I have here given exceed 1792 .
In No. III .
is the greatest three years , from May 9 , 1773 to May 8 , 1776 , which is lOln4g5$ inchesX and the greatest seventeen monthsa from May gn 1773 to October 8 , 1774,3 is S6,277 inches .
In No. IV .
are the greatest nine months7 January 6 to Octobsr 6 , 1774 , go727 inches X and several others , to 1792S 2+ , z62 inches .
In No. V. are several of the greatest six molathsX from *774 , 24 , go4 inches , to 1792 ) 20,257 inches .
In No. VI are several of the greatest three months , fror3 : 14S,477 inches in r774 , to xo,9g8 inches in 1792 .
The greatest month last year was , from August z6 to September , g , 5S1o8 inches , but I have had thirteen greater ; the most of all was in y74 , , 8v270 inches ; the rest are set down in order in No. VII* ; and the last is that in 1t,92 .
Lastly in No. VIII .
I have set down together the wettest times in all the several cases .
At Selbourn , betw : even Alton and PetersfieldS in Hampshire , which lies at the NO foot of a steep hill , that rises atl hundred yards perpendicular above it , they have half as much more rain as I have ; there was +82 inches last year9 as it is set down in the first page ; but they had o4 inches in 1782 , which is-something more .
But I was surprised to see , in the Supplem-ent to the Gentleman 's Magazine , page tlgy , that Mr. GOUGH says there was 8S2 inches of rain at Kendal last year .
This is an astonishing quan-tity ; though i-t is a-hilly country , it is alinost four times my common trea-r , and above double the greatestv and I should have thought it enough , in latitude 54O , to have made the whole country a marsh
