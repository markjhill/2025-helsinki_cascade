Up to the present time organo-metallic bodies containing ethylene in union with the metal have been often sought , but never recognized .
I have to announce the existence of organo-metallic compounds of ethylene with the alkali-metals .
In ethylate of sodium , or at any rate in the substance which is produced by heating up to 200 ?
C. the well-known -crystals got by acting on alcohol with sodiumn , I see the hydrated oxide of ethylene-sodiumNa"'{ ( C{ H ' ) " which , as I have recently shown , yields alcohol and a new compound on being heated with the ethers of the fatty acids : thus Ilydrate of ethylenesodium .
Acetate of ethyl .
Acetate of ethylene-sodium .

} Q " ' C CI H0 286 Acetate of ethylene-sodium yields alcohol and common acetate of soda on treatment with water:2( Na " ' 21 o ) +2 HO =2C 0+2 NaO C , H O. The extreme lightness of the so-called ethylate of sodium ( it swims in ether ) is a reason for regarding it as a compound belonging to a less condensed order of sodium-compound than ordinary sodium-compounds .
The property of yielding up its olefine in the shape of alcohol when it is treated with water is a reason for assigning to the new compound given by the action of acetic ether the above formula , and shows that the olefine is associated with the alkali-metal , not with the acid .
