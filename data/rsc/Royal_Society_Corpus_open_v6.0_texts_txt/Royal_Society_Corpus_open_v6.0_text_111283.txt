I. The following Letter was read , from Professor HANSTEEN of Christiania , For .
Mem. R.S.:To the Royal Society of London .
As a Corresponding Member of the Royal Society , I have the honour herewith to transmit a Research " On the Secular Changes of the Magnetical System of the Earth , and more specially on the Secular Variation of the Magnetical Inclination in the Northern Temperate Zone , " separately printed from the ' Memoirs of the Roy .
Soc. of Sciences of Copenhagen .
' By calculating newer and more ancient observations of the magnetical declination , I have ascertained the movement of the four magnetical polar regions , which I had already found in my work ' Untersuchungen uber den Magnetismus der Erde ' ( Christiania , 1819 , with Atlas ) ; whereof the two northern ones have a motion from west to east , the two southern ones in the contrary direction ; and have attempted thereby in general to declare the cause of the known variations , as well of the system of declination as of that of inclination and of intensity .
As I am indebted for the greatest part of the materials to English observations , I have found it my duty to render my thanks to English science , and to express my hopes of future exertions towards the solution of this , in my thought , most interesting problem of the general physics of the globe .
Most respectfully , CHRISTOPHER H ANSTEEN .
Observatory in Christiania , December 31 , 1855 .
