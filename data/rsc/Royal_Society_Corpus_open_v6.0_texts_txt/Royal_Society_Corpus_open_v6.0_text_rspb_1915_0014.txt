Tricuspid Valve , x 29 .
The auricular muscle passes into the base of the valve , of which it forms about one-half the thickness .
It passes for some distance along beneath the auricular endocardium , and is finally inserted into the connective tissue of the valve .

Mitral Valve , x 7*5 .
In this specimen the auricular inuscle runs a short distance only into the base of the valve .
Its contraction would , however , be quite efficient in raising the flap , owing to the relative positions of the muscle and the point of attachment of the base of the valve .
In all the figures M indicates muscle , CT indicates connective tissue .
The Effect of Functional Activity upon the , Blood-flow , and Exudation in Organs .

( Received February 18 , 1915 .
) i. Striated Muscle .
The animals used were dogs .
A.C.E. mixture used at first ; urethane throughout .
Two preparations have been used : ( a ) the gastrocnemius preparation as described by Verz\amp ; r \lt ; *\gt ; , ( b the anterior belly of the diagastric .
In each of four experiments the veins were dissected out which lead from the organ to some adjacent vein of considerable size\#151 ; the femoral or the jugular .
All the other confluents to this vein were tied off , and a pipette inserted through one of these into the great vein .
This was clamped proximally , and the blood from the muscle , and it only , was thus secured .
By measuring its rate of flow , and by comparing it with arterial blood in respect ( 1 ) of its oxygen content , and ( 2 ) its haemoglobin valued , data were obtained of ( a ) the oxygen used by the muscle ( 3\gt ; , the rate of flow , and ( c ) the exudation ** ) of fluid from the blood vessels .
In two experiments the herve was cut , in two it was not .
The following data were furnished by an experiment on the gastrocnemius , in which this nerve was cut two hours before its stimulation .
It was stimulated by a faradic current , of a duration of about 0*2 second , every second for 15 minutes .

In order to ascertain how much of the observed exudation was retained in the muscle , the muscle was weighed at the end of the experiment , i.e. , 8 h. 15 m. after the stimulus ceased .
The muscle on the opposite side was also weighed , its nerve having been cut 8 h. 30 m. previously .

The muscles were also weighed in Ringer 's solution , with the result that their specific gravities relatively to Ringer 's solution were\#151 ; ( A ) Sp. gr. of stimulated muscle ... . .
1*061 ( B ) " unstimulated muscle ... ... ... 1*070 This difference in the specific gravity makes it clear that the difference in weight of the stimulated muscle was not to be accounted for by a difference in the original size of the stimulated muscle , or a greater quantity of blood in it .
The observations on exudation , oxygen intake , and blood are typical of other experiments , except in so far as the effects do not always last so long , the minimal period of hypersemia being two hours .

In most experiments pilocarpine has been used as a stimulant .
