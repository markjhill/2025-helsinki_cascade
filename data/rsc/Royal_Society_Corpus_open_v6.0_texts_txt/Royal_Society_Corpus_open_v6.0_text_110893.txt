" On the Nerves of the Uterus .
" By Thomas S. Beck , Esq. Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie , Bart. , F.R.S. The object of the author in this communication is to record the results of his dissections of the nerves of the uterus , both in the unimpregnated and gravid states , with a view to determine if any changes are observable in them in these two conditions .
He enters minutely into the anatomical details of the formation of the great splanchnic nerve , the composition of the semilunar ganglion , and the distribution of the branches proceeding from it to the different abdominal viscera .
His conclusions are , that while the ovaria derive their nerves from the renal , the fallopian tubes from the hypogastric , and the bladder , rectum and vagina from the pelvic plexus , the nerves supplying the uterus are continuations of the hypogastric plexus , and that they undergo , during pregnancy , no further change , either in size or position , except that which is the simple consequence of the enlargement of the organ over which they are distributed , and that they undergo no other change during a second pregnancy .
He thinks it probable , moreover , that the vessels of the uterus do not decrease in size after parturition , but are only contracted in their cavity .
He notices several points relating to these subjects , which are still open to further investigation .
The paper is accompanied by highly finished drawings of the appearance of the dissected parts .
