A paper was read , entitled , " Historical Notice to the supposed Identity of the large mass of Meteoric Iron now in the British Mu ?
seum , with the celebrated Otumpa Iron described by Rubin de Celis , in the Philosophical Transactions for 17S6 .
, r Communicated in a letter from Woodbine Parish , jun .
, Esq. , F.R.S. , to Charles Konig , Esq. , Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society .
The mass of iron in question was transmitted to Buenos Airs , for the purpose of being manufactured into fire-arms , at the period when the people of that country declared themselves independent of Spain ; but a supply of arms having in the mean while arrived , it was depo ?
sited in the Arsenal , and afterwards given to Mr. Parish , who transmitted it to England .
Its identity with the mass of iron described by De Celis , though probable , is not exactly determined .
