] Having shown in a former paper that by an equalization of the light of stars of different brightness , their relative distances from the observer in the direction of the line in which they are seen may be ascertained , and having deduced from this equalization a method of turning the space penetrating power of a telescope into a gradually increasing series of gauging powers , by which the profundity in space of every object consisting of stars can be ascertained , as far as the light of the instrument will reach , Sir William Herschel proceeds to make use of some of his numerous observations made upon those oc .
casions , to show how the distances of globular and other clusters of stars may be obtained , and has represented their situations in space by a figure , in which their distances are made proportional to the diameter of a globular space , sufficiently large to contain all the stars that are visible to the eye of an observer in the clearest nights .
The author then details a series of observations of clusters of stars , from which the order of their profundity in space is determined , and describes the manner in which he represents the profundity of celestial objects in space by diagrams ; and in the concluding section of his paper , considers the extent of the power of telescopes to reach into space when they are directed to ambiguous celestial objects .
