Although blood invariably contains a small amount of dissolved nitrogen , it appears that with animals no absorption of that gas takes place save what is due to its solubility in the sei'um of the blood .
Nor is nitrogen eliminated from the system in the elementary state .
4 At Professor Ramsay 's suggestion , experiments have been made on the comparative amount of argon in ordinary air , and in air which had been frequently breathed , with the view of ascertaining whether , if the proportion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air be very much altered , argon .would either enter into , or be expelled from , the respiratory system .
The result of the experiments to be described is to show that the proportion of argon to nitrogen remains nearly normal , even when the air has been greatly altered in composition by respiration .
1 .
Percentage of Argon in Atmospheric Air.\#151 ; A mercury reservoir , the capacity of which was accurately determined by weighing with water , held 555'2 c.c. The upper end was fitted with a three-way tap , sealed on to the glass .
Through this tap was admitted air , purified by passage over soda-lime and phosphoric anhydride , to remove water-vapour and carbonic anhydride .
This reservoir was jacketed with water of known temperature , so that the volume of the air could be measured with great exactness .
The other branch of the three-way tap led to a tube filled with copper , in order to absorb oxygen ; one containing copper oxide to destroy any organic matter which might have been present , and one filled with magnesium turnings to absorb nitrogen ; these tubes were kept red-hot .
Other tubes were filled with soda-lime and phosphoric anhydride , so as to remove water and carbon dioxide , which might have been produced .
The air was circulated over these absorbents until little but argon was left .
The gas-holder was filled three times at 18'8 ' C. , and 752T mm. pressure .
After absorption had nearly ceased , the remaining gas was pumped out of the tubes , mixed with oxygen , and sparked for many hours in presence of caustic soda , to remove the last traces of nitrogen .
The residue , after absorption of oxygen with potassium pyrogallate , measured 1591 c.c. at 21'4 ' C. , and 754'5 mm. pressure .
Reducing both volumes to standard temperature and pressure , it appears that 1895 .
] Argon in atmospheric and respired Air .
1542*0 c.c. of air yielded 14'45 c.c. of argon , or 100*0 c.c. of air contain 0*937 c.c. of argon .
Calculating the percentage in atmospheric nitrogen , we have:\#151 ; 100 c.c. of mixed atmospheric nitrogen and argon contain 1*186 c.c. Owing to the avoidance of the presence of water during these experiments , they are probably more accurate than the original experiments of Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay .
They found* 1*04 and 1'03 in two experiments in which the nitrogen was removed by sparking with oxygen in presence of dilute caustic soda ; and 1*11 when the nitrogen was removed by means of magnesium .
Owing to the vacation , it has not been possible to put this result on record before now .
And M. Th. Schloesing , , has recently published !
* the results of a series of estimations in which the percentage of argon in atmospheric nitrogen was found to be 1-180 to 1-185 , or as a mean 1*183 per cent. , a number almost identical with that just recorded .
M. Schloesing has re-calculated the ratio which ought to subsist between the densities of atmospheric and " chemical " nitrogen on the basis of his determinations ; but in doing so , he has made use of the value 1-2505 gram as the weight of 1 litre of the latter , instead of 1*2511 .
J Moreover , he has assumed Regnault 's value , now superseded , for the weight of 1 litre of hydrogen , viz. , 0*0896 gram , instead of that given by the more recent determinations , 0"0899.S These are not serious errors , but it is more satisfactory to calculate the correct number .
The question is :\#151 ; If the weight of a litre of pure nitrogen is 1"2511 gram , and of argon 1-7818 gram , and if atmospheric nitrogen contain 1"185 per cent , of argon , what should be the weight of a litre of the latter ?
The answer is 1*2574 .
Lord Rayleigh found the number 1*2572 , one almost exactly identical .
For material for the second part of this research , I have to express my thanks to Dr. Marcet , F.R.S. , and his assistant , Mr. Floris .

68 Examination of Gases from Mineral Waters .
[ Nov. 28 , The air was breathed over and over again by Mr. Moris , until after 10 minutes ' respiration its composition had become :\#151 ; Nitrogen and argon ... ... ... . .
8096 per cent. Oxygen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
5"40 , , Carbon dioxide ... ... ... ... ... 13"64 " 100-00 " An estimation of the argon was carried out in precisely the same manner as before , on 1297'8 c.c. of breathed air , measured at 17-2 ' C. and 759 mm. pressure .
But the air was breathed over water , the requisite change of volume on respiration having been secured by breathing into one of Dr. Marcet 's counterpoised gas-holders .
The argon found measured at 17-7 ' C. and 752'3 mm. pressure , 12-85 c.c. These numbers corrected give :\#151 ; 1196 c.c. of breathed air yielded 1T72 c.c. of argon .
100 c.c. " " 0-980 c.c. of argon .
Calculating the percentage on the nitrogen , we have :\#151 ; 100 c.c. of nitrogen and argon of breathed air contains 1'210 c.c. This percentage is larger than that in normal air .
One of two suppositions may be made : either the increased amount is due to the air having been confined over water during breathing , or argon is given off from blood in greater amount than it is absorbed , when the composition of the air in the lungs is so much altered ; the former appears the more probable supposition .
In any case the difference is not great ; and it would appear that argon , like free nitrogen , plays no important part in the animal economy , save as a diluent .

" Examination of Gases from certain Mineral Waters .
" By ' ALEXANDER KELLAS , B.Sc. , and WILLIAM RAMSAY , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received November 14 , 1895 .
A sample of gas of an inflammable nature , sent to Mr. Crookes by Mr. C. Lothian Bell , of Middlesbrough , from " Ailhusen 's Well , " was sent on to us to be tested for argon .
The usual constituents , nitrogen , hydrocarbons , \amp ; c. , were removed by the usual absorbents , magnesium , copper oxide , \amp ; c. , and finally by sparking with oxygen over caustic soda .
The only noticeable feature was the great difficulty in removing the hydrocarbon , which for long resisted the action of red-hot copper oxide .
The circulation had to be continued for two days before absorption lyas nearly complete .
In one case ( Kellas ) 555 c.c. of gas gave 2 c.c. of residue , and in another ( Ramsay )
