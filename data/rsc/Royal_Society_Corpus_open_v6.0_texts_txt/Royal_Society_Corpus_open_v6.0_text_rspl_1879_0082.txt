nected , by means of the wires beneath the base , with the two other and ordinary vertical springs of the instrument , so that by turning the handle they may be disconnected from the studs and connected with those springs , and through them , the axis and standards , with the voltaic cell , and receive a current in either direction , according to the position of the handle .
The sketch represents the handle and axis m the above-mentioned first position , with the two wires of the electroscope metallically connected together , but insulated from the cell .
The usual form of the electroscope I have employed is represented in fig. 2 .
A is a wooden base , B a wooden upright board fixed to it .
C is the situation of the reverser .
D a microscope , capable of vertical and horizontal movement , having a magnifying power of about 30 to 50 diameters , and provided with a " spider-line .
" E is a grooved piece of wood fixed to the upright stand .
F a wooden slide , with a moveable scale , G , worked by a metal rack H , and pinion with handle , I. J is the capillary , supported by a perforated little brass shelf , K. L is the pressure-chamber .
M the-glass tube containing the compensating column of mercury .
IT a thin glass tube , about 5 millims. bore , containing the mercury and conducting solution .
O and P are the terminal platinum wires for attachment to the screws of the reverser .
Q is a strong clip , shown separate from the instrument .
R is a metal support for the clip .
S is a moveable slide of cork , carrying a very fine hair , T , for indicating the position of the meniscus .
It is not usually necessary to measure the amount of movement of the meniscus .
Some cotton wool is placed in the cup , U , and the cup is covered with a lid to exclude dust .
A strip of white paper is affixed behind the capillary portion of the tube to form a white background , and the instrument requires to be used in a good light .
Having found by additional experiments that in certain cases the mercury moves in an opposite direction to the electric current , I am now engaged in examining that fact , and in completing an investigation of the causes and conditions of the movements .

" Chemico-Electric Relations of Metals in Solutions of Salts of Potassium .
" By G. Gore , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received December 8 , 1879 .
The following experiments were made with the object of determining the chemico-electric positions of various metals , \amp ; c. , in solutions of salts of potassium of various strengths , and at different temperatures ; and also with the intention of ascertaining , by the aid of Lippmann's- 1879 .
] Metals in Solutions of Salts of .
capillary electrometer , the quantitative differences of electromotive force between each two consecutive metals , and thus to construct a series of tables of electromotive forces of the particular solids and liquids employed .
But as after making many attempts I was unable to construct such a form of that electrometer as might be relied upon as an accurate measuring instrument , I abandoned the object of measuring the electromotive differences , and proceeded no farther than simply determining the order of such differences in each particular solution .
Although I have not been able to carry out the examination as far as I intended , I venture to submit the results to the Royal Society , in the hope that if published they may be of use to other investigators , as similar tables upon a less extensive scale have already proved .
As the true electrical relations of metals in liquids depends largely upon the purity of the substances , I beg to state that the metals and salts employed were , in nearly all cases , the purest obtainable .
The tellurium , mercury , and antimony were very highly purified by me ; the silicon was prepared by fusing some fine crystals , which I had previously digested with pure hydrofluoric acid , hydrochloric acid , and nitric acid separately .
The gold , silver , platinum , palladium , iridium , rhodium , cobalt , tin , and cadmium , were obtained from Messrs. Matthey and Co. , and were the purest they prepare .
The nickel was refined by Sir J. Mason , and was of a high degree of purity ; it had been rolled into a thin strip .
The carbon was a rod of a JabloclikofPs candle .
The indium was a portion of one of the ingots exhibited at the Paris Exhibition by its discoverers .
The gallium was presented to me by M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran , and said to be 11 nearly pure except traces of zinc .
" The thallium was supplied to me by Messrs. Hopkin and Williams .
The magnesium was probably very pure , and was obtained from the Magnesium Metal Company , from whom I also obtained the bismuth , said to be " highly purified .
" The aluminium , copper , lead , iron , and zinc wires were of the ordinary qualities .
The salts employed were of considerable purity , and in every case were dissolved in distilled water .
To remove any trace of free iodine or acid from the solutions of potassic iodide , or any trace of soluble sulphid.e contained in those of cyanide of potassium , they were previously well stirred with a rod of aluminium or magnesium .
Every investigator who has made experiments of the present kind is aware that temporary reversals of the current frequently occur in such cases .
When the reversals took place immediately upon immersion , the first current was not regarded , because it was probably due to a momentary change of surface tension or of temperature , caused by the physical contact of the solid and liquid prior to chemical action .
A sufficient number of different strengths of solution of each salt were employed to supply a large number of determinations , so as to 40 Dr. G. Gore .
Chemico-ElectrRelations of [ Dec. 18 , enable curves to be drawn showing the variation of relative electric positions of different metals with the variations of strength of the liquid .
Such curves were drawn , compared with each other , and conclusions inferred respecting similar metals or groups of metals .
In the following tables the numbers at the top of each column represent the numbers of grains of the particular salt dissolved in the quantity of water stated .
The amount of water employed in the solutions of the first six tables was 50 cub. eentims .
, and in Tables VII and VIII it was 800 grains .
The specimen of gallium not having been obtained in sufficient time for the whole of the experiments , it was not employed in Tables I and YII and part of Table III .
Being also easily fusible it could not be used in hot solutions .

The following was the order obtained by immersing the various elementary substances in cyanide of potassium in a fused state ; the first substance being the most positive : magnesium , zinc , aluminium and platinum , nickel , iron , silver , iridium , gold , rhodium , carbon , palladium , cobalt , antimony .
From the notes appended to the foregoing tables , it may be observed\#151 ; 1st , that by far the greatest number of momentary reversals of current took place in the cyanide solutions , especially in the cold ones ; 2nd , that the proportions of such reversals to the number of solutions employed were not greatly different in the chloride , bromide , and iodide of potassium ; and 3rd , the reversals were not confined to the more electro-positive metals .
The most numerous reversals in the cold solutions of potassic cyanide took place with nickel ( 26 ) , aluminium ( 21 ) , silver ( 18 ) , platinum ( 16 ) , magnesium ( 15 ) , and zinc ( 14 ) ; and in the hot solutions , with aluminium ( 16 ) , magnesium ( 14 ) , and zinc ( ll ) ; whilst in the cold iodide solutions the most frequent ones were nickel ( 7 ) , iron ( 6 ) , silicon ( 4 ) , and cobalt ( 4 ) ; and in the hot liquids , nickel ( 10 ) , silicon ( 8 ) , iron ( 7 ) , and cobalt ( 8 ) ; most of these occurred in the strong solutions .
With the cold bromide mixtures reversals occurred with aluminium ( 6 ) , iron ( 5 ) , gold ( 5 ) , and palladium ( 4 ) ; with the same liquids hot , indium ( 6 ) , aluminium ( 5 ) , and iron ( 4 ) .
And with the chloride solutions cold , iron ( 3 ) ; and hot , aluminium ( 3 ) , and cadmium ( 3 ) .
The behaviour of particular pairs of metals in different liquids with regard to reversals may be ascertained by inspection of the notes .
Certain other general effects were also observed in the results .
1st .
Gas carbon was electro-negative to all other bodies in all the solutions employed , whether cold or hot ; concentrated or dilute .
2nd .
Rhodium was electro-negative to all substances except carbon , in all solutions of either iodide or cyanide of potassium , of all degrees of concentration , and at each temperature .
3rd .
Either rhodium or platinum was negative to all bodies except carbon in all the solutions of chloride or bromide of potassium , whether cold or hot .
4th .
Magnesium was positive to all the other substances in all the solutions of potassic chloride , bromide , or iodide , at each temperature .
5th .
Either magnesium , aluminium , or zinc , was positive to all other metals in solutions of potassic cyanide , whether cold or hot .
Thallium appeared to be the most quickly corroded of any metal in all the solutions , and was most manifestly affected in those of potassic iodide ; lead was also acted upon , but to a less extent , in that class of liquids .

] Spontaneous Segmentation of a Liquid Annulus .
49 By drawing lines through all the positions of each particular metal in the tables of solutions of different strengths of either of the salts employed , it was found that the position of pairs of metals of like properties , such as magnesium and zinc , nickel and cobalt , rhodium and iridium or platinum , lead and tin , \amp ; e. , often varied together , and described similar curves or lines of variation .
A much greater number of variations of relative electric position of the metals occurred in the cold and hot solutions of potassic cyanide than in either those of the chloride , bromide , or iodide , whether cold or hot , and the -amounts of such variations were also much greater in the cyanide solutions .
Agitation of the immersed metals is well known to influence the current .
Shaking one of the metals reversed occasionally the direction of the current ; palladium was the metal which most frequently manifested this effect .
The agitation of that metal rendered it either more negative or less positive in a considerable degree , especially in solutions of potassic chloride and cyanide .
In those of the bromide , antimony was the metal the current from which was most affected by shaking .
The effect of shaking was less in the iodide solutions than in those of the bromide .

" On the Spontaneous Segmentation of a Liquid Annulus .

Received December 6 , 1879 .
In seeking an explanation of the appearance of a definite number of lobes in the liquid annulus which is formed at a certain stage of the splash of a drop that has fallen vertically on to a horizontal plate , I was led to make some experiments on the spontaneous segmentation of such an annulus lying on a plate with a view to ascertaining whether the relation that exists between the dimensions of the annulus and the number of drops into which it will spontaneously split , is the same as for a straight cylinder of liquid under similar conditions .
Finding that the relation was the same , it then occurred to me that by liberating an annulus in air without contact with any solid , a direct experimental proof might fee obtained of the law of segmentation of a free cylinder .
It has been shown mathematically in various ways , and experimentally by M. Plateau , that the equilibrium of a free cylinder of any liquid , under the influence of surface tension only , becomes unstable as soon as the length exceeds w times the diameter ; and it has been regarded as a necessary consequence of this that such a cylinder , if
