" Note respecting a new kind of Sensitive Paper .
" By Henry Fox Talbot , Esq. , F.R.S. The method of preparing the paper here referred to consists in washing it over with nitrate of silver , then with bromide of potas ?
sium , and afterwards again with nitrate of silver ; drying it at the fire after each operation .
This paper is very sensitive to the light of the clouds , and even to the feeblest daylight .
The author supplies an omission in his former memoir on photo ?
genic drawing , by mentioning a method he had invented and practised nearly five years ago , of imitating etchings on copper plate , by smearing over a sheet of glass with a solution of resin in turpentine , and blackening it by the smoke of a candle .
On this blackened surface a design is made with the point of a needle , the lines of which will of course be transparent , and will be represented by dark lines on the prepared paper to which it is applied , when exposed to sun ?
shine .
The same principle may be applied to make numerous copies of any writing .
