( Abstract ) The researches described in this paper form a continuation of those published on the Diffusion of Ions into Gases.* The latter paper gives the results of experiments made with ions produced in air , hydrogen , and carbonic acid by the action of Eontgen rays .
The gases in these experiments were at atmospheric pressure .
The present paper contains similar investigations for ions produced in air at various pressures by the action of a radio-active substance , and also determinations of the rate of diffusion of ions produced in air at atmospheric pressure by the action of ultra-violet light and point discharges .
The principle of the method consists in calculating the coefficient of diffusion from observations on the loss of conductivity of a gas as it passes along metal tubing .
The experiments were arranged so that in all cases the * loss of conductivity due to diffusion should be much greater than the loss due to other causes , so that it was not necessary to apply any corrections for losses arising from recombination or from the mutual repulsion of the ions .
The results of the experiments are given in the following tables .
Tables I , II , III , and IV give the coefficients of diffusion , K , of positive and negative ions in dry and moist air at various pressures , P , the ionization being produced by the action of a radio-active substance .
The temperature of the air during each experiment is given in the column 0 .
These tables show that in each case the rate of diffusion of ions into a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas .
The coefficients of diffusion at 772 mm. show a discrepancy from this law , which is somewhat greater than the probable error of the experiments , but we should not expect a closer agreement between the products P x K unless the temperature of the air was the same in * ' Phil.

each case .
It will be noticed that the experiments at 772 mm. were made when the temperature of the air was higher than the tempera^ tures during the other experiments .
The negative ions which are produced when ultra-violet light falls on a zinc plate diffuse into air at nearly the same rate as the negative ions produced by a radio-active substance .
The values of the coefficients of diffusion for dry and moist air are 0-0435 and 0*0375 respectively , the pressure being 760 mm. and temperature 17 C. in each case .
The rates of diffusion of ions produced by a point discharge were found to vary considerably .
The discharges were usually produced from a steel needle or platinum wire pointing along the axis of a metal tube .
It was found that when the point was at the open end of the tube the ions which were produced diffused more rapidly than those given off when the needle , or wire , was drawn back into the tube , so that the point should be a few centimetres from the open end .
The differences obtained in this way were greater when the air was dry 124 Dr. H. T. Brown and Mr. F. Escombe .

( Abstract .
) This paper is intended to be the first of a series descriptive of the work carried out by the authors in the Jodrell laboratory on the fixation of carbon by green plants , and deals mainly with the purely physical processes by which atmospheric carbon dioxide gains access to the active centres of assimilation .
The new evidence which F. F. Blackman brought forward in 1895 in favour of the gaseous exchanges of leaves taking place exclusively through the stomatic openings , presents at first sight certain difficulties of a physical nature , which have led to an examination of the whole question of the free diffusion of carbon dioxide at very low tension , and under a set of conditions very different from those under which the previous determinations of the coefficient of diffusion of carbon dioxide and air have been made by Loschmidt and others , where the gases were initially of equal tension , and the ratios of mixture departed widely from those of ordinary atmospheric air .
The inquiry has led to the discovery of some new facts connected with the static diffusion of gases and liquids , which are of considerable interest , not only from the physical point of view , but from the explanations they suggest of certain natural processes which are primarily dependent on diffusivity .
The method employed in the first instance for the determination of the diffusivity of atmospheric carbon dioxide was one of static diffusion down a column of air of a definite length , towards an absorptive surface at the bottom of the column .
When a static condition has been established , there is a steady flux of the carbon dioxide down the * The title of the paper as communicated to the Society was " Some New Observations on the Static Diffusion of Gases and Liquids , and their Significance in certain Natural Processes occurring in Plants .
