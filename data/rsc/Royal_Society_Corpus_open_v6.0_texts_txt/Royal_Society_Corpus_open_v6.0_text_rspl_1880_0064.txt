" Further Experiments on the Action of an Intermittent Beam of Radiant Heat on Gaseous Matter .
Thermometric Measurements .
" By J. Tyndall , F.R.S. Received February 21 , 3881 .
In the concluding paragraph of the note communicated on the 10th of January to the Royal Society these words occur:\#151 ; " The vapours of all compound liquids will , I doubt not , be found sonorous in the intermittent beam .
" Since that time I have examined eighty different liquids , both at the ordinary temperature of the air and at their boiling temperatures , and have verified so far the prediction just quoted .
In all cases I have obtained musical sounds\#151 ; some feeble , some moderate , and some exceedingly strong .
I have , moreover , determined by thermometric expansion the absorptions exerted by the vapours of more than twenty of these liquids , and it is my intention to subject the whole ' of them to this test .
The harmony and mutual support exhibited by two series of experiments , conducted in accordance with these two diverse methods , are on the whole admirable .
The investigation , however , is laborious , and many weeks must elapse before I am able to submit it in extenso to the Royal Society .
Tested by the thermometric method , my old experiments on aqueous vapour again affirm their validity .
A long and narrow glass tube , bent into the form of a [ J , was partially filled with coloured water .
One leg of the ( J was connected with the recipient which contained the gaseous substances submitted to experiment , while the other end was left open to the air .
Before permitting the beam to pass , the liquid stood at the same level in both legs of the tube .
Cleansing the recipient thoroughly , and filling it with well-dried air , a powerful beam was sent through it .
There was no sensible expansion and consequently no perceptible motion of the thermometric column .
Air similarly dried was then passed over bibulous paper , moistened by water of a temperature of 14 ' C. The modicum of vapour carried forward at this temperature by the dried air , when smitten by the beam , produced instantly a depression of 55 millims. in the leg of the tube connected with the recipient , and an equal elevation in the other leg .
The difference of level in the two legs amounted , therefore , to 110 millims. Ro trace of haze or sign of condensation could be detected within the recipient .
Its boundaries were as bright , and its contents as free from turbidity , as when the dry air alone was employed .
With a conical tube of a certain size , stopped at its base by a transparent plate of rocksalt , I have obtained a considerable intensification of the sounds .
Abandoning the ear-tube altogether , and filling the Presents .
