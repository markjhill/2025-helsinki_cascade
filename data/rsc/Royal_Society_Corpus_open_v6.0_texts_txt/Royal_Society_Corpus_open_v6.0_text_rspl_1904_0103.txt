Hydrolysis of Cane Sugar by very Dilute Acids .
In accordance with the theory put forward in our former paper* it was to be expected that on hydrolysing cane sugar with sufficiently dilute acids the course of the change would not follow the simple logarithmic law but that it would approximate , during the earlier period , to a linear function of the time .
This supposition has been confirmed by experiments made very carefully to test this point .
Experimental Method:\#151 ; In order that hydrolysis should be about half completed in 10 hours by N/ 500 chlorhydric acid , it was necessary to work at about 40 ' .
At this temperature , when so weak an acid is used , the solution does not show any trace of colour even after 4 days , which may be regarded as evidence that no decomposition of the levulose into acid substances has occurred .
In order to maintain the temperature at 40 ' , a stream of water was passed through the jacket of the polarimeter tube in which the hydrolysis was carried out .
The water was taken from the mains at nearly 18 ' and passed through a metal vessel , about 2 litres in capacity , in which it was heated by a Bunsen burner to 30 ' .
It was then passed through a metal vessel holding about 5 litres containing an Ostwald thermoregulator ; in this the temperature of the water was raised to about 39 ' .
The final adjustment was performed by a very sensitive Ostwald thermoregulator with fluted sides to make it respond quickly to changes in temperature ; this was placed in a cylindrical Dewar vacuum vessel , which it almost filled .
After passing through a thin copper drum holding about 150 c.c. , the water circulated through the regulator , cooling being prevented by the vacuum jacket ; the temperature of the water in the drum was maintained at 40 ' by means of a flame controlled by the regulator .
This arrangement proved to be eminently satisfactory in observing slow rates of change , although the extreme variation of the temperature was nearly \#177 ; y^th of a degree , the period of the variations was only 1 minute , so that in experiments extending over several hours the temperature variation was of no account .

[ Aug. 26 , The strength of the acid selected was N/ 500 hydrogen chloride ; the two sugar solutions used contained 171 and 342 grammes sucrose per litre .
The polarimeter tube had been in use for a considerable time with acid solutions .
The solutions of sugar and acid were accurately measured out from burettes into a small flask into which steam had been passed , according to Ostwald 's directions , to free it from alkali .
The mixture was then rapidly filtered into the polarimeter tube .
The first reading was taken 10 or 15 minutes after mixing , when the temperature had attained to that of the thermostat .
As under these conditions the rotatory power of the solution fell quickly , the polarimeter readings had to be taken very rapidly , so that the possible error in the tabulated values ( although amounting to only 0T per cent. ) is about 0*03 ' , making a possible error of 3 units in the third column of differences .
By taking a very large number of points , such minor errors are eliminated and when the velocity constant K is calculated according to the usual logarithmic law a very steady series of values is obtained .
From Tables I\#151 ; IY it will at once be obvious that the value of the velocity coefficient K steadily increases during about the first 4 or 5 hours of the change and then remains constant , the figures obtained being in striking contrast with those of Ostwald and also with those given later in this paper , Tables YI , YII , for experiments in which stronger solutions of acid were used : in all these experiments the successive values of K vary up and down on either side of a mean value .
The fact that the value of K rises is an indication that change proceeds faster than the mass-action law requires .
On the other hand , the figures do not offer definite evidence that the change proceeds at a strictly linear rate , although in all cases , especially that recorded in Table II , the approximation to a straight line law during the first 2| hours is very close : indeed , if the possible error in the difference be taken into account , the first 10 or 15 per cent , of the change is practically linear .
When the values are plotted on rectangular co-ordinates , the curve obtained falls between the straight line and the mass-action curve .
Furthermore , Tables III and IY indicate that the approximately 1 linear portion of the change persists the longer the larger the proportion of sugar to acid .
It is obvious from these results that the analogy between acid and ; enzyme action is complete .
In both cases , when the proportion of j hydrolyst is relatively small the change is at first approximately a linear function of the time and subsequently a logarithmic function ; I whilst when a larger proportion of hydrolyst is present , the change is | from the first a logarithmic function which may become modified by J secondary causes .
The association theory of hydrolysis put forward in j Studies on Enzyme Action 11904 .

^ these papers gives a very satisfactory explanation of the observed phenomena ; as before stated , the differences between acid and enzyme 'action can all be attributed to the crystalloid nature of the former and .the colloid nature of the latter .
Influence of the Products of Change.\#151 ; In view of the theoretical importance of the influence of the products of change , * it appeared desirable ; to extend our experiments in this direction to cane sugar .
Accordingly the effect of adding 9 grammes of glucose or fructose to 100 c.c. of 17*1 per cent , sucrose containing half a gramme molecule of hydrogen { chloride has been determined in the manner previously described by one of us for / 3-camphor sulphonic acid at 20 ' .

12 *38 Calculating from the equation K = Ki [ 1+0-0131 P ] given by Arrhenius as that expressing the influence : of- concentration p on the constant of hydrolysis , it follows that in the Case of a solution containing 17T + 8*55 grammes of cane sugar per 100 c.c. , K = 12-45 The results obtained may thus be summarised-r- .

Studies on Enzyme Action .
The acceleration brought about by the addition of sugars may be attributed to a withdrawal of water by the sugar and the consequent increase in the amount of the " active system , " as pointed out in our previous paper .

Communicated by Professor E. H. Starling , F.R.S. Received June 2 , 1904 .
Schonbein* was the first to observe that most animal and vegetable j juices have the property of decomposing hydrogen peroxide into water i and oxygen , as well as the power of developing a blue colour in tincture of guaiacum containing a little hydrogen peroxide .
Since these properties belonged to all the enzymes then known , .
, emulsin and diastase , Schonbein regarded them as characteristic of enzymes in general , and used them in his numerous investigations as tests for the presence of these bodies .
A good many years afterwards Jacobson , !
working with impure emulsin and pancreatin , showed that the power of these enzymes to catalyse hydrogen peroxide could be destroyed without affecting seriously the specific ferment action .
A year or two ago , Loewf suggested that the power of plant and animal juices to decompose hydrogen peroxide is due to an enzyme of very wide distribution , which he has named catalase .
According to this view , Jacobson 's impure emulsin contained some catalase , which is less resistant against heat than the emulsin , and can be rendered inactive without affecting seriously the other ferment .
Since Schonbein 's time , the properties which blood possesses of .
decomposing hydrogen peroxide and of giving the guaiacum reaction have formed the subject of numerous investigations by Schmidt , S Bergengrun , || Spitzer , \#171 ; l Schar , ** Cotton , ft Ville and Moitessier , ++ and i others , and this is not surprising when we consider the importance of the guaiacum test for the detection of small amounts of blood .
