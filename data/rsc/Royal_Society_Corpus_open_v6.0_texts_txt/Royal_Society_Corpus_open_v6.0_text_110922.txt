" On Motion in the Lumbar Division of the Spine in Birds .
" By George Oakley Fleming , M.D. , F.L.S. Communicated by Thomas Bell , Esq. , F.R.S. The author gives quotations from the works of Cuvier , Blumenbach , Tiedemann , Macartney , Vicq d'Azyr , Carus , Earl , and Roget , in proof of its being the prevalent opinion among comparative physiologists that the dorsal and lumbar portions of the spine form altogether a rigid structure , not admitting of the least perceptible flexion .
But from his observations of the form of the articulating surfaces of the lumbar vertebrae , which appear to be adapted to lateral motion , the author was led to conclude that , although flexion in the mesial plane is effectually prevented , some degree of lateral flexion actually takes place .
The number of articulations in this part of the spine , hl observes , varies in different birds : thus in the sea-gull , there are several articulations in the dorsal and lumbar portions ; while , in the peacock , there is only one moveable vertebra ; the remaining dorsal being united together , and all the lumbar vertebrae being consolidated and anchylosed with the sacrum ; thus fbrming two firm and immovable pieces between which the moveable vertebra is placed .
The flexion of the spine forwards is prevented by the great breadth of the spinous processes and their projections at right angles to the bodies of the vertebrae ; and frequently also by the addition of a number of thin , flat long bones which are applied by their flat surfaces on each side of the spinous processes ; and also by strong flat ligaments , situated between each spinous process , like the ligamentum nuchae of herbivorous quadrupeds .
For the purpose of guarding against pressure on the spinal cord during the lateral flexion of this part of the spine , the spinal canal is enlarged laterally at the centres of motion .
The paper is illustrated by drawings of the parts described .
