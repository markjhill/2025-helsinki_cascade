Extract of a letter from Mr. Richardson , dated off Jerbah , 25th January 1850 .
" I will trouble your Lordship by the mention of the astronomic phenomenon which terrified or arrested the attention of the inhabitants of the whole of this coast some two months ago .
This was the fall of a shower of aerolites , with a brilliant stream of light accompanying them , and which extended from Tulnis to Tripoli , some of the stones falling in the latter city .
" The alarm was very great in Tunis , and several Jews and Moors instinctively fled to the British Consulate , as the common refuge from every kind of evil and danger .
" The fall of these aerolites was followed by the severest or coldest winter which the inhabitants of Tunis and Tripoli have experienced for many years .
" The reading of a paper , entitled " ' Discussion of Meteorological Observations taken in India at various heights .
" By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes , F.R.S. &amp;c. , was commenced , but was not concluded .
