( From the Physiological Laboratory , University College , London .
) In a paper communicated by one of us , in April last , to the Boyal Society , * a calorimeter was described for determining the heat emitted by man , which , on being tested , was found to give very reliable results .
At the same time a short history was added of the various instruments , used by physiologists to estimate the heat given out by man and animals ; from that list was accidentally omitted the calorimeter of D'Arsonval.f This calorimeter consists of two cylindrical concentric vessels , with an air space between them , and standing in an annular groove full of water , thus making an air-tight joint .
The outer chamber ( annular space ) has a manometer connected with it which registers in a graphic way the variations of pressure in that chamber throughout the experiment .
The subject of the experiment is enclosed in the inner chamber into which fresh air is continually being drawn by means of a flue where a gas burner is kept alight .
The whole apparatus is suspended from the ceiling by a pulley , and balanced with a weight .
It might be recollected that Marcet 's calorimeter which we made use of , consists of a wooden chamber covered with felt inside and out , enclosing another made of sheet copper , carefully polished inside , with an air space between them .
The size of the inner chamber is sufficient to admit of a person sitting down comfortably on a chair , with free elbow and head room .
Two ventilators ( agitators ) , worked by electric motors , constantly mix up the air inside the calorimeter , while the air from one of these ventilators impinges on a trough full of ice ; the water from the melted ice is collected in a flask , and its temperature read at the end of the experiment .
Thermometers with stems projecting above the chambers show the temperature of the air in the copper chamber and the annular space , and another gives the temperature of the copper walls ; these thermometers are divided into fiftieths of a degree centigrade .
For further particulars we beg to refer to the original paper .
The amount of heat evolved is easily calculated from the weight of ice melted , the temperature of the resulting water , and the change of temperature of the chamber , the annular space , and the copper .

of Man , or Economic Coefficient of the Hitman Machine .
361 gas , gave a figure ( 34,428 calories ) almost identical with that found by Favre and Silbermann ( 34,462 ) .
After having used that instrument towards the estimation of the heat given out in a state of rest* it appeared to us of interest to apply it to the determination of the heat emitted under exercise , so as to obtain finally a figure for the mechanical energy of the human machine , or , as termed by Yerdet in his book on the ' Mechanical Theory of Heat/ f the economic coefficient of the human machine .
In 1861 Helmholtz , making use of Edward Smith 's experiments on the treadmill , calculated by an ingenious mode of argument what ought to be the value of this coefficient .
He reasoned in the following way| ; \#151 ; A man in a state of repose emits exactly , in one hour , the amount of heat that would be required theoretically to raise his body uphill to a height of 522 m. , which he looks upon as a fair rate of climbing in one hour ; but , in order to accomplish this work , he would expire five times as much CCA as in the state of repose , and , therefore , produce five times as much heat , consequently the relation is 1 : 5 , and therefore the economic coefficient would be 1/ 5 .
Following this mode of argument , it will be readily seen that the supposed subject of this experiment , taking as an average weight 65 kilos .
, would have to emit in the state of rest 80-2 cals , per hour , because , on multiplying 80*2 by 423 ( the mechanical equivalent of heat ) , the result would give 33,925 kilo.-metres ; on the other hand , a man weighing 65 kilos , while raising his body by 522 m. , would effect an amount of work = 33,930 kilo.-metres .
Therefore the heat emitted in a state of rest in one hour would be exactly the same as the theoretical heat necessary to raise the body 522 m. ; but as ( according to Helmholtz ) Edward Smith says it is necessary to give out five times more C02 than when at rest , to do that work , the coefficient will be 1/ 5 .
This argument can be criticised as follows :\#151 ; 1 .
Most authors give a little over 100 cals , per hour as the mean amount of heat emitted by a person in a state of repose , while , from ninety-two experiments on three different persons , we found from 79-056 cals , to 137-636 cals , with a mean of 102-260 cals .
, these figures being very far from 80"2 , which are required to fit the present theory .

An ascent of 522 m. ( 1712 feet ) in an hour is more than anybody can do going uphill ; such exercise might perhaps be kept up for a minute or two , but the average height a man can ascend is usually put down at 1000 feet per hour ( perhaps 1200 feet ) .
It is difficult to say what amount of air a man would breathe during such exercise , but it * ' Roy .

Efficiency would probably happen that if a person could climb at the rate of 522 m. per hour , as Smith did on the treadmill , then he would expire about five times as much C02 as in the state of repose ; there is no reference to the oxygen absorbed in addition to the carbonic acid expired .
From these considerations it will be understood how Helmholtz obtained the figure accepted in a general way as the value of the efficiency of the human body , and which is close to the figure we have found .
In order to determine experimentally the heat given out under a definite exercise , and ascertain that utilised in the work done , a brake was used , being a modification of that known to engineers as Pronie 's .
This brake ( see diagram ) consists of an iron fly-wheel resting on an iron stand and worked by a handle projecting inside the calorimeter through a stuffing box ; a counter registers the number of revolutions throughout the experiment .
The wheel is brought into contact with a semicircle of hard wood in sections fastened to a strap ; by tightening this strap the semicircle of wood can be pressed more or less against the wheel , and thus the friction can be regulated .
On turning the wheel pressing against the wooden blocks , the tendency would be to give the blocks a revolving motion , but the force applied , instead of carrying them round and round , causes the wheel to slip over their surface , and in doing so to exert a degree of friction sufficient to raise a lever weighted at the end , and maintain it in a horizontal position as long as the wheel is rotated .
of Man , or Economic Coefficient of the Human Machine .
863 Therefore the power necessary to overcome the friction is exactly balanced by the weight at the end of the lever , and the work done will be a function of the weight multiplied by the length of the lever , or may be expressed as the work done in raising the weight by means of a cord wound round a drum , having for its radius the distance between the suspension of the lever and the end of the beam where the weight is hung .
It should be understood that the beam is balanced by a counterpoise before the weight is suspended to its extremity .
The only objection that could be made to the use of this instrument might be the friction to overcome on turning the wheel ; but there is no appreciable friction , the wheel revolving on ball-bearings like those of a bicycle .
The weight can be altered , and it will be readily found that if a person works the wheel as hard as he can for a given time , b^ doubling the weight at the end of the lever the number of revolutions he can make in that same time will be half that registered with the lighter weight .
The experiment in the calorimeter is made as follows .
The subject is shut up in the chamber as usual , and there he remains for thirty minutes quite quiet j during that time the temperatures are recorded , and the water from the melted ice is collected , thus the heat given out in the state of repose is determined .
Then the person is let out of the calorimeter , and the chamber left full open for its ventilation , and about twenty minutes later he returns into the chamber .
At once the work of turning the handle begins , to be continued for about half an hour .
Then a rest is taken for another half hour inside the calorimeter , and the experiment is over .
By so doing the heat emitted in the state of rest is first determined ; this is followed by the determination of the heat given out when at work and while the body is returning to its normal state of rest .
It might be thought that the amount of work done had better be determined by first working the wheel perfectly free and therefore effecting no work , and then putting on the brake while the lever is weighted and doing a certain amount of work ; the heat emitted in the first case would be subtracted from that given out in the second .
This plan , however , is not admissible , because , at any rate , no work can be done without moving the arm , so that the arm is a necessary factor of the woi .
The first question was to ascertain whether the mean relation of the oxygen absorbed under work to the calories emitted was the same as the corresponding mean relation in the state of rest .
In order to settle this point , the C02 emitted and 0 absorbed were determined while in the calorimeter , together with the calories , both when sitting quiet and during exercise , the relation at rest having been fully investigated m our last paper and found to be 1 : 4'000.* * It was stated in the previous paper that Hirn had found that while sitting quiet , 1 gram of oxygen gave rise to a mean of 5*22 calories .

, 3-265 Consequently the oxygen absorbed does not follow exactly the amount of heat produced ; but a number of experiments for separate individuals show in each case means somewhat approximating each other , though less obviously than in the state of rest .
* The persons who submitted to these experiments had practised this mode of breathing for a considerable time , and it had become with them quite natural .
of Man , or Economic Coefficient of the Human Machine .
365 The present inquiry includes twenty-three experiments : Therefore it will be readily seen that 1 gram of oxygen will give rise to more heat in a state of rest ( 1 : 4*000 ) than under exercise ( 1 : 3*246 ) , and it cannot be admitted that the same mean amount of heat is produced by a given weight of oxygen absorbed in repose and under exercise ; Hirn observed a similar occurrence .
It may therefore be concluded that the human body in the state of rest makes a more efficient use of its oxygen than it does under exercise in the proportion of about 4-000 : 3"246 .
The next , and perhaps most important subject for consideration , is the efficiency or economic coefficient of the human machine .
The efficiency of the body as a machine is the relation between the theoretical heat corresponding to the work done* and the actual amount of heat that the body requires to do this work .
According to this definition the result sought for in our inquiries was obtained by dividing the theoretical amount of heat necessary for the work done in each experiment by the heat given out during the work , less the normal heat emitted in the same time plus the theoretical heat necessary for the work .
This statement can be expressed in the form of a formula .
The weight suspended from the end of the lever forming part of the brake was 485 grams , and knowing the length of the lever ( 48*275 cm .
) it was easy to calculate that each turn of the wheel performed an invariable amount of work = 1-471 kilogram-metres .

These irregularities are apparently due to some accidental mis-estimation of the water from the melted ice .

The general results obtained from this inquiry can be summarised as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 ) There is no fixed relation per individual experiment between the oxygen absorbed under excercise and the corresponding heat emitted , although the mean for each person somewhat approximates a constant figure which is 1 to 3*246 .
Considering that in the state of rest we found the corresponding ratio to be 1 to 4*000 , it may be concluded that the oxygen is better utilised for the production of heat in a state of rest than under exercise .
( 2 ) There is a marked excess of heat over normal given out under exercise , this excess ( + theoretical heat ) produced in doing a definite amount of work ( say 1000 kilogram-metres ) varies for each of the five persons under experiment .
( 3 ) The efficiency , or economic coefficient , for the five persons under experiment varied from 0*193 to 0*174 with a mean of 0*183 ; or lb 3 per cent , of the excess heat produced + the theoretical heat corresponding to the work done .
This is a little less than a fifth .
