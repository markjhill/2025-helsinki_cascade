Received July 24 , 1860 .
Among the numerous compotunds into which benzol , when submitted to reagents , is converted , azobenzzol and its derivatives have as yet received but limited attention .
Although more than twentyfive years have elapsed since this interesting body was discovered by Mitscherlich , both its formation and its constitution remain still doubtful .
Mitscherlich * , who discovered azobenzol in 1834 , when submitting nitrobenzol to the action of an alcoholic solution of potassa , represented this compound by the formula C II5 N1 , but left the reaction which gives rise to the formation of azobenzol unexplained .
In 1845 this body was reprepared by Hofmann and Muspratt$ , who observed among the collateral products of the reaction anilinie and oxalic acid .
They represent the formation of azobenzol by the equation 2C6 H5 NO2+ C2 11 60= C6 H5 N+ C , 117 N+ C2 112 04+ H 0 , Nitrobelizol .
Alcohol .
Azobenzol .
Phenylaniioie .
Oxalic aci(l .
adding at the same time that they are far from considering this equation as more than the representation of onie phase of the transformation of nitrobenzol , since several other rather inidefinite coinpounds or products are formed simultaneously .
At about the same period Zinin made the in-teresting observation that azobenzol is capable of fixing hydrogen and of being thereby converted into a well-defined base , benzidine , which he represented by the formula C6 1-16 N. Considering the physical characters both of azobenzol and of benizidine , especially the high boiling-points of these substances , and the ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen in the latter compound , the sum of the number of equivalents of these two elements not being divisible by 2 , many chemists were inclined to double the formulae of both bodies , and to represent them by the following expressions : Azobenzol .
C*12 HON2 Benzidine .
C12 1112N92 This view received the first experimental confirmation in the formationl of the nitro-derivatives of azobenzol , which were examinied in 1849 by Gerhardt and Laurent .
The formation of Nitrazobenzol ... .
C12 110 3 02=c12 ( 119 NO2 ) N2 , of Dinitrazobenzol .
C. 12 118Ni 04 0 , C12 [ H8 ( NO2)2 ] N2 , and of several derivatives of these bodies , having established the C,2-formula of azobenzol , but little doubt could be elntertained regarding the formula of benizidine , which is as readily obtained from azobenzol by reducing agents , as it may be reconverted into azobenzol by nitric acid * .
The molecular value of beulzidine being thus almost exclusively fixed by the determination of the fori-iula of the compound from which it originiates , it was of some interest to obtain additional experimental evidence for the molecular weight of azobenzol .
With this view I have determined the vapour-density of azobenzol .
This body boiling at a rather high temperature , I have availed myself of the method of displacement lately proposed by Professor Hofmann .
Experiment proved the density of the azobelnzol-vaponir to be 94 referred to hydrogen as runity , or 65d0 referred to air .
The theoretical vapour-density of azobenzol , assuming that one molecule of this compounld furnishes , like the rest of well-examined substances , 2 vols .
of vapourt , is 82_ 91 referred to hydrogen , and 632 referred to air .
The determination of the vapour-density , then , plainily confirms the higher molecular weights proposed for azobenzol and for beuzidine .
When determining the vapour-density of azobenzol , I had occasion to observe that , probably in consequence of a typographical error , the boiling-point of this compound is misstated in all the manuals which I could consult , and even in the originial memoirs of Mitscherlich himself .
The boiling-point is stated to be 1930 C. , whilst it is in reality 293 ?
C. Benzidine , when expressed by the formula C12 112 N2 presents itself as a well-defined diacid diamine .
The molecular colnstruction of the diatomic base remained to be decided .
I have endeavoured to solve this problem by the process of ethylation , as yet the simplest and the best guiide in determining questions of this kilnd .
Benzidine in the presence of alcohol is rapidly attacked by iodide of ethyl .
After two hours ' digestioni at 1000 C. in sealed tubes , the reaction is complete .
The solution on evaporation yields a crystalline iodide , C1 1122 2 '2 012 112 ( C2 115)2 N2 I2 , from which amrnonia separates a solid crystalline base very similar to benzidine .
This compound , which fuses at 65 ?
C. , and resolidifies at 60 ?
C. , is diethyl6enzidine : 1G 120 2= 12 1-10 ( C2 115)2 N2 which forms well-crystallizable salts with the acids , and yields with diebloride of platinum a difficultly soluble crystallilne platinum-salt containing C i2 N Cl 2PtCl21 106 22 222 When diethylbenzidine is treated again with iodide of ethyl , the phenomena previously observed repeat themselves .
The iodide 020 1130 N2 12 012 " 10 ( C2 115 ) N2 12 is formed , which when decomposed by ammonia yields tetretitylbenzidine C20 2 N2=028 ( C= 115)4 N2 ' Tetrethylbeulzidine resembles the diethylated and the non-ethylated base .
It fuses at 850 C. , resolidifying at 80 ?
C. , produces with the acids crystalline compounds , and furnishes with dichloride of platinum a platinum-salt of the formula C20 1130N2 N 20 2 PtC12l The further action of iodide of ethyl uporn tetrethylbenzidine is extremely slow .
After 12 hours ' digestion at 100 ?
C. only a very minute quantity of the base had been transformed into an iodide .
Iodide of methyl , on the other hand , acts with great energy .
An hour 's digestion is sufficient to produce the final diammonium-compound .
The iodide C22 234 22 12 8 ( C2 115)4 ( Cl-3)2 2 12 is very difficultly soluble in absolute alcohol , but dissolves with facility in boiling water , from which it is deposited on cooling , in long beautiful nieedles .
The solution of this iodide is no longer precipitated byamnmonia , but yields with oxide of silver a powerfully alkaline solution , exhibiting all the characters of the complete .ely substituted ammoniumand diammoniium-bases discovered by Professor Iiofmann .
The solution of this dimethyl-tetrethylated base , which contains 0 I-I N0 ? ?
1C.2 H8 ( C2 11)6 ( 03)2 N. o 22 31 22 2I is not further acted upon by either iodide of ethyl or methyl .
With acids it forms a series of salts which are remarkable for the beauty with which they crystallize .
The platinum-salt is almost insoluble in water , but soluble with difficulty in concentrated boiling hydrochloric acid , crystallizing from this solution on cooling in beautiful lneedles .
This salt colntains C22 1T34N2 C012 , 2 PtCl2 .
The above experiments appear to establish the molecular colnstruction of benzidinie in a satisfactory manner .
This base is obviously a primary diamine , in which the molecular group C12 111 , whatever its nature may be , fulnctions as a diatomic radical .
