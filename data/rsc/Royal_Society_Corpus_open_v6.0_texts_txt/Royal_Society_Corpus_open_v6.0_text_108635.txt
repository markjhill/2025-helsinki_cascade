IN order to determine whether the act of photo-chemical combination necessitates the production of a certain amount of mechanical effect , for which an equivalent quantity of light is expended , or whether this phenomenon is dependent upon a restoration of equilibrium effected without any corresponding equivalent loss of light , we must study more specially the phenomena occurring at the bounding surfaces , and in the interior of a medium exposed to the chemically active rays .
A certain large class of bodies permit the chemical rays to pass through them to a greater or less extent , whilst other substances are opake to these rays .
The first class , to which the name " diactinous " may be given , includes almost all colourless , blue , and violet media ; the second class of " anactinous " bodies consists chiefly of opake , and yellow or red substances .
Although the terms " diactinous " and " anactinous , " like " diathermanous , " " diaphanous , " &amp;c. , merely represent phases of the same difference , and can therefore bear no strict scientific definition , yet we do not hesitate to employ these terms as a means of avoiding a tedious circumlocution .
When a ray of light penetrates a body which is not photo-chemically sensitive , a part of the light is absorbed , and an equivalent quantity of heat evolved .
If the amount of light entering the medium be called I , , and the amount issuing from the medium I , we have on the supposition that the extinction and the intensity of the light vary proportionally , when a represents the fraction of the original amount of light which has remained after passage through the medium .
If the amount of light cIo , which has passed through one medium , be now allowed to pass through a second whose coefficient is a , , the amount of light issuing from the second medium will be acaI0 , from a third medium caaeJ2Io , &amp;c. The value of the result aacc,2I is not affected by any alteration in the order of the media , as such an alteration simply changes the order in which the coefficients oac , a , , &amp;c. are placed .
It is therefore quite immaterial , as regards the amount of light , in what order the various absorbing media are placed between the source of light and the instrument by which the effect is measured .
In order to show that the extinction of the chemical rays is really proportional to the intensity of the light , we have made the following experiments .
The intensity of the chemical rays proceeding from a constant source of light , was measured before and after their passage through a cylinder with plate-glass ends , filled with dry chlorine .
After the amount of light Io has passed through the first plane glass obIo , and on passing through the second glass plate it will be reduced to aobojIo .
The amount of light I which issues from the cylinder , is therefore equal to I==s6zlj or II If we determine the amount of light I which passes through the cylinder for various intensities of the incident ray Io , and if we find that for the various intensities the fraction I remains constant , we may conclude that the amount of transmitted light is proportional to the amount of incident light .
I The following experiments show the equality of the fraction 1 for amounts of light varying from 1 to 1'9 .

For , as it is thus proved that the amount of light transmitted through a medium of finite thickness is proportional to the intensity of the incident rays , it may be assumed that the same relation will hold good for an infinitely thin medium .
According to this supposition , the relation between the transmitted light I , and the thicknesss of the absorbing medium , is found from the equations I=I.10Oh ... ..(1 .
) and hence ( " " --~.1og 10 in which Io represents the intensity before transmission , I the intensity after transmission through a medium of the thickness h , and the thickness of absorbing medium by passing through which the amount of light has diminished to one-tenth .
The values of c for chlorine , or the chlorine detonating gas , may be determined by allowing the rays from a constant source of light to pass through layers of the gas of various degrees of thickness ; whilst the intensity of the incident and transmitted rays is measured .
As the gases are enclosed between plane plates of glass , the loss of light in the passage through these plates must be considered .
This loss of light is made up of the light reflected from the surfaces of the glasses , and that absorbed in the mass of the glass .
For the purposes of our investigation , it is necessary to know what fraction of the loss of light is to be ascribed to the reflexion , and what fraction to the absorption in the mass of glass .
The following was the method adopted in order to determine this point .
Let Iq represent the portion of incident light Io which enters the medium , and let Ip represent the amount of light which remains after the ray has traversed a thickness h of the medium , and let represent the depth of the medium , by passing through which the original amount of light Iq is reduced by extinction to one-tenth of its intensity , we then have Ip= I,.l0- " , where Mo represents a constant , which we call the Coefficient of Extinction , dependent upon the nature of the medium .
We can only measure the amount of light Io falling upon the medium ; the light which enters the medium can , however , as the following considerations show , be calculated , at least for rays perpendicular to the reflecting surface .
Suppose that the unit amount of light falls in Fig. 1 .
the direction ii , t fig. 1 , perpendicular to the surface AA of the medium , ____ Aa portion g of this light will be reflected at i , and a portion 1g will enter the medium .
This g is a constant , dependent on the nature and surface of the transparent medium , which may be called the Coefficient of Reflexion .
When the light 1-g has passed through the thickness h of the medium , and reached the second surface i2 , AA the intensity has diminished to ( 1g)10 -ha , in consequence of the extinction which it has suffered .
At the second bounding surface the fraction g of this light , that is , g(l--g)lO- " , is reflected ; so that the amount of light which passes this second reflecting surface is ( 1-e)10O-7'"-(1-g)10O-a , or ( 1-I )210-h " .
In the case of our experiments , the further reflexions are not considered , as their influence on the result would be inappreciable , and hence we have the following equation representing the relation between the incident light Io and the transmitted light I:=(-L _ )2 0 h. .
( 2 .
) and similarly for 1 I1 and h1 , Io Hence = 1-h ' log(. .
( 3 .

( 4 .
) The values for a and g employed in all our experiments were calculated from the equations , by determining the amount of chemical rays which passed through two plates of crown glass , one of which was very thin , and the other much thicker .
The following experiments gave the requisite data .
Io signifies the amount of light , measured by our instrument before transmission through the glass plate ; I signifies the amount of light measured after transmission ; and A the thickness in millimetres of the plates employed .

0-30 mm. From experiments 1 and 3 the value of a is found to be 0-00642 ; from experiments 2 and 3 , 0-00605 , or a mean of 0-00623 .
From experiment 1 we get:=00520 , from experiment 2 g=0-0452 , from experiment 3 =-0'0485 , or a mean of 0-0486 .
The following conclusions may be drawn from this experiment:1 .
That 4-86 per cent. of the chemical rays from a flame of coal-gas which fall perpendicularly on a surface of crown glass , are lost by the first reflexion .
2 .
That nine-tenths of the chemical rays , issuing from the same source of light , are extinguished by passing through 160-5 millimetres of crown glass .
The thinnest of the plates employed by us had a thickness of 0-30 millimetre ; the unit amount of light in passing through this plate will be reduced from 1 to 10-0'3.0'00623= 09957 .
In passing through this plate , therefore , 0-43 per cent. of the light is absorbed .
This is so small an amount that it falls within the limits of the unavoidable errors of observation , and we may , without diminishing the accuracy of the result , write h=-0 instead of h=0*3 .
Hence formula ( 4 .
) becomes I ( 1 --)2=I org=. .
, Or.(5 .
) The value of g calculated according to this formula , from No. 3 of Series I. , gives 6=0*0506 , which corresponds very nearly to the mean value 0-0486 previously found .
This value is probably the more correct , as it is independent of the errors ensuing from the introduction of a. As the thick plate of crown glass , which we used for the determination of a , was somewhat dark-coloured , and contained bubbles of air , it was to be expected that the plates of white mirror glass , which we employed for our transparent cylinders , would not give so large a coefficient of extinction .
The following experiments confirmed this opinion , showing that the amount of light a , absorbed by the plates of white glass 4*7 millims. in thickness , was not more than that absorbed by the thin plate 0'3 millim. thick ; hence that the coefficient of extinction of our plates was so small , that , without incurring any perceptible error , the product a. 47 in formula ( 2 .
) becomes equal to 0 ; or in other words , the absorption in the interior of the glass may be neglected without any appreciable error .

) 1+ ( 2n--l)g ' ' If the mean value of 0 0-0509 , as found in the last experiment , be substituted in this formula , we obtain a value ai=0*823 for the amount of light passing through two plates .
This value , 0 823 , plays an important part in the calculation of the coefficient of extinction , so much so , that we have thought it necessary to corroborate this calculated result by further experiment .
For this purpose a series of direct observations were made with the cylinders closed with two plates of glass .
In these , as well as the succeeding absorption experiments with these cylinders , the accuracy of the result depended entirely on placing the cylinder before the insolation-vessel ( i , fig. 2 , Part II .
) , so that none of the rays from the luminous source were obstructed by the edge of the cylinder .
This arrangement was effected by illuminating the insolation-vessel , and placing the transparent cylinder in such a position that when the observer moved his eye near the source of light , he saw that the insolation-vessel was covered by the screen , and not by the edge of the interposed cylinder .
If the cone of rays from a convex lens was employed , the aperture of the lens was made smaller than that of the cylinder , and lens and cylinder were brought as near as possible together .
Having duly observed these precautions , we determined the intensity of the chemical rays proceeding from a flame of coal-gas , before and after their passage through our transparent cylinder , closed with two plates of glass .
The experimental numbers , and the values of al , as I calculated with the formula a , = I , are thrown into the following Table .

) .
In all the following experiments we shall employ the mean of these two determinations , 0811 , as the most exact value for the coefficient of transmission of our cylinder plates .
At the commencement of this section we have shown that when light passes throughl a number of media , the amount of transmitted light remains the same , in whatever order the media be placed ; thus a film of air between two glass plates would allow exactly as much light to pass through , were the air in front of or behind the plates .
This assumption is however only true when all the media possess the same coefficients of reflexion .
If the refractive index i , and hence the coefficient of reflexion ?
, differs according to the order in which the media are placed , the values of i and g vary in a relation dependent upon the arrangement of the media .
In this case therefore allowance must be made for the order in which each limiting surface of a mediuni occurs .
This is best explained by an example .
We select for this purpose the determination of the coefficient of extinction for water which we have occasion to employ in our subsequent experiments .
Let us first examine what occurs when a ray of light passes through two glass plates ( GG , , fig. 2 ) surrounded by air , but so thin that , like the glasses of our cylinders , they may be regarded as perfectly diactinic .
The fraction i of the unit amount of incident light falling perpendicularly upon the medium Which passes the first surface at r is ... ( 1-g ) Fig. 2 .
Which passes the second surface at r , is. .
( 1-g)2 G ; G Which passes the third surface at r , is. .

1 If we suppose that a film of water be placed between1 the plates instead of the air , the coefficient of reflexion from glass and water will no longer be g , but a new quantity , ?

The total amount of transmitted light is in this case , therefore , ( 1-)2(l-)2 ; and as g is greater than g , , the amount of transmitted light is larger than in the case when air was contained between the plates .
If the media are placed in the following order , air , water , glass , air , glass , air ; and If the coefficient of reflexion between air and water =g,2 If the coefficient of reflexion between water and glass =g , , If the coefficient of reflexion between glass and air =g , a repetition of the foregoing reasoning shows that the transmitted light is not ( 1-)(1-1)2 , but ( 1-g2)(1--g , )(1-g ) .
It is easy from these considerations to determine the amount of light transmitted by two diactinous glass plates enclosing a column of water .
Let g represent the coefficient of reflexion between air and glass , g , between water and glass , h the length of the enclosed column of water , and the length of a column of water by passing through which nine-tenths of the light is extinguished ; we then have the unit amount of light reduced , After passing the surface r ( fig. 2 ) ( 1 g ) After passing the surface r , ( fig. 2 ) ( 1)(1-~g ) After traversing the space from r , to r2 ( 1-g-)(l-g-l)10-h After passing the surface from r2 ( 1)(1 -gl)21 OAfter passing the surface from r3 ( 1 --g)(l -)20-La I If Io represent the amount of incident light , and I that of the transmitted light , I of the unit amount of incident light is transmitted .

An experiment with columns of water of h millimetre thickness gave the following values for Io ( the light measured without interposed cylinder ) and I ( with interposed cylinder ) .

) becomes =1 .
According to this method it is possible , approximately at least , to determine the coefficient of reflexion of all transparent fluids for the chemical rays .
For this purpose a drop of the liquid is brought between two plates of glass , of which the coefficient of reflexion g has already been determined , and the intensity of the light measured before and after transmission through the moistened plates .
The values of Io and I thus found are substituted in equation ( 7 .
) , and as the value of h is extremely small , the factor 10-^ vanishes , and we have for the coefficient of reflexion of the liquid , ,1-A simple relation exists , as has been stated , between the coefficient of reflexion g and the refractive index i , which is represented by the equation g ( 1+ ) , or i= + V. If 1vg we substitute the value g=0 0509 , found for crown glass , we obtain for the refractive index i=1-583 .
The value of this index of refraction , as obtained by experiment for FRAUNHOFER'S line H lying nearest to the chemical rays , is given in BUF 's ' Lehrbuch der Physik , ' to be 1'5466 and 1'5794 , numbers closely approximating to that found from the coefficient of reflexion .
The coefficients of reflexion and the refractive indices for the chemical rays of all substances which can be divided into such thin plates that the absorption may be considered =0 , may in this way be ascertained .
We have thus determined the coefficient of reflexion and the refractive index of North American mica , which we shall make use of in a later part of the investigation .
It has been previously observed that the fraction ( formul and 6 ) of the unit amount of light which passes through n glass plates , is represented by the equation I , _=(2l ) ' where g signifies the coefficient of reflexion of the glass .
In order to see whether the plates absorb any light in their interior , in which case the formula could not be employed , it is sufficient to make the experiment first with one plate , and then with a greater number .
If both experiments give the same value for g , it is clear that the disturbing influence of absorption within the plate is inappreciable .
The following series of experiments were made with plates of mica , which were only some hundredths of a millimetre in thickness .

Another important element in the investigation of photo-chemical extinction , is the law according to which the optical coefficient of extinction varies with the density of the absorbing medium .
In order to determine this law for the chemical rays we have employed coloured solutions , knowing that for a considerable depth water may be considered as perfectly diactinous .
We made use of columns of water of various lengths , each containing the same quantity of a dilute solution of common red ink .
The following experiments , VII .
, show the dependence of the extinguished chemical rays upon the density of the extinguishing medium .
Io signifies the amount of the chemical rays before transmission through the cylinder , I the amount remaining after transmission , I b=Y the transmitted fraction of the unit amount of incident light , h the length of the columns of liquid in millimetres , e the density of the colouring substance , that is , the amount of colouring matter contained in the unit quantity of water , and I the fraction of the unit amount of light transmitted through the unit length of the several cylinders .

0-204 0203 0 200 'From the closely approximating values of j we may conclude , that with the chemical rays the amount of transmitted light varies proportionally with the density of the coloured medium .
Having determined these preliminary points , we may now return to the question originally proposed , viz.:In the combination effected by the light between the particles of chlorine and hydrogen , are the chemical rays expended in a relation proportional to the quantity of hydrochloric acid formed l In order to solve this question , it was necessary to determine experimentally the coefficient of extinction of pure chlorine for a flame of coal-gas .
The chlorine used in the following experiments , prepared from bichromate of potash and hydrochloric acid , carefully washed and dried , was led through the transparent cylinders until all atmospheric air was expelled .
Each of the measurements contained in the following Table is reduced from three series of observations , the first of which was made without interposed chlorine-cylinder , the second with chlorine-cylinder , and the third again without the cylinder .
The mean of the first and third series gives I0 , or the intensity of the chemical rays before transmission through the chlorine-cylinder , whilst the second series gave I , or the intensity after transmission ; h signifies the length of the interposed column of chlorine , P the pressure , and t the temperature on filling the cylinders with chlorine , Series of Experiments VIII .

This amount , according to the former considerations , is that which remains after the quantity lost by passing both the enclosing plates of glass has been subtracted from Io .
Io must therefore be multiplied with a-==0811 , found from several of the previous experiments , the difference between the coefficients of reflexion between glass and air and glass and chlorine being neglected as imperceptible .
The value of l , which signifies , according to formula ( 2 .
) , the depth of chlorine to which the chemical rays must penetrate in order to be reduced to one-tenth of their original amount , has been shown by Experiment VII .
to vary proportionally with the density of the medium .
For chlorine under 0'76 pressure and at 0 ?

1717 This mean value , 171*7 , gives a value of 0-00582 as the coefficient of extinction for chlorine at 0*76 pressure , and 0 ?
C. for the flame of coal-gas .
In order to prove experimentally that the coefficient of extinction varies , in the case of chlorine , in the inverse proportion of the dilution , another series of determinations was made in which the chlorine was mixed with varying quantities of atmospheric air .
For this purpose the caoutchouc-tubes , connected with the cylinders previously used , filled with V volumes of chlorine at t ?
C. , and under the pressure P , were secured by screw-clamps , and into the end of one caoutchouc joining a fine capillary tube was fastened , whilst into the other was placed a chloride of calcium drying-tube .
On opening the screw-clamps , air was forced by the mouth through the drying-tube into the chlorine cylinder , whence the gas escaped through the capillary tube into a reversed retort filled with a solution of iodide of potassium , and when sufficient chlorine had been expelled the screw-clamps were again closed .
The volume of chlorine expelled , reduced to 00 C. and 0 76 pressure , was determined by volumetric analysis , and this volume subtracted from that originally contained , also reduced to 0 ?
C. and 0-76 pressure , gave the volume V , remaining in the cylinder mixed with air .
If H represent the depth of the cylinder , measured from the inner surface of one glass plate to the inner surface of the other , and hs represent the length of the H.P column of chlorine before displacement , h , =-.76( +0.oo066t ' and after displacement , ha=VH .
These various columns of chlorine , hi h2 , both of which were expanded to the height H in the cylinder , were placed between the source of light and the insolationvessel , and from the diminution of the action from Io to I , the values of were calculated as in the previous instance .
Chlorine was again expelled from the cylinder into the reversed retort , the cylinder again placed between the flame and the instrument , the values of Io and I again determined , and this repeated until the whole of the chlorine had been displaced .
The agreement of the sum of all the separate determinations of chlorine with the total quantity introduced , served as a control for the accuracy of the analyses .
The calculation of the volume of chlorine at 0 ?
C. and 0'76 pressure , from the direct observations of the volumetric analyses , was made by means of the formula c= 88'012 a(nt--t , ) , which we deduced in a former communication .

From these numbers the values of h are obtained , that is , the length which the columns of gas would have been , had they been unmixed with air and measured at 0 ?

174-3 millims. This mean value agrees very closely with that found from the experiments with chlorine undiluted with air , but it is seen that the variation in the separate values is not inconsiderable .
The cause of this lies not only in the unavoidable errors of experiment , but more especially in the fact that the formula used in the calculation is , strictly speaking , only applicable to homogeneous light , whilst the chemically active rays emanating from our coal-gas flame were certainly not all of the same degree of refrangibility .
If the intensity Io of the light , measured by our instrument , were composed of the components I 2+-I+- ... of various degrees of refrangibility , the formula IIlO-I0 " would become I= I,1o0-+I2I 0-^+ ... The values calculated according to the first formula can therefore only give a mean value for the various chemical rays in our flame , and the numbers obtained must vary more considerably amongst themselves than if homogeneous light had been employed .
The mean of all the determinations in Series VIII .
and X. gives the value of the optical coefficient of extinction of chlorine at 0 ?
C. and 0-76 pressure , for rays from a coal-gas flame , to be -73=0-00578 .
If the light is not consumed in the act of photo-chemical change , the coefficient just found must remain unaltered when the chlorine and hydrogen mixture is employed ; but if , on the contrary , light is not only lost by the optical extinction , but also an amount of light proportional to the chemical action vanishes , experiment must give a larger value for the coefficient .
In the first case the light merely liberates the chemical forces , in the second it suffers a transformation into mechanical energy , effecting the combination of the chlorine and hydrogen .
It would seem as if the simplest mode of arriving at a conclusion regarding these two alternatives , were to determine the coefficient of extinction for chlorine and hydrogen , by interposition of the transparent cylinders filled with the mixture : this plan , however , is accompanied by the unavoidable error arising from the impossibility of ascertaining when the mixture under examination has arrived at the point of maximum photo-chemical sensibility .
We have therefore preferred to deduce the coefficient of extinction for chlorine and hydrogen directly from the chemical actions effected by a constant amount of light in columns of sensitive gas of various length .
For this purpose we have employed the apparatus ( Plate XXVII .
) , which mainly differs from the instrument described in our first communication in the arrangement of the insolation-vessel .
The insolation-vessel iq consists of a glass tube with as even a bore as possible , 250 millims. in length and 15 millims. in breadth , of which the end i , exposed to the light , is a plane surface .
The mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , evolved in the manner described in our first communication , enters the insolation-vessel iq through the tube p melted on to the side of the vessel , and ground air-tight into the glass stopcock h ; the gas issues through a tube q similarly fused into the other end of the insolation-vessel , and thence passes into the observation-tube K. In the inside of the insolation-vessel is placed a semicircular diaphragm , d , of black glass , which is melted on to the glass rod i , moveable in the caoutchouc cap c. By moving this glass rod , on which a scale in millimetres can be etched , backwards or for , wards through the caoutchouc cap , the column of gas id , exposed to the light , can be shortened and lengthened at pleasure .
The tube iq contains so much water , that when the diaphragm d is turned round to the right , at an angle of 90 ?
from that represented in the figure , the surface of the water just touches the straight edge of the diaphragm .
In order to prevent entrance and collection of water in the tube q during the alteration of the diaphragm , the rod i , must never be moved , unless the curved side of the diaphragm is undermost ( as in the position represented in the figure ) , when the water is not carried back , and no inconvenience is experienced in altering the length of the column of gas .
In spite of the number of ground-glass joints , and the consequent fragile nature of the apparatus , all these necessary operations may be executed without danger , if the insolation-vessel is firmly fixed in one position by pressing it against the support at q with the finger and thumb .
When the apparatus is to be filled with gas , all the precautions must be taken which are described in our first communication , and a thick piece of wood is placed under the board at A , so that the whole arrangement , including the evolution-tube , not represented in the figure , is placed in an oblique position , and all the water collects at .
the lower end , i , of the insolation-vessel , and is completely saturated with the gas which bubbles through from the tube p. As soon as the gas has reached the maximum degree of photo-chemical sensibility ( determined by experiments made from time to time with the standard flame ) , the apparatus is again placed in a horizontal position by means of the screws B , B , B. RESiEARCHES .
615 The following precautions must be observed at the commencement of each experiment .
In the first place , the ground-glass joint of the tube p is rendered perfectly airtight , by slightly pressing the ground edge into its place , and then moving the whole vessel at g up and down as much as the elasticity of the glass joints allows .
In the same way , care must be taken that the joint at q is also tight ; and in order to preserve these joints secure , pieces of caoutchouc tubing cut lengthways and filled with water are placed over the two tubes where the joint occurs , and the ground-glass surfaces are thus always kept wet .
Secondly , the level of water in the tube iq must be so regulated by the screws BB B , at the commencement of each series of observations , that the same section throughout the whole length of the tube is filled with gas .
Thirdly , the end of the insolation-vessel which is exposed to the light must be blackened as far as the upper level of water , in order to avoid any alteration in the constitution of the dissolved gases from the action of the light .
Fourthly , the insolation-vessel must be placed , before each experiment , exactly in a line with the incident rays which are as nearly as possible parallel .
Fifthly , the whole mass of gas contained in the tube , both before and behind the moveable diaphragm d , must be induced before each series of observations .
We have always effected this induction by allowing light from a window opposite the door of our darkened room to fall on the tube , by opening the door previous to beginning an experiment , and allowing the action to proceed until it was evident , from the rate of motion on the index scale , that the maximum of the induction was attained .
Sixthly and lastly , in order to eliminate all disturbing influence of change of temperature , the instrument was covered , during the experiment , with a tin case C , in which slits were cut , as seen in the figure , so that the case could fit closely over all parts of the insolation-vessel .
From the following considerations , it is seen that in order to obtain the value of o , , the coefficient of extinction in the chlorine-hydrogen mixture , a determination of the chemical actions W and W1 , in two columns of gas of different lengths h and hl , is sufficient .
Let Io represent the intensity of the light on entrance into the gaseous mixture , I the intensity remaining after it has passed through a length z of gas , we have then , according to the former equation , I=Io 10-a1 , in which c1 signifies the coefficient of extinction of the unreduced chlorine mixture .
If , also , wdz represents the chemical action effected in the unit of time in a film of gas of the thickness dz , we have w=NI , where N signifies a constant , and therefore w =NIo 10-a .
If h is the whole depth of the insolated columfi of gas , and W the total action occurring therein , we have W= &gt; lNIo ( 1 0O .
-ai log not 101 or more simply , W-MIo(l -10--^ ) .
For W1 and h , we get , similarly , W , = MIo(1 --0 l"4 ) ; hence 1 W1 1W_ num1og=o , h , 11 num log= ol~h numlog-oti^l The value of a , is obtained from this equation by a method of approximation .
Experiments conducted in this manner at 230*3 C. , and under a pressure of 07589 millims. , gave the following elements for the calculation of the values of contained in the fifth column .
Each value of W and W1 is the mean of from ten to fifteen observations .

262 Had the insolated chlorine and hydrogen mixture possessed the density corresponding to 0 ?
C. and 0-76 pressure , and if it had been perfectly dry , the length 1 =262 would have diminished , for we have shown that the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the density of the absorbing medium .
In a pure dry mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen , having a density corresponding to 0 ?
C. and 0'76 pressure , the length of a column of gas through which the light must pass in order to be reduced by optical and chemical extinction to -LOth of its original amount , is 1=234 millims. Supposing that the hydrogen were replaced by an equal volume of a chemically inactive gas , which , like hydrogen , does not absorb any chemical rays , we should obtain from the coefficient of extinction of pure chlorine -y}3 , a length of the gaseous mixture equal to 2X 173 or 346 millims. , through which the light would have to pass in order that it should be reduced to -16th .
Hence it is seen that for a given amount of chemical action effected in the mixture of chlorine and hydrogen , an equivalent quantity of light is absorbed .
For we find that in the standard chlorine and hydrogen mixture , where , together with the thermal effect , a chemical action of the light occurs , the value of the coefficient of extinction is 0*00427 ; whereas in a chlorine mixture of similar dilution , where the chemical action was absent , the coefficient was 0'00289 , or very much smaller .
The difference between these two numbers , 0-00138 , represents the coefficient of extinction due to chemical action alone .
The consumption of rays from a coal-gas flame , solely employed in the act of photo-chemical combination , is hence represented by an amount of light which is reduced to a-th by passing through 723 millims. of the standard chlorine mixture , whilst in consequence of optical extinction alone the light is reduced to -f'-6th by passing through 346*6 of the same standard mixture .
It appeared to us of great interest to repeat the experiments with rays from other sources of light .
For this purpose we employed the diffuse light of day reflected from the zenith of a cloudless sky .
The rays were rendered as nearly parallel as possible by reflexion from a mirror through a blackened tube , 6 feet long and 6 centimetres wide , on to the insolation-vessel of our instrument .
All the observations employed in the two next series of experiments ( XII .
and XIII .
) , with diffuse light thus reflected , were made between the hours of 9 and 12 in the morning .
For the determination of the coefficients of extinction for pure chlorine , a series of experiments similar to Series VIII .

C. and 0'76 pressure , for diffuse morning light reflected from the zenith , is hence 0'0219 , very different from the value 0'00578 found for a coal-gas flame .
This result renders it probable that the coefficient of extinction of the standard chlorine and hydrogen mixture is much greater for diffuse morning light than for light from a coal-gas flame .
The following experiments made with the chlorine and hydrogen mixture at 23 ?

The value of the coefficient of the light consumed in effecting the change is = 000265 , and its reciprocal 337'3 millims. From this it is seen that the light reflected in the morning from the zenith of a cloudless sky , is much more easily extinguished by passing through chlorine than the rays from a coal-gas flame .
Hence it was conjectured that probably the solar light might differ in its properties according to the time of day or year .
This supposition has been fully confirmed , as is shown by the following experiments made on the 15th of September , 1856 , between the hours of 3 P.M. and 31 P.M. , with zenith light from a cloudless sky .

A negative value is obtained for the coefficient of chemical extinction calculated from the results of Experiments XIV .
and XV .
From this we may conclude , that the rays which produced the action in Experinments XIV .
possessed a different degree of refrangibility from those vlwhich acted in Experiments XV .
, and that from this reason the two series of experiments are not comparable ; this view is easily explained by the fact , that the experiments were made at different times .
The conclusion which we draw from all our observations is , that the coefficients of extinction of pure chlorine for chemical rays from various sources of light are very different .
The depth to which such light must penetrate chlorine at 0 ?

( 2 ) Morning light reflected from a cloudless zenith. .
3773 millims. It is thus seen that the chemical rays reflected at different times of the year , and at various hours of the day , not only possess quantitative but also qualitative differences , representing the various coloured rays of the visible spectrum .
Had nature endowed our eyes with the power of discrimiating the various degrees of refrangibility of the chemical rays , as she has done for the visible rays by impressions of different colours , we should see the rosy tints of morning pass in the course of the day through all the gradations of colour until the warm evening tones at length succeed .
A long-continued series of observations must be made before we are able to understand the influence which these qualitative differeces in the chemical rays exert in the photo-chemical phenomena of vegetation .
That this influence must be of the greatest importance , is evident from the varying effects produced in other photo-chemical phenomena by differences in the solar light .
We need only call to mind , in proof of this assertion , the fact , well known to all photographers , that the amount of light , determined photometrically , gives no measure for the time in which a given photo-chemical effect is produced , and that the morning light is always preferred to the evening light for the preparation of pictures , even should the light in the latter case be more intense .
