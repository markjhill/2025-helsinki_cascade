( Abstract .
) Arbogast 's Method of Derivations was devised by him with a view to the development of a function ( a+b +Cx'2+ ... ) , but it is at least as useful for the formation of only the literal parts of the coefficients , or , what is the same thing , the combinations of a given degree and weight in the letters(a , b , c , d , ... ) , the weights of the successive letters being 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , &amp;c. Thus instead of applying the method to finding the coefficients a 46b , 4Cau c+6atb262 , &amp;c. , we may apply it merely to finding the sets of terms a4 , a'b , a3c , &amp;c. a2 b2 .
Nothing can be more convenient than the process when the entire series of columns is required ; but it is very desirable to have a process for the formation of any column apart from the others ; and the object of the memoir is to investigate a rule for the purpose .
It is found that there is , in fact , a rule analogous in some measure to Arbogast 's , but which consists in operating simultaneously upon certain pairs of letters : the pairs which may be operated on are four in number , but the conditions are such , that , as regards two of these pairs , when the one is operated on , the other is not , and for the same term the number of pairs operated on is therefore three at most .
