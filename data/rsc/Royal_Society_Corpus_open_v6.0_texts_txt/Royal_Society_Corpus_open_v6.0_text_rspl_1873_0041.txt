254 Mr. J. A. Broun the Annual [ Mar. 26 , of translation in the visual direction of some portions of the nebulous matter within the nebula , which might be found by comparing the different parts of a large and bright nebula .
Sir William Ilerschel states that " nebulae were generally detected in certain directions rather than in others , that the spaces preceding them were generally quite deprived of stars , that the nebulae appeared some time after among stars of a certain considerable size and but seldom among very small stars , that when I came to one nebula I found several more in the same neighbourhood , and afterwards a considerable time passed before I came to another parcel Since the existence of real nebulae has been established by the use of the spectroscope , Mr. Proctorf and Professor D'Arrest* have called attention to the relation of position which the gaseous nebulae hold to the Milky Way and the sidereal system .
It was with the hope of adding to our information on this point that these observations of the motions of the nebulae were undertaken .

" On the Animal Variation of the Magnetic Declination.'- ' By J. A. Broun , F.R.S. Received February 11 , 1874 .
The first observations which seemed to show that the mean position of the declination-needle followed an annual law were those of Cassini , made , more than eighty years ago^ in the hall of the Paris Observatory and in the caves below it ( 90 feet under ground ) .
It cannot be said , however , that Cassini 's result has been confirmed by subsequent observations , either as regards the direction or amounts of movement from month to month .

] Variation of the Magnetic Declination .
world in modern times hare given results so different that we must conclude either that the magnetic needle obeys different annual laws at each place , or that the differences are due to instrumental errors .
The consequence has been that , after long , laborious , and expensive researches , it is still a question whether the magnetic needle obeys an annual law or not .
The results obtained at some observatories have made it very probable that , if an annual law exist , the range of the oscillation must be very small .
It is therefore essential , in questioning any series of observations for this law , to be assured that the errors ( instrumental or others ) are neither considerable nor systematic .
I have concluded , from several series of observations made with suspension-threads bearing unmagnetic or slightly magnetic weights ' , that the systematic errors due to varying temperature or humidity are very small when the suspension-threads are carefully constructed with fibres from which the original torsion has been removed .
Dr. Lloyd has concluded that threads with fibres differently twisted may produce comparatively large annual variations in different directions , according to the direction of the twist .
There is little doubt , however , that the greatest errors are due to the unequal stretching and rupture of the different fibres which form the suspension-thread .
When the instrumental errors may be so considerable compared with the variations to be observed , it cannot be supposed extraordinary that instruments in different places give different results ; and it appears essential so to eliminate the sources of error that two instruments in the same place may tell the same story before we .
attempt to announce the existence of any law .
If at sea two or more chronometers are necessary in case one may be affected by error , it seems not less necessary in scientific researches requiring continuous observations for years , where errors are so difficult of detection and elimination , that two or more instruments should be observed .
These considerations induced me to establish at Trevan-drum two declination-magnetometers of different construction , placed under considerably different atmospheric conditions ; and it is to the results of sixteen years ' comparative observation from these two instruments that I desire to draw the attention of physicists .
Both instruments had suspension-threads made with the utmost care .
One , Dr. Lloyd 's instrument , made by Mr. Q-rubb , of Dublin , with a magnet weighing nearly a pound , was placed in the large room of the Trevandrum Magnetic Observatory , which was always more or less open to the external air ; and , although covered by a cotton-wadded hood and a series of 'boxes , it was much more liable to any errors due to atmospheric actions than the other .
Its chief source of error was , however , connected with small movements of the telescope wire , although that was made to coincide , at varying intervals of time , with the transit-mark five miles distant .
256 Mr. J. A. Broun the Annual [ Mar. 26 , The second instrument , made according to my own designs by Mr. P. Adie , of London , had a magnet weighing only about one sixth of the other ; it was suspended under a glass bell from which the air was exhausted , and which was covered with two hoods\#151 ; one with gilt surfaces , the other with cotton wadding .
This instrument was placed in a closed room without windows or external openings , and with a terraced ceiling below the observatory roof .
Observed from without ( within the large room of the observatory ) , the diurnal variations of temperature in the instrument were not more than three tenths ( 0*3 ) of a degree Fahrenheit , while the annual variation was nnder 5 ' Fahr.* The compared mean positions of the two magnets for each day , derived from hourly observations of both instruments during eleven years , and from eight daily observations during the remaining five years , will be found with all other details in the volume referred to in the note to the preceding paragraph .
It will be sufficient for the purposes now in view to give here the chief conclusions from these means .
The monthly mean declinations having been freed from the secular movement , and the means for three groups of years having been taken , these means are represented very nearly by the following equations of sines ( 0 = 0 , Jan. 15):\#151 ; fAdie .
y=0'-033 srn ( 0+135')+0**069 sin ( 20+2996 ) .

\ Grubb .
ys=0'*062 sin ( 0+228 ' ) + 0'*122 sin ( 20+322 ' ) .
In the years 1854 to 1859 the movements of Grubb 's telescope were very small , the daily mean declinations from both instruments differing rarely more than 0'*1 throughout the whole six years .
It will be seen that the equations for these years agree very nearly .
In spite of the greater movements of the telescope in following years ( affecting chiefly the coefficient of sin 0 ) , the epochs of maxima and minima derived from the two instruments differ but little , and all the principal deviations from the mean law for any year are confirmed by both instruments .
When the means for the whole sixteen years are taken , and the equi* Experiments with suspension-threads carrying slightly magnetic weights of nearly one pound , showed that the effect of a change of 1 ' Fahr. on the position of Grubb s magnet amounted to about 0'-003 ( =0 ' , ,18)\#151 ; a result deduced from the changes of temperature from hoUr to hour , as well as from those from day to day .
I must refer to the first volume of the ' Trevandrum Observations , ' now in the press , for the details o these experiments .

March 18 and September 29 .
The confirmation of the results from Adie 's instrument by those from Grubb 's , in spite of the errors of the latter , is so marked in each year and group of years , that we can affirm that at Trevandrum , in the south magnetic hemisphere , the magnetic needle obeys an annual law ' producing a double oscillation , having a minimum towards the end of May , the principal maximum near the end of September , another minimum in January , and a secondary maximum in the middle of March .
Or , taking the results from Adie 's instrument as most free from all error , the principal minimum occurs about a month before the June solstice , and the secondary minimum about a month after the December solstice ; while the principal maximum occurs about a wreek after the September equinox , and the secondary maximum about a week before the March equinox .
In the result obtained by mo from four years ' observations ( 1843 to 1846 ) at Makerstoun , in Scotland , the greatest easterly position was attained in the end of April or beginning of May , and the greatest westerly ( or least easterly ) position in September .
If that result , derived from a single instrument , can be accepted* , it would appear that the movements of the north end of the needle , in the annual variations , are in opposite directions at Trevandrum and Makerstoun at the same period of the year .
This result agrees with that which I have found for the decennial inequality , or that in the south magnetic hemisphere ; the law for the south end of the magnet is the same as that for the north end of the magnet in the north magnetic hemisphere : but it is opposed to the result obtained by me for the twrenty-six day period , in which the easterly and northerly magnetic forces have their maxima at the same time in both hemispheres .
It follows that the results which are connected with the sun 's rotation on its axis are the same in both hemispheres , while those related to * I have always considered this result a near approximation to the truth , but it was not confirmed by the very limited series of observations made in the three subsequent years , years of great disturbance .
Presents .
[ Mar. 5j the earth 's revolution round the sun appear opposite in the two hemispheres .
It might be supposed , as was done for the diurnal variation of magnetic declination , that the directions of motion being opposite in the two hemispheres , the amount of motion should diminish , and perhaps altogether disappear , at the magnetic equator .
This does not seem to be the case for the annual law more than for the diurnal law , the range of the mean oscillation from four years ' observations at Makerstoun being about l'-O , which is little different from that found for Trevandrum ( 0'-33 ) , the difference of the directive forces being considered .
