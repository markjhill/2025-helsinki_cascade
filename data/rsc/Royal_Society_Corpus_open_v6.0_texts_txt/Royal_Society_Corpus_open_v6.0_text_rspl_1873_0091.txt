" On the Sun-spot Period and the Rainfall .
" By J. A. Broun , P.R.S. Having read with much interest Mr. Meldrum 's communication to the Royal Society on the apparent simultaneity of excess of rainfall and sunspot area* , I have waited some confirmation of his conclusions from a more extensive induction .
Mr. Hennessey 's " Note " in the Proceedings of the Society for April 1874 f induces me to offer the following views and results to the Royal Society .
It is well known that the amount of rainfall is a very variable quantity in some countries and in certain positions , and that when there is a year of drought in one part of the world , there is frequently an excess of rain in another .
Any investigation , then , which should be occupied with the average fall of rain over the earth 's surface must be long and laborious , unless the variation to be dealt with is large and marked compared with others which must be considered purely accidental relatively to the sun 's spots .
In proof of this I may cite the rainfall at Mussoorie given by Mr. Hennessey !
, where , as far as the sun-spot area is known , any result favourable to the connexion of the two phenomena depends wholly on the rainfall for 1861 , which is upwards of 50 inches in excess of the mean .
If this excess be not due to the great spot-area , then a long series of years ' observations might be requisite to make the positive and negative errors destroy each other .
It has been with the intention of determining what may be the effect of a given change of sun-spot area , within a limited district , during a period favourable to the connexion of the two phenomena , that the following discussions have been made .
We can then say approximately within what limits the excess and deficiency of rainfall lie for the years of greatest and least spot-area , what amount of observations may be required to destroy accidental variations , and whether the result may encourage more extensive research .
Mr. Meldrum finds a mean difference of 8'5 inches of rain between the falls for the years of greatest and least spot-area S ; but this result is derived to some extent from short series of observations made in different parts of the world , and gives no weight to the rainfall in other years than those considered years of maximum or minimum sun-spots .
Should there be any connexion betwixt the rainfall and spot-area , we may always in the first instance represent it approximately by an equation of this form , AR=/ AA , where ARE is the excess or deficiency of the rainfall from the mean , AA * Proceedings of the Koval Society , vol. xxi .

Mr. J. A. Broun on the [ June 18 , is the excess or defect of spot-area for the same period of time , and / is a constant to be deduced from the observations .
Having obtained the mean spot-area for each year from 1832 to 1867 , from Table YII .
of the paper on this subject by Messrs. De La Rue , Stewart , and Loewy* , the mean for three periods of 11 years ( 1832 to 1864 ) was found equal to 643 millionths of the sun 's visible surface ; with this quantity the values of + AA ( in millionths of the sun 's surface ) for each year were obtained .
Mr. Meldrum 's conclusion depends chiefly on observations during these periods in G-reat Britain ; and as he has deduced the rainfall for the first period of minimum spots from observations at three stations , Greenwich , Carbeth ( near Glasgow ) , and Aberdeen , I first examined the observations at these places together with simultaneous observations at Makerstoun for the two periods 1832 to 1853f .
Applying the above equation to these observations , the following results were obtained:\#151 ; Greenwich ... ... AR= \#151 ; 0*00092 AA ; Makerstoun ... .
AR= \#151 ; 0*00020 AA ; Carbeth ... ... ... AR= + 0*00158 AA ; Aberdeen ... ... AR== +0*00128 AA .
Greenwich and Makerstoun are thus opposed to the conclusion , and Carbeth and Aberdeen are more strongly in its favour .
It should be remarked , however , that the result for Aberdeen depends wholly on the rainfall given for that place in 1834 ( 12*3 in .
) being exact .
As it is 12 inches less than the mean , while at the other three stations the deficiency is only from 0*6 in .
at Greenwich and Makerstoun to 1*2 in .
at Carbeth , this may be due to a leaky rain-gauge or to a clerical error of 10 inches .
In any case no great weight can be given to the conclusion from these four stations $ .
I now sought for an approximation to the mean fall of rain for Great Britain , and for this end have employed the quantities deduced by Mr. Symons from ten stations ( British Association Report , 1865 , p. 203 ; 1871 , p. 102 ) .
The differences of spot-area from the mean , in millionths of the sun 's surface , and of the rainfall for each year are given in the following Table:\#151 ; * Phil. Trans. 1870 , p. 399 .

These results , then , are , as we expected , in conformity with Mr. Mel-drurn 's conclusion ; so that if we compare the year of largest with that of smallest spot-area , the difference of rainfall should amount to 2-61 in .
by the first and to 1-51 in .
by the second value of / .
If we take the mean spot-area for the years 1834 , 1844 , 1856 , and 1866 , and for 1836 , 1848 , and 1861 , we find that the mean difference of rainfall for these years should be 2-06 in .
by the first and 1-20 in .
by the second value of / , instead of 8'45 in .
as found by Mr. Meldrum .
It will be seen also that the greatest mean difference of rainfall is that for the years 1841 , 1852 , and 1863 , and this was an excess of rain for years of spot-area deficiency ; were another such opposite difference to present itself , it would neutralize the conclusion derived from these means .
It should also be observed that while the first and third periods of eleven years are in favour of the connexion , the second ( 1843 to 1853 ) is opposed to it ( this is also the case for the eleven'years 1857 to 1867 ) .
It will be seen , then , that from this discussion a probable difference of about 2 inches of rain may be expected betwixt years of greatest and least spot-area .
This result is derived from observations at ten stations , distributed over a very small patch of the earth 's surface ; and it is evident that for any serious investigation a much larger series of observations representing the rainfall over a great extent of country would be essential .

472 On the Sun-spot Period and the Rainfall .
[ June 18 , I now examined observations made at different stations in India ; but this examination showed the extreme difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory result , either way , from a few stations in that country , when , in certain years , the accidental excess of rainfall at some of the stations may be 40 inches , even though deficiencies at some stations may diminish the amount of the error .
From my own experience of rainfall on the Indian ghats , I should doubt that a mountain-station , such as Mussoorie , is well jetted to be employed in this discussion .
If a single station could be taken to represent any tract of country , it ought to be one least liable to local causes of variation .
Among the mountains a slight change in the average direction of the wind will cause great differences in the rainfall at stations but little distant from each other , and to eliminate accidental variations of 40 or 80 inches would require observations during a very long series of years .
The following Table will , however , show the quantities which may have to be dealt with at an Indian hill-station +:\#151 ; Yalues of AR for Mahabuleshwar , 4500 feet above the sea , with the corresponding values of AA .

The examination of many series of observations has shown how difficult it will be to arrive at a conclusion for a quantity so small as 2 inches of rain .
It is evident that a larger tract of country than Great Britain should be chosen , and the approximate rainfall be deduced from the greatest t For the rainfall at Mahabuleshwar , see Colonel Sykes 's paper on Indian observations , Phil. Trans. 1850 , p. 867 .

Germany and France may give sufficient data for such a trial .
Were the result well marked , there would be reason to seek for its confirmation in other countries ; but to undertake this labour , better grounds , I think , must be found than I have hitherto been able to obtain .
The admirable series of observations which Mr. Symons is obtaining will suffice for the future , as for the past , ten years to give a very near approximation to the excess or deficiency of rainfall in Great Britain .
