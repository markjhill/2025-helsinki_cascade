IN a paper inserted in the Philosophical Transactions* I endeavoured to elucidate what appeared to me an important point in the wave-theory , viz. the connexion ( first pointed out by Mr. TOVEY ) between certain conditions with respect to the arrangenent of the ethereal molecules , and the rectilinear or elliptic form of the vibrations ; thus affording a criterion of their nature , in the respective cases , by the evanescence , or finite value , of certain terms in the equations .
Since the publication of that paper I have been led to review the stubject in ' connexion with the valuable illustrations given by Mr. LUBBOCK of the views of FRESNELt , according to which it appears that the criterion just mentioned requires a material modification .
I think it necessary therefore to submit to the Royal Society this short Supplement , in order to point out in what way the conclusions in my paper will be affected by these considerations .
In the investigation last referred to it is established , 1 .
That every system of molecules , constituted as here supposed , has at every point three axes of elasticity , at right angles to each other .
2 .
That if these axes be t ; aken as the axes of coordinates , then , in the fundamental equations of motion , deduced as in my paper , we shall have { , rAnyAz } An = 0 , ... ... . .
( 1 .
) and all terms of the same form in like manner = 0 ; so that the equations ( 13 .
) of my paper are reduced to d(t2 d=2{( : r+4rA2)A } I ... ... . .
( 2 .
) d g= " { ( r+ rAZ)aC-J With the equations in this form we easily pursue the investigation of the dispersion formula ; and this condition is , in fact , assumned by M. CAUCHY , by Mr. KELLAND and others , though without explicit reference to the axes of elasticity .
In the case of elliptically polarized light we are obliged to adopt a peculiar method .
We have here to consider not , as in the common case , a rectilinear displacement g , and its resolved parts j , a , ~ , but a curvilinear displacement , which is the result of two virtual rectilinear displacements acting at right angles to each other , and in a plane to which the ray is perpendicular ; and one of which is always retarded behind the other by an interval b , which we consider as an arc less than r. In this case , therefore , we must proceed ( as in my paper ) by making one of the coordinate axes , as x , coincide with the ray , ( or , more correctly and generally , the normal to the wave surface , ) whence e= 0 , A= 0 , &amp;c. The first of the three equations ( 2 .
) disappears , and n , G coincide with the components which give the elliptic motion and are of the forms = oa sin ( nt kx =s sin ( ntkx + b ) ( In pursuing the investigation on the principles now referred to , Mr. LUBBOCK shows that in this case we have always l{a 4rAz Ay sin ( k A x ) } =0 and { ac-rA A zAysin2 ( k ) } =o Thus upon the whole we have ( in my notation ) { faqsin291 O0 fpAq2sin2d } ( = 0 Iq i } l******** l* ( ?
) dedt Hence , following the same investigation as in my former paper* we arrive at formulm corresponding to ( 25 .
) ( 26 .
) ( 27 .
) ( 28 .
) , whence there results , 0= { ap sin 2}0_E { p'sin 2 } l. ( 8 .
) n2 2 { p ' 2 sin2 }J and the formula corresponding to ( 41 .
) gives 0 sin = ... ... ... . .
( 9 .
) Hence , it follows that in the case where the ray coincides with an axis of elasticity , the criterion of elliptic polarization ceases to be applicable .
