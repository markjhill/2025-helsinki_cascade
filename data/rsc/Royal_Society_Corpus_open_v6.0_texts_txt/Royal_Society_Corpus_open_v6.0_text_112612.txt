( Abstract ) .
1 .
The Fovea centralis is a minute circular pit in the inner surface of the retina , made by the radial divergence of the cone-fibres from a central point , by the thinning and the outward curving of the inner retinal layers towards this point , and by the peripheral location of the outer granules belonging to the central cones .
2 .
The inner surface of the retina declines in a rapid uniform curve from the edge to the centre of the fovea , and very gradually from the edge towards the ora retine ; so that the edge of the fovea is the most raised part in the macula lutea , where the retina is thickest , and the centre of the fovea the most depressed part in the macula , where the retina is thinnest .
3 .
At the centre of the fovea , proceeding from the outer to the inner surface of the retina , we meet with the following structures in succession:the bacillary layer and the outer limiting membrane , a small quantity of finely areolated connective tissue , the inner granule-layer and the ganglionic layer very attenuated , a thin granular band containing optic nerve-fibres , and the membrana limitans interna .
