] show important variations from Bouvard 's work , which variations in their important particulars were confirmed by Dr. Hartwig .
Next ( 1885 ) the relative motions of the Pleiades were taken up with a view of tracing gravitational effects in the various members of the group .
This question is not ripe for solving , but it induced heliometer observers to take up the question , and important progress is now being made .
The photometric work detailed in the 'Uranometria Nova Oxon-iensis , ' also published in 1885 , consisted in measuring the light received from all stars visible to the naked eye , to 10 ' south declination , by means of a wedge photometer devised by Professor Pritchard\#151 ; a form of photometer now in the hands of many astronomers .
In the course of this work Professor Pritchard , at his own expense , took an assistant to Egypt to determine the effects of atmospheric absorption in a more constant climate than that of Oxford ; This photometric work has been recognised by the award of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Having fully determined the capacity of photography for accurate measurement , Professor Pritchard next applied it to parallax determinations of stars of the second magnitude .
Some thirty stars altogether have been investigated , and this work is now in the press .
Thirty is a greater number than any other astronomer has attempted .
Professor Pritchard is now working on the International Chart of the Heavens , and taking part in researches to ensure an accurate photometric scale .

John Newport La , F.R.S. Some of the most important of Mr. Langley 's researches have been upon the Physiology and Histology of Secreting Glands .
Extending the observations of Kuhne and Lea on the pancreas , Mr. Langley showed in an elaborate series of researches , extending over the salivary and most of the important secreting glands of the body , that the formation , as a morphological element within the secreting cell , at the expense of its protoplasm , of the material to be used in the secretion is a general function of secreting cells .
The dependence of this function upon the activity of nerves , and upon other forms of excitation , such as the action of drugs , has been greatly elucidated in the course of these researches .
Concurrently with the morphological changes within the cells , the chemical changes which occur within the secretion as the result of nerve activity or inactivity have been investigated , and many important facts brought to light regarding the nature of the action or modifications of the action which may be brought to bear upon the secreting cell through the nervous system .

Biographical notices will be found in the Proceedings .
The work of continuing the \#163 ; Catalogue of Scientific Papers ' is being steadily carried on with the resources at the disposal of the Society , i he Council and the Catalogue Committee have had under serious consideration the means which should be adopted to make the Catalogue as useful and as complete as possible .
The difficulties on nnancial and other grounds are very great , but the Council is resolved to persevere in this most valuable work .
302 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , During the past year , in the mathematical and physical section of the 'Philosophical Transactions , ' eighteen papers have been published , and in the biological section , eleven ; the two sections together containing a total of 1235 pages of letterpress , and 50 plates .
Of the ' Proceedings , ' fourteen numbers have been issued , containing 1223 pages , and 20 plates .
This unusually large bulk is partly accounted for by the publication in the ' Proceedings ' of certain extra matters which the Council deemed likely to interest the Fellows .
One part ( No. 307 ) , which forms an Appendix to Volume L , contains results of the Revision of the Statutes , to which I alluded in my Anniversary Address last year .
It consists of a summary of the Second and Third Charters , and a copy of the Statutes as now revised , followed by an interesting note on the History of the Statutes , which has been drawn up by our Senior Secretary , Professor Michael Foster .
In addition to these matters , the same number contains a complete List of the Portraits and Busts at present in the apartments of the Society , compiled by order of the Library Committee , a work which was much needed , as no such list had been made since Weld 's Catalogue , printed thirty-two years ago .
The new " list " is not a descriptive catalogue , but the names of the painters and donors , and the dates of the gifts , so far as a thorough and somewhat laborious examination of the Council minutes and Journal books has revealed them , are furnished .
The List of Portraits is followed by a full descriptive Catalogue of the Medals at present in the possession of the Society , which has been carefully made by our clerk , Mr. James , under the supervision of the Treasurer .
Another extra number of the 'Proceedings ' ( No. 310 ) is devoted to a First Report of the Water Research Committee on the Present State of our Knowledge concerning the Bacteriology of Water , by Professors Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward .
It contains 96 pages , full of most valuable information regarding the vitality of microorganisms in drinking water , to which in a large measure the spread of Asiatic cholera , typhoid fever , and other zymotic diseases is now known to be due .
In my Presidential Address of last year , I referred to this Water Committee as having been appointed by the Royal Society , in alliance with the London County Council ; and this first instalment of its work seems amply to justify its originators in their expectations of results , most valuable for the public health , from the investigation which has been commenced .
A third extra number ( No. 311 ) contains the Report of the Committee on Colour Vision .
This Committee , from the time of its appointment in March , 18 : 0 , held over thirty meetings , in course of which it examined more than 500 persons as to their colour vision , and tried various methods and many kinds of apparatus for colour President 's Address .

The report of the results of the whole inquiry contains a large mass of most interesting matter , and the Committee 's work ends in a set of practical recommendations , from which we may hope that much benefit will come , in the prevention of inconvenience and disaster liable to be produced by mistake of colour signals , both at sea and on railways .
Mr. Ellis 's communication* to the Royal Society of last May , and Professor Grylls Adams ' communication-)- of June , 1891 , both on the subject of simultaneous magnetic disturbances found by observations at magnetic observatories in different parts of the world ; the award of a Royal medal two years ago to Hertz , for his splendid experimental work on electro-magnetic waves and vibrations ; and Professor Schuster 's communication J to the Royal Society , of June , 1889 , on the " Diurnal Variations of Terrestrial Magnetism justify me in saying a few words on the present occasion regarding terrestrial magnetic storms , and the hypothesis that they are due to magnetic waves emanating from the sun .
Guided by Maxwell 's " electro-magnetic theory of light , " and the undulatory theory of propagation of magnetic force which it includes , we might hope to perfectly overcome a fifty years outstanding difficulty in the way of believing the sun to be the direct cause of magnetic storms in the earth , though hitherto every effort in this direction has been disappointing .
This difficulty is clearly stated by Professor W. G. Adams , in the following sentences , which I quote from his Report to the British Association of 1881 ( p. 469 ) , " On Magnetic Disturbances and Earth Currents " :\#151 ; " Thus we see that the magnetic changes which take place at various points of the earth 's surface at the same instant are so large as to be quite comparable with the earth 's total magnetic force ; and in order that any cause may be a true and sufficient one , it must be capable of producing these changes rapidly .
" 1 The primary difficulty , in fact , is to imagine the sun a variable magnet or electro-magnet , powerful enough to produce at the earth 's distance changes of magnetic force amounting , in extreme cases , to as much as 1/ 20 or 1/ 30 , and frequently , in ordinary magnetic storms , to as much.as 1/ 400 of the undisturbed terrestrial magnetic force .
The earth 's distance from the sun is 228 times the sun 's radius , and the cube of this number is about 12,000,000 .
Hence , if the sun were , as Gilbert found the earth to be , a globular magnet , and if it were of the same average intensity of magnetisation as the earth , we see , according to the known law of magnetic force at a distance , that the magnetic force due to the sun at the earth 's distance from it , in * ' Roy .

'304 Anniversary [ Nov. 30 , any direction , would be only a twelve-millionth of the actual force of terrestrial magnetisation at any point of the earth s surface in a corresponding position relatively to the magnetic axis .
Hence the sun must be a magnet* of not much short of 12,000 times the average intensity of the terrestrial magnet ( a not absolutely inconceivable supposition , as we shall presently see ) to produce , by direct action simply as a magnet , any disturbance of terrestrial magnetic force sensible to the instruments of our magnetic observatories .
Considering probabilities and possibilities as to the history of the earth from its beginning to the present time , I find it unimaginable but that terrestrial magnetism is due to the greatness and the rotation of the earth .
If it is true that terrestrial magnetism is a necessary consequence of the magnitude and the rotation of the earth , other bodies comparable in these qualities with the earth , and comparable also with the earth in respect to material and temperature , such as Venus and Mars , must be magnets comparable in strength with the terrestrial magnet , and they must have poles similar to the earth 's north and south poles on the north and south sides of their equators , because their directions of rotation , as seen from the north side of the ecliptic , are the same as that of the earth .
It seems probable , also , that the sun , because of its great mass and its rotation in the same direction as the earth 's rotation , is a magnet with polarities on the north and south sides of its equator , similar to the terrestrial northern and southern magnetic polarities .
As the sun 's equatorial surface-velocity is nearly four and a half times the earth 's , it seems probable that the average solar magnetic moment exceeds the terrestrial considerably more than according to the proportion of bulk .
Absolutely ignorant as we are regarding the effect of cold solid rotating bodies such as the earth , or Mars , or Venus , or of hot fluid rotating bodies such as the sun , in straining the circumambient ether , we cannot say that the sun might not be 1000 , or 10,000 , or 100,000 times as intense a magnet as the earth .
It is , therefore , a perfectly proper object for investigation to find whether there is , or is not , any disturbance of terrestrial magnetism , such as might be produced by a constant magnet in the sun 's place with its magnetic axis coincident with the sun 's axis of rotation .
Neglecting for the present the seven degrees of obliquity of the sun 's equator , and supposing the axis to be exactly perpendicular to the ecliptic , we have an exceedingly simple ease of magnetic action to be considered : a magnetic force perpendicular to the ecliptic at every part of the earth 's orbit and varying * The moon 's apparent diameter being always nearly the same as the sun 's , the statements of the last four sentences are applicable to the moon as well as to the sun , and are important in connection with speculation as to the cause of the lunar disturbance of terrestrial magnetism , discovered nearly fifty years ago by Kreil and Sabine .

] inversely as the cube of the earth 's distance from the sun .
The components of this force parallel and perpendicular to the earth 's axis are , respectively , 092 and 0 4 of the whole ; of which the former could only be perceived in virtue of the varying distance of the earth from the sun in the course of a year ; while the latter would give rise to a daily variation , the same as would be observed if the red ends of terrestrial magnetic needles were attracted towards an ideal star of declination 0 ' and right ascension 270 ' .
Hence , to discover the disturbances of terrestrial magnetism , if any there are , which are due to direct action of the sun as a magnet , the photographic curves of the three magnetic elements given by each observatory should be analysed for the simple harmonic constituent of annual period and the simple harmonic constituent of period equal to the sidereal day .
We thus have two very simple problems , each of which may be treated with great ease separately by a much simplified application of the principles on which Schuster has treated his much more complex subject , according to Gauss ' theory as to the external or internal origin of the disturbance , and Professor Horace Lamb 's investigation of electric currents induced in the interior of a globe by a varying external magnet .
The sidereal diurnal constituent which forms the subject of the second of these simplified problems is smaller , but not much smaller , than the solar diurnal term which , with the solar semi-diurnal , the solar ter-diurnal , and solar quarter-diurnal constituents , form the subjects of Schuater 's paper .
The conclusion at which he has arrived , that the sour ce of the disturbance is external , is surely an ample reward for the great labour he has bestowed on the investigation hitherto ; and 1 hope he may be induced to undertake the comparatively slight extension of his work which will be required for the separate treatment of the two problems of the sidereal diurnal and the solar annual constituents , and to answer for each the question :\#151 ; Is the source external or internal F But even though external be the answer found in each case , we must not from this alone assume that the cause is direct action of the sun as a magnet .
The largeness of the solar semi-diurnal , ter-diurnaj , and quarter-diurnal constituents found by the harmonic analysis , none of which could be explained by the direct action of the sun as a magnet , demonstrate relatively large action of some other external influence , possibly the electric currents in our atmosphere , which Schuster suggested as a probable cause .
The cause , whatever it may be , for the semidiurnal and higher constituents would also probably have a variation in the solar diurnal period on account of the difference of temperature of night and day , and a sidereal and annual period on account of the difference of temperature between winter and summer .
Even if , what does not seem very probable , we are to be led by the 306 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , analysis to believe that magnetic force of the sun is directly perceptible here on the earth , we are quite certain that this steady force is vastly less in amount than the abruptly varying force which , from the time of my ancestor in the Presidential Chair , Sir Edward Sabine 's , discovery , * forty years ago , of an apparent connexion between sunspots and terrestrial magnetic storms , we have been almost compelled to attribute to disturbing action of some kind at the sun 's surface .
As one of the first evidences of this belief , I may quote the following remarkable sentences from Lord Armstrong 's Presidential Address to the British Association at Newcastle , in 1863 :\#151 ; " The sympathy also which appears to exist between forces operating in the sun and magnetic forces belonging to the earth merits a continuance of that close attention which it has already received from the British Association , and of labours such as General Sabine has , with so much ability and effect , devoted to the elucidation of the subject .
I may here notice that most remarkable phenomenon which was seen by independent observers at two different places , on the 1st of September , 1859 .
A sudden outburst of light , far exceeding the brightness of the sun 's surface , was seen to take place , and sweep like a drifting cloud over a portion of the solar face .
This was attended with magnetic disturbances of unusual intensity , and with exhibitions of aurora of extraordinary brilliancy .
The identical instant at which the effusion of light was observed was recorded by an abrupt and strongly marked deflection in the self-registering instruments at Kew .
The phenomenon as seen was probably only part of what actually took place , for the magnetic storm in the midst of which it occurred commenced before , and continued after , the event .
If conjecture be allowable in sueh a case , we may suppose that this remarkable event had some connexion with the means by which the sun 's heat is renovated .
It is a reasonable supposition that the sun was at that time in the act of receiving a more than usual accession of new energy ; and the theory which assigns the maintenance of its power to cosmical matter , plunging into it with that prodigious velocity which gravitation would impress upon it as it approached to actual contact with the solar orb , would afford an explanation of this sudden exhibition of intensified light , in harmony with the knowledge we have now attained , that arrested motion is represented by equivalent heat .
" It has certainly been a very tempting hypothesis , that quantities of meteoric matter suddenly falling into the sun is the cause , or one of the causes , of those disturbances to which magnetic storms on the earth are due .
We may , indeed , knowing that meteorites do fall into the earth , assume without doubt that much more of them fall , in * Communication to the Royal Society , March 18 , 1852 ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 162 , p. 143 ) , President 's Address .

] the same time , into the sun .
Astronomical reasons , however , led me long ago to conclude that their quantity annually , or per century , or per thousand years , is much too small to supply the energy given out by the sun in heat and light radiated through space , and led me to adopt unqualifiedly Helmholtz 's theory , that work done by gravitation on the shrinking mass is the true source of the sun 's beat , as given out at present , and has been so for several hundred thousand years , or several million years .
It is just possible , however , that the outburst of brightness described by Lord Armstrong may have been due to an extraordinarily great and sudden falling in of meteoric matter , whether direct from extra-planetary space , or from orbital circulation round the sun .
But it seems to me much more probable that it was due to a refreshed brightness produced over a larger area of the surface than usual by brilliantly incandescent fluid rushing up from below , to take the place of matter falling down from the surface , in consequence of being cooled in the regular regime of solar radiation .
It seems , indeed , very improbable that meteors fall in at any time to the sun in sufficient quantity to produce dynamical disturbances at his surface at all comparable with the gigantic storms actually produced by hot fluid rushing up from below , and spreading out over the sun 's surface .
But now let us consider for a moment the work which must be done at the sun to produce a terrestrial magnetic storm .
Take , for example , the magnetic storm of June 25 , 1885 , of which Adams gives particulars in his paper of June , 1891 ( ' Phil. Trans. , ' p. 139 and PI .
9 ) .
We find at eleven places , St. Petersburg , Stony hurst , Wilhelmshaven , Utrecht , Kew , Vienna , Lisbon , San Fernando , Colaba , Batavia , and Melbourne , the horizontal force increased largely from 2 to 2.10 p.m. , and fell at all the places from 2.10 to 3 p.m. , with some rough ups and downs in the interval .
The storm lasted altogether from about noon to 8 p.m. At St. Petersburg , Stonyhurst , and Wilhelm shaven , the horizontal force was above par by 0*00075 , 0*00088 , and 0*00090 ( C.G-.S .
in each case ) at 2.10 p.m. ; and below par by 0*0007 , 0*00066 , 0*00075 at 3 o'clock .
The mean value for all the eleven places was nearly 0*0005 above par at 2h .
10m .
, and 0*0005 below par at 3h .
The photographic curves show changes of somewhat similar amounts following one another very irregularly , but with perfectly simultaneous correspondence at the eleven different stations , through the whole eight hours of the storm .
To produce such changes as these by any possible dynamical action within the sun , or in his atmosphere , the agent must have worked at something like 160 million million million million horse-power* ( 12 x 103* ergs per sec. ) , which is about 364 times the total horse-power ( 3*3 x 1033 ergs per sec. ) of the solar radiation .
Thus , in this eight hours of a * 1 horse power = 7*46 x 109 ergs per second .
Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , not very severe magnetic storm , as much work must have been done by the sun in sending magnetic waves out in all directions through space as he actually does in four months of his regular heat and light .
This result , it seems to me , is absolutely conclusive against the supposition that terrestrial magnetic storms are due to magnetic action of the sun ; or to any kind of dynamical action taking place within the sun , or in connexion with hurricanes in his atmosphere , or anywhere near the sun outside .
It seems as if we may also be forced to conclude that the supposed connexion between magnetic storms and sun-spots is unreal , and that the seeming agreement between the periods has been a mere coincidence .
We are certainly far from having any reasonable explanation of any of the magnetic phenomena of the earth ; whether the fact that the earth is a magnet ; that its magnetism changes vastly , as it does from century to century ; that it has somewhat regular and periodic annual , solar diurnal , lunar diurnal , and sidereal diurnal variations ; and ( as marvellous as the secular variation ) that it is subject to magnetic storms .
The more marvellous , and , for the present inexplicable , all these subjects are , the more exciting becomes the pursuit of investigations which must , sooner or later , reward those who persevere in the work .
We have at present two good and sure connexions between magnetic storms and other phenomena : the aurora above , and the earth currents below , are certainly in full working sympathy with magnetic storms .
In this respect the latter part of Mr. Ellis 's paper is of special interest , and it is to be hoped that the Greenwich observations of earth currents will be brought thoroughly into relation with the theory of Schuster and Lamb , extended , as indeed Professor Schuster promised to extend it , to include not merely the periodic diurnal variations , but the irregular sudden changes of magnetic force taking place within any short time of a magnetic storm .
In my Presidential Address of last year I referred to the action of the International Geodetic Union , on the motion of Professor Foerster , of Berlin , to send an astronomical expedition to Honolulu for the purpose of naaking a twelve months ' series of observations on latitude , corresponding to twelve months ' simultaneous observations to be made in European observatories ; and I was enabled , through the kindness of Professor Foerster , to announce as a preliminary result , derived from the first three months of the observations , that the latitude had increased during that time by ^ sec. at Berlin , and had decreased at Honolulu by almost exactly the same amount .
The proposed year 's observations , begun in Honolulu on the 1st of June , 1891 , were completed by Dr. Marcuse , and an elaborate reduction of them by the permanent Committee of the International Geodetic Union was published a month ago at Berlin .
The results are in President 's A ddress .
1892 .
] splendid agreement with those of the European observatories : Berlin , Prag , and Strasbourg .
They prove beyond all question that between May , 1891 , and June , 1892 , the latitude of each of the three European observatories was a maximum , and of Honolulu a minimum , in the beginning of October , 1891 : that the latitude of the European observatories was a minimum , and of Honolulu a maximum , near the beginning of May , 1892 : and that the variations during the year followed somewhat approximately , simple harmonic law as if for a period of 385 days , with range of about \#163 ; sec. above and below the mean latitude in each case .
This is just what would result from motion of the north and south polar ends of the earth 's instantaneous axis of rotation , in circles on the earth 's surface of 7*5 metres radius , at the rate of once round in 385 days .
Sometime previously it had been found by Mr. S. C. Chandler that the irregular variations of latitude which had been discovered in different observatories during the last 15 years seemed to follow a period of about 427 days , instead of the 306 days given by Peters ' and Maxwell 's dynamical theory , on the supposition of the earth being wholly a rigid body .
And now , the German observations , although not giving so long a period as Chandler 's , quite confirm the result that , whatever approximation to following a period there is , in the variations of latitude , it is a period largely exceeding the old estimate of 306 days .
Newcomb , in a letter which I received from him last December , gave , what seems to me to be , undoubtedly , the true explanation of this apparent discrepance from dynamical theory , attributing it to elastic yielding of the earth as a whole .
He added a suggestion , specially interesting to myself , that investigation of periodic variations of latitude may prove to be the best means of determining approximately the rigidity of the earth .
As it is , we have now , for the first time , what seems to be a quite decisive demonstration of elastic yielding in the earth as a whole , under the influence of a deforming force , whether of centrifugal force round a varying axis , as in the present case , or of tide-generating influences of the sun and moon with reference to which I first raised the question of elastic yielding of the earth 's material many years ago .
The present year 's great advance in geological dynamics forms the subject of a contribution by Newcomb to the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , ' of last March .
In a later paper , published in the 4 Astronomische Naehrichten , ' he examines records of many observatories , both of Europe and America , from 1865 to the present time , and finds decisive evidence that from 1865 to 1890 the variations of latitude were much less than they have been during the past year , and seeming to show that an augmentation took place , somewhat suddenly , about the year 1890 .

[ Nov. 30 , When we consider how much water falls on Europe and Asia during a month or two of rainy season , and how many weeks or months must pass before it gets to the sea , and where it has been in the interval , and what has become of the air from which it fell , we need not wonder that the distance of the earth 's axis of equilibrium of centrifugal force from the instantaneous axis of rotation should often vary* by 5 or 10 metres in the course of a few weeks or months .
We can scarcely expect , indeed , that the variation found by the International Geodetic Union during the year beginning June , 1891 , should recur periodically for even as much as one or two or three times of the seeming period of 385 days .
One of the most important scientific events of the past year has been Barnard 's discovery , on the 9th of September , of a new satellite to Jupiter .
On account of the extreme faintness of the object , it has not been observed anywhere except at the Lick Observatory in California .
There , at an elevation of 4500 ft. , with an atmosphere of great purity , and with a superb refractor of 36 " aperture , they have advantages not obtainable elsewhere .
The new satellite is about 112,000 miles distant from Jupiter , and its periodic time is about 11 h. 50 m. Mr. Barnard concludes a short statement of his discovery with the following sentences :\#151 ; " It will thus be seen that this new satellite makes two revolutions in one day , and that its periodic time about the planet is less than two hours longer than the axial rotation of Jupiter .
Excepting the inner satellite of Mars , it is the most rapidly revolving satellite known .
When sufficient observations have been obtained , it will afford a new and independent determination of the mass of Jupiter .
Of course , from what I have said in reference to the difficulty of seeing the new satellite , it will be apparent that the most powerful telescopes of the world only will show it " ( dated Mount Hamilton , September 21 , 1892 ) .
Sir Robert Ball , in calling my attention to it , remarks that " it is by far the most striking addition to the solar system since the discovery of the satellites to Mars in 1877 .
" To all of us it is most interesting that during this year , when we are all sympathising with the University of Padua in its celebration of the third centenary of its acquisition of Galileo as a Professor , we have first gained the knowledge of a fifth satellite in addition to the four discovered by Galileo .

Copley Medal .
Rudolph Virchow . .
Professor Virchow 's eminent services to science are known throughout the world , and they are far too varied and numerous for enumeration .
He survives Schwann , Henle , and the other pioneers in several branches of natural history who came from the school of Johannes Muller , and at the present time occupies a position of influence and honour equal to that of his great contemporaries Helmholtz , Ludwig , and Du Bois-Reymond .
His contributions to the study of morbid anatomy have thrown light upon the diseases of every part of the body , * but the broad and philosophical view he has taken of the processes of pathology has done more thaD his most brilliant observations to make the science of disease .
In histology he has the chief merit of the classification into epithelial organs , connective tissues , and the higher and more specialised muscle and nerve .
He also demonstrated the presence of neuroglia in the brain and spinal cord , and discovered crystalline hasmatoidine , and the true structure of the umbilical cord .
In pathology , strictly so called , his two great achievements\#151 ; the detection of the cellular activity which lies at the bottom of all morbid as well as normal physiological processes , and the classification of the important group of new growths on a natural histological basis\#151 ; have each of them not only made an epoch in medicine , but have been the occasion of fresh extension of science by other labourers .
In ethnological and archaeological science Professor Virchow has made observations which only the greatness of his other work has thrown into the shade ; and , so far from confining himself to technical labours , he has been known since he migrated to Wurzburg and returned to Berlin as a public-spirited , far-seeing , and enlightened politician.f Universally honoured and personally esteemed by most of the leading pathologists in this country , as well as on the Continent and in America , who had the good fortune to be his pupils , Professor Virchow is a worthy successor of the many illustrious men of science to whom the Copley Medal has been awarded .
* Among these may be mentioned his discovery of leucaemia , of lardaceous degeneration , and glioma ; his reconstruction of the kind of tumour known as sarcoma , and his establishment of the important group of granulomata .
t A short pamphlet , " Ueber die Nationale Bedeutung der Ifaturwissenschaften , ' ' may be mentioned as characteristic of the patriotism , the fairness , and the broad judgment of the author .
[ Nov. 30 , Anniversary Meeting* Rumfobd Medal .
Nils C. Duner , Director of the Observatory of Lund .
Dr. Duner has been continuously at work , since 1871 , at astronomical observations ( see 'R.S .
Catalogue ' ) .
He began to turn his attention to spectroscopic subjects in 1878 , and commenced the publication of his systematic work on Stellar Spectra in 1882 .
In 1884 he brought to a conclusion his wonderful observations of stars of Vogel 's III Class .
His .memoir contains a detailed study of the spectra of nearly 400 stars , all which are the most difficult objects to observe .
This volume is one of the foundations on which any future work in this direction must be based .
In 1891 he published another series of researches on the rotation of the sun , comparing true solar with telluric lines for regions up to 75 ' of solar latitude .
The result showed a diminution of angular velocity with increasing latitude , thus spectroscopically confirming Carrington 's results .
Royal Medal .
Professor Charles Pritchard , D.D. , F.B.S. , Director of the Oxford University Observatory .
Professor Pritchard began his publications on astronomical subjects in 1852 .
His first paper and several others which have followed , have dealt with the construction of object glasses and telescope adjustments .
He was President of the Royal Astronomical Society in the years 1867 and 1868 .
He was appointed first Director of the newly-founded observatory at Oxford in 1874 .
It is now the most active University observatory in the kingdom , as many as fifteen students receiving instruction in observatory work at times .
The services he has rendered to astronomy in devising , and keeping at a high standard , the work of the observatory in many directions , including its use as a school , are very noteworthy .
Immediately on the establishment of the observatory he saw the beneficial effects of photographic investigation , and first applied the method , with the old wet-plate photography , to the problem of the physical libration of the moon .
He saw that this problem was encumbered in heliometric work by the fact that a set of the observations must take a considerable time , and therefore they were made on a constantly changing disc , necessitating great labour in reduction .
By the observations being made in two or three seconds , the picture of the moon did not alter in the time .
The result was to President 's Address ' .

] show important variations from Bouvard 's work , which variations in their important particulars were confirmed by Dr. Hartwig .
Next ( 1885 ) the relative motions of the Pleiades were taken up with a view of tracing gravitational effects in the various members of the group .
This question is not ripe for solving , but it induced heliometer observers to take up the question , and important progress is now being made .
The photometric work detailed in the ' Uranometria Nova Oxon-iensis , ' also published in 1885 , consisted in measuring the light received from all stars visible to the naked eye , to 10 ' south declination , by means of a wedge photometer devised by Professor Pritchard\#151 ; a form of photometer now in the hands of many astronomers .
In the course of this work Professor Pritchard , at his own expense , took an assistant to Egypt to determine the effects of atmospheric absorption in a more constant climate than that of Oxford .
This photometric work has been recognised by the award of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Having fully determined the capacity of photography for accurate measurement , Professor Pritchard next applied it to parallax determinations of stars of the second magnitude .
Some thirty stars altogether have been investigated , and this work is now in the press .
Thirty is a greater number than any other astronomer has attempted .
Professor Pritchard is now working on the International Chart of the Heavens , and taking part in researches to ensure an accurate photometric scale .
Royal Medal .
John , Newport Langley , F.R.8 .
Some of the most important of Mr. Langley 's researches have been upon the Physiology and Histology of Secreting Glands .
Extending the observations of Kuhne and Lea on the pancreas , Mr. Langley showed in an elaborate series of researches , extending over the salivary and most of the important secreting glands of the body , that the formation , as a morphological element within the secreting cell , at the expense of its protoplasm , of the material to be used in the secretion is a general function of secreting cells .
The dependence of this function upon the activity of nerves , and upon other forms of excitation , such as the action of drugs , has been greatly elucidated in the course of these researches .
Concurrently with the morphological changes within the cells , the chemical changes which occur within the secretion as the result of nerve activity or inactivity have been investigated , and many important facts brought to light regarding the nature of the action or modifications of the action which may be .brought to bear upon the secreting cell through the nervous system ; 314 Anniversary Meeting .
[ Nov. 30 , These researches are published partly in the ' Philosophical Transactions , ' and partly in a long series of articles in the ' Journal of Physiology , ' which have extended over several years .
It is not too much to say that these researches of Mr. Langley upon secreting glands give him a claim to occupy the highest rank as a physiological investigator .
The other most important researches which Mr. Langley has published have been\#151 ; ( 1 .
) Upon the central nervous system , including especially an investigation into the anatomical changes which result from central lesions ; ( 2 .
) Upon the sympathetic nervous system , and particularly a number of researches , based upon physiological methods , into its peripheral distribution to involuntary muscle and glands .
Mr. Langley 's eminence in those branches of physiology to which he has mainly devoted his attention is universally admitted , and has been publicly recognised by his having been requested more than once by international assemblies of physiologists to investigate and report on difficult cases submitted to them ( vide ' Transactions of the International Medical Congress , ' 1881 , and ' Proceedings of the Physiological Congress at Basel , ' 1890 ) .
Davy Medal .
Frangois Marie Baoult , of Grenoble , Correspondent of the Academy of Sciences .
The accounts of Professor ftaoult 's researches on the freezing points of solutions , and on the vapour pressures of solutions , form a long series of papers which have appeared from time to time in the ' Comptes Etendus ' and ' Annales de Chimie , ' from 1871 down to the present time .
Our previous knowledge of these subjects was only fragmentary and disjointed , but he has placed it on a new footing , and established general laws relating to the depression of the freezing points and lowering of the vapour pressures of liquids holding other substances in solution .
These laws are of great importance , both to chemistry and physics .
Their validity is not disputed , and , while theories of solution are much discussed , it is acknowledged that no theory can stand which does not satisfy the conditions which Raoult , by an induction from a very large number of observations on a great variety of substances , has shown to be the order of nature .
Darwin Medal .
Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker , Although the regulations relating to the award of this medal direct that it is to be treated rather as a means of encouraging young naturalists to fresh exertion than as a reward for the life-long labours Election of Council and Officers .
1892 .
] of the veteran , there would seem to be a special appropriateness in awarding it to one who was intimately associated with Mr. Darwin in the preparation of the ' Origin of Species .
' That no one was more closely associated than Sir J. D. Hooker with Mr. Darwin in the work is abundantly proved by the following passage in the introduction to the ' Origin of Species ' " I cannot , however , let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr. Hooker , who , for the last fifteen years ( 1844-59 ) , has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment .
" The Statutes relating to the election of Council and Officers were then read , and Sir Erasmus Ommanney and Mr. Symons , having been , with the consent of the Society , nominated Scrutators , the votes of the Fellows present were taken , and the following were declared duly elected as Council and Officers for the ensuing year President\#151 ; The Lord Kelvin , D.C.L. , LL.
