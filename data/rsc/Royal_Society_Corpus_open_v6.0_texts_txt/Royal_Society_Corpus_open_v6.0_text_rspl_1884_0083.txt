" Note on a preliminary Comparison between the Dates of Cyclonic Storms in Great Britain and those of Magnetic !
Disturbances at the Kew Observatory .
" By Balfour Stewart , M.A. , LL. D. , F.R.S. , and Wm. Lant Carpenter , B.A. , B.Sc. Received February 11 , 1885 .
We took the dates of thirty storms from Mr. Scott 's paper entitled " The Equinoctial Gales ; do they occur in the British Isles ?
" in the " Quarterly Journal of the Meteorological Society " for October , 1884 , and by the kindness of Mr. Whipple , of the Kew Observatory , were enabled to make the comparison mentioned above .
Out of these thirty storms , in twenty-three cases there is a distinct magnetic disturbance , for the most part preceding the storm by somewhat more than a day .
We do not , however , imagine that we have thus proved the fact of such a connexion , but think the results we have attained sufficient to justify us in pursuing the subject .

Introduction , In a letter to me , dated March 29 , 1854 , the late Dr. W. Bird Herapath enclosed for me some iridescent crystals of chlorate of potash , which he thought were worth my examination .
He noticed the intense brilliancy of the colour of the reflected light , the change of tint with the angle of incidence , and the apparent absence of polarisation in the colour seen by reflection .
The crystals were thin and fragile , and rather small .
I did not see how the colour was produced , but I took for granted that it must he
