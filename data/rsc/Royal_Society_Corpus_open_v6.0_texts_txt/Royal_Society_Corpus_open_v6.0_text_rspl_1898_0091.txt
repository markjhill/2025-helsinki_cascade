Densities of " Atmospheric \amp ; c. the quick movement which may be regarded as an irregularly recurring reflex that doubtless has among its objects the renewal of moisture on the corneal surface , which otherwise would become dry .
This natural blinking movement seems in the monkey not to employ the orbital portion of the orbicularis J'palpebrarum , but only the palpebral .
It occurs habitually as a bilateral and symmetrical movement .
It is far less extensive in action than the closure of the palpebral opening , which ensues when the monkey grimaces on being threatened with a blow .
That in the blinking the contraction of the palpebral part of the orbicularis is not however the whole of the muscular mechanism at play , is clear from the fact , that in the awake and active animal with fully opened eyes , the blinking still remains bilateral , subsequent to section of the facialis nerves of one side .
The blinking by the right eye was of course normal in character .
As the right eye blinked , the upper lid of the left eye quickly dropped three to four millimetres over the globus of that side , and was then synchronously with the lifting of the right upper lid lifted again .
The left lower lid was not on any occasion detected to move at all .
The quick fall of the upper lid of the left eye must have been due under these circumstances to inhibition of the tonus of the left levator palpebrte superioris muscle .
This brings the co-ordination of the reaction into line with that which I have described for other movements under the term reciprocal innervation .
It is interesting that Panas , Sappey , Fuchs , Wilmart and others , who have carefully and particularly studied the mechanism of the closure of the eye , have not attributed any share to an inhibition of the levator palpebrae ; one physician , however , Dr. Lor , of Brussels , has argued that in the closure of the human eye such an inhibition does under certain circumstances occur .
" Note on the Densities of ' Atmospheric Nitrogen/ Pure Nitrogen , and Argon .

M. A. Leduc in a recent paper* has discussed the relation between the density of argon , its proportion in atmospheric nitrogen , the den-f y o the alter , and that of pure nitrogen .
It appears to me that he has misunderstood some of the data given by Lord Rayleigh , Dr. c las , and myself ; .and as the question whether the found density of argon corresponds with that calculable from the other data , is in itself SocietyreSting 'ne ' 1 haVe the h'nour to Present this note to the * " Beeherches sir les Gaz , " 'Ann .

Densities of " Atmospheric Nitrogen , " \amp ; c. The data may be divided into two groups : those of Leduc and Schloesing ; and those of Rayleigh , Ramsay , and Kellas .
From the first group it is possible to calculate the density of argon , , i.e. , the crude mixture left after separating oxygen and nitrogen from air .
From the second group , the density of argon may be calculated ; or if that be assumed , both groups give data for the calculation of that of " atmospheric " nitrogen .
It has been thought better to express the results in the form of the weight of one litre of the gas in question ; but if it is desired to state them with reference to the density of oxygen = 16 , the conversion may be made by means of the weight of a litre of oxygen according to both Lord Rayleigh and M. Leduc .
The data are as follows :\#151 ; Weight of 1 litre of Leduc .

Weight of 1 litre argon calculated from Rayleigh 's and Kellas 's figures :\#151 ; 0-01186\#174 ; = 1*25718-(1*25092x0*98814 ) ; hence\#174 ; = 1*7791 .
The difference from the value found is 13 in 10,000 .
Both of these results are quite satisfactory , considering that the-nature of the calculation involves a ratio of small differences .
The agreement is more striking if the density of " atmospheric " nitrogen is calculated from the figures ; for this calculation , the weight of 1 litre of argon is assumed to be 1*7815 grams .
Weight of 1 litre of " atmospheric " nitrogen from Leducs and Schloesing 's figures :\#151 ; x = ( 1-7815 x0*01183 ) + ( 1*25070x0*98817 ) ; whence\#174 ; = 1*25698 .
Here the difference is only 2 in 125,000 .
From Lord Rayleigh 's and Dr. Kellas 's figures , we have x = ( 1-7815x0*01186 ) + ( 1*25092 x0*98814 ) ; whence \#174 ; = 1*25721 .
The difference here is only 3 in 125,000 .

183 It is thus evident that either set of figures gives results as concordant as could be wished ; and that the density of " atmospheric " nitrogen is correctly given as the mean of the densities of the constituents , taken in the proportion in which they occur .

Received December 12 , \#151 ; Read December 15 , 1898 .
In the memoir on Argon , a new constituent of the atmosphere , * by Lord Rayleigh and one of us , reasons are adduced on pages 235 and 236 in favour of the supposition that argon is an element , or a mixture of elements ; and on page 236 , the following words occur:\#151 ; " There is evidence both for and against the hypothesis that argon is a mixture , for , owing to Mr. Crookes 's ' observations of the dual character of its spectrum ; against , because of Professor Olszewski 's statement that it has a definite melting point , a definite boiling point , and a definite critical temperature and pressure ; and because on compressing the gas in presence of its liquid , pressure remains sensibly constant until all gas has condensed to liquid .
The latter experiments are the well known criteria of a pure substance ; the former is not known with certainty to be characteristic of a mixture .
" And on pages 257-259 of the same volume , it is shown by Professor Sydney Young and one of us , that the ratios between the boiling points of argon and benzene , Argon and alcohol , and argon and oxygen on the absolute scale are such that it is possible kto compute the boiling points of argon at different pressures with very considerable accuracy .
We therefore draw the conclusion:\#151 ; " It is hardly likely , though not impossible , that so good an agreement would be obtained with a mixture or an impure substance .
It is , at any rate , certain that a distinct want of agreement would have shown that argon was not a definite , pure substance , and the results may be taken as affording additional confirmation of the conclusion that argon is a definite , hitherto unknown constituent of the atmosphere , and that it has been isolated in a state very closely approaching to purity .
" The density of a sample of argon prepared by means of magnesium was found by one of us to be 19'941 ( 0 = 16 ) ; and a much larger preparation by Lord Rayleigh , obtained by exposing a mixture of air and oxygen to an electric flame in presence of caustic soda , possessed the density 19'94 .
Supposing argon to be a simple substance , and not a mixture , the atomic weight would therefore be 39'88 .
An attempt was made by Dr. J. Norman Collie and one of us to effect a separation * 'Phil .
