( Abstract .
) In a paper published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1861 , p. 69 , Mr. W. H. L. Russell has constructed systems of multiplication and division for functions of certain non-commutative symbols , viz. p= , and 7r=x _- , and has given the quotient and remainder after both " 'internal " and " external division " of the symbolical function Pn0U(7r ) +P9t'l0njl(7)+. .
)O( ) by the factor pi , ( rr)-)0(7r ) .
But in the case of , ( p ) n+~ S(p ) -1+. .
1 o , p ) he has given only the quotient and remainder after internal division in the case of n=3 .
I have here investigated the general case .
The formulae will be best understood by reference to the memoir itself .
