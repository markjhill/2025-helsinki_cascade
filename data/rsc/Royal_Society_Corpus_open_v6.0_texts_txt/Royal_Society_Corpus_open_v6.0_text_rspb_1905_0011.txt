Two Cases of Trichromic Vision* By F. W. Edridge-Green , M.D. , F.B.C.S. ( Communicated by Dr. F. W. Mott , F.R.S. Deceived January 24 , \#151 ; Dead February 23 , 1905 .

One case ( Professor J. J. Thomson ) sees only three colours in the bright spectrum\#151 ; red , green , and violet .
He can distinguish nothing of the nature of pure yellow , like the sensation given him by the sodium flame in the spectrum .
There is no definite colour to him at the portion of the spectrum where the normal sighted see pure blue .
Beddish-green would describe the orange and yellow regions and greenish-violet the blue .
5950 ( orange-yellow ) is the point which differs most from red and green .
There was no shortening of either end of the spectrum .
The point of junction of the red and green differed somewhat in repeating the observations because of his great sensitiveness to simultaneous contrast .
It was , however , always in the orange or orange-yellow , never in the yellow of the normal sighted .
Difference of Hue Perception.\#151 ; I then tested him with my apparatus for ascertaining the size of different par-ts of the spectrum which appear monochromatic , and found that he was defective in distinguishing differences of hue .
A portion of the spectrum corresponding to the D lines , and isolated by two shutters in the eye-piece of the spectroscope , was first shown .
The shutter on the red side was gradually opened until a difference of hue was seen .
The monochromatic patch extended from X 5889 to X 6052 , beiug exactly half as large again as that of the normal sighted , which occupies the space from X 5889 to X 5998 .
The monochromatic patch he called greenish-yellow .
His monochromatic patch in the centre of the green bore exactly the same proportion to mine as in the case of the orange-yellow , being just half as large again .
Colour Mixtures.\#151 ; He was then tested with Rayleigh 's apparatus for matching spectral yellow by a mixture of red and green .
0 of the scale corresponded to pure red , 25 or 90 ' to pure green .
He made the following 10 matches:\#151 ; \amp ; If 0 : ei fc i 01 !

My match appeared to him bright red and bright green , the yellow appearing as green .
The match appeared more correct through a pin hole .
The mixed colour of his match always appeared green to me .
It will be noticed that his average difference is very nearly three times the amount of mine .
On comparing the differences , according to the colour which was shown first , it will be found that these were all positive when the green was shown first , and four out of the five were negative when he commenced with the red .

[ Jan. 24 , He seemed to get very easily fatigued with colours .
Classification Test.\#151 ; Called I ( orange ) " reddish-orange , " and matched it with orange and dark yellows .
Described II ( violet ) as mauve , and put with it violets and purples .
Named III ( red ) correctly , and picked out various reds to go with it .
Called IV ( blue-green ) " green , " and matched it with some greens .
Only a few colours were selected in each case .
On being asked to pick out all the yellows he chose those with orange in them .
He regarded orange-yellow as his yellow and rejected pure yellows because he said that they had green in them .
He had considerable difficulty in matching the colours .
In common with the cases I have previously observed , the effects of simultaneous contrast were much more marked than in the normal sighted .
Two wools changed colour to him on being contrasted , when no change was evident to me .
This was particularly noticeable when one of the contrasted colours was either red , green , or violet , and the other one of the intermediate and adjacent colours .
Lantern Test.\#151 ; He correctly named the red , green , and violet with and without the neutral glasses , and saw them at the normal distance .
He had difficulty with yellow and blue .
He called pure yellow " greenish-yellow .
" It will be noticed that the examination with the spectrum gives a key to the mistakes made .

The other case is that of Mr. P. S. Barlow , B.Sc. , a research student in the Cavendish Laboratory .
He sees three colours in the spectrum-red , green , and violet .
The red gradually passes into the green , and red-green would describe this region and green-violet that of the blue .
He sees no yellow or blue in the spectrum .
When I put the pointer in the yellow he said it was in the green .
He gave 6892 three times out of four as the junction of the red and green , the fourth time X 5950 .
Both are in the orange-yellow .
He selected X 4800 ( blue ) as the point of union of the green and violet .
He was very sensitive to simultaneous contrast .
When shown the violet first he put the junction of the green and violet at X 4861 ; when shown the green first at X 4740 .
There was no shortening of either end of the spectrum .
Difference of Hue Perception.\#151 ; He was tested in the same way as Professor Thomson .
He also called the orange-yellow patch " yellow-green , " and I had to increase the size of the patch until it was half as large again ( X 5889 to X 6052 ) as that of the normal sighted before a difference was seen .
I examined him in the same way with the other colours of the spectrum , and found that in every part he marked out a much larger monochromatic patch than the normal sighted .

Colour Mixtures.\#151 ; He was then tested with Rayleigh 's apparatus .
On being shown my match he said that the yellow was green and the mixed colour salmon pink .
He said that the yellow of my match was too dark , and in order to make a match , as far as luminosity was concerned , he had to increase the brightness of the yellow .
No match was then possible to me .

The other colours he named correctly .
Classification Test.\#151 ; I he designated " golden yellow " and matched it with orange .
II he called " purple " and put with it violets and purples .
Ill he said was " crimson " and sorted out a few reds to go with it .
IV he named " blue " and matched with greens and blues .
Many colours were omitted .
He called yellow " yellow-green .
" He chose orange-yellow for yellow .
He found great difficulty with blue and green .
Ladies have several times told him of mistakes in this respect .
On being shown IY ( blue-green ) a second time , he said that it was " pure green without a trace of blue .
" Simultaneous contrast was very strongly marked .
I use the term trichromic as a statement of the fact that persons having this vision see only three colours in the bright spectrum , whilst the normal sighted see six , and may , therefore , be designated It is 198 The Colour-Physiology of the Higher Crustacea .
probable that the appearance of the bright spectrum to the trichromic is very similar to that of a spectrum of feeble luminosity to the normal sighted , in which only three colours\#151 ; red , green , and violet\#151 ; are seen .
The i defective difference perception which is found in these cases accounts for most of the facts .
Both these cases are bordering on the tetrachromic , as : the sodium flame appears to give rise to a distinct sensation .

) ( Abstract .
) 1 .
The chromatophores of Hippolyte and Crangon are multicellular structures .
Their branches show differentiation into a firmer ectoplasm and a more fluid mobile endoplasm in which the pigment occurs .
2 .
The formation of the pigments in the larval and post-larval chromatophores is described .
3 .
In addition to pigments , fat , in the form of colourless globules , occurs in the chromatophores of Hiypolyte .
This fat lies in special cells of the chromatophore , and exhibits a mobility similar to that of the pigments of the chromatophore .
4 .
If fed and kept in the dark , or if starved and kept in the light , loses little of its chromatophoric fat .
Depletion of fat occurs , however , in starved , dark-kept , animals .
These , when exposed to sunlight for five or six hours , show fat in their chromatophores .
These results show that the colourless chromatophoric fat is a reserve food material , and point to the conclusion that in the accumulation of this reserve fat , light plays an important part .
5 .
At the time of settling on the weeds of the sea-shore , Hippolyte variant is a colourless or faintly brown-striped animal .
At this stage it is extremely sensitive to the light conditions of its environment , assuming the colour of its surroundings within 24 hours .
If the environment be changed , sympathetic change of colour takes place in three days .
Half- and full-grown Hippolyte are less susceptible .
With them sympathetic colour-change occupies a week or more .
