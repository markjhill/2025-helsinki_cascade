A Receipt for the Curing of Castorium , according to the method used in Russia .
TAke the Beaver Stones and get the Milk out of them as clear as you can , then set upon the Fire a Skillet or Kettle with water , big enough to contain the quantity of Stones you have to cure : let the water Boil , and put into it half a shovel full of clean Wood Ashes , then the the Stones together in couples and put them into the water , and let them Boil therein for half a quarter of an Hour .
Then take some Birch-Bark and lay it on the Fire , and let the Stones be well smoaked over it for the space of an hour , until they are well dried in the smoke ; then hang them up in a Kitchen or in the Air for a week or more , until they are perfectly dry and hard , after which they may be packed up in a Cask or otherwise for Transportation .
If there be more Stones than will conveniently go into the Skillet or Kettle , you may make another boiling of them , and add a proportion of fresh Ashes and order them as before .
