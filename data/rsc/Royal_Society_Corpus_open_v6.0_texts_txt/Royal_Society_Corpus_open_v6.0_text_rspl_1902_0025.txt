Report of Absolute Magnetic [ Apr. 12 ; perature coefficients are much smaller in each case .
With the exceptiojfl of carbonate of soda and chrome alum , all the other hydrated salts have ^ a coefficient of expansion not differing greatly from that of ice at low L temperatures .
Generally , the densities of the compressed blocks of different bodies agreed well with the results of other observers , but r my potash alum had only a density of 1-614 , whereas Playfair'and Joule give 1*781 .
It will be noted that iodoform is a highly expan- t sive body like iodine , and that oxalate of methyl has nearly as great i a coefficient as paraffin , which is one of the most expansive solids .
The correcting factor was used for paraffin , naphthalin , chloral hydrate , i iodoform , and sodium .
All weights are in grammes .
It will be possible by cooling the moulds with liquid air during the I process of hydraulic compression , to produce cylindrical blocks of solid j bodies of lower melting-points than any given in this investigation , '\#166 ; such as alcohol , ether , nitrous oxide , ammonia , chlorine , \amp ; c. , and to j ascertain their coefficients of expansion in the solid state between the individual melting-points and the boiling-point of liquid air .
This method , which works well with liquid oxygen or air , fails when applied to liquid hydrogen , as the density of the liquid is too small ( apart from other difficulties ) to give accurate values of the weights of fluid displaced .
For temperatures about 20 ' absolute , recourse must be had to measurements of the coefficient of linear expansion , and such observations could only be applied with ease to metallic bodies and alloys , " Eeport of Absolute Magnetic Observations at the Valencia Observatory ( Cahirciveen , co .

As far back as 1887 the late Professor FitzGerald , of Trinity College , Dublin , expressed a desire for a series of magnetic observations to be made in Ireland , ' when the writer offered to undertake the work if he was provided with instruments , and obtained the consent of the Meteorological Council .
This was done , and an old pattern unifilar by Jones , with a dip circle by Barrow , being loaned by Trinity College , experimental observations were commenced in a wooden hut erected in the Observatory grounds in Valencia Island , with funds supplied by the Eoyal Irish Academy , The result of the first few years of this series was published in the ' Proceedings of the Eoyal Irish Academy , ' and the observations were continued until the end of 1896 .
The observatory was removed in 1892 to Cahirciveen , about 4 miles eastward .

*w nn use was being made of these observations , and T Scffikge requiring their instruments , Professor FitzGerald came Blb/ conclufion to terminate the wort , and the observations aecord-Lt Zed Soon after enquiries were made for them , and very ^tg expression of their value given , with a desire for their continu-tZ Acting on such weighty opinion , he determined to put the observations on a business and permanent basis by .obtaining a set o modem instruments , and a fund to endow the work .
Enough was collected in Ireland to ensure the observer a small annual honoranu .
TOh a new set of instrument , examined at Kew ObserW he present series of observations was commenced in January , 1899 , original wooden observing house erected in the 1 e nor o Obfervatory , 90 yards from that building .
A radway rims east and west aboutf 50 yards north of the hut , and five light trains pass each wav daily , but these do not appear to materially affect e magne whilst observing .
The observing house being copper-fastened , wit^ iron down-pipe , this is the only magnetic interference likely to affect thInd !
termimng the position of the hut , consideration was given to obtaining a satisfactory fixed mark , visible from the 'bl and the down-pipe of a school house about 1 imle north .
of the Observatory was decided upon , as being the property of the Board of Works and likely to be permanent .
Not having the " ea"s ' ' ing sufficiently accurate time for a sun 's transit , the orientation_of this mark was determined by taking three series of observations ofeq\#153 ; altitudes of the sun by means of a transit theodolite lent by Kew Observatory for the purpose ; the mean of these was taken , and t e value 19 ' 46 ' 0 " W. used in the reduction of the decimation observaThe observatory is situated on an arm of Valencia harbour co .

The dip circle is also by Dover , No. 118 ; it was also examined and I P*Fot the^conveilience of observing , the two middle days of each month have been adhered to throughout ; the declination being observed about 10 a.m. Greenwich ( local time 41 mins , later ) , the actual mean time for the three years being 10.9 A.M. The mean time of the inclination observations is for the morning 11.45 A.M. , and for the afternoon 1.25 P.M. , these being ma e on succeeding days with two needles , which give unusually consistent results , the mean of each of the three years showing an excess in JNo .

The meridian of the circle is determined in January of each year , the value so obtained being used throughout the current year .
The intensity observations are made in the usual manner of vibrations and deflections , the same magnet being used as in the declination observations .
Two observations are made on the same day , one before noon ( 11 A.M. ) , and the other afternoon ( 3 P.M. ) , so that the mean time of the two observations used in calculating the forces is ^ which very nearly agrees with the mean ' time for the inclination , with which they are combined in the formulae ( Y.F = H F x tan inclin .
) and ( T.F. = H.F. x sec. inclin .
) .
The strength of the magnet considerably diminished during the first year , which may be attributed to its want of age ; the magnetic moment ( m ) falling in 1899 from 770 to 728 units ; in 1900 to 714 ; and in 1901 to 700 , a decrease which will probably become less each year .
The value of P ( distribution of magnetism ) in the reductions is calculated for the yearly series in 1899 being 8*2 ; 1900 , 7*0 ; and in 1901 , 7-5 .
