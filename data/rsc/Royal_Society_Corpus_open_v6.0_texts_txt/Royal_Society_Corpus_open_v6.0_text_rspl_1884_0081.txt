( Abstract .
) The author having previously shown ( " Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science , " vol. xvi\#151 ; New Series ) , that a laminated appearance is produced in hyaline cartilage by imbibition of nitrate of silver , now shows that the same lamellated structure may be observed in sections of fresh cartilage stained by Bismarck brown , and that the lamellae , as brought under observation by both methods , have approximately the same thickness and general arrangement .
It seems certain that the matrix of hyaline cartilage is formed by a series of lamellae superposed over each other , their general arrangement being parallel to the free surface of the cartilage .
Adjoining the zone of ossification , the lamellae are seen to be very distinctly separated from each other , and at this part their continuity is interrupted by the large spaces which correspond to the position of the cells .
