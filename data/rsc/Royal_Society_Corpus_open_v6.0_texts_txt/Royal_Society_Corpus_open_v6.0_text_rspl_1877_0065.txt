Report of the Kew Committee .
Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending October 31 , 1877 .
The Committee would commence their Report with the expression of heir heartfelt regret at the decease of Mr. J. P. Gassiot , who had been , ince 1851 , among the most active Members of the successive Kew Com-nittees , first of the British Association , and latterly of the Royal Society , dr .
Gassiot had not only devoted freely to the management of Kew Observatory a large portion of his valuable time , but also had , in 1871 , most nunificently endowed the establishment with the sum of \#163 ; 10,000 Italian Irrigation Stock , for the purpose of maintaining in a state of thorough ifficiency the self-recording observations in terrestrial magnetism and in meteorology .
Committee.\#151 ; The Committee is constituted as follows :\#151 ; General Sir E. Sabine , K.C.B. , Chairman .
Mr. De La Rue , Vice-Chairman .
Capt. Evans .
Mr. E. Galton .
Vice-Adm .
Sir G. H. Richards .
The Earl of Rosse .
Mr. R. H. Scott .
Lieut.-General W. J. Smythe .
Lieut.-General Strachey .
Mr. E. Walker .
j Mr. R. H. Scott , at his own request , has been for the future relieved of the duties of Hon. Secretary , which he has performed ever since the Observatory came under the management of the Royal Society , and the duties of that post will be in future discharged by the Superintendent .
% Magnetic Worlc.\#151 ; The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year .
The declination instrument was slightly deranged for a short period by the presence of some extremely minute organic fibres between the mirrors .
In accordance with the usual practice , determinations of the scale-values of all the instruments were made in the first week of the new year .
K The inconvenience occasionally experienced by the dropping , on to the Magnetographs , of water condensed in the smoke-tubes over the gas-burners has been obviated by the attachment of suitable catch-bottles .
462 Report of the Kew Committee .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been continued as usual by Mr. Eigg , and the results are given in the Tables ' appended to this Eeport .
A re-determination of the moment of inertia of ' the magnet KC1 was made in October ; the value accorded with the previously found amount .
A paper " On the Temperature-correction and Induction-coefficients of Magnets , " as determined in the results of various experiments at the * Observatory , was read before the Eoyal Society , and printed in vol. xxvi .
of the ' Proceedings .
' Sir Edward Sabine having brought the discussion of the Magnetical Observations carried on under his superintendence to a close in a final i " Contribution , " presented to the Eoyal Society ( No. XV .
, Phil. Trans , *\#187 ; vol. 167 ) , represented to the War Office that he was able to dispense with the further services of the two Sergeants of the Eoyal Artillery who : had acted as his clerks .
These men were in consequence withdrawn on the 31st of March .
The documents deposited in Sir E. Sabine 's late office have been pre- It sented by the " War Office " to the " Eoyal Society , " and , in conformity f\amp ; , with instructions received from the Council , will be retained in the cus-tody of the Observatory .
A detailed list of these documents and papers % is now in course of preparation .
The tabulation of the magnetic curves , which was suspended at the * time of writing the last Eeport , has been resumed , and Tables of the Declination have been completed as far as December 31st , 1876 .
At the request of Prof. Balfour Stewart , the range of the declination- \ needle has been determined for every day during the years 1858-73 inclusive .
The results have been discussed by him in a paper read before the Eoyal Society , March 22 , 1877 , entitled , " On the Variations of the Daily Eange of the Magnetic Declination as recorded at the Kew Observatory , " Proc. Eoy .
Soc. vol. xxvi .
In addition , magnetic data have been supplied to Dr. Atkinson , Prof. M'Leod , - the Hydrographic Department , Messrs. Gee , Grove , and Groenman .
The officers attached to the late Arctic Expedition have visited the Observatory , and made several sets of observations with the instruments j % employed by them on their voyage , Kew being the base station to which all their observations are referred .
The Committee have received , with great satisfaction , a communication from Mr. E. Ellery , E.E.S. , of the Melbourne Observatory , in which he states that , in deference to the opinions elicited by the circular of the Kew Committee from the chief authorities on terrestrial magnetism , as explained in last Eeport , the Government of Victoria has furnished funds for the erection of a new Magnetic Observatory at Melbourne .
Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of pressure , temperature , humidity , n l(l M L pi Report of the Kew .
463 ind ( direction and velocity ) , and rain have been maintained in regular peration under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by T. Gunter , 'he daily standard eye-observations for the control of the automatic ecords have been made regularly , as well as daily observations in con-exion with the Washington synchronous system .
The Observatories of the Meteorological Council at Aberdeen , Armagh , 'almouth , Glasgow , Stonyhurst , and Valencia have been visited by Mr. Whipple , and their instruments inspected .
The examination and checking of the work of the self-recording Obser-atories of the Meteorological Committee was discontinued in November 1876 , and the scales and appliances used in the work returned to the Meteorological Office .
Mr. Aldridge , an assistant engaged in the work , accepted an appointment from the Meteorological Committee .
Mr. Har-ison is employed at Kew , subject to the condition that he may be at any ime sent to any of the Observatories to relieve the officer in charge in as of illness or other cause , if required by the Meteorological Council So do so .
The tabulation of the Kew meteorological traces is performed )y Mr. Hawkesworth .
This change of arrangements has involved a considerable reduction in she amount allowed by the Meteorological Office to Kew , as its central Observatory .
This sum is now \lt ; \#163 ; 150 , instead of \lt ; \#163 ; 400 , as heretofore .
' Electrograph.\#151 ; The cause of derangement of this instrument having been apparently removed , by dismounting and thoroughly cleaning it , its action has been fairly satisfactory throughout the year .
Considerable difficulty has been experienced at times in maintaining the astern of the water-dropping collector in a sufficiently insulated condition .
The substitution of a set of Varley 's telegraph insulators for the ebonite supports previously used has been attended with good results .
The tabulation of the curves obtained from this instrument has not yet been commenced .
An instrument having been constructed for the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , similar to the one at Kew , certain minor alterations in the details have been introduced which Mr. Whipple 's experience has suggested .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures , as noticed in former Reports , has been steadily carried on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose .
I The rate of progress has been somewhat slow during the past year , owing to the enormous number of spots visible on the sun s surface during the ( maximum ) year ( 1870 ) now under discussion .
On several days , recently measured , more than 150 spots have had their positions determined .
Mr. Marth is still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric elements .
464 Report of the Kew Committee .
All of these operations have been conducted at the expense of Mr. De La Rue .
The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily by Mr. Harrison , when possible , as described in the Report for 1872 , in order , for the present , to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
Extra Observations.\#151 ; The Solar-radiation Thermometers are still observed daily .
The Campbell Sundial , described in the 1875 Report , continues in action , and the improved form of the instrument , giving a separate record for every day of the duration of sunshine , has been regularly worked throughout the year and its curves tabulated .
Wind Component Integrator.\#151 ; The Wind Component Integrator , an instrument which automatically resolves the velocity of the wind into its rectangular components , which was exhibited by Prof , von Oettingen , of Dorpat , at the recent Loan Exhibition , having been lent by the Guarantors of that Exhibition to the Meteorological Council , has been erected in the sun-room of the Observatory at their expense .
The instrument has been temporarily attached to the existing anemograph , and its gearing so modified as to enable it to print from type-wheels on a strip of paper the number of miles of wind passing over the building from the north , east , south , and west during every half-hour* .
At the request of the Editor of the ' Times , ' a copy of the traces of the self-recording instruments on a reduced scale , together with an epitome of the general features of the weather , is now prepared .
This is published every week in that journal , the cost to the Observatory being defrayed by the proprietors .
Verifications.\#151 ; This branch of the work of the Observatory has been carried on with considerable success as usual .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified:\#151 ; A set of Magnetographs for the Batavia Observatory .
" " " Potsdam Observatory .
A Collimator Magnet for Dr. van der- Stok .

The new Cathetometer has received some slight additions tending to improve its usefulness .
One Theodolite , three Sextants , and a Clinometer have been verified .
Experiments have been made with the new Deep-sea Sounding Thermometer , invented by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra ; and the Committee have under consideration the construction of an apparatus for the purpose of verifying this class of instrument under varying hydraulic pressure .
A system has also been organized for etching a " Hall-mark , " c^Op as in the annexed figure , upon all Thermometers which have ( p^ | been verified .
A pantagraph has been purchased for the purpose of engraving this mark and a register number upon the instruments .
The old " Royal Society " Standard Barometer , constructed by Newman in 1837 , under the direction of Mr. Bailey , which has been in a defective condition since its removal from the Society 's Rooms in Somerset House in 1857 , having been lent to the Kew Committee by the Council of the Royal Society for one year , has been thoroughly repaired and both its tubes refilled , and is now erected at the Observatory , with a view of making a lengthened series of comparisons with the two normal Barometers of the establishment .
Comparison of Standard Barometers.\#151 ; The Astronomer Royal having courteously offered the Committee every facility for a suggested comparison between the Greenwich and Kew Standard Barometers during April and May last , a number of carefully selected Portable Standard Barometers were conveyed to and fro between Greenwich and Kew on three separate occasions , and a large number of comparative readings were obtained by the Superintendent and Messrs. Baker and Foster .
A complete detailed account of the experiment has been drawn up , and will be laid before the Royal Society .
A determination has been made of the daily range of the Thermometer at Kew for the past twenty-one years , viz. 1855-75 , inclusive .
The results have been discussed by Prof. Balfour Stewart , and embodied by him in a paper " On the Variations of the Daily Range of Atmospheric Temperature as recorded at the Kew Observatory , " Proc. Roy .

APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. Long. 0h lm 15s* 1 W. , for the year October 1876 to September 1877 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K Cl , and the Kew 9-inch IJnifilar Magnetometer by Jones , the property of the Magnetic Office , directed by General Sir E. Sabine .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3| inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the units in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English values to metric value being 0*46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.Gr .
S. measure are also given .
The value of log 7r2K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60 ' .
The induction-coefficient fi is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature tQ to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' Fahr. is 0*0001194(\lt ; 0 \#151 ; 35)+0*000,000,213 ( \#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 ft. and 1*3 ft. , are 1*000075 ft. and 1*300097 ft. respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 dr 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
