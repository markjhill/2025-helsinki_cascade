On the Enumeration of x-edra having Triedral Summits , and an ( xI)-gonal Base .
By the Rev. THOMAS P. KIRKMAN , M.A. Communicated by A. CAYLEY , F.R.S. Received June 13 , -Read June 21 , 1855 .
IT is easily proved that no x-edron has a face of more than xangles , and that , if it has an ( x1)-gonal face , it has at least two triangular faces .
The object of this paper is to determine the number of x-edra which have an ( xl)-gonal face , and all their summits triedral , or , which is the same thing , the number of x-acra which have an ( x-l)-edral summit , and all their faces triangular .
We may call the ( x-l)-gonal face the base of the x-edron .
All the faces will be collateral with that base , and k of them will be triangular faces .
If we suppose those k triangles to become infinitely small , in any x-edron A , we have as the result an ( x-k)-edron B , having only triedral summits , none of whose triangular faces was a triangle of A. And it is evident that there is only one ( x--k)-edron B from which A can be cut by sections that shall remove no edge entirely , and shall leave untouched no triangle of B. It is plain also that B cannot have more , but may have fewer , triangles than A ; for if the vanishing of a triangle of A gave rise to two triangles in B , B , having two contiguous triangles , and all its summits triedral , would be a tetraedron .
If now we suppose the triangular faces of B to vanish , of which there must at least be two , there will arise a polyedron C , having only triedral summits , and fewet faces than B. In like manner C is reduced by the vanishing of its triangles to a solid of still fewer faces , and , by this continual evanescence of triangular faces , we shall finally arrive , either at a tetraedron , or a pentaedron with two triangular faces .
Hence it appears , that every x-edron having its base ( xl)-gonal , and all its summits triedral , can be cut from one of these two simple solids , by reversing the above process , i. e. by cutting away k summits of the base of a polyedron B , having k-h triangular faces , so as to leave none of those k-h triangles untouched .
And by this process no polyedron A can be twice generated .
It is to be remembered that we are all through handling no polyedra but those whose summits are all triedral .
The pentaedron on a 4-lateral base , has around that base the faces 3434 .
This I call a doubly reversible polyedron , as it exhibits in the faces about the base the series 34 repeated , and reads backwards and forwards the same .
If we cut every base sumnmit of the tetraedron , we obtain a heptaedron having around its hexagonal base the faces 353535 .
This I call a trebly reversible heptaedron .
3 2 If we cut a summit of either triangle of the pentaedron , we obtain the system 35344 about the pentagonal base .
This is a reversible hexaedron .
By cutting the first triangle of this with the pentagon and the second with the adjoining quadrilateral , we obtain the system 4364354 , which I call an irreversible octaedron ; it does not read backwards and forwards the same .
The double reversible 3434 , by one section of its triangles , becomes 435435 , a double irreversible , and by another , 436344 , a reversible heptaedron .
And the system 353535 gives , by cutting the triangles in one way , the irreversible 437346345 , and , in another way , the trebly irreversible 436436436 .
These six varieties comprise all the polyedra that have only triedral summits .
They are all irreversible , reversible , doubly irreversible , doubly reversible , trebly irreversible , or trebly reversible .
For if any polyedron exthibited in the faces about the base the fourfold repetition of any period of m faces containing k triangles , the vanishing of the 4k triangles would give rise to a fourfold repetition of a period of m--k faces , which would contain k ' triangles , k ' being not more than k ; an(i this system around the base would reduce , by the vanishing of the 4k ' triangles in it , to a fourfold repetition of a period of m-k-k ' faces ; and we should obtain at last a base of 4(m-K ) sides , admitting no further reduction by the vanishing of triangles , i. e. we should obtain a pyramid having a tetraedral summit ; which is impossible .
Problem.-An x-edron P being given on an x 1-gonal base , and having k triangular faces , it is required to determine how many ( x+k+l)-edra can be cut from it by the removal of k+l base summits , so that none of the k triangles shall remain untouched , and so that no ( x+k+l)-edron shall be the reflected image of any other .
k* &gt; ( x--1 ) , and k+l &gt; xx1 .
We are bound to cut each of the k triangles once , which can be done in 2k ways , giving 2k different irreversible arrangements of x+k--1 faces .
Next we have to cut I of the remaining x 1-k angles about the base of P. These may be any I out of x--l-k , and this gives us 2k ( -- ) arrangements of our k+l sections .
But these will not be all different arrangements .
Any one of them will contain e cases of twice cut triangles of P , thus made into e pentagons , and consequently I-e triangles which are not cut from triangles .
Let us suppose e=2 , the case in which two pentagons are newly made , standingthus , ... c353de353f ... Of these four triangles , two were introduced in the distribution of our k sections , 40( ) and two others in that of the I sections , which may happen in 22 different ways .
This arrangement , c353de353f , in which cdef are supposed not to be triangles , will then be found 22 times with every disposition of the remaining k-2 triangles first cut , and with every ( 1-2 ) sections of angles not in triangles , of which angles the number is x1 2k .
We have therefore counted the completed arrangement ... c353de353f ... , in the number 2k ( --k)1f+ 22 2k-2 ( x2k)-1 ties 12 2+ 1 times , instead of 2k-2 ( x2k)l')tim2es .
rk -2+ The same error has been made with every value of e &gt; k , and eFl , or e &gt; the least of k and 1 , and this with every set of e twice cut triangles that can be selected out of k. Hence there is an error made in excess , in 2k , of ( 2e 1).2 i+l ( e ' for every value of e1P the least of k and 1 ; for , in supposing e twice cut triangles , we assume that e &gt; k , and that k+l-k4 &lt; e. The number required in the problem is thus proved to be ( x-k-)1 -i ( x-1_--2 -e1 ke"1- " 2 ( k l 1+l _2.(2-1)2-e + l-e 'e e ' for all positive values of e not greater than either k or 1 : which was to be found .
This function I shall denote by the symbol ii.(x , k , 1 ) .
It expresses the number of ( x+k+l)-edra that can be made from any x-edron having an ( x--l)-gonal base and k triangular faces , of which no two are contiguous , by removing k+l of the summits about the base , so that no edge shall be entirely removed , and that no one of the k triangles shall remain untouched .
Of course k+l : &gt; x--1 .
Its values are ii(x , k , 0)=2k ; ii(cx , k , 1)=21(2x-3k-2 ) ; ( x-2)11-1 ( x-3)1-11-1 ii(x,1 , 1)=-2 .
-2 ~( )lii( , k , 2)-2k .
( -3 ) ( x-4)-1k.1-1.-2 -1 ii(x , 2 , 1 ) =4 .
( -4 ( S( )- &amp;c. &amp;c. Let I(x , k ) be the total number of irreversible x-edra on an x-l-gonal base that have k triangular faces .
Then I(x , k){ii.(x , k , 1 ) } , part of I(x+k+l , k+l ) , is the whole number of ( x+-k+l)-edra that can be cut , from irreversible x-edra having k triangles , so as to have k+l triangles .
Others can be cut to be also part of 401 .
I(x+k+l , k+l ) , from other x-edra having k ' triangles , by removing k'+l ' summits about the base , none of the k ' triangles being untouched , if k'+l'=k+l .
Next let our sublject of operation be an irreversible containing more than one period of faces about the base .
If it be a doubly irreversible , the base will be 2x-gonal , as every face will be opposite to a similar one .
We have then two periods each of x faces , and if we operate on one of these so as to renmove angles , leaving no triangle in the period untouched , and then repeat the operation exactly in order in the other period , we shall obtain a doubly irreversible for our result .
Let 12(2x+1 , 2k ) be the whole number of doubly irreversible ( 2x+l)-edra on a 2x-gonal base , having 2k triangles .
Then ii.(x+ , k , ) is the number of ways in which we can remove k+ summits from one period , and therefore 2(2x+ 1 , 2k)ii x+ , k , part of 1(2x+l +2k+l , 2k+l ) , is the whole number of doubly irreversibles having 2k+l triangles , and a ( 21x+2k+l)gonal base , that can be cut from all the I2(2x+1 , 2k ) polyedra before us .
If I is not an even number , ii( + , k , ) is to be considered nothing ; for it is impossible to remove a fractional number of summits .
We can cut also from these 2 .
( 2x+1 , 2k ) doubly irreversibles a number of singly irreversibles .
If each of these doubly irreversibles were single , it would give rise to ii(2x+ 1 , 2k , 1 ) singly irreversibles ; but the double character of the subject of operation causes every method of removing 2k+ tangles , which is not alike in both perioids of the subject , to appear twice in the number just written .
That is , we are to subtract from this number all the doubly irreversibles that can be made , and take half the remainder , which is , after division , ii(2x+l , 2k , 1 ) -iix1(5+l , k , The second term of this is zero when I is odd .
We obtain thus for the number of singly irreversibles that can be cut to have 2k+l triangles from all the 12(2x+1 , 2k ) under consideration , P.(2x+,1 , 2k ) .
2{ii(2x+l , 2k , 1)--ii(+l , k , )a part of I(2x+ 1 +2k+1 , 2k+1 ) .
Next let us consider the operations that can be effected on triply irreversible ( 3x+1)-edra having 3k triangles .
Let their number be I3(3x+l , 3k ) .
It is easily proved by a repetition of the preceding argument , that ii( +l , k , ) is the number of triply irreversibles that can be cut from each of them , and that ii(3x+ 1 , 3k , 1)-ii(x+l , k , / ) } 402 is that of the singly irreversibles , where the appearance of a fraction in the function ii , reduces it , as it always must , to zero .
That is , we obtain P(3x-+1 , 3k).ii(x+1 , k , t ) , as 3P.(3x+3k+l+1 , 3k+l ) , and P(3x+1 , 3k ) ?
ii(3x+l , 3k , 1)-ii x(+- , k , as a portion of I(3x+3k+l+ 1 3k+l ) .
From an irreversible no reversible can be cut by this removing of summits ; for as the summits of triangles of a reversible correspond in pairs , the arrangement of faces about the base will still be reversible , if all the triangles are supposed to vanish .
Let us now operate on a reversible polyedron , whose faces about the base read backwards and forwards alike .
There will be a certain period abc ... ..klm reversed , in one of the three ways , abc ... .klrnlk ... .
cb , abc ... .
klmmlk ... .
cb , or abc ... .klmmlk ... .cba .
There is in any of these what : may be called an axis of reversion , which in the first passes through the faces a and m , in the second through a and between two m 's , in the third between two a 's and between two m 's .
It is evident that the number of triangles about the base of a reversible cannot be odd , unless the axis of lreversion passes through a triangle ; as all faces recur in order reversed , through which that axis does not pass ; and the base must be ( 2x+ l)-gonal , if the axis passes through one face only .
The third case , of an axis of reversion passing through no face , does not occur when all the summits are triedral .
First let the base be even , and let the number of triangles be even also ; we have to consider the operations practicable upon a ( 2x+ l)-edron R reversible , with 2k triangles .
Some ( 2x+ +-2k+l)-edra can be cut from it reversible , and some irreversible , by the remnoving of 2k+1l summits of the base , leaving none of the 2k triangles untouched .
A reversible so cut will have on either side of its axis of reversion half the 2k+1 added triangles , unless it passes through an added triangle , in which case it will have on either side ( 2k+l1 ) of them .
Let 1=21 ' ; then the number of possible operations on one side of the axis of reversion , which exhibits x summits , is ii(x , k , 11 ) ; each of which gives by repeating it backwards one of our reversible ( 2x+l +2k+21')-edra .
As the axis does not pass through a summit , I cannot be odd , for the added triangles are all in pairs .
If then R(2x+ 1 , 2k ) be the total number of reversible ( 2x+ l)-edra having 2k triangles , we obtain R(2x+1 , 2k).ii(x , k , ) , part of R(2x+1 +2k+l , 2k+l ) .
403 Now take the reversible ( 2x+1)-edron R ' having 2k+1 triangles ; the axis of reversion passes through one of them .
As this triangle cannot be untouched , it must be twice touched , so that we have only ( 2k+1+--2 ) other sections to make , one half of these on the x-1 summits on one side of the axis , neglecting the summit of the central triangle .
The possible operations are../ k -2 or , if R(2x+ 1 , 2k+ 1 ) be the total number of reverlsible ( 2r+ 1 )-edra having 2k+ triangles , we obtain R(2x+ 1 , 2k+ l)ii(x , k , 12 ) , part of R(2x+2+2k+l , 2k+ 1 +1 ) .
We take now a reversible R " having a ( 2x-l)-gonal base , and 2k triangles .
The axis of reversion passes through a summit and through a face , which we shall suppose to be not a triangle .
It is not difficult to prove that it can be no triangle if 2x1 &gt; 3 , all the summits being triedral .
We have on either side of the axis 1(2x-2 ) summits , that in the axis being neglected , and half the 2k triangles .
We have to distribute k+I sections on these x-summits .
The number of ways to do it is ii , k3\ which requires I to be even ; or if I be odd , we may cut the summit in the axis , and distribute k+sections on the x--1 summits , giving ii(x , k , 2 ) .
These operations reversed on the other side of the axis give us all the possible results .
If then R(2x , 2k ) be the total number of reversible 2x-edra having 2k triangles , we can cut from all these R(2x , 2k)ii(x k , +ii ( x , k,1 ) } ( 2x+2k+l)-edra reversible , having 2k+l triangles .
One of the terms in the second factor is always zero .
The polyedra so cut are a portion of R('2x+2k+l , 2k+l ) .
When k+l=v-1 , all the angles about the base of the reversible with k triangles are cut , and the result is of necessity reversible .
But if k+l &lt; x1 , some of the results of k+l sections will be irreversible .
The whole number of results , if we treated the n-edron R or R ' oI R " as irreversible , would be ii(n , k , 1 ) , but these are not all different .
They will all , except the reversible ones , have a different order on the two sides of the axis of reversion ; and each irreversible will occur twice , the second time reverted by exchanging the arrangements of the two sides of the axis , so as to make a polyedron and its reflected image .
As we are not to count these reflexions , we have to 404 subtract from ii(n , k , 1 ) all the possible reversible results , and divide the remainder by two .
That is , by what precedes , we obtain from R , R ' and R " { ii(2x+1l , 2k , 1 ) -ii(x , k , -I { ii(2x+ l , 2k+1 , l ) -ii( , k , -2 ) } ii(2x , 2k , 1)-ii( , k , 2 -ii( , k , -1 ) } It is to be understood in these formulae that 2k+1 &lt; 2x in the first , 2k+ + l &lt; 2x in the second , 2k+l &lt; 2x-1 in the third .
If we multiply the first by R(2x+l , 2k ) , the second by R(2x+1 , 2k+1 ) , and the third by R(2x , 2k ) , we obtain the corresponding portions of 1(2x+1 +2k+l , 2k+,1 ) I(2x+2+2k+l , 2k+l+l ) , and I(2x+2k+1 , 2k+1 ) .
Let us next operate on a doubly reversible ( 4x+l)-edron , with 4k triangles .
All these are cut from the pentaedron 3434 , and by the addition of an even number of triangles in each period .
The operations by which doubly reversibles are cut from a doubly reversible are simply those whereby reversibles are cut from the reversible period of 2x summits , containing 2k triangles , being in number ii(x+1 , k , 4 ) by what has preceded .
Or , if R2(4x+1 , 4k ) be the number of ( 4x+1)-edra doubly reversible , with 4k triangles , R2(4x+l , 4k).ii .
x+1 , k , )=R2(4(x+k)+l+l , 4k+l ) , there being no more ; for one of these latter can be cut from nothing but a doubly reversible with 4k+1 faces fewer .
From the same ( 4x+1)-edra can be cut doubly irreversibles , namely so many as the irreversibles producible from sections of one period , or from a reversible ( 2x+l)-edron with 2k triangles .
This number is , as just proved , 2 i2i(2x+ 1 , 2k , )-ii(+ ] k , 4 which multiplied by R2.(4x+ 1 , 4k ) , constitutes a portion of I2.(4x+4k+l+l , 4k+1 ) .
As a doubly reversible is also a reversible , reversibles can be cut from it .
It is to be observed that , as a reversible , it has two axes of reversion , as indeed every 2m-ly reversible has .
Thus the enneaedron 35363536 has an axis through the two pentagons and another through the hexagons .
If we operate on one side of the axis for irreversible results , and revert our operations on the other side , we obtain reversibles .
The number of such results in either position of the axis of reversion is that of the irreversibles producible by ( 2k+)sections of a reversible ( 2x+l)-.gon with 2k triangles , or I(2xr+l 1 , 2k , 2-i(i+ l , k 4 ) ; whence we obtain , from both positions of the axis , R2.(4x + 4k).ii(2.x+1 , 2k , 1 , 2 ) } as part of R(4x+1+4k+l , 4k+1 ) .
If we forget for a ttmoment the character of one of these R(4m+ 1 , 4k ) , and treat it as an irreversible , we obtain by 4k+1 sections ii(4m+1 , 4k , 1 ) results .
Of these the doubly reversibles can occur only once , every doubly irreversible will occur twice , in one result as the reflexion of the other ; every reversible will occur twice , the operations in the first period in the second result being ' those of the second period in the first ; and every irreversible will occur four times , twice by the exchange of the operations on the first period for those on the second , and twice again by the reversion of all the operations , producing reflected images of two preceding results .
That is , if we subtract from ii(4x+l1 , 4k , 1 ) all the doubly reversibles , twice the reversibles , and twice the doubly reversibles that can be cut from a doubly reversible ( 4x+ I)-gon havitig 4k triangles , by 4k+1 sections , thetre remains four times the nutnber of irreversibles that can be cut from it , by 4k+1 sections .
This remainder , divided by 4 , is 4ii(4x+l , 4k , I)-(x+1 k , -2ii(2+l,2k , 2ii(x+ , k , -{ii(2+l , 2k -2-i ( + ] ' , I ) } ] =Lii(4x+1 , 4k , 1)+2ii(x+1 , k , -3zi 2x+1 2k , which , multiplied by R2(4x l1 , 4k ) , is to be added to 1(4+ l +4k+l , 4k+1 ) .
It ernemains that we handle now trebly reversible ( 6x+ 1)-ed ra , having 6k triangles .
If x &gt; 1 , the number of triangles in a triply reversible cannot be less than 6k , as they are all cut from the heptaedi'on 535353 , by an even number of sections in every period .
By operating on one reversible period of 2x summits and 2k triangles for reversilles by -(6k+31 ) sections , we obtain all the triply reversibles .
The number of these so found is ii.(x+l , k , 1 ) , giving so many ( 6x+l+6kA31)-edra triply reversible with 6k+31 triangles , for each subject ; and in all R3(6x+l , 6k ) ( ii(x+l , k , =R(6k+ +6k+3l , 6k+31 ) .
The number of triply irteversibles is equal to that of the irreversibles producible 406 from a reversible period of 2x summits and 2k triangles by 1(6k+31 ) sections , and is , by what precedes , { ii(2x+l , 2k , l)-ii(x+l , k , / ) } from each subject of operation .
This , multiplied by R'(6x+1,6k ) , is to be added to I3(6x+ 1+6k1 31 , 6k+31 ) .
The reversibles obtainable from a triply irreversible are found only about one axis of reversion .
Thus 735373537353 has only one axis through a heptagon and a pentagon .
We are to cut by -(6k-+2l ) sections on one side of this axis all possible irreversibles from a reversible system of 3x summits and 3k triangles .
These results reverted on the other side of the axis , will give all possible reversibles .
Among these will be all triply reversible ( 6x+ 1 +6k+21)-edra , with 6k+21 triangles , for these are all reversible ; and none of these can occur more than once .
We have these to subtract from our results , leaving ii(3x+I , 3k , 1)-ii(x+l , k , - ) reversibles from every subject ; which number , multiplied by R3(6x+l , 6k ) , forms part of R(6x+1+6k+21 , 6k+21 ) .
If we treated a triply reversible as an irreversible by 6k+1 sections , we should obtain ii(6x+1 , 6k , l ) results .
Among these every triply reversible is found once ; every triply irreversible twice , one place showing the reflected image of the other ; every reversible three times , each time the same operations commencing at a different period ; and every irreversible six times , being begun both backwards and forwards in three different periods .
If then we subtract from ii(6x+ 1 , 6k , 1 ) every triply reversible , twice the triply irrevisibles , and thrice the reversibles that can be made by 6k+1 sections of a triply reversible ( 6x+ l)-edron having 6k triangles , there will remain six times the number of irreversibles that can be so cut from the same .
This remainder , after division by 6 , is { ii(6x+1 , 67I 1)-ii(+1 k , 6 ) -ii(2+,1 , 2k , 3 +ii+ , X+ , ) -3ii ( 3x+ 1 , 3k , +3iix1 , k , =--6ii(6x+l , 6k , 1)+3ii(--+1 , k , )--ii2+1 , 2k , )-3ii(3+1 , 3k , - ) } , which , multiplied by R(6x+ 1 , 6k ) , forms part of I(6x+ 1 +6k+l , 6k+l ) .
It is most convenient to treat the case of the triply reversible having only three triangles by itself .
From this heptaedron can be cut one triply reversible by cutting every summit of the base .
One triply irreversible only can be made , a decaedron , by cutting each triangle once .
Two reversibles can be cut , by four sections , 3H2 407 differing in the manner of cutting the triangle through which the axis of reversion does not pass , giving two reversible 1 1-edra .
Three irtreversibles can be cut from it , one by three , another by four , a third by five sections , as is evident on a moment 's consideration , giving a 10-edron , 11-edron , and 12-edron .
We can now collect into one group all the formulae above deduced , which contain the complete solution of our problemn ; to find the number of these x-edra on an ( x-l )-gonal base .
There is no ambiguity in the case of two ( xI)-gonal faces , for the figure is always identical with itself whichever be considered the base , and can have only two triangles .
Let II(x , k , 1 ) or IR(x , k , I ) be the number of irreversible ( x+k+l)-edra that can be cut to have ( k+l ) triangles from an irrieversible or reversible x-edron having k triangles , the capital on the right denoting the subject of operation : ( k+l ) &lt; x.

To show the use of these equations , we can easily by trial verify the following : R3(4 , 3)=1 , R2(5,2)=1 , R(6,2 ) =1 , R(7 , 2 ) 1 , R3(7 , 3)=1 , 12(7 , 2 ) =1 , R(8 , 2)=2 , 1(8 , 2 ) =1 , 1(8 , 3 ) =1 , R(9 , 3 ) =2 , R(9 , 2 ) =2 , R2(9 , 4)=1 , 1(9,3 ) =3 , 1(9 , 2 ) =2 , 2(9 , 2 ) =2 ; then to find the decaedra on a 9-gonal base , with only triedral summits , we first write down the classes , R(10 , 2)=R(8 , 2 ) , RR(8 , 2 , 0 ) ; 1(10 , 2 ) =R(8 , 2).IR(8 , 2 , 0)+I(8 , 2).II(8 , 2 , 0 ) ; 1(10 , 3 ) =R(7 , 3).IR3(7 , 3 , 0)+R(7 , 2).IR(7 , 2 , 1)+2(7 , 2).I2(7 , 2 , 1 ) ; I3(10 , 3 ) =R3(7 , 3).I3R3(7 , 3 , 0 ) ; R(10 , 4)=R(6 , 2).RR(6 , 2 , 2 ) ; I(10 , 4 ) =R(6 , 2).IR(6 , 2 , 2 ) .
That is , by what precedes , R(10 , 2)=2.ii(4 , 1 , 0)=2.2=4 ; I(10 , 2 ) =2 .
{ ii(8 , 2 , 0)--ii(4 , 1 , 0 ) ) =2.-({4-2 =2 ; I(10 , 3 ) = 1.6ii(7 , 3 , 0)-ii(3 , 1 , 0)}+1.ii(7 , 2,1)+1.ii(7 , 2 , 1 ) : =6{8-2}+2+ =13 ; P(10 , 3)= 1.I= 1 , ; R(10 , 4)= 1.ii(3 , 1 , I)= 1 .
( 6-5)= 1 ; I(10 , 4 ) 1.-ii(6 , 2 , 2)ii(3 , 1 , 1)}= 1.{72-108+41-1}=--2 .
409 Next to find the hendecaedra , we write down I(11 , 5 ) =R(6 , 2).IR(6 , 2 , 3)=0 ; R(11 , 5)--R(6 , 2).RR(6 , 2 , 3 ) ; R(11 , 4 ) =R(7 , 2).RR(7 , 2 , 2)+R3(7 , 3).RR3(7 , 3 , 1 ) ; I(11 , 4 ) =R(7 , 2).IR(7 , 2 , 2)+I2(7 , 2).II2(7 , 2 , 2)+R3(7 , 3).IR3(7 , 3 , 1 ) ; I2(11 , 4)=-2(7 , 2).I2I2(7 , 2 , 2 ) ; R( 1 , 3)= R(8 , 2 ) .

1(8 , 2 , 1)+I(8 , 3).II(8 , 3 , 0 ) ; R(11 , 2 ) R(9 , 2 ) .

122(9 , 2 , 0 ) .
That isR(11 , 5)=1.ii(3 , 1 , 1 ) =1 ; R(11 , 4)=1.ii(4 , 1 , 1)+1.2 5 ; 1(11 , 4 ) =-1.~ii(7 , 2 , 2)-ii4 , 1 , 1 ) } +1 . ?

{ ii(9 , 2 , 0)-ii(5 , 1 , 0)}+ 2.ii(9 , 2 , 0 ) +2.1{ii(9 , 2 , 0)-'ii(5 , 1 , 0)}-=2.1+2.4+2.1=12 ; I2(11 , 2)=2.ii(5 , 1 , 0 ) = 4 .
As a verification , it may be worth while to write down these eighty-two 1 1-edra , to show the faces in order about the 10-gonal base .
R(11 , 5 ) is 3537353636 ; R(11 , 4 ) are 5383535453 , 4383453635 , 3464363636 , 4373537345 , 3463536437 ; I(11 , 4 ) are 4438353635 , 6346436363 , 5437436363 , 3543835354 , 3637374354 , 6353653463 , 6353644373 , 6346354373 , 5353736345 , 6353644373 , 4437363536 ; I2(11 , 4 ) are 5353653536 , 6346363463 , 5437354373 ; 410 are 4439344535 , 5347435535 , 4355534636 , 3445443737 ; 1(11 , 3 ) are 5444439353 , 5734446353 , 6634455353 , 7534545353 , 5463447353 , 5553456353 , 5643546353 , 5436444383 , 5436634463 , 6436356344 , 5436453473 , 7346354534 , 6436355435 , 5439344453 , 5438435453 , 5436444383 , 5436383444 , 5436354435 , 5437443653 , 5436374354 , 5534653463 , 6443743643 , 5443743734 , 5443834634 , 6534643643 , 5534734634 , 5534643734 , 6534734543 , 5443843553 , 5534653463 , 5534644373 ; are 4534843544 , 44431034444 , 5435653454 , 6344644364 ; are 4534934444 , 6344653454 , 6734445443 , 6643545443 , 5643545534 , 5834444543 , 4834444634 , 5743544543 , 8435445353 , 8436354443 , 5436543563 , 5437535453 , 5443744373 , 6443834543 , 5443753463 , 5734445534 , 4743544634 , 6444374534 , 6553455443 ; I2(11 , 2 ) are 5553455534 , 7444374443 , 6544365443 , 6453464534 .
The dodecaedra are found by rather less calculation than the hendecaedra , forming only eight classes , as follows : I(12 , 5 ) =ER2(7 , 3 ) .
IR(7 , 3 , 2)+12(7 , 2 ) .
I12(7 , 2 , 3)+R(7 , 2 ) .
IR(7 , 2 , 3 ) , R(12 , 5)=R(7 , 2)RR(7 , 2 , 3)+R3(7 , 3).RR3(7 , 3 , 2 ) , 1(12,4 ) =(8 , 3)11(8 , 3 , 1)+I(8 , 2).11(8 , 2 , 2)+R(8 , 2).IR(8 , 2 , 2 ) , R(12 , 4)=R(8 , 2 ) .
RR(8 , 2 , 2 ) , I(12,3 ) =I(9,3).II(9,3,0)+1(9,2)II(9,2,1)+R(9,3).IR(9,3,0)+R(9,2).IR(9,2,1 ) , R(12 , 3)=R(9 , 3 ) .
RR(9 , 3 , 0)+R(9 , 2)RR(9 , 2 , 1 ) , 1(12,2 ) =1(10 , 2)1(10 , 2 , 0)+R(10 , 2).IR(10 , 2 , 0 ) , R(12 , 2)=R(1 2)= R(21 , ).(1 2,0 ) .
These are , by what precedes , all given numbers ; and , by continuing the process , we can finally obtain all the x-edra on an ( xl)-gonal base , numbered in their proper classes , which have only triedral summits .
I have generalized the expressions InT"(x , k , 1 ) , RWRW(x , k 1 ) , n R..(x , k , 1 ) , which the theory requires foir enumerating all the x-edra having an ( xl)-gonal base , and any surmmits whatever ; but the formulae are not worth producing .
The number of distinctions to be made is too great to be of any ready use .
If the x-edra having an ( x-I )-gonal base were classed and enumerated according to their sunmits , it would be possible to count all the ( x+h)-edra on the same ( xI)-gonal base , by removing summits not in the base , thus producing crown-faces , and by the vanishing of edges about the crowns and base , thus producing faces contiguous , but not collateral .
T'hat is , it would be possible to enumerate and classify the N-edra .
