" Suggestion intended to confirm Franklin 's Theory of Electrostatics , by explaining the phenomena of Repulsion between bodies negatively electric .
" By James A. Smith , Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. The author conceives that in negatively electrified bodies , or bodies having less than their natural quantity of electricity , the redundant matter must have a tendency to escape , and thus the equilibrium of its cohesion is destroyed ; and that two bodies in such a condition must mutually repel each other .
