As much interest has been taken of late in the state of the barometer in high southern latitudes , the Expedition sent last year from the Cape of Good Hope to complete the magnetical observations made by Sir JAMES C. Ross in those latitudes , was supplied with a barometer and other meteorological instruments , and directed to make meteorological as well as magnetical observations .
I have now the honour of laying before the Royal Society the observations made during that Expedition .
They were taken daily at the hours of 3 and 9 A.M. , 3 and 9 P.M. , noon , and midnight , by the officers of the ship during their respective watches .
Nothing could exceed the zeal with which the officers entered into all the objects of the Expedition , and the attention and care they took in the observations they had to make .
The following are the instruments with which the Expedition was furnished : One marine barometer , Three thermometers , by J. NEWMAN , London .
One DANIELL'S hygrometer , Ether in metal bottles .
The barometer was of the usual construction , the case being of wood and the scale of ivory , read off by a vernier to '01 of an inch ; the mercury was contained in a leatheln bag .
It was compared with the standard barometer at the Magnetic Observatory , Cape of Good Hope , both before and after the Expedition ; and also with the Royal Society 's barometer on its return to England .
The following are the comparisons : Cape of Good Hope.-January 1845 .

They have also been corrected for the effect of temperature on the mercurial column , the corrections being taken from the Table given in the Royal Society 's Instructions for Magnetical and Meteorological Observatories , p. 82 .
The daily means thus corrected are given in the Abstract in Table I. Table II .
contains the means of every seven successive days ; these means have had an additional correction applied to them , for the variation in the length of the column of mercury occasioned by the variation of gravity in different latitudes..o .
inch .
The correction in lat. -20 amounts to --0059 The correction in lat. -45 amounts to -0'000 The correction in lat. -70 amounts to +0-059 and proportionally for intermediate latitudes .
Table III .
contains the general results arranged according to latitude .
This has been done by grouping together , without reference to date , the weekly means belonging to nearly similar latitudes .
The number of observations , of which each general result is the mean , is given in the last column of the Table .
In order to resolve the heights of the barometer into the two constituents of aqueous and gaseous pressure , one of DANIELL'S hygrometers was observed at the hours of 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. , by Assistant-Surgeon W. DIXON , M.D. , attached to the Expedition .
The tension of vapour obtained by these observations is taken from the Table in the Royal Society 's Instructions ( page 89 ) .
This being deducted from the height of the barometer in Tables II .
and III .
, leaves the pressure of the dry air .
434 The thermometers , employed for observing the temperature of the air and of the surface of the sea , were frequently tested by immersing them in melting snow , and the necessary corrections have been applied .
The thermometers were found to have very little index error .
The temperature of the surface of the sea was obtained by drawing up water in a small canvas bucket and immersing a thermometer immediately into it .
The directions of the wind are the true ones , i. e. the observed compass direction corrected for the declination .
The force of the wind and the state of weather were recorded according to the systeml drawn up by Captain BEAUFORT for the use of the Royal Navy:-.frequent attempts were made to observe the force of the wind by means of one of LIND'S gauges , but owing to the rolling motion of the ship it was found impossible .
The observations in the Pagoda show a lower barometer within the Tropics than a little beyond them ; the mercury rising from latitude -20 ?
to about 350 , where it stood at 30'15 .
From latitude -35 ?
to -56 ?
the barometer fell rapidly , the difference being 1,054 inch .
The descent of the mercury with the increase of latitude did not appear to extend beyond -56 ?
, as in the forty days during which the Pagoda was between --600 and 670 ?
5 , the mean height of the barometer scarcely differed from the mean corresponding to 56 ? ?
21 ' .
The gaseous pressure presents similar features , rising from -20 ?
to --3.50 , thence descending to 56 ?
, and remaining nearly constant from -56 ?
to -670 .
The difference between lat. --35 ?
and lat. -56 ?
amounts in this case to 0'78 inch .
No influence of longitude on the barometer is deducible from these observations , extending from 0 ?
to 120 ?
East .
For the purpose of comparing these results with the inferences which have been derived from previous observations , I have added an abstract of the conclusions drawn from the observations discussed in Dr. ADOLPH ERMAN'S work* , which has been communicated to me by Lieut.-Colonel SABINE .
" From a parallel very near the equator , the pressure of the atmosphere , measured by the barometer corrected for gravity , increases both northward and southward to a little beyond the outer limit of the trade winds ; beyond this limit the pressure decreases , at first slowly , but much more rapidly after passing the 50th parallel .
The maximum of pressure occurs at about 35 ?
in each hemisphere .
The decrease from the maximum in the direction of the Pole has been found in the southern hemisphere to continue as far as the parallel of Cape Horn ( 550 ?
5 ) , where the low pressure corresponds with that observed in the northern hemisphere at Kamtchatka and Sitka , which are nearly in the same latitude .
" The dry air has also a minimum zone within the inner limits of the trades ; the increase from thence in both directions is more rapid and considerable than that of the pressure of the gaseous and aqueous atmospheres united , and the gaseous maximum in both hemispheres is obtained in a higher latitude ( about 45 ?
) .
The pressure of the dry air at its maximum at 450 exceeds the equatorial gaseous pressure by about 0 47 inch ; the pressure of the whole atmosphere at its maximum in 350 is not more than 0'18 above the equatorial pressure .
" The following Table contains the approximate mean annual pressures of the atmosphere corresponding to different latitudes , as given by Dr. ERMAN:-- .
Of the barometer ; 2 , of the vapour ; and 3 , of the dry air .
The Table is formed from observations in both hemispheres , and in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans ; it also unites observations made in different seasons , with a single exception .

55 89'64 0'22 29-48 " The summer pressures of the dry air are less than the winter ones , except at the equator ; the contrary is the case with the vapour .
" On comparing Dr. ERMAN'S conclusions with those drawn from the observations in the Pagoda , it appears that they agree in placing the maximum barometric pressure in lat. 35 ?
, the pressure diminishing thence rapidly to 560 , where the Pagoda 's observations show it to become nearly stationary ; but they differ as to the place of the maximum pressure of the dry air , that being in lat. 40 ?
or 45 ?
by Dr. ERMAN'S observations , and in lat. 35 ?
by those of the Pagoda .
It is possible however that a longer series of observations would have made the present ones agree more closely in this respect also with those of Dr. ERMAN , his means being taken from observations made in different seasons , and in various longitudes in both hemispheres .
Taking rom Dr. ERMAN'S table 29*21 as the mean pressure of the dry air at the eqqator , the observations in the Pagoda show a difference of gaseous pressure between the equator and the high latitudes ( -56 ?
to67 ?
'5 ) of the southern hemisphere amounting to 0*28 inch ; the observations in the Pagoda were however exclusively in the summer months , when the pressures are generally less than on the mean of the whole year .
Owing to the increase in the elastic force of the aqueous vapour in the warmer regions of the globe , the difference of barometric pressure between the equator and the high latitudes ( taking the data from Dr. ERMAN'S table on the one hand , and from the observations in the Pagoda on the other ) amounts to 0'89 inch .
As the facts shown by these observations are curious , and must be interesting to meteorologists , it is hoped that the Royal Society will not consider this paper unworthy of their acceptance .
