210 The Spectrum of Radium Emanation .
By Alexander Thomas Cameron , M.A. , B.Sc. , and Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. ( Received July 2 , 1908 .
) In May , 1904 , one of the authors , in conjunction with Professor Collie measured the visual spectrum of the emanation accumulated in 14 days from 109 milligrammes of radium bromide , by means of a direct vision spectroscope .
A subsequent measurement was made with 11 days ' accumulation .
It was then stated* :\#151 ; " The spectrum was very brilliant , consisting of very bright lines , the spaces between them being perfectly dark ; it had a striking resemblance in general character to the spectra of the gases of the argon group .
" This spectrum became rapidly faint , and had largely disappeared in less than a minute ; it was replaced by the spectrum of secondary hydrogen .
We have now repeated this experiment several times with the emanation accumulated during 12 days from 477 milligrammes of radium bromide , with partial success ; and recently with perfect success , no other spectrum being visible at first but that of the emanation .
It was intensely brilliant , and consisted of a number of green , blue , and violet lines , besides a very slightly refrangible live in the red .
The spectrum was photographed ; but during the exposure , which lasted 4 to 5 minutes , it faded , and was replaced by that of hydrogen .
The tube was photographed three times altogether ; the second and third exposures lasted about eight minutes ; the hydrogen lines , as a rule , were equally strong in the second and third photographs , and almost entirely absent from the first .
On reducing the pressure , a number of lines appeared in the second photograph , which seem to be additional lines of the emanation .
The action of the discharge is to drive the emanation into the negative electrode , where it is largely absorbed ; for the glowing , due to secondary products , was much more brilliant there than through the rest of the tube .
The greater part of the lines previously observed have been confirmed ; and a number have been added to the list .
The degree of exactitude is of course , very much greater than before ; in most cases the limit of error is O not greater than one or two Angstrom units ; the lines of secondary hydrogen already mapped , and apparently not with great accuracy , were taken as fiducial .

211 The secondary spectrum of hydrogen is being re-mapped by Mr. Herbert Watson , and the lines will be corrected as soon as his measurements are complete.* The following table shows the results of two experiments ; in Column 1 are the wave-lengths of the lines ; in Column 2 their intensities when photographed during the first experiment ; in Columns 3 , 4 , and 5 , their intensities if observed on the first , second , and third photographs of the W ave-length .

[ July 2 , second experiment .
Column 6 gives the wave-lengths and intensities of the lines observed visually by Collie and Ramsay .
The photograph taken during the first experiment showed chiefly secondary hydrogen and some nitrogen ; it is somewhat remarkable that so many lines belonging to the emanation were photographed .
The asterisked lines are undoubtedly those of the emanation .
The greater number of these lines grow weaker with the duration of the discharge , and in some cases fade out , so that they are absent from the third column of Experiment 2 .
But in some cases , and conspicuously in line 4058-5 , the intensity has increased astonishingly .
This line is near a mercury line of wave-length 4047 , the intensities of which vary from 3 in the first plate to 6 in the second , and to 2 in the third ; it is given in spectrum tables as of intensity 10 .
It looks probable , therefore , that the line 4058-5 is due to some product of the decay of the emanation , the quantity of which increases with length of passage of the discharge .
Through the kindness of Sir William Huggins , we have been furnished with a list of the more important lines of the nebulae .
No one of them appears to be due to radium emanation .
Addendum.\#151 ; Received .
August 5 , 1908 .
In the experiments just described ordinary panchromatic plates were used .
In two later experiments " spectrum " plates were employed .
In the first of these the spectrum only lasted a minute and a-half .
The lines in the photograph were all very weak .
They included most of the emanation lines previously photographed , together with the slightly refrangible line in the red , already referred to ; the wave-length of this line is 7050 .
In all these experiments the spectrum tubes were fitted with aluminium electrodes , and the rapid absorption of the emanation was undoubtedly connected with this .
In a final experiment , on the recommendation of M. de Bort , we used copper electrodes .
The result was entirely satisfactory .
They apparently contain no hydrogen , and absorb emanation much more slowly .
The tube became vacuous only after 7 to 8 minutes and a very good photograph was taken .
It contained a large number of new lines belonging to the emanation spectrum , besides a number of mercury lines .
The hydrogen lines were few , and their intensity were unaltered throughout .
The unitalicised figures in the following table refer to lines measured in this last experiment with the corresponding intensities .
Italicised figures refer to lines absent in this case , but measured previously .

4 Since this paper was communicated to the Society Professor Rutherford and Mr. Royds have published a preliminary account of their work on the same subject.* Their figures show a very close agreement with those given above .
Our thanks are due to Mr. Herbert Watson for some assistance in measuring the wave-lengths of the lines , and for placing at our disposal his results of measurement of the secondary spectrum of hydrogen .
