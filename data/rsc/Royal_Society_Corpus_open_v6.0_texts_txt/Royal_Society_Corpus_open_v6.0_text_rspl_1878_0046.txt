" Researches in Spectrum Analysis in connexion with the Spectrum of the Sun .
" By J. N. Lockyer , F.R.S. Received November 17 , 1877 .
Read January 24 , 1878* In a map of the solar spectrum , containing a greatly increased number of lines , such as that upon which I am now engaged , it is possible to seek under favourable conditions the coincidence or non-coincidence of lines due to elements hitherto undetected in the solar atmosphere , on account of their existing in quantities insufficient to give very marked spectral lines .
A search has accordingly been made , on the principles laid down in previous communications , for those elements which contain in their spectra long and well-characterised lines in the photographic region .
Although the evidence cannot be said to be complete until the whole spectrum has been examined , it is not too early to adduce the following evidence as to the existence of several additional metals in the sun 's reversing layer , and the probable existence of others .
The results obtained up to the present time are shown in the following tables , premising that in the first paper of this series the metals considered as being solar as the result of the labours of Kirchhoff , Angstrom , and Thalen , together with the considerations there brought " forward regarding the length of the lines , were as follows :\#151 ; Na Fe Ca Mg Ni Ba Cu Zn Cr Co H Mn Ti A1 * See ante , p. 49 .

282 Mr. J. N. Lockyer on Researches in Spectrum Ana in connexion with the Spectrum of the Sun .
283 It is important to bear in mind that the lines recorded in the foregoing tables are in most cases the very longest visible in the photographic region of the respective spectra .
In some cases they are limited to the region 39-40 , which I have more especially studied .
So that the fact of their being reversed in the solar spectrum must be considered as the strongest evidence obtainable in favour of the existence in the sun of the metals to which they belong , pending the complete investigation of their spectra .
Where , however , there is only one line , as with Li , Rb , \amp ; c. , the presence of these metals in the sun 's reversing layer can , for the present , only be said to be probable .
Neither must it be forgotten that in addition to the long lines which a spectrum may contain in the red , yellow , or orange , long lines may exist in the hitherto unexplored ultra-violet region , so that the necessity for waiting for further evidence before deciding finally upon the presence or absence of such metals in the sun will be rendered obvious .
It will be thought remarkable that if the long lines of such metals as lithium and rubidium are found in the photographic region of the spectrum , the long lines ( Li , W.L. 6705 ; Rb , W.L. 6205 and 6296 ) , should have escaped detection .
To this it may be replied that , although these red lines may be apparently the brightest to the eye , it by no means follows they are the longest , since they are situated in a part of the spectrum which affects the visual organ more strongly than the photographic region does .
It is possible also that the reasoning I have lately used in a paper communicated to the Society on the spectrum of calcium may be applied in these cases .
Since a sensitized film is affected by some rays more strongly than by others , in determining the lengths of lines from a photograph , it is not fair to compare together portions of the spectrum separated by too great an interval .
Furthermore the fact of these red lines having been overlooked in the solar spectrum is not conclusive proof of their absence , inasmuch as this portion of the spectrum is both brighter and less refrangible , and a greater degree of dispersion would be necessary when prisms are employed to render visible faint dark lines which are easily detected in the photographic region* I hope to be able to make special search for these lines on some future occasion .
For metals having long lines in the green a special search was made .
The long thallium line ( W.L. 5349 ) was photographed , but no distinct evidence of a corresponding solar line was obtained .
Two long silver lines were found also , about W.L. 4018 and 4212 , * It is significant that there is a dark line near the position of the Li line both in Angstrom and Kirchhoff 's maps not assigned to any metal .

( Abstract .
) The paper contains an account of some points in the development of the Cymothoa oestroides and C. parallela of Milne-Edwards .
The work was mainly carried on in the Zoological Station at Naples , and the author takes this opportunity of returning his best thanks to Dr. Dohm and Dr. Eisig for the kind way in which they forwarded his researches .
The eggs were prepared in the way described by Bobretzky in his paper on the development of Oniscus mur("Zeit .

The sections were stained with Kleinenberg 's haematoxylin and mounted in Canada balsam .
The eggs when first laid are surrounded by a single membrane .
The earliest stages of segmentation were not observed ; the first described is that in which a circular patch of cells has appeared at one pole of the egg .
The cells are of considerable size and contain very large granular nuclei ; in the centre of the patch they are polygonal , and more than one layer deep , but at the edges they are flattened and form a single layer .
The blastoderm gradually spreads over the yolk , the cells on the
