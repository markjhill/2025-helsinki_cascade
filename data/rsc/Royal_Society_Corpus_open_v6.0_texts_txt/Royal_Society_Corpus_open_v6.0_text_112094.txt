By JosEPH I.D EVERETT , M.A. , F.R.S.E. , Professor of Mathematics in King 's College , N.S. Communicated by Professor WILLIAM THoMSON , F.R.S. Received December 21 , 1864 .
My former paper* embraced the six months from October 1862 to March 1863 .
Since the latter date my observations have been continued as before , the water-dropping method being employed until December 1st , since which time burning matches have been used , as in the previous winter .
The glass fibre of the station electrometer remained unchanged till July 31st , when it became loosened from its attachment , and was replaced by a new and much thinner fibre , which has continued in use ever since .
From comparisons made with the portable electrometer , in the manner described in my former paper , it appears that the change of fibre has increased the indications in the ratio of 20'2 to 3 ' 1 .
The principal observations have , as before , been made three times a day , namely at 8 or 9 A.M. , 2 P.M. , and 9 or 10 P.M. ; but additional observations have frequently been taken at other hours , especially during the months of May , June , and July , when they were much more numerous than in any month included in the former paper .
Each observation has generally contained five air-readings the interval between the readings being a minute , until September 16th , since which date it has been only half a minute .
I assume that this change cannot affect the mean result , though it may to some extent influence the observed range .
It was adopted for convenience , the new fibre being found to admit of more rapid observation than the old .
The following is a summary of the results of observations during rain or other downfall , fog , and thunder and lightning the period included being the eleven months from April 1863 to February 1864 .
-Rain.-With light rain the electricity is generally moderate , sometimes very weak , and sometimes about double the average fair-weather strength .
These remarks do not apply to light rain imm-nediately following heavy , the electricity being often as strong during the intervals between heavy rain , and for some time after its conclusion , as during its descent .
Very heavy rain is almost invariably accompanied by very strong electricity .
Snow.-Almost always positive , but occasionally a little negative intermixed with positive ; and on one solitary occasion ( February 16th ) strong negative sparks were drawn during a heavy fall of snow .
On this occasion strong positive electricity was also observed .
It is worthy of remark that on the following morning and midday strong positive sparks were drawn , and the electricity continued very strong positive during the remainder of the day .
No snow fell , but a strong west wind filled the air with drifting snow .
IIail.-I have nothing to add under this head , except that on one occasion ( February 26th ) strong positive sparks were drawn during hail accompanied by lightning and thunder .
Sleet.-One observation : rather strong negative .
Fog.-Always positive , and generally above the average strength , but sometimes rather below .
The fogs embraced in this account were few and inconsiderable , never lasting more than a few hours , whereas the former paper included some of a more decided character .
Thunder-storms.-None of these occurred during the period embraced by the former paper ; but there have been several since , and always marked by very strong electricity .
The first occurred June 15th , distant thunder commencing about 1 P.M. , and a violent thunder-storm continuing from 4h 30 ' " to 6 P.M. with a deluge of rain , three-quarters of an inch falling in half an hour .
Silent lightning continued all the evening , and to an unknown hour in the night .
The electrometer showed , as usual , moderate positive , while the thunder was distant ; but observations from 4 " 36 " to 6 " 2m showed electricity excessively strong , with frequent changes of sign .
The extremes were +104 and -121 , the average fine-weather strength being 3 or 4 .
The next storm occurred June 24th .
Observations were taken from 5"1 1lm to 5 " 39m P.M. , during which time much thunder was heard , but no lightning seen .
The electricity observed was constantly negative , increasing by a nearly regular advance from -29 to -214 , this last being the strongest electricity that I have ever yet found .
No rain fell during this observation , but '39 of an inch fell before 9 P.M. , with some heavy peals of thunder and vivid lightning .
Immediately after the heaviest peal strong negative electricity was found , but was not measured .
On the evening of July 6th there was much silent lightning , the flashes being at the rate of four or five a minute , some of them very vivid .
The electricity observed was weak , never rising higher than 1'8 .
The next storm occurred July 18th , and closely resembled that of June a1th , but on a reduced scale as regarded its external features .
The indications of the electrometer , however , were quite equal in strength to those observed on that occasion .
The next day ( July 19th ) there was distant thunder and lightning , with what appeared to be rain in the distance , from about 3 to 4 P.M. ; and the electricity observed was very strong negative , observations extending from 31 " 1 to 3h '57m .
The observations on these two days are given in extenso at the end of this paper .
Silent lightning was observed on the evening of August 6th , the electricity indicated being moderate positive .
On August 10th there was a deluge of rain with some thunder and light1865.J ] 11 ning , during which frequent observations were taken , showing very strong electricity , generally negative .
No more instances occurred till the evening of February 26th , when hail fell , with short intermissions , from a little before 91 30m P.M. till after midnight , accompanied by much lightning and some thunder .
The only observation of the electrometer was at 911 30 " ' , when strong positive sparks were obtained .
It appears from these instances , that thunder-storms in the neighbourhood of the place of observation are accompanied by extremely strong indications of atmospheric electricity , but that neither silent lightning nor the distant rumbling of thunder is accompanied by any marked effect on the electrometer .
For the sake of comparison with numerical data given in the former paper , applying to the six months October 1862 to March 1863 , I subjoin the corresponding data for April to September 1863 , thus completing a year from the commencement of observations .

1 S.W. It will be observed that in all these instances the weather was cloudy and the negative electricity weak , characteristics which also belong to the corresponding instances : in the former paper .
The remark there made , that on every day on which negative electricity had been observed , positive had also been observed , holds good down to the present date ( March 1864 ) .
The monthly means of the results of fine-weather observations , for different hours of the day , from April to September 1863 , are shown in the following Table .
They have been computed in the same manner as the corresponding numbers in the former paper .

These 1865 .
] 13 results agree very well with those derived from the previous six months , allowing for the difference between the length of the day in summer and in winter .
The following Table of the variations of electricity in fine weather , from month to month , embraces the whole period of observation down to February 1864 .
These results , as well as those above given , are expressed in units of station electrometer with second fibre , being the same unit that was employed in the previous paper .
The day is supposed to be divided into three portions-before noon , noon to 6 P.M. , and after 6 P.R. For each miuth , all the observations in each portion have been summed and divided by their number , giving the means shown below .

b. Third fibre put in July 31st .
c. The electricity on February l7th and part of 18th was out of range , and has not been reckoned .
These results show that atmospheric electricity is stronger in winter than in summer , and seem to indicate a double maximum and minimum within the year , the principal maximum occurring about February , and the other maximum about October ; the principal minimum in June , and the other in November .
It will be observed that in every case the numbers in the column " after 6 P.M. " are the smallest .
At the suggestion of Professor Thomson , I have made a careful comparison of the states of electricity , as regards both strength and variableness , for different directions of wind .
For this purpose I have tabulated according to direction of wind ( separating also fine-weather from wet-weather observations ) the daily entries of mean potential at 2 P.M. for the first twelve months , also the variableness as measured by the difference between the entries of highest and lowest potential for the same hour .
Where there was no observation between 3 and 4 P.M. the day was passed over ; and where more than one observation was entered between these hours , that which was nearest to 2 P.M. was alone reckoned .
From these data , the monthly means of strength and variableness were computed ; but in neither case was any regularity exhibited .
The only results of this comparison which seem worthy of record are the annual fine-weather means ( derived from the monthly ) for the prevailing directions of wind .
These are Calm .

The first two days contain instances of some of the weakest electricity that I have ever found in clear weather ( I allude particularly to the observations at 2h 1 Om June 29th , and at 3h 47m July 1st ) .
The other two days afford fair instances of observations during thunder and lightning* .
