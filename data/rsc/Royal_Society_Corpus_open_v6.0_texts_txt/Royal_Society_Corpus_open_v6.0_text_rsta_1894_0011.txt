] During the total eclipse of 1871 observations were made by Respighi and myself with spectroscopes deprived of collimators , and a series of rings was seen corresponding to the different rays emitted by the corona and prominences .
The phenomena were so distinct that I made arrangements for a repetition of the observations during the eclipse of 1875 , and an instrument , which received the name of ''prismatic camera , " was arranged to photograph the rings.* The chief advantage of the instrument is that it combines the functions of a telescope with those of a spectroscope , and gives spectroscopic views of the solar surroundings in each radiation .
The object-glass employed on this occasion had an aperture of 3S inches and a focal length of 5 feet , while the prism had a refracting angle of 8 degrees .
Two photographs were obtained , showing several protuberances in addition to continuous spectrum from the corona .
I again employed this method of observation during the eclipse of 1878 , but failed to see the rings , the corona apparently giving only a continuous spectrum .
The method has also been attempted during succeeding eclipses , but on so small a scale that the results obtained have not come up to the expectations raised by my observations of 1871 .
Subsequent solar investigations , however , confirmed my opinion that this was the best way of studying the lower parts of the sun 's atmosphere , providing an efficient instrument were employed .
As the Solar Physics Committee is now in possession of a prismatic camera of a much larger size than those used during the eclipses in question , I determined to employ it during the eclipse of 1893 , the work on photographic stellar spectra at 5 Kensington having given abundant proof of its excellence .
The object-glass of this instrument has an aperture of 6 inches , and was corrected for the photographic rays by the Brothers Henry .
The correction is such that it is unnecessary to incline the back of the camera , and hence some of the objections which have been made to the * 'Phil .
Trans. , ' 1878 , vol. 169 , p. 139 .
use of this form of spectroscope are overcome .
The large refracting angle of the prism employed ( 45 ' ) obviously increases the value of the instrument for eclipse work .
This instrument was placed at the disposal of the Eclipse Committee by the Solar Physics Committee , and was entrusted to Mr. Fowler , who took the photographs at the African station .
It also seemed important that a series of similar photographs should be taken at another point on the line of totality , even though an equally efficient instrument were not available .
A spectroscope belonging to the Astronomical Laboratory of the Royal College of Science was lent for the purpose by the Science and Art Department , and a siderostat used in conjunction with it was lent by the Royal Society .
These instruments formed part of the equipment of the Brazilian expedition , and were placed in charge of Mr. Shackleton , Computer to the Solar Physics Committee .
The stations chosen were Fundium , on the Salum River , West Africa , and Para Curu , Brazil .
The weather was fortunately favourable at both places .
The preliminary reports of work done at the stations named , by Mr. Fowler and Mr. Shackleton respectively , are appended ; the object of these being to indicate the kind of results obtained .
The complete discussion of the results , which will occupy some time , will form the subject of a future communication .
( 1 .
) African Observations .
The prismatic camera employed at the African station had an aperture of 6 inches , the refracting angle of the prism being 45 ' .
Spectra photographed with this instrument are 2 inches long from F to K , and rings corresponding to the inner corona are about seven-eighths of an inch in diameter .
As very little idea could be formed of the exposures required , a series of four different exposures was repeated three times during totality , a specially long one being given near mid-eclipse .
A complete list of the photographs taken is given in the appended table .
Column 1 contains reference numbers to the photographic plates ; column 2 the brand of plate employed ; column 3 the times of beginning and ending each exposure , as recorded by a deck-watch ; and column 4 the amounts of exposure , " Inst. " indicating an exposure given as quickly as possible by hand .
There is a little uncertainty as to the exact time of commencement of totality , but there is reason to believe that it occurred at about 2h .

Description of Plates 9 and 10 .
For the information of those specially interested , seven typical photographs are reproduced in Plates 9 and 10 , the scale being twice that of the original negatives .
A small amount of detail , particularly in the extreme ultra-violet , and in the region about G in some of the photos , is lost in the reproductions .
The principal lines , or rather portions of circles , are those of hydrogen , and the H and K lines of calcium .
In Plate 9 , the F line is on the extreme right , while the two prominent lines near the violet end are H and K. The same lines will be readily identified in Plate 10 .
The orientation of the rings will be gathered from fig. 1 in the report on the Brazilian observations .

\#151 ; a. 4 Y No. 7 ( Plate 9 ) was taken very shortly after the commencement of totality , the exposure being " instantaneous .
" At this phase of the eclipse a considerable arc of the chromosphere was visible , and its spectrum is therefore shown in addition to the spectrum of the higher reaches of some of the large prominences extending beyond the moon 's limb .
It will be seen that at H and K there are almost complete circles of chromosphere and prominences , the absent portions being of course obscured by the moon .
One very small prominence is especially rich in lines , including some of iron and manganese .
No. 9 ( Plate 10 ) was taken about 8 seconds later with an exposure of 5 seconds .
Practically all the chromosphere is now covered by the moon so that only the spectra of prominences and corona are visible .
With the increased exposure the ultra-violet spectrum is considerably extended , and the spectrum of one of the prominences reaches as far as b in the green .
The continuous spectrum of the corona is also more strongly represented in this photograph .
In this photograph the spectrum trailed slightly at right angles to its length owing to a defect in the driving screw of the telescope .
Nos. 12 and 16 ( Plate 9 ) were taken at later stages with instantaneous exposures .
They differ from the others only in point of phase .
No. 17 ( Plate 10 ) was taken on an isochromatic plate with an exposure of 40 seconds .
The spectrum extends from the ultra-violet to the less refrangible side of D , Ds being a well-marked line .
The characteristic coronal radiation at X 5315'95 ( 1474 K ) is represented by portions of a well-defined ring at that wave-length .
No. 21 ( Plate 9 ) was taken shortly before the end of totality , a portion of the chromosphere being again visible in addition to numerous prominences .
It will be seen that one of the smallest prominences is rich in lines and closely resembles that which appears in No. 7 .
No. 22 ( Plate 10 ) was taken immediately after totality , the exposure being about 5 seconds .
Six of the photographs taken out of totality show bright lines in the same way , but the remainder show only the Fraunhofer lines , the thin crescent of the sun then visible acting as a curved slit .
The latter plates will be of value , however , as comparison spectra for the final reductions .
A word of caution is necessary with regard to the ill-defined broad ring , a little more refrangible than D , which is seen in photograph No. 17 .
Experiments made since the eclipse indicate that this particular ring , and possibly other less distinct ones which are more refrangible , may be produced by a purely continuous spectrum .
The isochromatic plates employed have two well-marked maxima of photographic action , one at a point a little more refrangible than D , and another about G ; tha| appears to explain the origin of the rings in question .

715 ( 2 .
) Brazilian Observations .
The prismatic camera employed in Brazil was one of 3 inches aperture .
The light from the sun was reflected on to the prisms from the mirror of a siderostat .
The object glass was a Dallmeyer doublet of 19 inches equivalent focal length ; the image of the inner corona , therefore , is a ring of 0*2 inch diameter .
Before the doublet were placed two prisms of 3 inches clear aperture , with their refracting edges perpendicular to the horizontal , each having a refractive angle of 60 ' .
The length of the spectrum given by this combination was 1*65 inches from F to K , or 2*5 inches from I)3 to K. Three specially constructed dark slides , carrying eight plates each ( 4^ in .
X If in .
) , were employed , the change from plate to plate being effected by means of a rack and pinion attached to the dark slides .

I The exposures were made by means of a shutter , which could be closed and opened from the camera end with a cord ; when this was done as rapidly as possible the exposure is tabulated as instantaneous .
The sun was observed through a finder fixed on the camera , until it was seen that totality was very near commencement .
The exposures were then begun .
4 y 2 At the beginning of the second exposure the signal that totality had commenced was given .
Between the sixteenth and seventeenth exposures , on a change of slides being made , two apparently complete rings were observed on the ground glass screen of the camera ; they were coloured green and yellow , and probably correspond to the 1474 K and D3 lines .
Fig. 1 shows an enlargement of the 1474 K ring ( from photograph Number 12 ) placed alongside a reduced copy of the corona from a photograph taken by Schaeberle in Chili .
This particular one has been selected , because the exposure was short enough to make the lower corona thus obtained comparable with the spectrum ring at 1474 K. Fig. 1 .

Lower Corona .
Comparison of the 1474 K spectrum ring with the lower corona .
On comparison it will be seen that the prismatic camera has picked out the brightest parts of the corona , and where it is strongest , the spectrum ring and the continuous spectrum at those points is most intense , whilst a prominence occurring at any part of the sun 's limb does not alter the intensity of the ring at the corresponding part .
Six of the photographs are reproduced in Plate 11 , on a scale of three times that of the original negative .
The numbers correspond to those given in the first column of the " Table of Exposures .
" The parts of circles photographed are chiefly K.H G and F. Description of Plate 11 .
No. 2 was taken as near the commencement of totality as could be estimated , and was probably exposed when the moon had just covered the photosphere .
The exposure was very short , but still long enough to over-expose the plate between F and K. Beyond K at one end numerous ultra-violet lines are shown ; while beyond F at tte other several bright lines are discernible as far as b , which probably is registered as two bright lines .
PRISMATIC CAMERAS DURING THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN .
717 Nos. 4 and 5 were taken at a later phase and show semicircles corresponding to the principal hydrogen and calcium lines .
Nos. 11 and 12 are photographs taken near mid-eclipse on isochromatic plates with exposures of 30 and 60 seconds respectively .
Besides the arcs shown in Nos. 4 and 5 a complete ring is seen on the less refrangible side of b corresponding to the 1474 Kline .
Still further towards the red are several bright points , marking the position of the D3 ring , but this and those of hydrogen and calcium differ from that of 1474 K in being made up of points , whilst the latter is nearly complete .
The continuous spectrum is also very marked in these photographs , as it is also in others of long exposure .
No. 18 was taken just before totality ended , and a large arc of the chromosphere is shown .
