( Abstract .
) This paper is a continuation of one published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1852 ( p. 289 ) , and discusses the general qiuestion of the anatomical structure of the stems of Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons , especially in reference to some objections taken against the author 's views respecting the stems of the Nymbpheaceae .
Certain peculiarities of the structure of roots are next examined , and these are shown to be formed On the Dicotyledonous type in Victoria .
The germination of the seed is described in a manner differing to some extent from the accounts given by Planchon , Trecul , and Hooker .
The error of Tre'cul , in stating that the earlier leaves are devoid of a stipule , is shown to depend upon his overlooking the true axillary position of that organ .
The Phyllotaxy is next treated , with the development and arrangement of the leaves and roots ; lastly , a complete history of the development of the flower , showing that the apparently inferior position of the ovary depends upon a great enlargement of the receptacle after the formation of the various organs forming the flower .
