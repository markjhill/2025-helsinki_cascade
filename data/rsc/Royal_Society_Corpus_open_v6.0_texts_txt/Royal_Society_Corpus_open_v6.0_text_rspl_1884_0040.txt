The following Papers were read:\#151 ; I. " Observations on the Harmonics of a String struck at one-eighth of its Length .
" By Alfred James Hipkins ( of John Broadwood and Sons ) .
Communicated by Alexander J. Ellis , F.R.S. Received October 1,1884 .
The string observed was a steel pianoforte wire , gauge number 19-g- , diameter 1T7 mm. = '07 inch , of exactly 45 inches vibrating length , stretched by a tension of 71 kilogrammes = 156*63 lbs. , and forming the note C of 135'2 vibrations , in the second space of the bass staff , in one of Broad wood 's concert grand pianofortes accurately adjusted to be struck by the hammer at one-eighth the length of the string from the wrestplank end , or 39*375 inches from the belly-bridge .
Actually three such strings , forming the usual trichord of a grand pianoforte accurately tuned in unison , were used to augment the volume of tone .
The positions of all the nodes less than 39*4 inches from the belly-bridge for the first 20 harmonics , were previously calculated .
All three strings were stopped at the same distance from the belly-bridge with the edge of a piece of felt glued to a piece of wood by Mr. Hartan , the foreman of the tuners , while I struck the note .
A considerable weight and steadiness of blow was necessary to excite the harmonic .
The sound at first was dull VOL. XXXVII .

The Harmonics of a String [ Nov. 20 , and unmusical , but immediately afterwards the harmonic corresponding to the node touched , sang out , always clearly enough to be unmistakably recognised , and sometimes , especially where the node corresponded to several harmonics , with a long clear ring , that was made brighter and longer by removing the stopper from the string , which then vibrated in the small loops conditioned by the node touched .
The following are the first 20 harmonics of this C determined theoretically .
Against each is placed its number of vibrations , and the name of the nearest note on the equally tempered scale , which was that of the piano used , with the theoretical number of hundredths of an equal semitone which had to be added to , or subtracted from , the pianoforte note , in order to give the true pitch of the harmonic.-This list enabled the note heard to be immediately identified , by touching the corresponding notes on the pianoforte .
Finally in the last column is given the number of inches from the belly-bridge at which one or more of ' the nodes of the harmonic would lie theoretically , for all the harmonics actually observed and brought out on the 29th July , 1884 , in the presence of Dr. William Huggins , F.R.S. , who verified the position of the node by a scale after the harmonic had been produced , and Mr. Alexander J. Ellis , F.R.S. , who recorded the results .
The examination of the numerous other positions of the nodes of these and other harmonics was omitted for brevity , as those possessing most interest had been already produced , but those obtained on other occasions are inserted irt a parenthesis .
Except in a few instances considered below , the practical place of the node did not differ from the theoretical by more than *02 or '03 inch , within which limits it was .
difficult to* be sure of the measurement .
In calculating out the positions of all the nodes it was found that some lay very close together .
Thus a node of the 17th harmonic lay at 5'29 inches from the bridge , between one of the 9th harmonic at 5 inches , and another of the 8th at 5*62 , so that these nodes were only '3 inch apart .
All these harmonics were brought out separately , but great care was necessary to hit the precise spot .
On the other hand the node of the 2nd harmonic at 22'5 inches lay between one of the 19th at 21*32 inches , or 1'2 inches nearer the bridge , and another also of the 19th at 23'68 , or 12 farther from the bridge .
Hence there was a space of 2'36 inches with only one harmonic node within it .
Probably in consequence of this the 2nd harmonic could be brought out by touching the string at a considerable distance on either side of the theoretical place , because apparently the string had no other shape which it could assume .
It was determined that the limits within which the 2nd harmonic could be brought out were from 22 1 to 22'95 inches from the bridge , allowing '85 inch play , but at 22 05 and 23*0 inches from the bridge the harmonic would not speak .

* j ' | Similarly for the 3rd harmonic which had its theoretical node at 15 inches from the bridge , between a node of the 19th at 14'21 inches and one of the 20th at 15*75 inches , leaving 1*64 inches unoccupied by nodes .
Practically the 3rd harmonic spoke from 14*75 to 15*4 inches from the bridge , giving a " play " of *65 inch , but would not come out at 14*7 or 15*45 .
These were the only two cases in which the amount of " play " was accurately determined .
In each ease the harmonic came out brightest and best at the theoretical node .
Dr. Huggins said that he had remarked a similar phenomenon on the violin , where he found a " play " of about a quarter of an inch in " stopping " for the octave harmonic .
Subsequently I brought out the 23rd harmonic fn , ' % + 28 , vib .
3124*6 , at 1*96 inches from the bridge .
And going nearer , at 1*50 inches from , and until quite up to , the belly-bridge , I got out the dull prime note of the string C , without apparently any partial .
The same note was produced also at 1*50 inches from the wrestplank-bridge .
So that there is still more play for the prime note itself .
The stopping seemed to obliterate all the upper partials , but allowed the string to vibrate as a simple tone in its full length .
It is remarkable how many harmonics could be elicited by the meaus adopted from one length of string , and how 366 Mr. A. J. Hipkins .
The Harmonics of a String [ Nov. 20 , clearly the high harmonics even to the 19th came out .
Also it was noticeable that the harmonic could be brought out by touching at any one of its nodes , even at those very far distant from the striking-point , showing how accurately a comparatively stout string of great tension could resolve itself into minute sub-vibrations .
Thus the 19th harmony was quite distinctly brought out , so as to be easily compared with e""by touching the string at its second node from the bridge , leaving 40'26 inches of string to be agitated by the blow .
The object of the experiment was to determine , if possible , the effect of the striking place on the harmonics quenched .
Helmholtz ( " Tonempfindungen , " fourth edition , p. 133 ) says that the striking place is from J- to the length , between which , of course , lies and observes ( ibid. ) that " an essential advantage of this striking place appears to be that the seventh and ninth partial tones disappear , or , at least , become very weak .
" I do not know of any pianos with the striking place at -f- the length .
Harpsichords and spinets , which were set in vibration by quill or leather plectra , had no fixed point for plucking the strings .
It was generally from | to TV of the vibrating length .
Although it had been observed by Huyghens and the Antwerp harpsichord maker , Jan Couchet , that altering the plucking place altered the quality of tone , giving rise to the lute stop " of the eighteenth century , no attempt was made to fix a uniform plucking place .
On the latest improved spinet , a Hitchcock , of the early part of the eighteenth century , in my possession , the striking distances for the C 's vary from to y. And on the latest improved harpsichord , a Kirkman , of 1773 , also in my possession , the striking distances of the C 's vary from ^ to and the lute stop from .S .
to ^ of the string .
The bass or longest strings giving , of course , the shortest striking measures , and the same was true of the early pianofortes , as those of Stein , Mozart 's favourite pianoforte maker .
The great length of the bass strings as carried out on the single belly-bridge , copied from the harpsichord , made it impossible to equalise the striking place for that part of the scale- It was John Broadwood , in 1788 , who first endeavoured to equalise the scale in tension and striking place .
Assisted by Signor Cavallo and the then Dr. Gray of the British Museum , he produced the divided belly-bridge which enabled him to reduce the length of the bass strings , and hence gained a uniform striking place .
He adopted the vibrating length , allowing much latitude in the treble .
C , Kiitzing ( u Das Wissensehaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst,9 ' Bern , Chur , und Leipzig , 1844 , pp. 41\#151 ; 2 ) says the maximum should be and the minimum -g- the length , but that the latter requires a softer hammer to bring out a pleasant tone , and that ^ is much better .
The present head of the house of Broad-wood ( Mr. Henry Fowler Broadwood ) has arrived at the same conclusions , and adopted ^ the vibrating length as the striking place for 1884.1 struck , at one-eiglith of its Length .
his pianofortes .
Kiitzing says that when he was an assistant he had to " equalise " instruments where the striking place was between -j1^-and j- the vibrating length , and it is the latter place which Helmholtz has adopted for his table of experiments ( ibid. , p. 135 ) , in which the 6th harmonic is made very weak , and the 7th disappears altogether .
Now the table I have given shows that though the striking place was adjusted with great accuracy to S\#166 ; the vibrating length , not only the 7th and 9th harmonics , but also the 8th and even the 16th , were brought out distinctly .
The 7th was particularly strong and clear , and the 9th was very good indeed .
The 8th harmonic was not so strong , but it was perfectly clear , and it was got out at three of its nodes .
Of course , it has 7 nodes , but of the 4 where it was not brought out , 2 were nodes of the 4th harmonic , and 1 a node of the 2nd harmonic , and the 8th was , of course , absorbed in these , while the remaining node was the striking place itself .
Perhaps the reason why the 8th harmonic did not disappear was that the striking surface of the hammer was not a perfectly hard edge , but a yielding surface , so that the blow spread on both sides of the intentional striking place , and thus excited the string at very slight distances from the node itself .
But whatever may have been the cause the result was quite distinct , and recognised clearly by Dr. Huggins and Mr. Ellis , as well as myself and Mr. Hartan .
So that there is no doubt whatever that striking with a pianoforte hammer at a node does not obliterate the corresponding harmonic .
For the 16th harmonic there are 15 nodes , 1 at the striking place , 1 between the striking place and the wrestplank-bridge , neither of which could be tried , 3 which were also nodes of the 8th harmonic , 2 of the 4th , and 1 of the 2nd .
The remaining 7 belong to the 16th harmonic alone , and of these it was thought sufficient to try two , which produced the sound quite clearly .
The neighbouring 15th and 17th harmonics also came out well .
These are an additional proof that a pianoforte hammer striking at a node does not destroy the harmonic due to that node .
Subsequently I had an opportunity of trying the middle c ' string of one of Steinway 's grand pianofortes .
This string was 28*75 inches long , and was struck at 3*2 inches from the wrestplank-bridge , that is , at \#177 ; of its length .
I got out the 6th , 7th , 8th , and 9th harmonics just as in Broadwood 's piano , the 6th and 7th both beautifully strong ; the 8th and 9th weaker , but clear and unmistakable\#151 ; a further confirmation of the fact that the pianoforte hammer does not obliterate the harmonic at whose node it strikes .
