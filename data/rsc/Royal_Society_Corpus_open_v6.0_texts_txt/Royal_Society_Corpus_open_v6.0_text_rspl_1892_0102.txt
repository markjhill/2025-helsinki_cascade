] chloral , the curves of temperature show that when the muscles of a limb are made to contract , the temperature of the muscles rises , but falls rapidly as soon as the stimulation ceases , soon returning to the normal .
This is not the case , however , with the brain excited by an electric current .
Here the stimulus gives rise to a more lasting production of heat ; the temperature may continue to increase for several minutes after the cessation of the stimulation , indeed often for half an hour .
This may possibly explain why , upon an electric stimulation of the cerebral cortex , the epileptiform convulsions are not immediately developed , but only appear after the lapse of a latent period of several minutes .
This experiment may be made to show the elective action exercised upon the brain by stimulant remedies .
The injection of 10 centigrams of cocaine hydrochlorate produces a rise of temperature in the brain of 0-36 ' 0 .
, without any change in the temperature of the muscles or of the rectum being observed .
In a curarised dog , the intervention of the muscles being thereby excluded , the action of the cocaine may produce a rise of as much as 4 ' C. in the temperature of the brain , the author having observed a rise from 37 ' to 41 ' C. This shows that in arranging the calorific topography of the organism a high place must be assigned to the brain .
The author concludes by expressing the hope that the comparative study , by the direct thermometric method , of the temperature of the various organs of the body will enable us to push forward our knowledge of the phenomena of life .

The following Papers were read:\#151 ; L " An Improved Apparatus for ascertaining the Sensitiveness of Safety-lamps when used for Gas-testing .
" By FRANK Clowes , D.Sc .
( Lond. ) , Professor of Chemistry , University College , Nottingham .
Communicated by Professor Armstrong , F.R.S. Received March 24 , 1892 .
An apparatus devised for the purpose of testing the sensitiveness of different forms of miners ' safety-lamps , when they are employed for detecting and measuring low percentages of firedamp , has been already described in the 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. ' ( vol. 50 , 1891 , p. 122 ) .
The section of the apparatus ( fig. 1 ) shows that the apparatus consists of a large cubical wooden box or chamber , into the upper part of which the requisite measured volume of methane or firedamp can be introduced , the complete admixture of this gas with the air of the chamber being then secured by swinging up and down a broad wooden flap , the area of which is nearly equal to the square section ot the chamber .
