A paper was then read , entitled , " Remarks on certain Statements of Mr. Faraday , contained in the Fourth and Fifth Series of his Expe ?
rimental Researches in Electricity .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. Dr. Davy complains that Mr. Faraday has , in the paper referred to , made certain statements with respect to the opinions of Sir Humphry Davy relative to the conducting powers of dry nitre , and caustic pot ?
ash and soda , when in fusion by heat , and also with regard to other matters connected with voltaic electricity , which are not correct ; and vindicates Sir Humphry Davy from the charge of want of perspicuity in the statement of his views of these subjects .
A Note by Mr. Faraday on the preceding Remarks by Dr. Davy was then read , in which he replies to the charges there brought forward , andjustifies those statements , the accuracy of which had been impugned by Dr. Davy .
