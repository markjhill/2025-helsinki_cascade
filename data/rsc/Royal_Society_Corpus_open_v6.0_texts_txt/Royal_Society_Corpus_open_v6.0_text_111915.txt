1On the Double Tangents of a Curve of the Fourth Order .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received May 30 , 1861 .
( Abstract .
) The present memoir is intended to be supplementary to that " On the Double Tangents of a Plane Curve , " Phil. Trans. vol. cxlix .
( 1859 ) pp. 193-212 .
I take the opportunity of correcting an error which I have there fallen into , and which is rather a misleading one , viz. the emanants U , , U,. .
were numerically determined in such manner as to become equal to U on putting ( x1z , y1 , z , ) equal to ( x , y , z ) ; the numerical determination should have been ( and in the latter part of the memoir is assumed to be ) such as to render HI , H2 , &amp;c. equal to H , on making the substitution in question ; that is , in the place of the formulae U , l=(X a3+y , b.yz , a ) U , n(n-1 u ; = b ; -i )( a +y a , +z a , )2 u , &amp; e. there ought to have been n-2 3 uT , = ( , + yl , y )2 , &amp; c ( n 2)(_n-_3)( a~+y~ %+ a ) u &amp; The points of contact of the double tangents of the curve of the fourth order or oquartic U=0 , are given as the intersections of the curve with a curve of the fourteenth order II=0 ; such last-mentioned curve is not absolutely determinate , since instead of I1 =0 , we may , it is clear , write +-tMU =0 , where M is an arbitrary function of the tenth order .
I have in the memoir spoken of Hesse 's original form ( say H =0 ) of the curve of the fourteenth order obtained by him in 1850 , and of his transformed form ( say I2= 0 ) obtained in 1856 .
The method in the memoir itself ( Mr. Salmon 's method ) gives , in the case in question of a quartic curve , a third form , say 3I , =0 .
It appears by the paper " On the Determination of the Points of Contact of Double Tangents to an Algebraic Curve , " Quart .
Math. Journ. vol. iii .
p. 317 ( 1859 ) , that Mr. Salmon has verified by algebraic transformations the equivalence of the last-mentioned form with those of JHesse , but the process is not given .
The object of the present memoir is to demolstrate the equivalence in question , viz. that of the equation II--=0 with the one or other of the equations lln=0 , H2-=0 , in virtueof the equation U=0 .
The transformation depends , 1st , on a theorem used by Hesse for the deduction of his second form 2-I=O from the original form fI1= 0 , which theorem is given in his paper " Transformation der Gleichung der Curven 14ten Grades welche eine gegebene Curve 4ten Grades in den Beruihrungspuncten ihrer Doppeltangenten schneiden , " Crelle , t. lii .
pp. 97-103 ( 1856 ) , containing the transformation in question : I prove this theorem in a different and ( as it appears to me ) a more simple manner ; 2nd , on a theorem relating to a cubic curve proved incidentally in my memoir " On the Conic of Five-pointic Corntact at any point of a Plane Curve , " Phil. Trans. vol. cxlix .
( 1859 ) , see p. 385 , the cubic curve being in the present case any first emanant of the given quartic curve : the demonstration occupies only a single paragraph , and it is here reproduced ; and I reproduce also Hesse 's demonstration of the equivalence of the two forms 11 =0 and 11= 0 .
