Ill. " On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion .
" By J. P. JOULE , LL. D. , F.R.S. , and Professor W. THOMSON , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received May 9 , 1860 .
In ouir paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1854 , we explained the object of our experiments to ascertain the difference of temperature between the highanid low-pressure sides of a porous plug through which elastic fluids were forced .
Our experiments were then limited to air and carbonic acid .
With new apparatus , obtained by an allotment from the Government grant , we have been able to determine the thermal effect with various other elastic fluids .
The following is a brief summary of our principal results at a low temperature ( about 70 Cent. ) .

The results at present arrived at indicate invariably that a mixture of gases gives a smaller cooling effect than that deduced from the average of the effects of the pure gases .
