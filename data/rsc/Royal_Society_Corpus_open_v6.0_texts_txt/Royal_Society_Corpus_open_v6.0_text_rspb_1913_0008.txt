) In a previous paper a method was described* by which the percentage saturation of haemoglobin with carbon monoxide can be estimated .
This was done by measuring with a special spectroscope the position of the absorption bands of a solution of blood , since it was found that a definite relationship exists between the percentage saturation with carbon monoxide and the wavelength of the bands .
The principle used in the instrument was one first discovered by Zollner in 1870 and called by him the reversion spectroscope .
Two adjacent reversed spectra were obtained by passing beams through a slit suitably placed in relation to a reflecting prism and a replica diffraction grating , optical means being employed for shifting one of the spectra laterally , so that corresponding points in the spectra might be adjusted into line .
Since first describing the method I have been able to investigate more thoroughly its accuracy both in my own hands and also in those of other observers .
Two different classes of phenomena will receive attention , both of which tend to introduce complications in the use of the method when absolute values for the percentage saturation with carbon monoxide are required .
These are:\#151 ; ( a ) Variations in wave-length determinations made from time to time by same observer on different samples of blood ( personal variation ) .
( b ) Variations in wave-length determination by different observers on same sample of blood ( individual variation ) .
Description of Personal Variation .
As a result of wave-length measurements of the bands of the O2 and CO compounds of haemoglobin , I found that those previously published differed considerably from my own ; further , in these there was found from time to time a small but quite definite divergence .
Both these points are shown in the table below .
It will be seen from the table that by my measurements the change in wave-length of the a-band , when O2 is replaced by CO in the haemoglobin compound , is 53*3 Angstrom units ; *J* a value which is lower than that given by the other observers quoted .
This may have been due to dissociation of * * Journ. Physiol. , ' 1912 , vol. 44 , p. 1 .

the COHb by light , since it was considered inadvisable to employ any screening fluid , in case this influenced the normal positions of the bands .
Ammonium sulphide has the property of rendering the CO compound much more stable to light ; measurements done in the presence of this body gave a value as high as 59 A.U. Variations were , however , still found in the absolute values , in one case the wave-length varied as much as 5'4 A.U. from the typical position .
Alterations in the scale of the instrument were in every case avoided by making the measurements from two standard lines , sodium supplying that for the a-bands , the thallium line 5351 A.U. for the / 3-bands .
These differences in wave-length must be due to one of two causes , either to actual differences in the wave-length of the various blood solutions measured , or to retinal changes brought about by alterations in the intensity of the incident light , or the previous stimuli received by the eye .
Before dealing with the explanation of these phenomena I will proceed with the description of the second , somewhat larger , individual variation .
Description of Individual Vaviation .
Measurements of wave-length carried out by several observers on the same blood solution showed that considerable divergence of opinion could exist as to the apparent positions of the absorption bands .
In this case also the first Mr. H. Hartridge .
Factors Affecting the [ Nov. 1 , question to require consideration was the cause of the divergence , but the effect this might have on the accuracy of the carbon monoxide estimations had also to be investigated .

dhe initial observations of G. W. are given in the table below and are shown plotted as black dots .
But to ascertain how far subsequent readings could be relied on to give the actual percentage saturation of a sample of blood , a further series of isolated readings were made .
These are shown plotted in fig. 1 as white dots , and are given in the table side by side with the actual peicentage saturation present ; it will be seen that the latter readings have an a\eiage error of IT per cent.

Factors Affecting the [ Nov. 1 , Experimental Demonstration of the Factors that Control the Position Boundaries and Mean Wave-lengths of Absorption Bands .
Theoretical considerations showed that the factors of importance are :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The number of molecules of pigment encountered by light in trans* mission ( i.e. concentration x thickness ) .
( 2 ) The initial intensity of incident light .
( 3 ) The activity of the retinal response .
( 1 ) The effects of alterations in concentration or thickness of the solution under examination are well known , having been first investigated by Rollett.* These observations have been repeated with the new method , the results being given in the table below and shown graphically in fig. 2 .
The widths of the bands increase with an increase in concentration or thickness of the solution till a point is reached when fusion of the neighbouring bands takes place .
The mean wave-lengths of the a- and / 3-bands , on the other hand , do not appear to be affected by changes in concentration , and this would point to the bands being symmetrical in form .

It will be noted that a decrease in the intensity of the light tends to make the bands broader , whereas an increase makes them narrower .

Factors Affecting the [ Nov. 1 , also evidence is afforded of the symmetry of the bands .
Limiting the change of intensity to that part of the spectrum occupied by one side of a band still causes the same change as those described above , an increase in intensity making that side of the band narrower , a decrease making it broader , the change being always such as will cause the band , as a whole , to appear shifted away from the side of greater intensity ( see Table V ) .

The increased intensity was obtained by supplementing the light used above by a Nernst lamp , which could be fitted with light filters that transmitted either the orange or green parts of the spectrum .
( 3 ) It is well known that by decreasing the intensity of the light incident on the retina , a point is ultimately reached where no sensation of light can be obtained .
This point is called the " visual threshold .
" The amount by which the light has to be decreased to reach the threshold depends on the activity of retinal response .
This not only varies with the wave-length of the light but also with the stimuli received by the retina previous to the threshold measurement .
Thus , when the previous stimulus has been intense , a light of considerably greater intensity than the threshold may cause no sensation .
Moreover , a stimulus of a certain wave-length not only affects the threshold for that wave-length , but also to a less extent that of wave-lengths on either side ; in cases where the previous stimuli have been very intense and prolonged every part of the spectrum becomes affected .
The position of the visual threshold at different points of the spectrum is one of the factors which determine the appearance of absorption bands ; this is well shown in the case of oxyhemoglobin in Table VI .
Previous stimulation by a bright light causes the threshold to rise and makes the bands become wider ; a fall in the threshold conversely makes 1912 .

them narrower .
Further , if the bands be measured after alteration in the threshold on one side of the band only , then a movement of the mean wavelength of the band will be found to have occurred ; this being in every case towards the side on which the threshold is highest .

the light used was orange .
Lastly , there is another important factor , viz. , contrast , the full effects of which are to receive future consideration .
By comparing in several cases the visual appearance of absorption bands with their spectrophotometer curves , the following observations have been made in nearly every case :\#151 ; ( 1 ) A certain density gradient is necessary for an absorption band to be recognised .
( 2 ) Any gradient that exceeds this tends to be increased in slope by contrast .
( 3 ) Light and dark areas connected by such gradients increase in width .
( 4 ) Areas of high intensity become brighter , those of low intensity darker .
( 5 ) Small density changes within such areas tend to become obliterated .
( 6 ) A line breaking the continuity of a gradient causes a considerable increase in the differences of density on the two sides .
The method of observation and data will appear at a future date .
Fig. 3 shows these six effects , it also demonstrates how contrast impairs VOL. lxxxvi.\#151 ; B. L Mr. H. Hartridge .
Factors Affecting the [ Nov. 1 , the accuracy of measurement , either of the mean wave-length or of the apparent boundaries of bands by the cross-wire and micrometer .
Where such a method is alone available , the use of a broken line is indicated .

A brief theoretical consideration may now be given of the manner in which threshold and intensity of incident light control the appearance of absorption bands .
Any desired value may be given to the density at any point of the spectrum , by causing the incident light , on transmission , to encounter the correct number of pigment molecules .
Any part of a spectrum may therefore be made to fall below the value of the threshold of vision , and , when such is the case , these portions must give to the eye the appearance of uniform black areas having no visible luminosity .
This explains why , by starting with a dilute solution of such a pigment as haemoglobin , and gradually increasing either its concentration or thickness , a point is reached at which a narrow black area appears in the centre of the a-band , and , further , why this area increases in width on either side as the concentration or thickness is further increased , until fusion of neighbouring areas ultimately takes place .
Similar changes may clearly be brought about by altering either the initial intensity of the incident light or the threshold .
In fig. 4 these changes are shown diagrammatically .
Such considerations explain the existence of certain conditions upon which the accuracy of the estimation of CO in blood is found to depend .
As much of the bands as possible should be below the threshold , without the conditions being such as to impair the luminosity of the area separating the a and / ?
components .
These optimum conditions are always aimed at when making CO estimations ; their existence is of great practical importance , and is well shown in fig. 5 .

are to be obtained .
The alterations have been considered above as taking place uniformly throughout the spectrum .
It remains to consider the case when alteration on one side only of a band is involved .
It has been shown above that a rise in the threshold or a fall in the intensity of the incident light both have the same effect , namely , to increase the width of the bands .
Where one side only of a band is affected , it is clear that a change in the mean wave-length of the band will be involved , since one side of the band increases in width , the other remaining stationary .
This will cause the band as a whole to appear shifted towards that side on which the intensity reaches its lowest , or the threshold its highest value .
This is shown diagrammatically in fig. 6 .
It will be remembered , when describing the personal and individual variations in the wave-length of the bands of haemoglobin , that even under the same conditions differences are still found to occur ; these are to be explained as being due to alteration in the threshold .
For observers are agreed that the threshold value for light of different wave-lengths is a factor +6 -4- . .

At A the value of the threshold on one side has been changed ; at B ' and B the normal intensity of the incident light has been altered , moving with it the threshold .
which not only varies greatly with the individual , but is also modified by the quality and time of the stimuli the retina has previously experienced.* In the case of the observer G. W. and myself , a difference of 10 A.U. was found in the wave-length of the bands ; this would point to an abnormality in the threshold values of the green or yellow regions of the spectrum for one of us .
To test whether this was accompanied by any change in the normal intensity of sensation , tests were carried out by Rayleigh 's method , f a yellow being matched with a combination of red and green ; we were unable , however , to demonstrate any difference in our sensation of these colours .
The variations demonstrated above in the visual measurements of wavelength of absorption bands are also to be found when a photographic process has been employed ; for colour , sensitive plates have a threshold at different wave-lengths which depends on the dyes used to sensitise the emulsion .
Further , the actinic value of the light used to illuminate the slit of the spectrograph should be as far as possible adjusted to be of uniform intensity throughout the spectral region under examination .
For this purpose the cadmium arc and similar light sources which yield a number of fine lines of very varying intensity are unsuitable .
When a suitable source has been chosen the true density gradient may be ascertained by determining experimentally the threshold values at nine or ten evenly distributed positions in the desired spectral region .
It thus becomes possible to obtain for the infra-red and ultra-violet portions of the spectrum density curves that are the equivalent of spectro-photometric measurements in the visible spectrum .
It is interesting to observe that the factors of contrast , etc. , here described may in their relation to the phenomena of absorption bands be conveniently * ' Physiology of Special Senses , ' Greenwood , p. 104 .

Summary .
( 1 ) When absolute values of the CO saturation of haemoglobin are required the spectroscopic method is complicated by the fact that each observer must obtain a calibration curve for himself , and this should also be checked from time to time against the blood from the particular source under examination .
( 2 ) These individual differences are due to the particular threshold values at different wave-lengths .
( 3 ) The differences greatly detract from the value of accurate wave-length measurements of absorption bands , both visual and photographic .
( 4 ) They do not , however , prevent accurate CO estimations being made , provided that care be taken to work under standard conditions .

At present the subject of " reflex walking " is one almost entirely neglected by physiologists , yet it is of fundamental importance in the physiology of the nervous system .
For this reason it is desired to lay stress upon it by means of the present paper , which is to be regarded as a preliminary account of a phenomenon which will later be described in greater detail .
The present author has already described certain movements of progression * The expenses of this research have been defrayed by a grant from the Carnegie Trust .
The results here described were embodied in a thesis presented to the University of Edinburgh on March 31 , 1912 .
