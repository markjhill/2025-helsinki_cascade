] INTRODUCTION .
ALTHOIJGH for both theoretical and practical purposes it is important to know the amount of light reflected from the sir .face of glass , and the loss which light suffers in passing through glass , but few accurate experiments appear to have been made on this subject .
Dr. ROBINSON , in the report on the Melbourne telescope ( Phil. Trans 1869 , p. 127 ) , gives an account of experiments made by Lord , Mr. GRUBB , and himself to determine the amount of light transmitted by telescopic object glasses , and through various kinds of flint and crown glass ; he states that Lord ROSSE'S and Mr. GRUBB'S experiments were rruade with a BUNSEN'S photometer , and his own with a ZoLLNER'S photometer .
Dr. ROBINSON assumed the truth of FRESNEL'S formulae , and then calculated the values of the extinction coefficients from the expression modulus ) , where I is the intensity of the emergent light , the thickness of the glass , and the coefficient giving the amount which escapes reflection at the two surfaces .
Mr. ROOD published in the 'American Journal of Science ' for 1870 ( vol. 50 , p. 1 ) an account of some observations he had made , with a modification of BUNSEN'S photometer , of the Ioss which light suffers in passing through crown glass .
He states that the formulae for reflection were originally given by YouNG , and obtained subsequently by POISSON and FRESNEL , but believes that no accurate experiments have ever been made to test their truth .
He used two plates of glass , 15 mm. and mm. thick , and assumed that with such thin plates the loss of light was practically entirely due to reflection .
He found that with one plate , of which the index as , and which therefore should have transmitted per cent. of 30.5.89 the incident per cent. actually passed through ; and with the other , of which the index was ) was transmitted , instead of VOGEL published in the 'Berliner Monatsberichte ' .
1877 ( p. 138 ) some detertions of the absorption of crown , and of two kinds of flint , glass for different arts of the spectrum , but states that , as bhe three glasses were not equally well polished , no conclusion can be drawn as to their relative merits .
NI .
ALLARD Intensit des \ldquo ; 'Annales des Ponts } , ' 1876 , p. 31 ) states that the ) tion of light by the glass which it passes through is giyen " " un formule exponentielle , mais on peut sans grande erl'eur la supposer proporl'epaisseur et raison de par centime de verre trayerse but does not give an account of experiments made to determine the aJnount Since the experiments described in this paper were commen ced Lord RAYLEIGH has published Proc an account of some determinations he has made of the intensity of light reflected from glass at a nearly perpendicular lcidence ; he came to the c.onclusion that " " recently polished glass surfaces have a reflecting power differing not more than 1 cent. that given by FRESNEL'S ; but that fter some months or years the may fall off from 10 to 30 per cent. , and without any apparent tarnish experiments of which I have the honoul of enting an account to Royal Society were commenced in order to determinTe , if possible , the amount of light lost by transmission through glass , without the truth of the formulae for reflection , and also to determine experimentally the amount reflected from the surface of the glass .
It was thought that one way in which this might be effected would be by taking plates of the same kind of glass , but of different thicknesses , and observing the amount of light which passed through ; the reflection the first surface would be the same in all cases , whilst that from the second would only differ slightly in amount , as , owing to the increased absorption of the thickel pieces , less light would reach the second surface ; but , the ption being small , and photometric methods not very exact , it was thought that this would produce any sensible diffel.ence in the results .
It was also hoped that it might be found possible to determine the reflected light directly , , as RAYLEIGH has pointed out .
cit. with reference to Professor ROOD'S experiments , any elTO in the measured amount of the light transmitted woul give rise to a very much greater .
in the estimated amount of the reflected light .
This was subsequently accomplished by measuring the relative in tensities of the i]lumination produced by two Argand gas flames , when from both fell directly on the photometric surfaces , and when the light from one fell directly , whilst that from the other eached the photometer after reflection from the surface of a piece of glass .
AND BY CERTAIN KINDS OF GLA S. were also made ascertain whether in any way the reflective power of the glass ; and the before , \ldquo ; lepolishing were also determined .
The observations were made with five plates of thouse \ldquo ; glass , for which the author is indebted to Mr. KENWARD , the plates mm. , 115 mm. , 15 mm. , , and .
thick respectively , clnd with different thicknesses of Messrs. " " ordinary dense flint A block of this glass procured from Mr. HILGF , , by whom slice 7 .
thick cut off and polished , then the remaindel of the piece formed into a rectan gular block measuring mm. mm. mm. , and the six carefully ished .
Some measurements were made with a piece of ordinary plate lass 6 thick .
The ordinary plate glass was green when seen edgewise , Messrs. glass was slightly green when viewed in the same manner , and the flint glass was distinctly yellow by Mr. KENWARD states that " " the lighthouse glass is of a special , varying slightly from time to ; it is of the nature of hard crown glass The average refractive index for the sodium line of Messrs. hard crown is stated by them to be ] and of their soft ; and in letter which ccompanied the glass its index was said to be " " about or \ldquo ; The refractive indices the sodium line of the crown glass , the flint glass , and the plate glass used in these were determined in the ordinary with small pl.isms made of each kind of glass by Mr. HILGER ; the values found glass 1.5145 , Flint glass glass 1.5274 .
indices of the crown and plate glass were also determined with the wedges of these two of used for the reflection experiments ; that for the crown was found to be , and of the flint ; the refracting angles of these two wedges being only and whilst those of the small prisms were and it seemed probable that the obtained with the lattel were the most accurate , and they were therefore taken as the true values of the indices .

) .
Two similar pieces of looking glass 125 mm. mm. vere fixed vertically ends of a horizontal board ratber more than 2 metres long and 27 cm .
, the lnirror3 being 2 ; a Argand burner , giving a .
in diameter , was fixed opposite the middle point of the line joining the centres of the , and a horizontal distance of 20 .
from the line ; the mirrors were so adjusted that they reflected the light of the lamp towards each other .
A block of wood , resting on four small metal rollers guided by two strips of wood fixed cm .
apart on the upper surface of the horizontal board , carTied the photometel ; an index ) fixed to the wood and a scale , divided into millimetres , to the board , the zero being one of the mirl'ors .
The photolneter of which a description was given in 'Roy .
Soc. Proc vol. p. 27 , and ' Phil. Iag .
, ' series 5 , vol. 15 , 423 , was used Plate ; it consisted essentially of two pieces of white paper so placed that , whilst each was illuminated by one only of the two lights to be compared , both were visible to the observer .
Three pieces of wood were screwed to the block , and between these the eter was placed ; this arrano e , whilst permitting the photometer to be reversed , so that the light from each of the two mirrors could be made to fall first on the one and then on the other paper , ensured its always being replaced in the same position .
The whole arrangement was optically equivalent to two exactly similar sources of light which always etained the same relative intensity , and were a distance apart of a little more than twice the distance between the two A wooden screen placed between the lamp and the observer , and , in order to cut off stray light reflected from the horizontal board , screens , with apertures in them rather larger than the apertures in the photometer box , were placed on either side of it , and between it and the rors ; the edges of the apertures in the screens being formed of metal filed to a edge , theu , together with all the wood work , painted a dead black .
Assuming that the two sides of the Argand flame were equally bright , that the reflective powers of the two looking sses were equal , and that there was no stray light , or at least that there was an equal amount from either side , then at a point midway between the two the intensities of the light reflected the mirrors would necessarily have been equal , and , in order to determine the amount of which ssed through any nsparent substance , it would merely have been necessary AND TRANSMITTED BY CERTAIN KINDS OF GLASS .
to interpose the substance in question between one of the mirrors and the photometer , and determine , by of the photometer , the new position of equality .
But , as such assumptions might be erroneous , the experiments were actually made in the following manner :First , the glass plate was fixed on one side of the photometer , whose position was altered until both papers appeared equally bright ; six readings having been thus made , the glass was then placed on the other side , and six more teadings made .
The glass was then replaced in its original position , and six more readings made , and so on .
After thirty-six readings the photometer was leversed , and another set of thirty-six readings made in the same manner .
In making the readings , the photometer was first placed too much to the right , and then moved to the left till the point at which the illumination was equal was reached ; it was then pushed to the left , and gradually moved back to the right , the papers appeared equally bright , being thus brought to the position of equality alternately from one side and from the other .
order to prevent the possibility of any reflected from the edges of the plates reaching the photometer , the plates were placed either close to it or dose to one of the screens .
For two sets of readings the glass was placed against the opening in the box enclosing the photometer , and for one set against the opening in the screen , except in the case of the thick piece of flint glass , which was too large and heavy to be carried by the block on which bhe pbotometer rested , and which was therefore always placed against one of the screens .
The position of the glass made no erence i measurements .
The percentage transmitted of light falling upon the glass was calculated in the following manner:\mdash ; Half the difference between the means of each set of six observations with the plate on either side of the photometer was taken ; half the distance between the two mirrors , plus or minus this quantity , together with the distance between the lamp and the mirrors , gave the two distances from the at which there was equality of illumination .
The mirrors being 200 cm .
apart and the lamp at a horizontal distance of 20 cm .
from the middle of the line which joined their centres , the half difference was added to or subtracted from 202 Calling these distances and being the lesser , a correction had to be made in the value of for the optical shortening of the path of the light due to its passage through the glass ; this was calculated by the ordinary formula , where is the thickness of the plate , and its refractive index , the distance of the lamp from the glass being sufficiently great to allow the formula for perpendicular incidence to be used without introducing any sensible error .
The percentage amount of light transmitted was given by the expression * Sbrictly speaking , the geometrical , and not the arithmetical , mean of the readings should have been taken , as the intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the distance .

A. B. 6.4 These determinations were carefully made , and the results are fairly concordant ; as , however , this agreement was not inconsistent with the ) of a constant source of error , it appeared desirable to repeat some of them by a different method .
A polarising photometer was , therefore , set up ( Plate 8 , fig. 2 ) , of two Nicols and a right-angled prism ; the Nicols , which were furnished with divided circles and verniers reading to , were placed in the same line , and about 30 cm .
apart , the right-angled prism being between them , and so placed the field of view of the analysing Nicol was bisected vertically by the of bbe prism .
Two pieces of white paper were fixed in vertica ] planes at right angles to one another , both being illuminated by a small Argand gas burner ; one was seen directly through the two Nicols , and the other , through the analyser only , by reflection in the prism .
A blackened diaphragm was fixed between the prism and the second piece of paper , the aperture being of the same apparent size as the circular diaphragm of the ng Nicol .
On looking through the analysing Nicol a circular white field was seen , bisected vertical]y , the two halves being usually of unequal .
On rotating the analysel .

hIean 8 This method is clearly incapable of giving very accurate results .
It is difficult to judge of the equality of the illumination in the two halves of the field , and the ange through which the Nicol has to be turned to make the comparison is small , and , therefore , a slight error in the determination of the value of makes a very considerable one in the result .
The measurements with the polarismg photometer not being entirely satisfactory , another form of photometer was devised Plate figs. .
It consisted essentially of white surfaces illuminated by the same lamp , the light falling very nearly ) on both .
One ce was at a constant from the lamp , whilst tlIe other could be .
to , and moved further from it ; one surface was directly , and the other through the glass to be examined , and then the distance of the movable surface from the llamp altered till both surfaces appeared equally bright .
One surface fixed at a distance of cm .
from the and in the same horizontal plane , whilst the second fixed to a vertical screen , which could be moved backwards and .
forwat.ds by means of a pulley tgut band along board with a divided scale .
The surfaces consisted of a double of white paper , as it found by taking a double thickness the apparent illumination was increased , portion of the light which passed the first paper being reflected back by the second .
In of the lamp two prisms were placed .
They were held in position by two pieces of wood , through which a screw was passed , one prism being htly i advance of the other , and oyerlapping it to a small extent .
To adjust the prisms they were placed on a smooth table , the one resting directly on the table , and other on a thin piece of card , , after adjusted , fixed in position by means of the screw .

The distance of the moveable surface from the lamp , its reflection in the prism and that of the fixed surface 'ppeared equally bright , was determined ( 1 ) without any glass being interposed , 2 ) with a plate of glass between the fixed surface and the prisms , and ( 3 ) between the moveable surface and the prisms , six readings being made of each of these positions , and then the prisms reversed so that the surface which had been seen by reflection in the one was seen by reflection in the other , and six more made .

In order to have obtained really accurate results with this method it would have been necessary to have made a large number of observations , and taken their mean ; but , as the results obtained it , and with the polarising photometer , agreed fairly well with one another and with the far larger number of observations made with the first method , it was thought unnecessary to contirlue the observations , the agreement between those obtained by ] three methods being sufficient to show that there was but slight , if any , probability of a constant error due to the photometer itself used in the first series .

Section If.\mdash ; Amount of Reflecterl at Incidence .
The small percentage of light reflected by glass at a perpendicular incidence rendered its direct determination difficult ; a fxirly satisfactory method of measurement was , however , at length devised .
The principle of the method was the obvious one of comparing the amount of light which reached the photometer when it came direct from the lamp with that which reacbed it after reflection from the glass .
It was found necessary to use two lamps , as no single-lamp apparatus , such as had been used for the transmission experiments , could be employed .
One of the lamps , a small Argand gas burner , was placed at the end of the photometer board ( Plate 8 , fig. 1 ) , and a similar gas burner attached to the arm of a goniometer fixed at a short distance from the other end of the photometer board , the vertical axis of the goniometer being in the prolongation of the median line of the board .
The glass of which the reflective power was to be determined could be placed with its surface vertical , and in the axis of the goniometer .
The nents were made by first comparing the umiIation produced by the two lamps when the light from both fell ctly on the " " photometer the arm of the goniometer carrying the lamp being in the prolongation of the line joining ths fixed lamp and the axis of the goniometer ; the glass plate was then attached to the goniometer with its surface vertical and nearly normal to the line joining the fixed lamp and the axis of the goniometer , the arm of the goniometer otated until the light again fell on the photometer after reflection from the glass plate , and the position of equality determined .
It was not necessary that the illuminating power of the two Iamps should be equal : it was that the ratio between their illuminating powers should remain as nearly constant as possible .
The gas for the two burners came from the same supply pipe , was passed through a bell-and-valve regulator ; in spite of the regulator , it was found impossible to get satisfactory measurements , except in fairly still weather ; the slight in the flames which occurred whenever there was much wind prevented the position of equality of illumination being determined with degree of accuracy .
The measurements were always made in a dark room , " " detector\ldquo ; gas burner being used to read t , he position of the index on the scale ; and , in order to reduce the stray light as much as possible , cylindrical metal chimneys , cm .
in diameter and 18 cm .
in height , blackened externally and internally , were placed round the glass chimneys of the burners , a rectangular aperture being cut in ch at the level of the flame .
Two black wood screens with square openings , similar to ) used in the transmission experiments ( p. 248 ) , were fixed at either end of the photometer board ; there were black cloth screens behind and above the board , and the walls and of the room vere p a dead ; the lnetal cla1np by the grlass plate ; SIR J. AIIOU OF HT attached to the goniometer was made as small as possible and blackened , and the orIiometer itself was covered with a black cloth whilst the observations were being made .
In order to measure the intensity of the ligrht reflected by the glass both when incident normally and at various angles , that to compare the intensity of which under certain circumstances would be partially polarised with the lsity of unpolarised light , it was necessary that the photornetric surface should be normal both to the incident light and to the line of ; hence , the photometer which had been used in the transmission experiments clearly could not be used , nor indeed could a Bunsen 's disk or any of its modifications .
A new form of photometer was , therefore , devised .
Two wooden screens were fixed to the sides of a block 10 cm .
across , similar to the one which had carried the photometer in the first set of nents ; in these rectangular apertures were cut , 3 cm .
by 2 cm .
, and " " parchment\ldquo ; paper fastened over them ; the two right-angled glass prisms which had been used in the third method for determining the amount of the transmitted light Plate were ) laced between the screens , and in a line the 'pertures , The two papers , each illuminated by the light of one of the lamps , were seen by reflection in the prisms , and by moving the block , to which an index fixed , along the photometer board a position could be found in which the two images appeared equally bright .
Glass only reflecting from 4 to 5 per cent. of the light incident normally upon its surface , and the photometer scale being only 2 ) etres long , it was impossible to compare the intensities of the direct reflected light when the two lamps had the same illuminating power .
During the first set of experimen , those marked , the iHerence was ined by keeping the flame of the comparison lamp turned down rather low .
Subsequently , in the determinations marked , the same result was obtained by different sized apertures in the metal chimneys ; that in { he chimney of the goniometer lamp was 10 mm. by 18 mm. , whilst the one in the chimney of the comparison or fixed lamp was only 10 mm. by 6 mm. ; the gas flames were so regulated that the apertures appeared completely filled with a uniformly bright flame .
When the gas pressure changes , the size of a flame , and not its intrinsic brilliancy , is mainly what alters ; and , therefore , by limiting the visible portion of the flame in this a greater onstancy in the ratio between the illumination produced by the two } ) was obtained ; but , the tables , the measurements made when the whole flame , and those in which the central portions only were used , tisfactorily .
This method for determining the reflective power possesses the obvious defect that , owing to the necessary alteration in the course of the light , the direct and reflected light cannot be interchanged , and , , a constant source of eITor may easily exist .
It seems that , to a small extent , such was the case , and that the measured alnounts of the reflected light too When lamp attached to the placed that the lighl , f'ell directly AND TRANSMITTED BY CERTAIN KINDS OF GLASS .
on the photometer , the whole beam of light which passed through the aperture in the chimney fell solely on the screen at the end of the photometer board , and no light diffused from the lamp reached the photometer .
When , however , the laml ) was so placed that the light was reflected from the glass , part of the light fell on the wall of the room , and , .
this was at a distance of about 2 metres and painted black , some light must have been diffused from it the photometer ; the metal clamp also in which the glass was held , although made as small as possible and blackened , certainly reflected some light .
In order to obtain some idea of the amount of light which reached the photometer from these sources , the clamp was fixed to the goniometer without any ; the left half of the field was not absolntely dark , but the amount of illumination was far too slight to be measurable , in fact it was almost imperceptible when the light from the comparison lamp illuminated the other half of the field ; hence , the error from this cause can only be small .
In order to eliminate as far as possible any error due to a change in the relative amount of illumination produced by the lamps , four readings were first made of the position of the photometer when the two halves of the field were equally bright , the light of both lamps falling directly on it ; four readings of the position when the light was reflected the glass were then made ; and then four more with the direct light : the mean of the eight readings taken as the true position of the photometer when the light reached it directly .

In the first set of experiments the distances from the lamps were measured from SIR J. ON AMOUNT OF LIGHT REFLECTED Section of at Perpendicular Incidence after Lord RAYLETGH found Proc that , although the glass surfaces he examined were free from any apparent tarnish , the amount of light they reflected was largely increased by repolishing .
The wedge of crown glass was , therefore , repolished on December 21 , 1887 , by means of a disk of wood charged with ptltty powder and mounted in a lathe ( the same method that Lord RAYLEIGH had used ) , and its reflective power redetermined immediately ; it was found to reflect , instead of , per cent. The glass was again examined on January 5 , 1888 , and it then reflected per cent. Two days later the glass was repolished a second time with fine rouge , and again examined ; it reflected per cent. of incident light .
After an interval of five months , on June 13 , this piece of glass , the surface of which had become considerably tarnished , was rubbed with wash-leather until the moisture deposited on the glass by breathing gently on it evaporated quite uniformly ; it was then examined , and found to reflect per cent. of the incident light .
The next day it was repolished for the third time , and examined immediately ; it reflected per cent. An attempt was made to repolish the flint glass wedge on , ] 888 , with both putty and rouge , but a surface free from scratches could not be obtained .
Its reflective power , however , was increased , and it reflected per cent. , instead of , after this imperfect polishing .
The surface not being ctory , the glass was sent to Mr. HILGEn to be repolished .
It was received back on the evening of March 2 , and examined on the 3rd ; it reflected per cent. After three months the glass was again examined , the film which had formed on its surface having been previously removed by rubbing with a wash-leather ; it only reflected per cent. , although the surface appeared perfectly polished .
On June 11 ib was repolished with very fine washed rouge , and was found to reflect per cent. of the incident light .
Two days later , on June ] 3 , it only reflected per cent. The with putty powder was effected by means of a soft wood mounted in a lathe , the disk being kept moist .
For the rouge a polisher was formed by cementing a piece of silk to a sheet of plate glass fastened to a table , and charging this with carefully washed rouge : the glass was held against the rapidly rotating disk in the one case , and rubbed over the fixed surface in the other .
The relative velocities of glass and polisher were very different in the two cases , and with th ' , disk the friction was sufficiently great for the glass to become sensibly warm .

forc rSection Amount of Light Repolishing .
effect of repolishing on the amount of light transmitted by the glass was examined .
The first observations , those with the mm. plate of crown glass ( except the last ) were made with the photometer used in the reflection experiments , the arm of the gonion1eter carrying the lamp being clamped in the prolongation of the line joining the fixed lamp and the axis of the goniometer .
The small slot in front of the flame of the fixed was subsequently replaced by one of the same as that in front of the lamp carried by the goniometer , and most of the observations made with this arrangement , in which there were two lamps of nearly equal illuminating power .
Finally , a photometer with a single lamp , two mirrors , and inclined paper surfaces , like that used for the original smission experiments , was fitted up , and this was used for all measurements made in August and September , 1888 , is , those with the flint glass and the four last determinations of the light transmitted by tho crown glass .
The measurements were made as described in Section I. , but only four readings were taken in each position of the glass , and the results were calculated out by the expression ( see p. 250 ) , where is the coeflicient of transparency , the distance between the two lights , and and the two positions of the in which there is equality of illumination , the optical of the path of the light due to its passage through the glass being of course allowed for .
The results are contained in Tables XIII .
and of the les before and In order to determine the angles of polarisation , a form of apparatus essentiaily similar to that employed by BECK ( ' POGGENDORFF , Annalen , ' vol. 20 , 1830 , p. 27 ) was used .
It consisted of a goniometer with a horizontal circle reading to 20 the slit and lens of the collimator were removed and the observing telescope replaced by a tube to one end of which a vertical divided circle was fixed .
A Nicol was contained in an inner tube , and by means of a vernier the position of its principal section could be read on the vertical circle to 5 ' .
The of the goniometer and the arm carrying the Nicol were geared together by means of toothed wheels working into a double pinion , the number of teeth in the wheel , and pinion being such that on moving bhe arm of the goniometer carrying the Nicol the angular velocity of the tube was twice that of the A small gas flame was placed close to the end of the collimator tube , the flame being surrounded by a blackened metal chimney with a small aperture in it , and the glass surface whose angle of tion was to be observed clamped to the vertical stage with its surface in bhe prolongation of the ical axis of the goniometer , the stage turned till the image of the was seen through the Nicol , and then , by means of the pinion ( the axis of which was fixed to a sliding piece ) , the stage and Nicol geared together .
The Nicol having been clamped with its short diagonal horizontal , the arm was moved till the light reflected by the glass was reduced to a minimum .
The end of the collimator tube nearest the lamp was bisected by a vertical thread ; a pair of cross threads were placed in the inner end , and a diaphragm with a small aperture at the eye end , of the Nicol tube ; and in making the observations care was taken that the of the vertical thread should coincide with the point of intersection of the two cross threads as seen through the diaphragm .
The observations were made by moving the Nicol tube altel.nately towards the and the left .
As the image of the flame always remained in the field of view , and the room was completely dark , the angle.at which the light was reduced to a minimum could be observed with a fair amount of accuracy .
The amount of light reflected by glass at a perpendicular incidence being small , and a satisfac diagonal eyepiece not being able , the position of the stage in which the light was incident perpendicularly on the surface of the glass was determined by an indirect method .
The axis of the Nicol tube was first , by means of the diaphragm and cross threads , brought into the same line as that of the collimator tube , and its position read on the divided circle of the goniometer ; the tube was then turned through , the glass surface attached to the vertical stage and adjusted , and the stage rotated until the image of the single thread again coincided with the cross threads of the Nicol tube .
AND BY CRTAIN KINDS GLASS .
The reading gave the position in which the light was incident upon the snrface at an of .
To verify the adjustment , the Nicol tube was clamped , first , at an angle differing by , and then at one differing , from its original position .
The reading of the Nicol , when light polarised in the of incidence was cut off , had been carefully determined some years previously , and in verified .
To reduce , as far as possible , the errors due to the Nicol ( which was of the ordinary construction , with its terminal faces not perpendicular to its axis ) , eight were made the prism in one position , and more after it had been turned round through The actual made with the mm. plate of crown glass , which had been repolished by .

Flint glass From the of it would that these two eIlS of glass absorbed somewhat less light than those used in the experiments of which account is contained in this paper , but Dr. RoBlNSON'S results depend on the value of being " " calculated accurately from FRESNEL'S formula and if , as seems probable , glass usually reflects less than the theoretical amount of light , the amount absorbed would necessarily appear less than it really was .

The of for the crown glass is therefore 0359 , and the glass ) The amount of which according to theory should have been reflected by the glass was calculated by the expression , where is the index of refraction .
These values , and also the amount of the reflected light , as directly ( see Tables .
and IX are given in Table XVIII .
TABLE XVIII .
Percentage amount of Light Reflected .
The observed values of the light reflected by the crown glass do not agree quite so those for the flint bolass ; this may be due to the fact that all me surements with the flint grlass were made with one thick block , whilst several pieces of crown glass were used for the transmission experiments , and these plates may have differed slightly both in their composition and in the polish of their surfaces .
Making due allowance for this , and for the approximate character of all photometric measurements , the agreement between the results obtained by two entirely distinct methods probabl quite as close as could have been anticipated .
The calculated value for both kinds of glass considerably exceeds the observed .
As has already been mentioned , the refractiye indices , as determined with the large prisms used for the reflection experiments , and with the small prisms , differed slightly ; the differences , however , \mdash ; 0008 and , are not sufficiently great to affect the result to any considerable extent .
Thus , at a perpendicular incidence the two theoretical values for the reflected light are and for the crown glass , and and for the flint glass , or a ence of and per cent. of the incident light , a quantity which is , of course , quite inappreciable ) ] jotometrically .
Both the crown glass and the flint glass had been recently polished , the former by Messrs. CHANCE and the latter by Mr. HILGER , both kinds of glass having been ground with emery and polished with rouge ; the crown glass was partially machinepolished but finished by hand , the flint glass entirely hand-polished .
The glass were always well cleaned with wash-leather immediately before being used , as after left in the laboratory for some days they were usually somewhat tarnished ; the fihns , however , were easily removed , and in no case could any deterioration of the surface be detected .
The of repolishing the glass was to increase its reflective power , but Tables X. and XI .
show that the two kinds of glass behayed somewhat rently .
Immediately after repolishing both reflected more than the theoretical amount of light ; but , whilst the crown continued to do the reflective power of the flint decreased , and after an interval it reflected the theoretical amount .

By assuming the truth of the theory , the of the refractive index could , of course , be readily deduced from the amount of light reflected at a nearly normal incidence , this being equal to .
Refore repolishing , the crown glass reflected per cent. of the incident light ; hence , the value of would be .
Assuming such was the case , the amount of light reflected by glass at various angles was calculated , and these numbers are given in the fifth column .

The percentage amount of light reflected before and after repolishing and the amount calculated from the observed index of the glass axe represented by the curves on Plate 8 , fig. 4 , where the abscissae the of incidence , and the ordinates the percentages .
The curve for the values deduced from the index calculated from the amount of light reflected normally is not given , as it coincides so closely with the curve for the glass in its state that , in order to render the differences visibie , it would have been necessary to draw the on a much larger scale .
More tions were ma with the glass before repolishing than after , which accounts for the one curve being so much smoother than the other .
results shing increased the amount of the reflected light ; ( 2 ) that before repolishing the amount of light reflected was less than the theoretical amount calculated from the observe index of refraction of the glass , but that in the case of the crown glass , by assuming a value for the index in accordance with the anlount of light reflected at a perpendicular incidence , the amount reflected at other angles by the glass before repolishing was given correctly by the formula ; ( 3 ) that after repolishing the obseryed amount of light reflected exceeded the calculated amount ; ( 4 ) that in case of flint glass what may be described as the " " polishing-effect " " passed off in the course of a day or two , and then the theoretical and actual intensities of the reflected light agreed , but that with the crown glass this did not appear to be the case .
The of repolishing being to increase the amount of light reflected by the glass , it to ascertain whether repolishing would produce any change , and , if so , whether increase or in the amount transmitted .
If the increase in the reflected light were due to a more perfect surface being obtained , and , therefore , to less light being ularly reflected or diffused , the intensity of the transmitted beam would certainly not be weakened by repolishing ; if , however , it were due to an increase in the refractive index of the of the glass , then the intensity of the transmitted beam would be decreased .

show that , except with the mm. of crown glass , the effect of repolishing was to decrease the amount of light transmitted by both kinds of glass ; they also show that , whilst the amount transmitted by the crown glass was the same as when it was first examined , the amount transmitted by the flint glass had increased considerably , although both kinds of glass had been kept during the interval wrapped in soft paper and in the same room .
The mm. plate of clown glass behaved differently from the others .
As is stated in Table XIII .
, it was first cleaned , and the amount of light it transmitted determined ; each surface was then polished for 20 minutes with fine rouge on a silk polisher .
This produced no change , and the plate was , therefore , sent to an optician , who returned it with the statement that it had been " " polished with rouge on pitch , almost dry , to get a high polish The moment the glass was placed in the photometer the polish was seen to be defective , the surface being apparently grained , and , as the shows , its transmissive power was greatly decreased ; it was returned to the optician to be again repolished , and then it let through more light than when first tested .
The values of , calculated with the value of previously obtained ( p. 280 ) , are given in Table XXTI .

These results agree with those obtained by the direct measurement of the reflected light , and show that the effect of the repolishing is to increase the amount of light reflected and to decrease the amount transmitted , and this latter effect must be due to some cause other than a more perfect surface having been obtained .
The polish of the glass plates was examined by holding them close to the aperture in one of the screens of the photometer , and allowing the beam of light from the lamp to pass through the glass , the cross-section of the beam being smaller than the surface of the glass , and all other light being excluded .
If the surfaces had been perfectly polished , they would have been quite invisible , but such was not the case , the shadow cast by the edge of the aperture being just visible in all cases .
Examined in this way , there did not seem to be much , if any , difference between the various plates of crown glass , of which two were in their original state and four had been repolished , nor between them and the four faces of the flint block , of which two had been repolished .
The surfaces of the crown and flint glass wedges used for the reflection experiments did not appear to be quite so good ; the difference , however , was very slight .
The 7 mm. plate of flint glass was much inferior to all the other pieces , the boundaries of the beam of light which passed through it being distinctly visible .
When examined in a strong light there appeared to be a slight film on the surface ; on continued lllbbing with a wash-leather this diminished , and then the surface of the plate , when placed in a beam of in the dark room , was less visible than before .
The inferiority of the surfaces of this plate appeared to be due to the films which had formed on them , and not to any roughness due to imperfect polishing .
The truth of BREWSTER'S law , that the tangent of the polarising angle of a substance is numerically equal to its index of refraction , being generally admitted , it seemed desirable to ascertain the values of the polarising angles for the different ates before and after repolishing .

Sir DAVID BREWSTER stated , many years ( ' Phil. Trans 1815 , p. 126 ) , that glass " " acquires an incrustation or experiences a tion by exposure to the air which alters its po]arising angle without altering its general refractive power and added by the action of heat alone he had produced a variation of in the angle of flint glass .
nalen , made a number of deterlninations of the polarising angles of different kinds of glass , found that there was considerable diffel.ence between the observed values and those calculated from the refractive index , except in the case of surfaces which he himself had ground ) polished ( with emery and colcothar ) .
With one specimen of flint glass the difference was originally ; he then polished it himself , and found that the difference was only ; after being poliQhed by an optician , the difference became SEEBECK was of opinion that these differences were due to the treatment which the glass had received whilst being polished and cleaned , and that lapse of time made no change .
The only experiments he appears to have made on this latter point were with crown glass , the surface of which , as the experiments ] lere recorded show , does not alter , or at least only alters slowly .
Lord RAYLEIGH found Proc that repolishing prisms of rown glass caused a considerable increase in the amou1lt of light they reflected ; but his experiments do not show that when the prisms were first examined by him they reflected less light than when they were originally polished .
CONCLUSION .
It seems probable that the amount of light reflected by ] polished glass varies with the way in which it has been polished , and that , if a perfect surface could be obtained without alte the index of the surface-layer , then the amount would be accurately given by FBESNEL'S formula , but that usually the amount differs from that given by the formula , being sometimes greater and sometimes less .
The formation of a film of lower refractive index on the glass would account for the defect in the reflected light ; but , to account for the excess , it seems necessary to assume the has increased the optical density of the surface-layer , and the changes produced in the amount of light transmitted and in the angle of polarisa- tion support this view .
After being polished , the surface of flint glass seems to alter somewhat readily , the amount of the reflected light decreasing , and the amount of the transmitted increasing , whilst with crown glass the change , if any , proceeds very slowly .
There is no evidence to ) to what particular cause these changes are due .
The values of the transmission coefficients for light of mean refrangibility for the two particular kinds ofglass are given , and show that for 1 centimetre the loss by obstruction amounts to cent. with bbe crown glass , and per cent. with the flint glass .
