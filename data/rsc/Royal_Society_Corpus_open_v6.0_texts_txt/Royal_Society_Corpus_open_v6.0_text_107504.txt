The results of Observations made at the Observatory of Trinity College , Dublin , for determining the Obliquity of the Ecliptic , and the Maximum of the Aberration of Light .
By the Rev. J. Brinkley , D. D. F. R. S. and M. R. L A. and An. drew 's Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin .
Read April i , i819 , OBSERVATIONS have been made by the eight feet circle of the Observatory of Trinity College , Dublin , at the respective summer solstices since the year 18o9 , with the exception of two .
The obliquity of the ecliptic thence resulting , has always agreed so nearly with , that adopted in the French tables , that I have heretofore thought it useless to make any public communication relative thereto .
But some circumstances have now induced me to lay my results before the Royal Society .
The recent publication of Mr. BESSEL'S valuable labours on the observations of Dr. BRADLEY , has afforded us a more exact determination of the obliquity of the ecliptic , as deduced from the early observations by the Greenwich quadrant , than we before possessed .
The comparison of this with the present obliquity , gives us the diminution for an interval of nearly 6o years , with a considerable degree of accuracy , and almost sufficient to enable us to state with some confidence the mass of Venus .
To obtain this point with a greater degree of certainty , the present obliquity , as deduced from a mean of the observations of different astronomers , should be used .
It has been an opinion almost generally received among astronomers , that observations of the winter solstice , have given a less obliquity of the ecliptic than observations of the summer solstice .
The explanation of this seemed very difficult .
But in the above mentioned work of Mr. BESSEL , he calls in question this opinion , and shows that the observations of Dr. BRADLEY give the same result , both in summer and winter .
His own observations also tend to the same conclusion .
The observations of Dr. MASKELYNE , of M. ORIANI , of M. ARAGO , and of Mr. POND , are in opposition to these ; to which my own may be added .
It is not likely that this difference really exists , but it is a question of some importance in astronomy , and the explanation thereof may throw some light on other points .
It is probable the difference arises from some unknown modification of refraction .
I find , and I believe other observers have found the same , that at the winter solstice , an irregularity of refraction takes place for the sun greater than for the stars , at the same zenith distance .
The zenith distance of the sun at this place is then nearly 77 ? .
What Mr. BESSEL has adduced , certainly tends to render the prevalent opinion doubtful .
It therefore appears to me of consequence , that astronomers should pay attention to the observations at the winter solstice .
My observations at that time have been much fewer than in the summer , because , on account of the uncertainty of refraction , I considere( them ( -f ' less importance .
It has been proposed to make the two results agree , by an increase of the quantity of BRADLEY'S mean refraction ; but this could not be done , without increasing it by a quantity greater than can be justified by other determinations respecting refraction .
Considering then this uncertainty respecting the observations of the winter solstice , it appears better to compare the results from Dr. BRADLEY'S summer solstices , with the result as deduced from the mean of the observations of different astronomers .

The above determination of the obliquity by observations near the summer solstice gives ( taking the annual diminution o"043 .
) Mean obliquity Jan. i , 18o00 27 ' 97 56 , o , differing only 1 " from that assumed in M. DELAMBRE'S tables of the sun .
And as far as my own observations are concerned , the diffe .
rence does not exceed half a second .
In M. ZACH'S solar tables , there is given a determination of the obliquity of the ecliptic computed by M. GERSTNER , from a mean of a great many observations of Dr. MASKELYNE'S , made at 9i summer solstices .
Although the results of the several solstices are rather discordant , more so than was to be expected from a fixed instrument , yet it is likely a mean of 173 observations cannot be far from the truth .
This mean is 2$3 ? ?
28 ' 1 1 " , o for 1769 , when reduced to 180o , is 23 27 57,7 , which agrees sufficiently near with the present determination , to show that , if the necessary corrections for the sun 's latitude , &amp;c. had been used , the result would probably have been very exact .
The mean of 102 observations at 17 winter solstices computed by M. GERSTNJER , gives for 1769-23 ? ?
28 ' 3 " ; a result which , after making all possible allowances for the error of the quadrant , is considerably less than that deduced from the summer solstices .
In using the eight feet circle , two or more observations were made a few minutes before the sun arrived at the meridian , and then the instrument was reversed , and observations made after the passage .
The results were carefully reduced to the meridian ; the upper and lower limbs being observed , the zenith distance of the centre was deduced from the instrument itself .
This facility of reversing the instrument seems more likely to produce exact results , than those obtained by a fixed instrument , although from the necessary effect of the action of the sun on the parts of the instrument , the results must be expected to be more discordant than those obtained by a fixed in.strument .
The results of the several observations are as follow .

I also mentioned that it would be desirable to investigate this point , and therefore during the last year , I instituted a course of observations for this purpose , and I beg leave to offer the results thereof .

While these observations were going .
forward , Mr. BESSEL'S work above mentioned was published .
From several investigations in the Greenwich observations of Dr. BRADLEY , he also deduced the maximum = 0o",70 , nearly .
These results certainly appear extraordinary , and are not likely to be acknowledged by astronomers , unless they shall be established by a great number of observations .
My results were computed with great care , allowances being made for the ellipticity of the earth 's orbit .
It is not likely , supposing the velocity of the light of all the stars to be the same , that the result can err more than L of a second.* By continuing the observations , I hope to obtain farther information on this interesting point .
And it appears to be an enquiry deserving of the j )int co-operation of astronomers .
Those instruments which admit of observing each star , without a reference to other stars , seem best adapted thereto .
It is not likely that the maximum of aberration differs in different stars ; yet this ought not to be taken for granted .
The mean N.P. D. Jan. i , 1818 , deduced from former observations , have been put down as a proof of the consistency of my instrument .
C Ursae Majoris is thhe only star in which the difference is worth notice .
Whether this difference is from the error of observation , or from any uncertainty in the proper motion of the star , it is difficult to say .
Three results reduced by BRADLEY'S refraction are as follow .

6 ' 19',99 Mr. POND 's observation , 1815 i 8,99 My observation , 1818 17,67 A comparison of independent results is for many reasons much to be desired .
I offer the above principally with a view of calling the attention of astronomers to such investigations .
It appears to me , that the only method by which an expla .
nation of the difficulties that have occurred , from a comparison of the Greenwich observations and of those made at this Observatory , can be obtained , is from an extensive series of observations of many stars , referring each to the apparent zenith point .
I am therefore pursuing such a course of observations .
Conclusions as to the existence or non-existence of parallax , from comparisons of the relative places of stars taken indiscriminately , must be liable to much uncertainty , whether the comparisons be made by polar distances or by right ascensions .
The former being affected by the uncertainty of refraction , may , at first view , be thought more subject to error than the latter ; but a careful consideration of the circumstances attending the latter method , will show that it has its peculiar difficulties.*
