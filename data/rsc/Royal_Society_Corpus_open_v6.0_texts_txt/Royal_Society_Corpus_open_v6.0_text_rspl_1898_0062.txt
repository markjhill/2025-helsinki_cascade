" On the Determination of the Magnetic Susceptibility of Rocks .
By A. W. ROcker , Sec. R.S. , and W. H. White , A.R.CJ Received July 6 , 1898 , and published during the vacatioi In the Report of the Magnetic Survey of the United Kingdom the question as to how far the local and regional magnetic di : turbances of the earth 's field may be ascribed to the influence \lt ; masses of magnetic rocks was discussed by Professors Rucker an Thorpe.f In a previous paperJ a method for the determination of tl magnetic susceptibilities of rocks was given , together with value for the specimens then examined .
It was considered desirable to ad to this relatively small number of results so as to obtain a broad* basis for the development of the theory .
Accordingly Sir Archibal Geikie , P.R.S. , Director-General of the Geological Survey , has bee good enough to supply us with a typical series of specimens of tb basic rocks of the country , and , after a complete overhauling of tb method originally adopted , we have measured the susceptibility c sixty-eight of these new specimens of forty-five different rocks .
Tb earlier stages of the work were carried out by Mr. P. Fisher , A.R.C.S who would , no doubt , have taken part in the whole had he not leli the college for an appointment elsewhere .
The principle of this method of determining the susceptibility C1 small pieces of feebly magnetic materials is to compare the suscept ; bility of the fragment with that of the displaced volume of liquid of known susceptibility in which it is immersed .
In more detail , the method is as follows:\#151 ; ( a ) To measure the susceptibility of the magnetic liquids a tub containing the liquid is introduced into one of two equal solenoid* the effects of which on a small magnetometer destroy each other .
I| these experiments a field of seven absolute units was employed , ratio of the deflection caused by the tube of liquid to that produce* by a measuring solenoid traversed by a small current , multiplied bj the computed constant of the instrument , gives the absolute sut| ceptibility of the liquid .
_JB The apparatus was figured and described on pp. 506 509 , ' Roj Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 48 , 1890 .
( b ) The differences of susceptibility of rocks and liquids are measured on the calibrated sonometer scale of a Hughes inductjjj balance .
Two tubes , filled with a liquid to the sufficient depthJB 6 cm .
, are balanced , and the distance through which the compensall| * ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 188,1896-f Vide pp. 637\#151 ; 647 and map 14 .

Determination of the Magnetic Susceptibility of Rocks .
461 has to be moved to produce silence after the introduction of a small piece of a rock into one of the tubes is noted .
This is repeated with liquids of different strengths .
Then if a , b are the differences observed between the rock of susceptibility x and two liquids of \#166 ; susceptibility Jcl } k2 respectively , we have \#166 ; due regard being given to the signs of the differences .
The liquid employed was pure glycerine in which finely divided magnetic oxide of iron was suspended , for no solutions of metallic salts possess a susceptibility sufficiently high for our purpose .
These liquids were very carefully prepared , and in the light of the experience now gained it is desirable to add to the statements made in the earlier paper on this point .
Natural magnetite cannot be ground fine enough to remain long in suspension , though experiments in which a coarsely powdered mixture of magnetite and manganese dioxide ( minerals of about the same specific gravity ) was shaken in water and allowed to settle rapidly into a solid mass were fairly successful .
I Finally , the magnetic oxide was prepared artificially by adding ammonia to a boiling solution of sulphate of iron of which one-half had been oxidised by nitric acid .
The black precipitate , dehydrated by alcohol and dried at 100 ' , gives a friable dark brown mass about one and a half times as magnetic as a good specimen of the powdered funineral .
By grinding with glycerine between glass plates the oxide is reduced to minute yellow scales .
Glycerine mixtures made with this substance give no indications of settling for forty-eight hours .
Numerous experiments with various suspensions of natural magnetite called attention to the fact that in a magnetic field the particles rotated slowly to set their axes along the lines of force , thus giving a fictitious susceptibility largely dependent on the permanent magnetisation of the grains of magnetite .
With the artificial oxide this effect is extremely small , but , to avoid it altogether , we prepared gelatinised glycerine mixtures which at ordinary temperatures become solid .
In this state we repeatedly determined , firstly , their absolute susceptibility with the magnetometer apparatus , and , secondly , the value in sonometer scale divisions of each balance tube filled with the jelly .
With these particular tubes one division = susceptibility | 00001075 .
The balance tubes being thus standardised , the absolute I magnetic value of a liquid is determined by the induction balance !
under exactly the same conditions that hold during the tests of rocks .

Sensitiveness and Accuracy .
The errors arising from various sources have been carefully considered .
They naturally fall into two groups\#151 ; First .
Errors in the determination of the primary standard of susceptibility , and affecting all results equally .
Second .
Errors affecting individual specimens .
1 .
Under the first heading come the probable errors in the magnetometer constant and readings .
In the value of the constant there is an estimated probable error of + 1 per cent. Combining with this several smaller errors due to temperature , variation of resistances , imperfect adjustment , external magnetic disturbances , \amp ; c. , we conclude that the susceptibility of each standard jelly is subject to a probable error + 2 per cent. The two jellies actually gave factors 0*000109 and 0000106 ( the error of constant being the same in each case ) .
0'0001075 is ivithin + 2 per cent , of the truth .
2 .
Errors in the values of individual rocks arise from the limited sensitiveness of induction balance , telephone , and ear .
The values of the magnetic liquids are not appreciably affected by this , but it becomes important in the case of rock specimens of small size and feeble susceptibility .
In the earlier paper already referred to it was stated 0*00013 was the lower limit to the range of measurement by the methods adopted and experiments made since with magnetic and non-magnetic substances indicate about the same degree of accuracy .
For moderate susceptibilities , however , the accuracy now attained has been greater than in the earlier work , and the errors cannot in most cases be much greater than per cent. The difference between two specimens taken from the same rock is of course greater than this , as the composition of the rocks is not uniform .
It is not necessary to give a detailed example of an experiment .
Suffice it to say that in a particular case the susceptibility of the rock ( No. 2 ) was determined by comparison ( 1 ) with liquids H and ) D of susceptibilities 0 00074 and 0*00357 , and ( 2 ) with liquids H and C of susceptibilities 0*00074 and 0*00250 .
The results obtained were 0*00164 and 0*00179 , the mean being 0*00172 .
The agreement of these two values is not particularly good , thought not exceeding the probable error given above .
^ fl For some unrecorded reason this specimen was tested again , and gave\#151 ; From D and H/ , x = 0*00174 " 0 and H ' , a ?

463 and C taken together , for that would introduce extrapolation , which we avoid as mnch as possible .
In the case of the three specimens of susceptibilities greater than O'Ol we are compelled to extrapolate beyond our strongest mixture , and with the eighteen specimens below 0*001 we make our weakest mixture a factor in the extrapolations .
In some instances ( e.g. , No. 45 ) there is a very distinct difference in the strength of two pieces broken off the same hand specimen .
A few of the specimens used in the earlier investigations were re-examined , and gave considerably larger susceptibilities than those previously measured .
This is probably due to an error in the determinations of the absolute value of the susceptibilities of the liquids employed , but in the case of any individual rock this error would not exceed the difference often observed between two different fragments of the same specimen .
The fact also that the mean value now obtained is almost exactly the same as that formerly given ( viz. , 0*00255 as against 0*00245 ) justifies the conclusions based upon the use of this or the smaller number ( 0*00160 ) which was used in many of the calculations on the magnetic effects of basaltic rocks .
The accuracy of the absolute values now given has been tested by experiments on ferric chloride .
Although the susceptibility of this substance is much smaller than that of most of the rocks , the result of our measurements was in close accord with the means of values deduced from the experiments of Quincke and Townsend .
