" Polacanthus Foxii , a large undescribed Dinosaur from the Wealden Formation in the Isle of Wight .
" By J. W. Hcjlke , F.R.S. Received January 3 , 1881 .
( Abstract .
) A description of the remains of a large Dinosaur , discovered in 1865 by the Rev. W. Fox , in a bed of shaly clay between Barnes and Cowleaze Chines , in the Isle of Wight .
Head , neck , shoulder-girdle , and foreribs were missing , but the rest of the skeleton was almost entire .
Some of the prsesacral vertebree recovered show a double costal articulation .
In the trunk and loins the centrum is cylindroid , relatively long and slender , with plano-concave , or gently biconcave ends .
Several lumbar centra are ankylosed together , and the hindmost to the sacrum .
The sacrum comprises five relatively stout and short ankylosed centra of a depressed cordiform cross-sectional figure .
The front sacral vertebrae have a stout short centrum .
The limb bones are short , their shafts slender , and their articular ends very expanded .
The femur has a third trochanter , and the distal end of the tibia has the characteristic dinosaurian figure .
The back and flanks were stoutly mailed with simple , keeled , and spined scutes , and the tail was also sheathed in armour .
The animal indicated by these remains was of low stature , great strength , and probably slow habits .
It is manifestly a Dinosaur , and is considered to be very nearly related to Hylceosaurus .
