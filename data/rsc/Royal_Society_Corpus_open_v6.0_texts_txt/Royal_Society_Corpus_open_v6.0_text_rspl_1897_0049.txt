By the aid of the cone condenser and the method described by us in another communication , * we have studied the changes produced in the dielectric constants cf ice at and above the temperature of liquid air when the ice has suspended in it insoluble metallic oxides or else has dissolved in it soluble metallic oxides or hydrates .
We have also examined the dielectric properties of some of these oxides and hydrates when dissolved in other menstrua frozen and reduced to very low temperatures .
The experiments were conducted exactly as described in the communication above mentioned , and the frequency of the electromotive force reversals was , as before , 120 .
In the following tables the four columns of figures give respectively the platinum temperature of the dielectric , the scale deflection of the galvanometer , representing the capacity of the condenser with the selected dielectric , when corrected for voltage and capacity of the leads and vibrator ; the deduced dielectric constant , and the electromotive force at which the charging of the condenser was conducted .
The figure given at the head of each table as the corrected galvanometer deflection with air as dielectric , represents the capacity of the condenser with gaseous air at normal pressure and temperature as its dielectric .
The hydrates dissolved in water or other media , or the oxides in a very fine state of division , suspended in water , were introduced by means of a pipette , as the dielectric into the cavity of the cone condenser .
This liquid dielectric was then frozen and reduced to the temperature of liquid air by lowering the whole condenser into a large vacuum vessel holding several litres of liquid air .
As soon as the dielectric was reduced to the temperature of 188 C. the observations for capacity and temperature began .
In all cases an observation was taken for electric conductivity and the dielectric measurements were stopped the moment any sensible conductivity made its appearance .

It will he noticed that the dielectric constant of the ice having in suspension particles of oxide of copper has an exceedingly high value , even at the temperature of liquid air , and , moreover , shows no signs of becoming reduced .
We suspected that this might be due to the conductivity of the oxide of copper particles , which , though separated and insulated by ice at a low temperature in such fashion that the whole mass is a good insulator , may yet raise the value of the average dielectric constant .
We tried suspending sulphide of copper in ice , but in this case found the material , as a whole , had such conductivity that we could not make any dielectric measurement by the method used .
With this exception , all the other frozen oxides and hydrates suspended or dissolved in ice had a very high resistance .
We then tried dissolving the oxide of copper in ammonia .

Before drawing conclusions as to the dielectric power of these-oxides and hydrates , it seemed important to try the effect of suspending in ice small quantities of inert particles , and we theiefoie selected finely divided gold and precipitated sulphur as instances of a good conductor and a good non-conductor in very fine states of division .
These finely divided materials were suspended in water and frozen and the dielectric constants taken as follows : Dielectric Constant of Ice , having in suspension a small quantity of finely divided Gold .

The results show that practically no influence is produced upon the dielectric quality of the ice at very low temperatures when it is impregnated either with conducting particles of gold or non-conducting particles of sulphur .
The amount of gold in the ice as used by us is no doubt small .
In each case the dielectric constant of the material is very close to that of the ice obtained from pure distilled water .
The electrical resistance of the ice slightly impregnated with finely divided gold did not appear to be less than that of ordinary ice .
To the tests we applied the one appeared to be as good an insulator as the other .
The foregoing observations are graphically delineated in the diagrams in figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 , according to the magnitude of the dielectric constants found .
The following facts may then be noted ( i ) The presence of ccesium hydrate , lithium hydrate , bismuth oxide , aluminic oxide , finely divided sulphur or finely divided gold , in the percentages used by us , in ice makes little or no difference in its dielectric power when cooled to the temperature of liquid air .
( ii ) The presence to about the same extent of the hydrates of potassium , sodium , rubidium , or the oxides of copper , iron , or lead , causes a very great increase in the dielectric power of the ice at that low temperature .
( iii ) The dielectric curves are , however , all seen to be tending downwards in such a way as to show that at still lower temperatures it is probable the effect of the oxides or hydrates would be annulled and the dielectric constants of all be reduced to a value not far from that of pure ice .
( iv ) The exception to this tendency , so far as yet observed , appears to be in the case of the oxide of copper , which , when suspended in ice , causes it to possess the remarkably high dielectric value of 150 even at the temperature of liquid air .

It is possible , however , that in this case the conductivity of the yet insulated particles of oxide may account for the result .
( v ) The effect of the solvent or menstruum upon the dielectric constant is also exceedingly marked .
Thus the oxide of copper suspended in ice has a dielectric constant of about 150 at \#151 ; 185 ' , the oxide of lead suspended in ice has a value of about 80 at the same temperature .
If , however , the oxide of copper is dissolved in ammonia and frozen , the dielectric constant of this at -185 ' falls to 2 % whereas if the oxide of lead is dissolved in 5 per cent , solution of caustic potash and frozen , the dielectric constant rises to 170 at the temperature of liquid air .

The only general conclusion that can as yet he drawn experiments described is that the presence of certain oxides or hydrates of metals in ice , even to the extent of not many per cent. , has an immense influence in raising the dielectric power of the ice when taken at the temperature of liquid air , whereas the presence of other oxides or hydrates chemically analogous has har y any influence at all .
