" By Charles Brooke , M.B. , F.R.C.S.E. Communicated by G. B. Airy , Esq. , F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal .
The author enters into fuller details than he had done in his former communication to the Society , which was read on the 18th of June , respecting the construction of the instrument , the preparation of the highly sensitive photographic paper employed in the process , and the minute adjustments necessary for ensuring accuracy in registering the results .
In a supplement to the above paper , the author describes the methods he has contrived for obtaining a similar automatic registration of the heights of the barometer and thermometer , by suitable additions to the same apparatus which registers the magnetic variations .
