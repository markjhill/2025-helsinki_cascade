) I. Introduction.\#151 ; Investigations of amplitude for continuous sounds produced in a telephone by alternating current have been made by Lord Rayleigh , * Frank .f Cross and Mansfield.| Lord Rayleigh found by an indirect process the value 0-05 / u-yu .
for frequency 512 , and 0-7 / qa f'r frequency 256 .
Other values found by Lord RayleighS are : 0'8 / qa ; 1'27 ya/ a. Toepler and Boltzmann obtained results of the same order .
These results cannot be tabulated as the conditions are different , and in some cases unknown .
Frank , by more direct measurement , obtained a value 1*2 yqa .
The present writer11 found by direct measurement a value 04 / qa in the case of an impulsive sound .
In each of these researches the micrometer was not sensitive enough to actually measure the least-audible amplitude ; the relation of current to amplitude was determined for relatively large amplitudes , and separate measurements were made of the current which gives the least audible sound .
Extrapolation then gave the amplitude in question .
The present writer measured as little as 24 / qa , so that he was less likely to err in using extrapolation than Eranke , whose smallest observed amplitude was 52 / qa .
The present paper shows how the amplitude of the smallest audible sound can be measured directly without extrapolation ; it is even possible , as the tables show , to measure movements whose amplitude is too small to be audible .
With the instrument described in the previous paper , IT movements as small as 04 / qa can be observed ; the minimum audible has been again investigated on the same lines as before .
The value obtained for a sensitive ear is 0'7 / qa , as shown below .
It refers to a telephone of usual construction whose diaphragm fundamental is about 580 , the sound being perceived by the right ear of the writer , expecting the sound .

The Amplitude of the Minimum Audible Impulsive 361 II .
Method.\#151 ; There are two distinct parts in the determination :\#151 ; A. Observe the position of the diaphragm ( see iig .
1 ) at rest by making contact pq , draw away p by working the lever system , and pass a steady current through the telephone , so as to move the diaphragm to a new position of rest .
Fig. 1 .
Now move up p slowly towards the diaphragm , watching the micrometer screw ( fig. 1 , last paper ) , and listening for contact .
Thus measure the movements due to a set of steady currents down to such small ones as cause imperceptible motion .
Plot the relation between movement and current .
B. Apply the ear to the telephone and pass through the same set of currents as in Section A. For each current , except the smallest ones , a sound is heard when the key is released .
We thus learn the relation of current to audibility ; the curve in Section A gives at once the relation of amplitude to audibility .
The sound is impulsive , for the diaphragm is released from a position of strain , vibrates under considerable damping , and soon comes to rest .
Both right and left ear were used .
Speaking generally , both ears would be considered to be normal , but as the writer has had great practice in listening to faint telephone sounds with the right ear , probably that is abnormally acute .
The research was conducted in a vault below ground between 12 o'clock and 4 o'clock at night , so that extremely quiet conditions prevailed .

The Curves I and II refer to one instrument .
" III " IY " another instrument .
Curve IY2 is for the second instrument rendered less sensitive .
The curves are not simple in form , which may be partly due to errors in measurement , as we are near the limit of the instrument .
But , as in the former paper , * it is obvious that , according to the exact tightening of the diaphragm , we obtain a different characteristic curve for it .
Thus III and IV are for the same instrument , but no doubt the clamping conditions are different in the two cases .
IV .
Results.\#151 ; In the curves the cross lines show where the sound is just audible for the right ear , the circles where it is just audible for the left ear .
Averaging the results , we obtain 0*7 / x/ x for the right ear and 0-9 fxfx for the left .
On reference to the first section of this paper , it will be seen that the above result for impulsive sound is in close agreement with those obtained by Rayleigh , Boltzmann , and others for continuous sound .
The fundamental of the diaphragm when clamped hard to the case was found , by testing it against tuning-forks , to have frequency about 580 .
Throughout the amplitude measurements care is taken to clamp the diaphragm firmly , so as to insure that its movements are purely flexural .
In the former paperf a scale of loudness was drawn up .
It now stands amended in column A. * Loc .

5000 1000 The word " just " here implies , in each case , the lower limit .
The amplitude of the diaphragm must not be confused with that of the air which it vibrates .
Lord Rayleigh* obtains a relation between these two amplitudes by considering the space between diaphragm and tympanum of the ear to be an air-tight cylinder , the diaphragm acting as a piston moving at one end .
Roughly speaking , the ratio of the two amplitudes is 5:1 Using this factor , we obtain column B for air amplitudes under the conditions of the above experiments .
Though 0T4 is the smallest audible amplitude in air to an expectant ear when the conditions as to silence are exceptionally favourable , yet 10 / /.g is the amplitude for the smallest audible sound in air about which the ear can be quite sure when the conditions are normally favourable and the ear not listening for the sound .

Y. Large Sound Amplitudes.\#151 ; It is difficult , or even impossible , to measure the air amplitude near the source of a great impulsive sound\#151 ; e.g. , an explosion , but indirectly we can obtain some idea of this large amplitude by observing the distance at which the sound is distinctly just audible , and applying the law of sound radiation .
If the radiation be cylindrical , i cc a2 , or ax2ri = a22r2 .
( I ) where i \#151 ; intensity , a\ , a2 amplitudes at distance from the source .
This would occur if the source were a long line or if the radiation took place between near parallel walls .
If , however , the radiation be spherical , and the source be one of simple expansion and contraction around a centre , oc a2 , or axrx = a2r2 .
( II ) This occurs in an atmosphere of uniform temperature and free from distinct strata .
But in reality there are ( 1 ) reflections upwards produced from the earth , ( 2 ) reflections downwards from damp layers in the upper air , ( 3 ) total reflections from upper or lower layers of higher temperature , and therefore higher sound velocity , ( 4 ) deflections due to air-currents .
The spherical law will give us a basis for rough calculations , but the many anomalies in sound transmission are due to these deflections , and not to any truly cylindrical radiation .
One or two examples , in which we know data , are given:\#151 ; Thunder.\#151 ; This has a vertical line-source , but for a distant observer it becomes a point-source .
If 10 miles be the maximum distance at which it can be heard , expression II gives , taking = 2 yards , ax = 1/ 12 mm. This value for rx might be possible .
It should be observed that is at most 1/ 12 mm. , probably much less , for near a. line-source cylindrical radiation would occur .
Cannon-Firing.\#151 ; This is an instance of a simple point-source .
If 30 miles be taken to be a maximum distance for the sound to carry , the amplitude at a place two yards to the side of the muzzle of the gun where the nearest gunner stands would be about 1 / 4 mm. This seems to be the largest sound amplitude of which we have any knowledge .
The case recorded in 'Knowledge , ' June , 1901 , in which firing was heard at 140 miles from the source , is peculiar .
Some deflections must have 366 The Amplitude of the Minimum Audible Impulsive Sound .
occurred , for over a wide zone of from 10 to 50 miles from the source no sound was heard .
Volcanic Eruptions.\#151 ; The sound commences not at a point , but over a large horizontal area .
Suppose the greatest distance to which sound carries is 500 miles , the amplitude at one mile from the source would be 1/ 200 mm. In the great eruption of Krakatoa , sounds were heard 5000 miles away .
If the sound really " travelled through air ( and not through the earth ) , it must have had a succession of reflections to take it round nearly one earth-quadrant .
In making these estimates of large amplitudes ( which are intended to show merely the order ) the spherical law is considered to hold good while amplitude varies from 10 / i/ jl to 100,000 or more .
This is not strictly true ; but the errors caused by deflections in the atmosphere are uncertain plus and minus quantities , at least as large as those involved in taking the spherical law to hold throughout , so that it would be practically useless to attempt a more accurate calculation .
I am glad to acknowledge my indebtedness to the Royal Society for two grants of money whereby I have been able to develop these researches .
