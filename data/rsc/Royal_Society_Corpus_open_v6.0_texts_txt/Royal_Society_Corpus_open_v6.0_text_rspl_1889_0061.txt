" A Compound Wedge Photometer .
" By E. J. Spitta , L.R.C. Phys , Lond. Communicated by Capt. W. DE W. Abney , C.B. , F.R.S. Received November 8 , 1889 .
The idea of employing a wedge of neutral-tinted glass as a photometer has occurred to many observers\#151 ; Dawes , Captain Abney , and others\#151 ; and notably of late years to Professor Pritchard , of Oxford , who has produced with such an instrument his well known ' Urano-metria Nova Oxoniensis , ' a catalogue of the relative brightness of the brighter stars north of the equator .
But the use of such an instrument has always been limited hitherto to the comparison of the relative intensities of such points of light as the stars present , its employment upon objects of sensible area being foreign to the ideas and requirements proposed in its construction .
Having , however , attempted to use a photometer of this description upon disks of small but of various areas illuminated by a known amount of light , the discordances of the results forced upon me the necessity of modifying the construction of the photometer in a way which I believe will extend its sphere of usefulness .
It is not within the scope of this paper to give any detailed account of the many experiments I have made with several wedges , but it is sufficient to say that the wedge-form itself has been fully proved to be an important factor in the production of the discordances to which reference has been made , for the following reasons :\#151 ; A point of light from its very definition implies that no sensible portion of the wedge is occupied in its passage , but it requires very little thought to perceive that when an area of sensible dimensions is being dealt with this is by no means the case .
Moreover , an elementary inquiry suffices to point out that if the area possess a considerable diameter the light emanating from its lateral portions will impinge on different thicknesses of the wedge , as shown to an exaggerated degree in fig. 1 , where AB is the transverse diameter of the area , and CDEF the portion of the wedge employed .
It is evident if the differences in intensity be required between two disVa 16 Mr. E. J. Spitta .
[ Dec. 5 , of the same diameter this condition of things would not affect the validity of the final results , but it is equally apparent that were the disks of differing diameter the values obtained could not but be seriously affected .
Let it be presumed that two such different-sized disks were under consecutive examination , as shown in fig. 2 , AB Fig. 2 .
representing the diameter of one and CD that of the other .
In the case of AB it is manifest that the extreme limb B would be fainter to all appearance than the opposite edge A , because the light issuing from it has to traverse a portion of the wedge EF , thicker and so more dense than E'F\ On consideration , it is equally obvious that the limiting margin A will be the last to appear as the wedge is made to move from right to left till disappearance takes place , the position technically spoken of as " the point of wedge extinction .
" But if CD , the larger disk , be illuminated with light of the same initial intensity as fell on AB , it is evident that the point of wedge extinction ( technically so-called ) for CD at the limb C will not be at the same wedge-reading as in the previous case ; in fact , disappearance would not occur until the portion of the wedge corresponding to the hne E'F ' had been moved to occupy the position shown by the line E F .
Hence , when ascertaining what is termed the wedge-interval m the direct comparison , say , of the relative intensities of a large and small disk , it is very obvious an error entirely due to the physical nature of a wedge must inevitably result , such error being in direct proportion to the amount of shift required , which depends upon the relative differences in diameter of the disks under observation .
ot mg is here said of the difficulties of observation , which are enormously increased by the different apparent intensities of the light at the extremities of the diameter parallel to the length of the wedge , because I merely wish to call attention to the error resulting from the employment of the wedge-form itself .
To apply a correction under these circumstances was not deemed pe lent , even if found to be practically possible ; hence the removal ' e souice of error has been arrived at by devising an instrument of 1889 .

17 different construction , to which the term Compound Wedge Photometer has been applied , and of which the following is a brief description Two very thin wedges of neutral-tinted glass are made to slide past one another with a Uniform rate of motion by the turning of a single milled-headed screw , the idea of the arrangement being dia-grammatically set forth , so far as the wedges themselves are concerned , in fig. 3 , where it will be seen that any amount of density , within Fio .

certain limits , can be obtained by equal movement of the two wedges , although a uniformly absorptive area in all parts of the field is rigidly maintained .
In the figure , ABC is shoWn as one wedge , DEP the other , and VIEW the field of view .
A cursory inspection of the arrangement at once reveals its most salient advantages , and the fact that any sized disk within the limits of the field of vision will be obscured by the same density of neutral-tinted glass at any and all parts of its image , and hence that the cause of error spoken of as arising from the use of a single wedge is at once removed .
An instrument so constructed has been subjected to several months ' crucial testing , and I have no grounds for thinking it does not fulfil the requirement for which it was devised .
In its final form the arrangement differs from that usually met with as suggested by Professor Pritchard , for it is supplied with a rotating disk of metal , perforated at intervals to allow the permanent insertion of pieces of neutral-tinted glass of different thickness , each of which can be evaluated for magnitude and used as a constant .
