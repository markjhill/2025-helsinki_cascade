, the triceps , muscle can be evoked is separate from ( that is to say not the same as ) that area whence excitation evokes contraction of the triceps ( or of that part of the triceps , inhibition of which is now referred to ) .
On the other hand , the area of the section of the internal capsule , whence inhibition of the muscle is elicited , corresponds with the area whence contraction of its antagonistic muscles can be evoked .
Yet synchronous contraction of such , pairs of muscles as gastrocnemius and peroneus longus is obtainable from the cortex .
The observations make it clear that 11 reciprocal " in antagonistic muscles is obtainable by excitation of the fibres of the internal capsule .
It is probable , therefore , that the inhibition elicit-able from the cortex cerebri is not due to an interaction of cortical neurons one with another .
The variety of nervous reaction in which I have been able to establish existence of the reciprocal form of muscular co-ordination is now pretty extensive .
In some the condition described in the previous ( 3rd ) Note ( the state shown to ensue upon removal of the cerebrum , and in that Note spoken of as " decerebrate rigidity " ) was conducive to the result ; in others the cerebrum was of course not removed .
The reactions examined for the phenomenon with positive result include those initiated by excitation of ( 1 ) the skin and skin nerves ( with " decerebrate rigidity " ) , ( 2 ) the muscles and afferent nerves of muscle ( with " decerebrate rigidity " ) , ( 3 ) the dorsal ( posterior ) columns of the cord ( with u decerebrate rigidity ( 4 ) of the cerebellum ( with \lt ; ldecerebrate rigidity ' " ) , ( 5 ) of the crusts , cerebri ( with " decerebrate rigidity " ) , ( 6 ) of the internal capsule , ( 7 ) of the optic radiations , ( 8 ) of the Rolandic cortex , ( 9 ) of the occipital ( visual ) cortex .

S. S. , November 3 , 1897 , : " On certain Media for the Cultivation of the Bacillus of Tubercle."* By Arthur Ransom , M.D. , F.R.S. Received November 13 , \#151 ; Read November 25 , 1897 .
In May , 1894 , a communication was made to the Society by Professor Delepine and myself , " On the Influence of certain Natural Agents on the Virulence of the Tubercle-Bacillns .
" * By permission of the Royal College of Physicians , this research , which forms a portion of the Weber-Parkes prise essay , is communicated to the Royal Society before publication .
The cost of the inquiry is defrayed by the Thrustim prize , presented to the author this year by Gronville and Caius College , Cambridge .
p 2 3 88 Dr. A. Ransom .
certain Media for The conclusions drawn from the experiments recorded in this paper \#166 ; were:\#151 ; ( 1 ) That finely divided tuberculous matter , such as pure cultures of the bacillus , or tuberculous matter derived from sputum , in daylight and in free currents of air is rapidly deprived of virulence .
( 2 ) That even in the dark , although the action is retarded , fresh air has still some disinfecting influence ; and ( 3 ) That in the absence of air , or in confined air , the bacillus retains its power for long periods of time .
These observations afforded an explanation of the immunity of certain places , and the danger of infection in others .
They show that where tuberculous sputum is exposed to sufficient light and air , to deprive it of virulence before it can be dried up and powdered into dust , no danger of infection need be dreaded .
It would appear further , from this research and others , that it is only when there is sufficient organic material in the air , derived from impure ground air , or from the reek of human bodies , that the tubercle bacillus can retain its existence and its virulent power .
Long-lived though it may be under these latter conditions , it is rapidly disinfected by the natural agencies of fresh air and sunlight ; so rapidly that , when these agents are present , even in comparatively moderate degree , the tuberculous material cannot reach its dangerous state of dust before it is deprived of all power of doing harm .
But , in addition to the above-mentioned researches , it seemed desirable that an attempt should be made to ascertain what part was played respectively by the several forms of organic impurity that are present in insanitary dwellings .
Hitherto , so far as I know , no attempt has been made , in the laboratory or elsewhere , to imitate the actual conditions that prevail in such houses .
It was determined , therefore , to collect the aqueous vapours arising from the ground or from human bodies , and to submit these products to the test of trying Avhether they would serve as cultivating media for the bacillus of tubercle .
Many years ago in a research , the particulars of which are given in an appendix to my treatise on " Stethometry , " I examined the condensed aqueous vapour of the breath , in health and disease , and ascertained the quantity of organic matter that it contained .
The breath of fifteen healthy persons and of twenty-seven cases of disease was examined chemically by Wanklyn 's method of water analysis , and microscopically .
The fact of chief importance obtained was , that every specimen contained a small , but appreciable , quantity of both free and organic ammonia .
The quantity from the cases of disease varied considerably , but that from healthy persons was remarkably constant , varying from 0'325 milligram to 0 45 per 100 minims of the Cultivation of the Bacillus of Tubercle .
189 the fluid collected , the average being 0*4 .
Hence , by calculation , we obtain the rough estimate that about 3 grs. of organic matter is given off from a man 's lungs in the course of twenty-four hours .
Doubtless a very small amount , but sufficient to render the aqueous vapour thus thrown off more impure than most sewage water , and ample in quantity , to foster the growth of organic germs .
It was the result of this research that induced me to try to cultivate the bacillus of tubercle upon these and similar organic fluids , such as were likely to be met with in dwelling-houses .
By means of a simple freezing mixture of ice and salt it was easy to condense the aqueous vapour , both of the breath and that coming from ground air ; and , in order to make the inquiry more complete , the vapour of the breath was collected in a flask , surrounded by this mixture , from both healthy and diseased sources .
In other words , both healthy persons and those affected by phthisis were prevailed upon to breathe into the flask , until a sufficient quantity of aqueous fluid had been obtained .
With another apparatus , consisting of a framework supporting beakers containing freezing mixture , collections of aqueous fluid were obtained from " ground air " coming from a wine cellar in a gravelly subsoil , and from cellars under several low-lying , unsanitary cottages in Southampton .
Some of the moisture from a weaving-shed in Blackburn was also thus collected and used as a cultivating medium .

In order to test the activity of these cultures they were each , in the first instance , sown upon ( a ) sterilised blood-serum , and ( 6 ) upon glycerine agar peptone , " as these media were known to be the best for cultivating purposes , and the results could then with advantage be compared with those from the other materials used .
Both specimens were found to be capable of active growth , though the cultivation ( A ) was somewhat tardy .

It was then thought well , in the first instance , to attempt to cultivate the bacillus upon media , on which it grows with difficulty , without the presence of added peptones ; in other words , to find out w'hether the presence of the condensed organic fluids from the sources that have been mentioned would replace the peptones .
Accordingly , simple agar jelly , with 6 per cent , of glycerine , was made with each of the fluids mentioned , after careful sterilisation .
Tubes were charged with these several compounds , inoculated with looped platinum wire , lightly charged , stoppered with sterilised # The various manipulations required in this inquiry were carried out chiefly by Mr. Tanner , in his Bacteriological Laboratory , at Bournemouth , and to his carefulness and skill much of the success attained is due .

As a control experiment , the agar jelly was made with simple distilled water and glycerine , charged and disposed of in the same way .
The results of these several experiments are shown on the two following tables .
It will be observed that , out of the eighteen specimens , only two ( two of those from the impure cellars ) failed to produce growth to some extent ; those that did best were the fluids from the cellar in porous soil , and those condensed from the breath of phthisical patients .
But all kinds of organic fluid showed growth oil either agar jelly or potato .

None of these bases were found to be satisfactory ; and at length it was determined to use a particularly pure " filter-paper , " manufactured by Messrs. Schleicher and Sehiill , from which even the salts had been extracted by washing with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids.# This paper was folded in a convenient form , sterilised , inserted in the test-tubes , and charged with the several organic fluids , to which , as before , 6 per cent , of pure glycerine had been added .
It was then inoculated , stoppered as before , and in the first trials these tubes were placed in the incubator at the usual temperature of 35 ' C. The results are shown on Table V. It will be seen that some degree of success was attained in twelve out of fifteen specimens of the organic fluids .
The degree of growth was also much the same as in the previous series , though perhaps slightly less vigorous .
* Each of these filter-papers , analysed for me by the Kjeldahi process , by Sir H. Boscoe 's assistant , was found to contain only 0 * 1 milligram of nitrogen .

On certain Media for It was now determined to try to do without the help of the glycerine , which , as is well known , so greatly assists the ordinary cultivations of the bacillus .
Accordingly , four tubes with simple filter-paper as the supporting medium , and condensed fluids , from the breath of a healthy person , and from that of a phthisical patient , as nutrient fluids , were inoculated , and no glycerine was added .
In these tubes the same cultivation was used as in the previous experiments .
Shortly afterwards , two similar tubes with fluid from healthy breath alone , but with 5 per cent , of glycerine , were sown with the same cultivation , and were left at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory , about-21 ' C. ( see Table VI ) .
All of the former group took on active growth within four weeks , and one of the latter .
In other words , it was proved that pure filter-paper , moistened with these condensed fluids , alone would suffice to nourish and promote the growth of the bacillus , and , further , that this growth would take place at ordinary temperatures .
It may hence be concluded that when this organic fluid is present in ordinary dwellings , the bacillus may grow at the temperature of living rooms as well as at the temperature of 85 ' C. In September , 1896 , another attempt to test this point was made by inoculating a dozen more tubes in which the various condensed fluids were employed as nutrients .
Some of them were placed in the incubator , the others being placed outside .
In this series , however , a sub-culture on agar peptone , taken from the old Preventive Institute tube , was used as the seed ; and it was soon evident that this sub-culture had greatly declined in vigour .
For three months no perceptible growth took place on any of the specimens , and then only on phthisical breath to a very slight extent .
Although they must be counted for the most part as failures , the results of the inoculations are given in Table VI .
In consequence of this failure in vigour of the last used cultivation , a fresh series of eight tubes was commenced on October 31 with the same cultivation , which also failed .
Then , in February , 1897 , thi'ough the kindness of Dr. Childs and of Dr. Curtis , a fresh tube of apparently vigorous cultivation of the tubercle bacillus , guaranteed to be of human origin , was obtained from University College , London .
By way of control , this culture was sown upon blood serum and upon agar peptone , and incubated at 37 ' C. , and a copious growth was found to be commencing on the blood serum within ten days time ( see Table IX ) .
Two sets of tubes were then prepared of condensed vapour from breath , and from ground air from a pure sandy soil .
Xo glycerine was added ; but for the solid medium , in some instances , the pure the Cultivation of the Bacillus of Tubercle .

certain Medi the Cultivation of the Bacillus of Tubercle .
199 It will be seen that in many of the tabes a free growth was observed as early as the end of the first fortnight .
Oat of the total number in this series of 37 , in thirty-six instances there was free growth on the medium employed , on both kinds of paper , and all kinds of condensed fluid .
Eleven of them were grown at a temperature of about 20 ' C. In only one instance was there complete failure ( vapour from healthy breath ) .
Most of these tubes have been left intact , in order that they may be inspected ; but six of them were removed , stained , and examined microscopically , in order to determine whether they were true cultures ; this they proved to be .
Two of the cultures , after two months ' growth , were sent away to be inoculated into guinea-pigs , but both they and the original culture were found to be non-virulent.* Microscopic Examination .
Nearly all the earlier cultures , in which there appeared to have been any growth , were submitted to microscopical examination .
In all the specimens in which this examination did not show distinct signs of growth the result was put down as " nil , " even though a small number of bacilli might have been found .
These few bacilli might have come from the inoculation , .
It was not difficult to recognise the abundant growth of a true cultivation .
These examinations , however , gave remarkable results in a large number of the specimens giwn upon paper .
Many of the bacilli were gigantic in size , and a considerable number of them showed distinct branching .
Others were knobbed at one end or at both ends , when they looked like miniature " 'life preservers .
" In many of the specimens the culture seemed to have penetrated into the substance of the paper .
The bearing of these researches upon the subject of the prophylaxis against tuberculosis seems to be of some importance .
They prove that any one of the various organically charged vapours , whether coming from healthy or from diseased lungs , from the air of cellars , or from comparatively pure ground , forms an excellent cultivating medium for the bacillus of tubercle when kept away from the disinfecting influence of air and light .
This power of promoting its growth is particularly manifest when the supporting substance is common wall-paper , though it is quite apparent when very pure filter-paper is used .
It is further proved that , on these substances , the growth of the bacillus may take place at the ordinary temperatures of dwelling- * A further research , with cultures of the bacillus of undoubted virulence , has now been undertaken .

" Summary of Professor Edgeworth David 's Preliminary Report on the Results of the Boring in the Atoll of Funafuti .
" Communicated by Professor T. G. Bonnet .
F.R.S. , Vice-Chairman of the Coral Reef Boring Committee .
Received November 25 , \#151 ; Read November 25 , 1897 .
The boring at Funafuti , according to the latest advices , had reached a depth of 643 feet .
Professor David 's report is transcribed from notes made during the progress of the work , and gives his first impressions of the materials brought up , down to a depth of 557 feet , which had been reached when he quitted the island to return to his duties at , Sydney , leaving the work in charge of his assistant .
The latest advices informed him that the boring was arrested at 643 feet , but as it was hoped this was only for a time , we are daily expecting to hear yet more gratifying news .
His last letters , received during the present week , give a few particulars of the materials pierced between 557 and 643 feet .
The work , Professor David states , often presented most serious difficulties , which would probably have frustrated their efforts , but for the experience gained on the former occasion .
The bore hole is situated about half a mile N.E. of the Mission Church , and its height above 'sea level is about 1 foot above high water mark at spring tides .
The diameter is 5 inches down to 68 feet ; it is lined with 5-inch tubing down to 118 feet , and 4-inch from surface to 520 feet , so that on September 6 a 4-inch core was being obtained .
The following is a general description of the materials pierced :\#151 ; For about a yard at the top there was a hard coral breccia .
This was followed down to a depth of 40 feet by " coral reef rock , " into the composition of which Ueliopora cerulea , with spines of echinids and nullipores , entered largely , the last predominating over the coral at from 15 to 20 feet .
From 40 to 200 feet came more or less sandy material , but with a variable quantity of corals .
These were scattered through the sand ( calcareous and of organic origin ; foraminifera , at about 40 feet , making from one-half to two-thirds of the whole ) sometimes as fragments ( forming occasionally a kind of rubble ) , but sometimes in the position of growth .
Between 120 and 130 feet , and from about 190 to 200 feet , the material
