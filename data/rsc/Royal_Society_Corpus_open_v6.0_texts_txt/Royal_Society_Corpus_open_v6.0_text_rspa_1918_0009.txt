that were unable to reconcile the experimental data with the theory included in the above paper , we were gradually led into the attempt to find solutions of scme of the problems involved in this complex subject , starting only with ) fact that when light falls upon a finite thickness of a scattering medium , part is rejected , part extinguished , and part transmitted .
In the present communication we have confined ourselves to a study of the action of such media upon which is assumed to be already completely difluse Let MN represent a large sheet of a .
medium of uniform thickness quality , upon which completely diffused light of intensity falls .
Let the intensity of the light returned in directions opposed to be the intensity of the which escapes after through the sheet ' Photo .

It is oonvenient also to express the ratio between the unrejected portion of incident light and the light issuing by the symbol " " \ldquo ; and the term " " contendance It should be noted that the rejectance ( R ) includes all light returned in directions opposed to the incident diffused ) light , no matter by what circuitous path within the material it may have travelled .
It seems therefore undesirable to employ the term ' reflection\ldquo ; in describing it .

is ceShary to emp loy a sufficiently large source of completely diffused light and specimens of the materia ] to be studied of sufficient area to avoid the serious which nlav arise with small specimens from loss of light the only convenient means available uniform diffused of constant intensity is to employ a good diffusing medium illuminated by a constant light source , ence it is necessary in practice to measure values of or relative to a diffusing 1nedium of known rejectance .

When other qpecimens of unknown properties are now measured in contact the same diffusing screen , it is possible , from the results obtained and the ] of for the photolnetcr , 1 deduce the desired values for any new material .
For this method it is necessal.y , as a mininum , to obtain by measul.eluent the values of the relative ructances f specimens both one unit and two units thick .
The rejectance of unit thickness of the new material can then be derived from equation ( 5 ) in the form : The of then follo from while From these data any desired values can be calculated with the aid of the equations in the first part of this paper .
It is necessary to utter a warning concel.ning the extreme care neces\amp ; ary for determining the values of and in the above manner .
The results depend on the comparatively small differences between two much greater values , and ; consequently any errors in the values of and will be greatly increased in those of and deduced from them .
If two photometer diffusing screens of widely different and accurately rejectances and are available , a simpler solution of the problem offers itself , having , moreover , the of requiring only one specimen of the material .

( 19 ) The Behaviour of Scattering Media in Fully Diffused Light .
231 The method of measurement between two opal glasses , prescribed by Nutting , * which is supposed to berive the absolute or " " total\ldquo ; transparency to diffused light , can be shown in accordance with our theoretical discussion of the subject to in reality the following highly complex function of the properties of ) ditfusers and specimen:\mdash ; where refers to the specinlen between the two diffusing plates and Such a result evidently bears no simple relation to the obstructance of the specimen , nor could its value be deduced even if and were known .
ConJirmation of The paper already mentioned , published by one of in collaboration with O. Bloch , contains measurements of the relative obstructance arithms of specimens of opal glass and various other granular media ( suspensions in gelatine ) .
These results led to the discovery of an empirical rule connecting relative obstructance with thickness ( or concentration ) of the medium , viz. :\mdash ; where and are constant for the medium and the riven conditions of measurement .
This formula was found to represent very closely the observed relationship , the agreeulent well within the limits of experimental error in most cases .
No physical explanation of this rule was apparent , so that it was deemed advisable to make further measurements to see if any departure from it could be established by exercising every care , and especially to test practically our theoretical deductions .

All of them were ground to a fine matt surface on both sides and brought to approximately equal and uniform thickness , except one ( f ) which was made specially thin .
