Method of Disintegrating Bacterial Cells .
57 subsequent inoculation with the corresponding living organisms , a protection* which , with appropriate doses of the endotoxin , is exerted for at least 11 weeks after the injection of the endotoxin .
This result suggests that endotoxins may be of considerable value as protective or prophylactive vaccines .
The endotoxin solutions maintain their activity for at least six weeks .
A few inoculations of typhoid and diphtheria endotoxins have been performed in the human subject .
The inoculations cause some local reaction at the site of inoculation , consisting of redness , soreness and stiffness of the part , but little general reaction is induced , nor are any ill effects apparent .
I am indebted to Mr. Henry Welcome for the facilities he has kindly afforded me for carrying out this work at the Welcome Physiological Laboratories , and my best thanks are due to Mr. E. Thompson for his invaluable assistance in the preparation of the endotoxins .

] The methods hitherto available for accomplishing the disintegration of bacteria may be summarised briefly as follows :\#151 ; The earliest experiment is that of Buchner* for obtaining the intracellular juices of yeast .
This method was adopted by Macfadyen , Harris-Morris , and Rowland in their investigations on " Expressed Yeast Cell Plasma , " communicated to the Royal Society , June 19 , 1900 , but they subsequently introduced some modifications and improvements in the method .
Their improved process was to place the yeast cells in mass in a mechanical contrivance , together with a proportion of added silver sand , and to violently agitate the containing vessel .
The rapidly succeeding impacts of the yeast * 'Berichte d. Deutsch .

Method of [ Mar. 28 , cell with the sand particle ruptured the cell wall and caused the contents of the cell to be expelled .
The objection to this method is that a great rise of temperature rapidly takes place unless very efficient means are adopted for cooling ; in fact , the whole mass may quickly reach boiling point unless this is efficiently performed .
The cooling method they employed was to surround the containing vessel with brine at a temperature of about \#151 ; 5 ' C. , which sufficed to keep the yeast mass at a temperature of about 15 ' C , Macfadyen and Rowland later discarded this method , and adopted one in which micro-organisms were disintegrated at the temperature of liquid air , and described their method in a paper on " The Intracellular Constituents of the Typhoid Bacillus."* In this apparatus the organisms in mass are placed in a cylindrical metal vessel , which is itself immersed in a vessel of liquid air .
The inner container has a conical-shaped bottomland in this another cone fits which is caused to rotate and is also free to move vertically .
On placing the mass of bacterial or other cells in the container , the cells are rendered extremely brittle by the low temperature of the surrounding liquid air .
The cone is caused to rotate inside the container and at the same time to move up and down , engaging at each rise and fall a number of the cells between the bottom of the containing pot and itself .
The result is that each time a proportion of them is fractured .
The sequence of operations is continued until the micro-organisms are found on microscopical examination to be disintegrated .
On the completion of the process the temperature of the mass is allowed to rise , salt solution is added if necessary , and the suspension is then centrifugalised so that the cell bodies and any metallic contamination are removed .
The amount that may be dealt with by this method is not large , varying usually from 0*5 to 1 grm. , and the time required for the complete disintegration of such a quantity varies from one and a half to two hours .
Subsequent experiments have shown that while it is necessary to maintain the material at a low temperature to ensure the brittleness of the cell and to prevent chemical change during the process , such a low temperature as that of liquid air is not essential .
It appears to the writers that the conditions to be fulfilled in designing an efficient machine for the disintegration of micro-organisms are as follows : 1 .
The grinding should be effected in a manner which is , as far as possible , frictionless , so that the risk of rise of temperature and consequent chemical change is avoided so far as possible , even apart from any extraneous cooling arrangement .

59 2 .
Approximately , every micro-organism or cell should , sooner or later , be brought with certainty under the influence of the grinding action , so that the number of whole cells remaining is a minimum .
3 .
The containing vessel in which the grinding action takes place must be so effectually enclosed that during the process of disintegration no cells have any opportunity of escaping .
This applies particularly to pathogenic organisms .
4 .
The appliance must be such that an efficient cooling arrangement may be adopted , and , if necessary , a temperature of 15 ' to 20 ' C. below freezing maintained at the actual point at which the grinding action takes place .
5 .
The action presumably requiring to go on in metallic containing vessels , it should be provided that the actual mechanical disintegration of metal between the grinding surfaces should be as little as possible .
These conditions are in the main complied with in the apparatus to be described ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .
The containing vessel consists of a phosphor-bronze body A , in which a number\#151 ; usually five\#151 ; of hardened steel balls , B , are placed .
The shape of the containing vessel is such that when these balls are at its periphery they accurately fit the inner side of the vessel .
The diameter of the vessel may conveniently be slightly less than the sum of the diameters of three balls .
The balls are evenly distributed round the pot by means of a cage C , and , during the time they are running , this cage ensures that they are equidistant and do not collide one with another .
At the centre of the metal pot is a steel cone D , which is of such a size that it keeps the balls in their proper position , in close contact with the periphery of the containing vessel .
The vessel is closed by a screw cap E , through which the steel cone passes , and in which it is free to rotate .
Over the whole of this a metal cylinder F is placed , and is screwed down , completely sealing the upper opening in the metal pot .
In the top of this metal cylinder a steel bearing O is placed , which has freedom of movement in a vertical direction , but is kept down on the top of the steel cone by the action of a spring .
It therefore follows that when this metal cylinder is screwed down , the steel cone is pressed down on to the balls , and the balls are in their turn forced out to the periphery of the metal pot .
The whole appliance is mounted on a cone H , which is the upper end of a shaft passing through the base plate ; on the lower end of the shaft is a grooved wheel K , by which the apparatus may be rotated .
The grinding action is intended to take place between the steel balls contained in the metal pot and the interior surface of the pot , but it is evident that , so long as the whole appliance is rotated as it stands , no 60 Messrs. Barnard and Hewlett .
Method of [ Mar. 28 , grinding action would take place , as the vessel and its contents would rotate as a whole .
To bring about a grinding or crushing action , a drag must be placed on the central steel cone , which retardation is in turn conveyed , at least in part , to the steel balls .
It is therefore necessary !

either to let the central steel cone remain at rest , or for it to rotate at a speed less than that of the steel balls .
This has been effected in the type of machine now described ( fig. 1 ) , by mounting on the top end of the steel cone a bar of soft iron L , which is slightly less in length than the diameter of the covering cylinder .
On each side of the machine , but 1911 .

61 near to the outside of the covering cylinder F , a pair of electromagnets are mounted , with their poles in such a position that the iron bar on top of the steel cone is attracted by them .
In actual practice it is found convenient and more efficient to let ' this electromagnet be a circular one , so that the magnetic circuit is closed , with a pole on each side , in such a position that it will attract the central iron armature .
A suitable current of electricity is then passed through the winding of the electromagnets , so that the iron armature is kept in one position .
It follows that , on rotating the containing vessel , while the armature is held by the electromagnets , a drag is put on the central steel cone , which in turn is communicated to the steel balls , and the grinding action occurs in the manner indicated .
To ensure that the bacteria are brought under the influence of the grinding A B ; C Fig. 2.\#151 ; Apparatus for disintegrating bacterial or other cells .
Type with gravitational control .
mechanism , the speed of rotation should be at least 1500 revolutions per minute .
The bacteria are placed in the pot in a semi-fluid condition or as an emulsion .
Centrifugal action then ensues , so that they are almost immediately brought under the grinding action of the balls .
As the grinding action is one which takes place largely as the result of the rotation of the balls in an exactly fitting race the amount of friction is almost negligible ; and further as the pressure that is put on the balls consists of a direct thrust by the steel cone , there is every opportunity for them to slip should any additional friction be introduced , or if for any reason any added load be put on the grinding mechanism .
To ensure that the running is perfectly true , the whole appliance is mounted between centres I , I , which are adjustable for wear .
62 Messrs. Barnard and Hewlett .
Method of [ Mar. 28 , Cooling may conveniently be effected by means of liquid carbonic acid .
This may be obtained commercially , ready compressed in a steel cylinder , from which the gas may be allowed to escape and impinge on to the side of the metal pot .
By varying the rate of escape of the gas the temperature may be controlled at will .
An alternative method is to have another containing cylinder N outside the vessel in which the balls rotate , and to pack the space between this metal cylinder and the metal pot with a mixture of ice and salt or any other convenient freezing mixture .
If pathogenic organisms are being dealt with the whole machine may be covered with a glass bell-jar .
Around the base-plate a groove 0 is cut , and in this any fluid bactericidal agent may be put , the glass jar being then placed over the whole , thus effectually preventing the possibility of the escape of any part of the contents of the pot .
The introduction of the material to be ground into the containing vessel is effected by unscrewing the top cylinder F and taking out the small plug P at the top of the steel cone .
The spindle of the central steel cone is hollow , so that the emulsified bacteria may be introduced into the vessel by means of a pipette through this opening without disturbing the balls or any other part of the apparatus .
On completion of the grinding action , owing to the cell contents of the bacteria having been expressed , the material is much more fluid than when introduced ; and , therefore when the machine stops , it all sinks to the depressed centre of the containing vessel , and may be pipetted off again without further trouble .
The introduction into , and removal of the material from , the metal pot without disturbance of any of the parts is a matter of considerable moment when dealing with pathogenic organisms .
This arrangement also enables the ground material to be removed from the containing vessel immediately the grinding action ceases .
As a further precaution the lid of the pot E is recessed towards its centre as shown : it is therefore possible to fill the hollow top of the lid with a bactericidal agent ; immediately the machine is started the speed of rotation ensures that this fluid is thrown outwards by centrifugal action , and completely seals the two screw-joints where the lid of the pot and the outer cylindrical cover meet .
As a point in the construction it is necessary that the side wall of the top cylindrical cover should be made of vulcanite or some diamagnetic material^ as otherwise the necessary magnetic pull on the armature inside would not be effected .
A simplified form of the appliance is one in which the whole apparatus is mounted horizontally , and the pull is put on the central steel cone not through the agency of an electromagnet , but by means of gravity ( fig. 2 ) .
The whole arrangement is exactly similar to that previously described , 1911 .
] Disintegrating Bacterial and other Organic Cells .
63 except that the pot , with its balls , steel cone , and outer cover , is mounted horizontally between centres .
On the spindle of the central steel cone D a semi-cylindrical mass of iron or lead K is fixed , the weight of which has to be calculated for and proportioned to the drag on the central cone , but must be such that when the whole apparatus is rotated the weight is sufficient to keep the central cone at rest .
In practice this modification has proved to be simpler than the original model , the only objection being that it is not quite so easy to cover the whole apparatus with an outside bell-jar as in the first described type .
The following experiments were carried out with the apparatus described :\#151 ; Yeast .
In order to ascertain the efficiency of the grinding under different conditions , a series of experiments was performed with yeast .
The yeast cells being large , and their cell membranes being readily recognisable after the cells have been crushed , it was possible to make an actual count of the crushed and uncrushed cells after grinding .
Fresh German yeast was used and this was made into a smooth stiff cream with water for the purpose of grinding .
Films were made on glass slides at various stages of the grinds ; these were stained with Loffler 's methylene blue , and the counts made .
Controls of the unground yeast showed that practically all the cells were intact .
