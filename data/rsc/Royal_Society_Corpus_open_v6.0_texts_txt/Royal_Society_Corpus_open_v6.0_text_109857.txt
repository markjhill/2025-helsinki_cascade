] The observations here added as an Appendix to Mr. Mornay 's paper , relate to the crystalline texture of the mass , and its magnetic qualities .
The experiments were undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of nickel more certainly than Mr. Mornay had been enabled to do , and also to discover the quantity of this ingredient .
The crystalline forms in which this iron breaks , are such as are common to many metallic substances ; the regular octohedron , tetrahedron , or rhomboid , consisting of these two combined .
With respect to magnetism , it is observed , that the fragments are precisely like any pieces of the best soft iron , easily obeying the magnet , and instantly assuming polarity , according to the direction in which they are placed with reference to the magnetic meridian , and as instantly changing it when reversed .
And hence it is inferred that the magnetic polarity of the mass is solely from similar induction .
For detecting the presence of nickel , the author dissolves a very small portion in nitric acid , evaporates to dryness ; and after dissolving the oxide of nickel in pure ammonia , he precipitates by triple prussiate of potash .
But for determining its quantity , he adds sulphuric acid to the ammoniacal solution ; and after evaporating to dryness , he expels the ammoniacal salts by heat , and then dissolves the residuum , which is mere sulphate of nickel , and , by crystallization , obtains it in a state from which the quantity of metallic nickel can be inferred .
By this process he found four per cent. of nickel in this specimen of native
