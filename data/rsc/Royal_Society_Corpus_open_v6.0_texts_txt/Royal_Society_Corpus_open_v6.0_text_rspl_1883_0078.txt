The existing clouds will be furrowed obliquely , and the vortical stratum will be cut up into diamond-shaped spaces , determined by the intersection of the old and new vortex-axes .
This would explain the patch-work arrangement commonly observed in mackerel sky .
May not the lengths of the patches give a measure of the rate of veering of one of the currents ?

] The above account of the formation of ripple-marks shows it to be due to a complex arrangement of vortices .
The difficulty of observation is considerable , and perhaps some of the conclusions may require modification .
I hope that other experimenters may be induced to examine the question .
Lord Rayleigh has shown me a mathematical paper , as yet unpublished , in which he has considered the formation of aerial vortices over a vibrating plate .
It seems possible that an application might be made of similar modes of approximation to the question of water oscillating over a corrugated bottom .
Even a very rough solution would probably throw much light on the exact changes which the ripple-making vortices undergo , and any guidance from theory would much facilitate observation .
" On the Atomic Weight of Titanium .

( Preliminary communication .
) The sto'ichiometrical quantities which we ordinarily term atomic weights are not only the fundamental constants of chemical calculations ; their relations as mere numbers are of the highest significance in connexion with our conceptions concerning the essential nature of matter .
The recent publications of Becker and Clarke in America , and of Lothar Meyer and Seubert in Germany , have served to demonstrate ou how slight an experimental basis a large number\#151 ; the greater proportion , it must be confessed\#151 ; of the accepted values of these constants really depend .
A notable instance of this fact is seen in the case of titanium .
The atomic weight of this element was determined by Rose in 1829 , and by Pierre in 1847 with the following results :\#151 ; Rose ... ... ... . .
48 T3 and 49 '58 , Pierre ... ... ... 50 '25 .
The commonly accepted value of titanium is that founded upon the experiments of Pierre ; the atomic weight adopted by MendelejefE in the series based upon his periodic law is 48 , a number which finds 44 Dr. T. E. Thorpe .
[ Nov. 22 , some experimental support from the observations of Rose .
The direct evidence in favour of either value is , however , very slight , and a critical examination of the observations affords no ground for assuming that Rose 's value is nearer the truth than that of Pierre. .
It is probable that the value 48 has been adopted in one or two modern text-books , mainly because it agrees best with the requirements of the periodic law .
I have attempted to deduce the atomic weight of titanium from observations made with the tetrachloride , the tetrabromide , and the dioxide .

45The total amount of the silver chloride thus obtained was 69*25983 grms. : it was formed from 53*13881 grms. of silver added in the preceding series .
The weight of the silver chloride thus obtained from a known weight of silver and of titanium tetrachloride , not only affords an additional value for Ti , but it also serves as a rigorous check on the accuracy of the work , for if the ratio of Ag to AgCl is found to be the same as that obtained by the direct union of chlorine and silver , it at once disposes of the possibility of error due to the co-precipitation of titanic acid , and is a guarantee of the purity of the silver employed\#151 ; Now 52 *13881 : 69 *25983=Ag : AgCl = l : 1 *3284 .

47*94 49*29948 20*79032 47 *970 All the experiments which were made , either for the estimation of the chlorine or the titanic oxide , are given with the exception of two ; one of these was made upon a small quantity of material , and was considered as merely preliminary ; the other miscarried and was not persevered with .
In order to enable an opinion to be formed as to the agreement among the several observations , I have calculated the value of Ti afforded by each experiment .
But probably the most accurate values for the atomic weight would be deduced from the aggregate weights of the tetrachloride , silver , silver chloride , and titanic oxide , respectively .
Inasmuch as it may be presumed that the employment of large quantities of material would tend to increase the accuracy of the result , by calculating the final values from the aggregate weights On the Atomic Weight of .
[ Nov. 22 , instead of merely taking the means of the several observations , the influence of the larger quantities is directly felt .
Assuming with Lothar Meyer and Seubert that the most probable ratios of Ag , 01 , 0 , and H , are as follows\#151 ; Ag=6 7456 Cl =2 -21586 O =1 H =0 -06265 the vai'ious experiments afford the following values for Ti :\#151 ; I ... ... . .

47 -969 Ti=48 -000 It would appear , therefore , from these , that titanium must be added to the increasing list of the elements whose atomic weights .are simple multiples of that of hydrogen .
In these observations , which have occupied me many months , I have sought to eliminate such sources of error as were known to me .
It is of course possible , in spite of the agreement between the several values , that the results may be affected by undetected and .constant errors .
Experience warns us that no determination of atomic weight , however well the individual observations may agree -among themselves , can be considered wholly satisfactory if it depends upon a single reaction or is referred to a single relation .
It is for this 1883 .

47 reason that I have sought to extend my observations to other compounds of titanium , and to vary the nature of the reactions involved in the chemical process .
Unfortunately it is found that comparatively few bodies containing titanium lend themselves to the purpose of atomic weight determination .
I am , however , making observations with the tetrabromide , which , in some respects , is to be preferred to the tetrachloride , and the results furnished by its analysis will be given in a second communication , which will also contain details respecting the preparation of the substances used , the methods of weighing , the processes of manipulation , effect of errors , \amp ; c. With reference to the tetrabromide , I may here say that I find it can be very easily made by the action of hydrobromic acid gas upon the chloride , and that this proves to be a more convenient method of preparation than that by which it was first obtained by Duppa .

" On the Life History of the Dock iEcidium rumicis , Schlecth ) .

Communicated by W. Thiselton Dyer , M.A. , F.R.S. Received November 10 , 1883 .
This vEcidium , which is common in this country upon Jiydrolapathum , Huds , , obtusifolius , Linn. , Linn. , and conglomerate , Murray , was regarded by Fuck el* and Cookef as being a condition of JJromyces rumicis ( Schum .
) , is now stated by WinterJ in his last work to be a condition of Puccinia magnusiana .
During the present year I have conducted a series of cultures , in which the life history of this fungus has been carefully , if not laboriously , worked out , from which it appears that rumicis bears the same relationship to Puccinia phragmitis ( Schum .
) ( =P .
, D C. ) as JEcidium berberidis , Grmel .
, bears to Puccinia graminis , Perss .
History of the Subject.\#151 ; Winter , in 1875 , S showed that those botanists who had associated this AEcidium with the TJromyces , simply because these two fungi occurred upon the same host plant , were wrong , and that the fungus in question was the secidiospore of Puccinia phragmitis .
Stahl , in 1876 , repeated Winter 's experiment , and confirmed it .
Now it happens that there are two Puccinice common upon Phragmitis communis , the ( Schum .
