) A grant of \#163 ; 50 was voted by the British Association in 1897 for erecting a line on Mount Royal to connect the summit with the McGill College Observatory , in order to obtain continuous electrical records in the Observatory with one of Professor Callendar 's instruments of the variations of temperature on the summit of Mount Royal at a distance of about a mile , in a situation which was inaccessible for the greater part of the winter .
An air-line was erected early in 1898 , as soon as the weather permitted , and the thermometers and other instruments adjusted and tested by Professor Callendar .
The apparatus worked very well in fine weather , but the insulation was appreciably imperfect during rain .
During the summer the original thermometers and part of the line were damaged by lightning , and it was found to be necessary to replace the air-line by a lead-covered cable to secure perfect insulation and protection .
The necessary funds for this purpose were provided partly by a grant of \#163 ; 20 from the British Association and partly by a gift of $300 from Sir Wm. McDonald .
The cable was erected in the summer of 1903 , and the thermometers refitted .
The cable consisted of four No. 16 copper wires insulated with paper in a thick lead sheath suspended from a steel cable on poles .
The length of the cable was 4100 feet , the horizontal distance between the stations 3300 feet , and the difference of altitude , 620 feet .
The total resistance of the thermometer leads was about 40 ohms , and was very nearly equal to that of the compensating leads .
The resistances were equalised by a short coil of copper wire , placed outside near the observatory .
The insulation of the line was tested and found to be ample for the purpose even in wet weather .
' In order to secure an open scale for the record , and to obtain the greatest possible accuracy in the measurement of the difference of temperature between the two stations , a pair of similar platinum thermometers , each having a resistance of 9'264 ohms at 32 ' F. , and giving a scale of 1 / 5 of an inch , or 1/ 50 of an ohm per degree Fahr. , on the recorder , were connected differentially to the recorder , one thermometer being placed in a screen on the top of the mountain at one end of the line , and the other in a similar screen at the other 416 Prof. McLeod .
Difference of Temperature between [ June 7 , end of the line near the observatory .
The position of the zero and the accuracy of compensation of the leads were tested on two occasions at an interval of three months , with satisfactory results .
The maximum error due to defective insulation or compensation or variation of zero did not exceed 0'-5 F. The results of the first year 's working demonstrate the possibility of obtaining accurate continuous records of the temperature of an inaccessible station without any trouble over long periods .
It has not yet been possible to trace the connection between weather conditions and the variations of the difference of temperature between the stations , but some general results of interest appear to he worth noting .
The range of variation is considerable , and often changes very rapidly .
On some occasions the temperature at the higher station has been as much as 6 ' or 7 ' F. above the lower , on others it has been 25 ' F. below , showing a range of more than 30 ' F. Normal differences of temperature appear to vary with the average air temperature , increasing negatively ( higher station colder ) as the temperature falls .
This is illustrated by the accompanying table of monthly means .
The average difference of temperature varies from ll0-5 F. in January , at 80-2 F. , to 3Q,7 F. in May at 59'-7 F. Month .

A complete set of records for February , 1904 , which are not reproduced , but preserved for reference in the Archives , also accompanies the paper .
If the differential records are compared with temperature at the lower station , it is at once noticed that any marked change of temperature at the lower station is almost invariably preceded by a similar change at 1905 .

A negative increase in the temperature difference as shown by the curve on February 1 heralds the arrival of a cold wave .
A rise in the difference curve , or a diminution of the temperature difference , indicates the approach of warmer weather .
It seems probable that when these relations have been more completely studied and reduced , they may prove of great assistance in forecasting .
The system of recording here adopted can be applied equally well to sunshine , and to other meteorological data , and appears to overcome the difficulty and expense of maintaining a staff of observers at an elevated and often inaccessible station .
