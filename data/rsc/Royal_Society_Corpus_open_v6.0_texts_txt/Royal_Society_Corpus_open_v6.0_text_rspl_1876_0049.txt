" On the Effect of Heat on the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of'Silver .
' " By G. F. Rodwell , F.R.A.S. , F.C.S. , Science Master in Marlborough College .
Communicated by Professor Tyndall , F.R.S. Received March 10 , 1876* .
In a former paper f I endeavoured to prove that the iodide of silver is capable of existing in three allotropic modifications , that it possesses a point of maximum density at or about 116 ' C. , and that if a mass of the molten iodide be allowed to cool the following effects may be observed :\#151 ; ( a ) At the moment of solidification a very considerable contraction takes place ; ( / 3 ) the solid on further cooling undergoes slight and regular contraction , after the manner of solid bodies in general , until ( y ) at or about * Read May 4 , 1876 .

the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
281 116 ' C. it undergoes sudden and violent expansion , passing from the amorphous into the crystalline condition ; ( 3 ) after undergoing this expansion the mass , on further cooling , undergoes slight expansion , and ( e ) the coefficient of contraction diminishes as the temperature decreases ( or otherwise expressed , the coefficient of contraction augments with the temperature ) .
The following experiments were made in order to examine these effects more minutely , to determine the coefficients of contraction and expansion of the iodide , and to determine the coefficients of expansion of the chloride and bromide of silver between as great extremes of temperature as should be found practicable .
1 .
Apparatus employed for the determination of coefficients of expansion or contraction .
As mercury attacks the iodide of silver at a temperature far below its boiling-point , and as the beautiful optical method of Eizeau does not seem to be capable of application at high temperatures ( his own experiments in no case embracing a higher temperature than 100 ' C. ) , it was considered advisable to seek for some special method by means of which the degree of expansion and contraction of the iodide could be accurately determined .
I finally decided to enormously multiply a small motion by a system of levers , to cause short bars of the iodide , chloride , and bromide to act on these levers while being heated between various temperatures , and to measure the dilatation by a micrometer-screw .
The following apparatus was devised in order to carry out this idea .
The box A , fig. 1 , p. 282 ( drawn to scale ) , contains the levers , shown in plan and section in figs. 2 and 3 ; B is an index attached to the axis X , which is in connexion with the final lever , B moving through 180 ' of arc over the graduated half-circle 0 .
D is a sliding bar , one end of which bears upon the first lever , while the other is in contact with a short rod of glass E , which moves freely , but watertight , in a metal stuffing-box .
The rod of glass thus enters a brass trough E , which can be filled with water or melted paraffine , and which can be heated by means of a Bunsen 's burner .
The water or paraffine is allowed to run off at the end of an experiment by the tap G- .
IT is a rod of glass similar to E , which moves freely but water-tight in the metal stuffing-box I. Between E and TI is placed the rod of substance the expansion or contraction of which we desire to determine .
The end of II external to the trough F rests against the end of the micrometer-screw K , which is tipped with agate , and which moves steadily in the support L firmly clamped to the iron bar M , which is screwed to the base of the instrument N. The head of the micrometer-screw , O , is graduated into 250 divisions , and is figured to 500 ; the graduations are read off against the cross arm P. A plan of the levers is shown in fig. 2 , where D ( the end of which is seen in fig. 1 ) is the movable bai ' , sliding in a socket It and bearing against the first lever S , -which is pivoted at T. Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effect of Heat on The lever S bears against a second lever U , pivoted at V. From the opposite extremity of U a very fine steel chain " W " , such as is employed in watches , passes to a vertical axis X , which carries the needle B. The needle is brought back to zero by the pressure of the spring Y against the lever U , and also by a fine steel mainspring Z , which is fixed to the vertical axis X. a is a small pin to stop the lever U as soon as the needle has passed the zero-point by a few degrees .
The levers are shown in section in fig. 3 ; the lettering is the same throughout .
The framework b is of brass , as are also the levers ; the pivots are of steel .
Pieces of glass , cc , are let into the levers at the bearing points to diminish the friction .
The micrometer has threads T^ff of an inch apart ; hence one turn of the micrometer-head is equal to 'f an meh , and the movement of the head through one division is equal to Jot 'f an inch ; but it is quite easy to read to half a division , and hence to Tbivir'f an inch .
The rods inserted between the micrometer and the lever are six inches long , and from one quarter to half an inch in diameter ; they rest on light glass rollers placed in the trough F. A rod of the substance to be examined is inserted between E and H ; the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
283 perfect continuity of the parts is established , and the micrometer-head is turned until the needle stands at zero ; the reading on the micrometer is registered , and the head is then turned until the index B has passed to 180 ' of arc ; by again reading the micrometer , the relation between the micrometric divisions and the divisions on the scale of C is established .
By this means it was found that a movement of *0035 inch in the micrometer moves the index through 180 ' of arc .
Now since the index is six inches long , in moving through half a circle its extremity passes over 18*84 inches , and this motion is produced by a movement of *0035 inch ; hence the levers multiply any motion communicated to them 5382 times .
The precise value of this index-scale having been ascertained , the determination of the expansion of a body by heat becomes an easy matter , provided that we are careful to secure perfect rigidity in all the fixed parts of the apparatus ( by no means an easy task ) , and are further careful to prevent the conduction of heat from the short glass rods ( E and H ) to the interior of the apparatus .
The coefficient of expansion of E and H must also be ascertained , and allowed for in all determinations .
If , on the other hand , we wish to determine the contraction of a body , the index is pushed up to 180 ' of arc by means of the micrometer-screw , and is pushed back to zero as the bar contracts by the spring Y and the helical mainspring Z. The precise value of the return movement must be , of course , ascertained by means of the micrometer-head .
It is obvious that in moving from 0 ' to 180 ' of arc the spring Y acts against the motion of the expanding body ; while in moving from 180 ' to 0 ' it moves with the motion of the contracting body .
A bar of fine homogeneous silver was used in order to test the delicacy of the apparatus .
It was placed between the short glass rods ( E and H ) , and cold water was poured into the trough .
The temperature was indicated by two thermometers reading well together , placed near the opposite extremities of the silver bar , and the needle was brought to zere .
The water , was then heated , being constantly stirred to produce uniformity of temperature throughout the whole mass , until the needle had been forced round to 180 ' of arc .
The number of degrees of heat being read off , showed the heat necessary to produce a certain known expansion , and from this the coefficient of expansion was easily ascertained .
Six results gave 10 ' C. , 10 ' , 9 ' , 10 ' , 10 ' , 9'*5 .
The coefficient deduced from the mean of the determinations was for 1 ' C. *0000193083 .
Now Lavoisier gives it as *00001910 ; Daniell *00001951 ; Fizeau ( determined by the same method as that which he applied to the iodide , chloride , and bromide of silver ) gives *00001921 ; and more recently Matthiessen ( Phil. Trans. I860 ) found it to be *000019436 .

-0000288761 -00002918 It is thus abundantly evident that the apparatus is capable of very considerable accuracy , especially when we remember that we are dealing with rods of metal only six inches long .
I venture to think that such an apparatus would prove a useful adjunct to a Physical Laboratory for it would not only afford a means of determining coefficients of expansion with rapidity and accuracy , but it might be used for determining thicknesses in thousandths and ten-thousandths of an inch .
For if the substance were introduced between the agate face of the micrometer-screw and the glass rod H , and if the index were then driven round to a certain point ( say 20 ' of arc ) , and so with the other substances tested , an exact uniformity of pressure of the face of the screw on the substance would be secured , and minute thicknesses might thus be measured with accuracy .
In constructing such an apparatus , extreme rigidity of the fixed parts is a main necessity ; the base should be of thick marble , and the micrometer-screw support should be deeply let into it and firmly secured .
Massive supports , apparently fixed with the utmost firmness , sometimes yield with surprising readiness to the extent of one five-hundredth of an inch .
The elasticity of the metal sometimes causes great inconveniences .
The levers must be firm and strong , but not unnecessarily heavy ; they should work very smoothly .
Agate should be let into the brass at the points of contact .
Care should be taken to avoid any transference of heat from the hot trough to other parts of the apparatus .
By the use of a paraffine of high boiling-point , the temperature of a bar submitted to heat in the trough ( F ) can be raised to 300 ' 0 .
Under such circumstances great care is requisite to avoid heat from being radiated or otherwise communicated to other parts of the apparatus .

Means employed to determine the expansion in passing from the solid to the liquid condition .
The determination of the amount of expansion which iodide , chloride , and bromide undergo in passing from the solid to the liquid condition was effected in the following manner:\#151 ; A conical tube of platinum weighing 44-844 grammes was carefully filled with mercury at a known temperature .
It contained 105-43 grammes of mercury .
It was then filled with the substance under examination at its meltingthe Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
285 point ; the substance was allowed to solidify , and the whole was weighed-The cavity due to the contraction of the mass in solidifying was then filled with mercury to the level of the mouth of the conical tube , and was weighed .
Then , knowing the capacity of the tube , the specific gravity of mercury and of the substance under examination , the temperature of the fusing-point , and the coefficient of expansion of the platinum cone , we have all the data requisite for the determination .
The real difficulty is the determination of temperatures above the boiling-point of mercury ; and until a trustworthy method of general application has been devised , such determinations must be regarded as approximations .
The expressions " below a red heat , " " a dull red heat , " \amp ; c. are still common in text-books and in memoirs ; but the very definitions of what is meant by a " dull red heat " vary , as also do the temperatures assigned to it by different writers .
3 .
Effects of Heat on the Iodide of Silver .
Iodide of silver , carefully prepared by precipitating the nitrate by means of iodide of potassium and subsequent drying* , was fused in a porcelain crucible and cast in warm tubes of glass .
The cylinders thus cast were from | to | an inch diameter ; they were levelled at the end by a fine steel saw , and were reduced to 6 inches in length .
Every precaution was adopted in order to secure homogeneity ; but the rifts , both longitudinal and horizontal , produced during the sudden expansion of the substance in passing from the amorphous to the crystalline condition sometimes rendered the bar so weak and brittle that it had to be recast .
I have before pointed out that as a bar of molten iodide cools it contracts regularly to its point of maximum density , then expands considerably just below the temperature of maximum density , passing simultaneously into its crystalline condition , and finally continues to slightly expand as the temperature falls .
Its behaviour in the expansion-apparatus may consequently be readily inferred ; and experiment justified the inference .
A bar of the iodide was placed between the movable glass rods ( E H , fig. 1 ) , resting on glass rollers ; water was placed in the trough , and the thermometers were put in their places .
The index was placed up to 180 ' of arc , and the water was heated .
As the temperature rose the needle gradually returned towards zero as the bar contracted ; and the amount of contraction was measured and compared with the range of temperature .
When the needle reached zero , the bar was allowed to cool , and the needle now moved forward , indicating expansion .
The water was now replaced by a paraffine of high boiling-point , and the heating was recommenced .
The index ( at 180 ' of arc ) began *to retreat as before , showing that the bar was contracting ; as 140 ' C. was approached the * I must express my great indebtedness to Mr. Valentin for allowing me to have a quantity of the iodide , bromide , and chloride prepared at South Kensington , and to Mr. Greenaway for preparing it .

X 286 Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effect of Heat on contraction became more rapid ; and between 142 ' and 145'*5 C. very-rapid contraction took place , and the temperature was maintained as steady as possible .
A slight fall of the temperature below 142 ' C. caused the needle to stop , and the contraction was resumed as soon as the temperature again rose above that point .
When the temperature was kept steadily between 142 ' and 145'*5 C. , the contraction after a while ceased at the latter temperature ; and on raising the temperature the mass now expanded slowly up to 300 ' C. , the limit of the apparatus , as beyond this the paraffine ignited .
In cooling these effects were exactly reversed : the index moved from 180 ' of arc to zero between 300 ' and 142 ' C. , that is , the mass contracted like an ordinary solid ; then at 142 ' a considerable expansion occurred , after which the mass slowly expanded as the temperature fell .
Fizeau , " by a method depending on the accuracy with which extremely minute movements can be appreciated , by observing the changes they produce in a system of Newton 's rings , " determined the coefficient of cubical contraction of iodide of silver between + 70 ' C. and \#151 ; 10 ' C. , and found it to be *00000417 .
The determinations made with the expansion-apparatus were higher than this ; but as M .Fizeau 's method is undoubtedly one of great accuracy , and as , moreover , the determinations of the expansion of silver , copper , lead , zinc , and of the chloride and bromide of silver made by means of the expansion-apparatus agree very closely with those made by M. Fizeau by his optical method , I have preferred to adopt his coefficient for temperatures between \#151 ; 10 ' C. and 4- 70 ' C. Between 70 ' C. and 142 ' 0 .
, at which temperature the considerable expansion occurs , the coefficient was found to be *00001749 ; the determination is apt to be vitiated by the sudden increase in the coefficient as the temperature of rapid contraction is approached .
Between 142 ' C. and 145'*5 0 .
the mass contracts to the extent of *004500 ; probably this contraction occurs at one precise temperature within even a less range than 3'*5 C. ; but it is practically impossible to ensure an absolutely uniform temperature in a bar of iodide in a bath of paraffine under the conditions of the experiment .
Between 145'*5 C. and 300 ' C. the coefficient was found to be *00002844 .
The iodide fuses at a temperature which I estimate at 450 ' C. By fusion in the platinum cone , and the application of the method described above , the volume in the liquid state at 450 ' C. was found to exceed the volume at 450 ' C. in the solid state to the extent of *046331 on volume at 450 ' C. in the solid state = 1*008659 .
On raising the temperature of the platinum cone and its contents to a temperature estimated at 750 ' C. ( a cherry-red heat visible in broad daylight ) , the molten iodide did not appear to expand more than the platinum ; the coefficient between 450 ' C. and 750 ' C. has been hence taken as that of platinum as an approximation .
As no method could be devised for determining the coefficient of expansion between 300 ' C. and 450 ' C. , the same coefficient as that the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
287 determined for the range between 145'*5 C. and 300 ' C. has been adopted .
Finally , as to the coefficient of contraction between \#151 ; 10 ' C. and \#151 ; 60 ' C. Fizeau asserts that he believes the point of maximum volume or minimum density of the solid iodide to be at \#151 ; 60 ' C. He does not give the coefficient below \#151 ; 10 ' C. , and presumably could not apply his method to so low a temperature as \#151 ; 60 ' C. Neither did an attempt with solid carbonic acid and ether prove satisfactory in the expansion-apparatus .
Hence , as an approximation , the coefficient has been taken as *00000104 , calculated on the presumption that the coefficient between \#151 ; 60 ' and \#151 ; 10 ' C. decreases in the same ratio as the coefficient between + 70 ' C. and 142 ' C. increases , in reference in each case to the coefficient for temperatures between \#151 ; 10 ' C. and +70 ' C. Summarizing the above results , we obtain the following as an approximate statement of the changes in volume undergone by a mass of iodide of silver in cooling down from 750 ' C. to \#151 ; 60 ' C. More than this we fear we cannot say until high temperatures can be satisfactorily measured , and until certain experimental difficulties in connexion with the determinations can be overcome .

1*017342 1*017394 J Expansion on cooling , contraction on heating .
In my former paper I mentioned 116 ' C. as the temperature at or about which the iodide undergoes its sudden change of volume , and at which it possesses its maximum density .
But this assertion was founded on the fact that a rod of iodide in cooling in a glass tube breaks the tube at or about that temperature .
It is obvious , however , that the tube would yield before breaking ; and the expansion-apparatus clearly proved that the change takes place at a higher temperature\#151 ; a temperature at or very near to 142 ' C. At this temperature , both in cooling and heating , the index reversed its motion .
Wernicke ( Pogg .
Ann. cxliii .
p. 560 ) mentions the fact that prisms of fused iodide of silver when cooled to 138 ' C. exhibit a sudden alteration of colour and transparency .
Molten iodide solidifies to a perfectly transparent , very flexible claret-coloured solid ; as it cools it becomes amber-coloured , and just above 142 ' C. it becomes pale yellow ; at 142 ' C. the change from the amorphous to the crystalline condition takes place , the body simultaneously becoming crystalline and opaque and undergoing considerable expansion .
It now exists as a brittle pale green solid .
On heating this to a temperature of 300 ' C. it recovers some of its plasticity , and may again be x 2 Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effect of Heat on bent , but it cannot be made transparent without re-fusing .
By rapidly casting a bar and introducing it into the trough of the expansion-apparatus filled with paraffine above 200 ' C. , the expansion of the transparent amorphous iodide was determined , and this gave *00001206 .
Wernicke considers that at a high temperature " part of the iodine is separated from its combination with the silver , and is absorbed by the remaining substance in the liquid state , for the spectrum , like that of solid and liquid iodine , contains no blue or violet light .
In the normal state , below 138 ' C. , silver iodide gives a spectrum less bright , but twice as long , and particularly developed in the blue-violet portion .
" It is well known that red , transparent , plastic sulphur in becoming yellow , opaque , and crystalline gives out a good deal of heat .
Transparent plastic iodide of silver was examined at the moment of change , and was found to give out heat .
A mass of the plastic iodide at 200 ' C. was placed in paraffine at 200 ' C. , and the cooling was observed .
When the iodide began to change from the amorphous to the crystalline condition the rate of cooling ( previously determined ) was far less rapid , proving clearly that heat was given out .
The iodide appeared to become more brittle with successive fusions ; but this did not seem to materially affect its specific gravity .
Thus a specimen which had been many times fused gave a sp. gr. of 5*675 , while another specimen after a single fusion gave 5*66 .
Taking the former as the true sp. gr. , we find that the sp. gr. at the maximum density ( 142 ' C. ) will be 5*771 , and at the minimum density ( \#151 ; 60 ' C. ) 5*673 ; while the sp. gr. of the molten iodide at 450 ' C. will be 5*522 .
It was noticed that the platinum cone was altered in capacity when fused iodide of silver was allowed to cool in it ; in fact it became more or less deformed .
This was found to be due to the considerable expansive force exercised by the iodide in expanding .
We did not succeed in breaking an iron bottle by this means , but a thick porcelain tube was easily broken by the passage of the iodide from the amorphous to the crystalline condition .
An attempt to determine the relative conductivities of the iodide , bromide , and chloride of silver was made in the following manner:\#151 ; Homogeneous rods of each of these substances were taken in weights corresponding to their specific heats .
Any one rod whose conductivity was to be determined was fixed in the bottom of a copper trough , the projecting end dipped into a small reservoir of mercury in contact with a delicate thermopile and galvanometer .
Great care was taken to surround every thing with non-conductors of heat , and to insulate the rod from contact with the copper trough .
Paraffine at 300 ' C. was poured into the trough , and thus came into contact with the exposed end of the bar .
The time which elapsed before the movement of the galvanometer took place was noted in seconds .
The results were not satisfactory ; but they appeared to prove that the bromide of silver conducts heat better the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
289 than the chloride , and more than twice as well as the iodide .
We should naturally expect the iodide from its comparatively loose crystalline nature to conduct heat less well than either the bromide or chloride .
4 .
Effects of Heat on the Bromide of Silver .
Precipitated bromide of silver was fused , and cast in warm glass tubes .
The mass when warm was found to be somewhat tenacious ; the surface of the fused rod was smooth and brilliant , the fracture crystalline .
Repeated fusion seemed to render the substance more crystalline .
Although crystalline the substance was very compact , and altogether unlike the crystalline condition of the iodide ; the rod contracted a good deal in cooling , and easily came out of the tube in which it was fused .
Rods 6 inches long by 5 inch diameter had their ends levelled by means of a fine steel saw , and were placed in the expansion-apparatus , and tested as described in the case of the iodide bars .
The coefficient of cubical expansion for 1 ' C. was found to be .00010500 .
Pizeau by his optical method found the coefficient to be *000104061 .
The coefficient increases with the temperature , at least to the extent of .000004 for each 100 ' C. increase of range .
The expansion is very considerable in passing from the solid to the liquid condition , and between 380 ' ( which I believe to be near its melting-point ) and a temperature estimated at 750 ' C. The volume at \#151 ; 60 ' C. has been taken as unity in order for better comparison with the iodide in the accompanying Curve Table ( p. 290 ) , and an addition of *000004 to the coefficient has been made for each 100 ' C. of temperature .
Then if we suppose a ' molten mass of bromide of silver to be cooling down from 750 ' C. to \#151 ; 60 ' C. , the following is an approximation to the volumes of the mass at the various temperatures indicated:\#151 ; Volume at 750 C. ... = 1*167940 55 " 380 ( liquid ) = 1*122840 55 " 380 ( solid ) ... = 1*048120 55 " 300 .

= 1*006060 55 " \#151 ; 60 1-000000 The specific gravity at 7 ' C. was found to be 6*245 in the case of a specimen which had been often fused , and 6*293 in the case of a specimen which had been only once fused .
This would give 5*595 as the sp. gr. of the molten bromide at the fusing-point .
Mr. G. F. Rodwell on the Effect of Heat on Table showing approximately the Action of Heat on the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver , between \#151 ; 60 ' C. and 750 ' C. Temperatures .
The bromide fuses to a reddish brown liquid , not unlike bromine , and it solidifies to a bright yellow transparent solid when seen in thin layers .
In thick layers it appears to be brownish yellow .
It is brittle even before it is quite cold .
During the process of cooling loud cracking noises , like the cracking of a piece of porcelain or thick glass , are produced .
The solidified solid produces a metallic ring when struck ; but this is less marked than in the case of the chloride of silver .
5 .
Effects of Heat on the Chloride of Silver .
Precipitated chloride of silver was fused and cast in warm glass tubes .
It had been very carefully prepared in the dark , and the fused mass in thin layers was colourless and quite transparent .
When warm , a rod of the chloride was very flexible , and to some extent malleable ; when cold the bar did not bend without fracture , and repeated fusings seemed to render it more liable to fracture .
The rod contracted a good deal on cooling , and easily came out of the tube in which it was cast .
Rods of 6 inches long by | inch in diameter had their ends levelled by means of a fine steel saw , and were placed in the expansion-apparatus and tested as the Chloride , Bromide , and Iodide of Silver .
291 described in the case of the iodide bars .
The coefficient of cubical expansion for 1 ' C. was found to be .000095454 .
Tizeau by his optical method found the coefficient to be *000098814 .
The coefficient increases with the temperature , at least to the extent of *000003 for each 100 ' C. increase of range .
The expansion is considerable in passing from the solid to the liquid condition , and between 350 ' O. and a temperature estimated at 750 ' C. I believe 350 ' C. to be near the melting-point of the chloride .
( Can the 260 ' C. which we see in books be a misprint for 360 ' C. ?
The chloride may be kept for any length of time in a paraffine-bath at 300 ' C. without showing signs of fusion .
) The volume at \#151 ; 60 ' C. has been taken as unity , in order that a better comparison between the chloride and the iodide may be made in the curve table , and an addition of *000003 to the coefficient has been made for each 100 ' C. of temperature .
Then , if we suppose a molten mass of chloride of silver to be cooling from 750 ' C. to \#151 ; 60 ' C. , the following is an approximation to the volumes of the mass at the various temperatures indicated:\#151 ; Volume at 750 C. .
... ... ... ... ... = 1*177135 " " 350 ( liquid ) ... ... = 1*116427 " " 350 ( solid ) .

= 1*015092 " " 0 ... ... ... ... = 1*005547 " " \#151 ; 60 ... ... ... ... .
= 1-000000 The specific gravity was found to be 5*505 in the case of a specimen which had been often fused , and 5*405 in the case of a specimen which had been once fused .
This ( former ) would give 4*957 as the sp. gr. of the molten chloride at the fusing-point .
The chloride fuses to a dull light-red liquid , and becomes faintly yellow when solidified , in thin layers colourless and quite transparent .
When cold it forms a pale dirty greenish-yellow solid , transparent in thin layers .
No sounds were emitted during cooling .
The fracture is crystalline .
In thin layers the chloride is very flexible when cold ; and when hot thick masses of it are very flexible .
When cold it has a decided metallic ring when struck .
