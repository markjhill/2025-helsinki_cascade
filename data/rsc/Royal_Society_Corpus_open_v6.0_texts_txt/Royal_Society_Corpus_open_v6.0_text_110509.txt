" On the Tides at the Port of London .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , F.R.S. The discussions of tide observations which the author has hitherto at various times laid before the Society , were instituted with reference to the transit of the Moon immediately preceding the time of highwater , from which the laws of the variation in the interval between the moon 's transit and the time of high-water have been deduced .
But the discussion of nineteen years ' observations of the tides at the London Docks , which is given in the present paper , has been made with reference to the moon 's transit two days previously , and proves very satisfactorily that the laws to which the phenomena are subject accord generally with the views propounded long since by Bernoiulii , The relations which the author points out between the height of highwater and the atmospheric pressure as indicated by the barometer are particularly interesting and important .
The influence of the wind is also considered ; and such corrections indicated as are requisite in consequence of the employment by several observers of solar instead of mean time .
