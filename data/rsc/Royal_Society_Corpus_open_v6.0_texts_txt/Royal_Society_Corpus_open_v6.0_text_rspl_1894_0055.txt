391 initiations of specific heat have been carried to densities at which the substance was partly in the liquid state at the lower limit of temperature of the experiments .
Observations dealing with true specific heat , uncomplicated by the presence of thermal effects due to the presence of liquid , are limited by the density 01444 .
At this density the mean specific heat over the range , 12 ' C. to 100 ' C. , is 02035 .
| The following table contains a summary of the mean results of the experiments in which no liquid is present at the initial temperature .
The range of these experiments lies between air temperature ( 12 ' to 169 ) and steam temperature \#151 ; Specific heat .

ciZ .
) , afford a well defined line , which rises slowly at the higher densities , turning away from the axis of density .
According to an empirical equation to this line , the specific heat of carbon dioxide at constant volume is given in terms of its variation with density p , as follows :\#151 ; Cv = 0*1650+0-2125/ 9+ 0-3400^ .
This is in fair agreement with the linear equation deduced in Part I from the limited number of experiments at low densities therein contained:\#151 ; Cv = 0-16577 + 0-2064/ 9 .
In these experiments a spherical vessel of copper was used to hold the gas , having a voluminal capacity of about 86 c.c. , a mass of 137 grams , and an estimated resistance to bursting of 300 atmos .
This , as in the former experiments , was equilibrated against a similar vessel in a differential steam calorimeter .
These vessels produced each a precipitation , due to its own calorific capacity of 2*1 grams of steam .
It was found , however , that closely agreeing results ( to 1 per cent , about ) were obtained when the precipitation due to the gas fell to as little as 0*15 gram .
