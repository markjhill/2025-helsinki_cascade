" On the Colours of Mixed Plates .
" By Sir David Brewster , K.G.H. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. In the prosecution of his optical inquiries , the author was induced to study the phenomena of mixed plates , ( originally discovered by Dr. Young , and described by him in the Philosophical Transactions for 1802 , ) as he had observed similar appearances in various mineral bodies under analogous circumstances , to which he had been led to ascribe an origin different from that assigned by Dr. Young .
In order to obtain a more distinct view of these colours , Sir David Brewster employed , instead of the substances used by Dr. Young , the white of an egg , beat up into froth , and pressed into a thin him between plates of glass .
From observations of the colours exhibited by plates so prepared , and also by the edge of a thin him of nacrite in contact with copaivi balsam , the author deduces the conclusion , that all these phenomena , as well as those often seen in certain specimens of mica through which titanium is disseminated , and also in sulphate of lime , are cases of diifraction , where the light is obstructed by the edges of very thin transparent plates placed in a medium of different refractive power .
If the plate were opake , the fringes produced would be of the same kind as those often noticed , and which are explained on the principle of interference ; but , owing to the transparency of the plate , fringes are produced within its shadow ; and , owing to the thinness of the plate , the light transmitted through it is retarded , and , interfering with the partial waves which pass through the plate , and with those which pass beyond the diffracting edge with undiminished velocity , modify the usual system of fringes in the manner described by the author in the present paper .
