On the Tides of Refuge Cove , Wellington Channel .
Received July ll , \mdash ; Read November 19 , 1874 .
THE following observations , like those at Northumberland Sound , were made on board H.M.S. 'Assistance , ' under the command of Sir EDWARD BELCHER , R.N. , K.C.B. They were made from 16th September to 11th October 1853 .
Although the period of observation is so short , yet , owing to the fact that it was the time of Equinox , some useful information has been obtained as to the Lunar Diurnal Tide at this Station .
The position of Refuge Cove is Lat. N. Long. W. The following Table contains the Height ofeach High and Low Water , and the Height of the Diurnal Tide , calculated by the second difference of the heights .

A. Diurnal Tide .
The general expression for the Diurnal Tide is , ( 1 ) which at the Equinoxes reduces simply to the Lunar Tide , viz. .
( 2 ) If the Tides be plotted carefully to scale , it appears that the Diurnal Tides in vanish together at High Water and Low Water , when , or nearly so .
The mean interval from the time of the Moon 's declination vanishing to the disappearance of the Diurnal Inequality is about 36 hours , which may be regarded as the of the Lunar Diurnal Tide .
It is evident from equation ( 2 ) that if and represent the lange of Tide at High Water and Low Water respectively , since the phase changes by from High Water to Low Water , we have the following equations to detelmine the unknown constants and , ( 3 ) ( value of ) . . . . .

( 6 ) If we plot the Lunitidal Intervals at High Water and Low Water to scale , from the following Table we obtain the Diurnal Inequality in time .
It produces a maximum acceleration or retaldation in the time of Tide , amounting to 39 minutes .
The following Table gives the Lunitidal Intervals at High Water and Low Water .

These diffe represent the time of the Atlantic Tide-wave passing from Refuge Cove to thumberland Sound ( uncorrected for longitude ) ; and their agreement is a proof of th accuracy of the observations at both places .
B. Tidci ( Heights ) .
When Table I. is plotted to scale , it is easy to correct the tide for the Diurnal Inequality , or to do so by Diurnal Tide at High Water and Low Water given in that Table .
When this correction is made we find the following pring and Neap Ranges : .
