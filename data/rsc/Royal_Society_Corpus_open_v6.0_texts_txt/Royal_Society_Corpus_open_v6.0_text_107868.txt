Corrections to the reductions of Lieutenant FOSTER'S Observations on Atmospherical Refractions at Port Bowen ; with Addenda to the Table of Magnetic Intensities at the same place .
By Lieutenant HENRY FOSTER , R. N. F. R. S. Read March -22 , 1827 .
I HASTEN to acquaint the Royal Society with an error I have inadvertently committed in my observations on Atmospherical Refractions at Port Bowen , published in Part IV .
of the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 .
The error alluded to arises from my having used an erroneous value of the divisions on the long level of the repeating circle , with which the observations were made .
For the detection of this error , I am indebted to Captain KATER , who recently having had occasion to use the same instrument , found the value of each division of the level to be more than ten seconds in arc , of which he very kindly informed me , knowing that I had considered them as equal to single seconds only ; and at the same time he wished me to acquaint him , if any accident had happened to the instrument , by which the level might have been changed .
I knew that no accident had befallen the instrument , and that the level was the same which I had used ; I therefore immediately proceeded to town , and in Captain KATER'S presence ascertained the value of each division of the level to be 10o.9 .
In order to explain the source of the error into which I have fallen , I must state , that on receiving the repeating in question , I was given to understand that the value of each division of the level was equal to one second in arc:and as this instrument was the same that had been employed by Captain SABINE , in his experiments on the pendulum , I took no steps to examine this point for myself , for it never once occurred to me that there could exist a doubt on the subject .
The following , however , are the corrected Tables , which are similarly numbered with those they are intended to be substituted for , in pages 220 and 223 of Part IV .

=4 39 30,24 , instead of 39 31,50 which the Observations by Capt. PARRY and myself for the Amount of Refraction at Port Bowen were made , renders it important that the identical thermometer employed should be preserved ; I therefore beg to present it to the Society for their acceptance : it was prepared with every possible care by Mr. DANIELL , for the occasion , and is a spirit thermometer , having an ivory scale , graduated from 10o ?
degrees below zero to 94 ?
above , of FAHRENHEIT:-It has also divisions according to REAUMUR'S scale .
I avail myself of this opportunity of noticing an omission in the Table of Abstracted Intensities , page 125 of Part IV .
of the Philosophical Transactions , for 1826 ; in which , the means of the times of vibration of the horizontal magnetic needle only are given .
The actual intensities would exhibit the law of variation much better than the times , and as I have detected some numerical errors in the Table alluded to , it would be better to recompute the whole , and convert the times into proportional intensities by squaring the reciprocals of the times , and multiplying those squares by o , ooo , ooo , ooo , in order to render the results all integral .
It is now however too late for such recomputation , and all that remains is to put the reader on his guard against the errors alluded to .
