The asteroid character of the ambulacral system : the divisional plates not only being homologous with , but resembling in the manner of their disposition the ambulacral plates of Asteroidea ; at the same time furnishing a highly suggestive representation of their phylogenetic development .

The rudimentary structure of the mouth-armature , more asteroid than ophiuroid in general facies .
Absence of teeth , jaw-plates , and jaws .
4 .
Extension of the peritoneal cavity to the extremity of the functional portion of the rays , that is to say , to the margin of the pentagonal body .
5 .
The extremely rudimentary condition and aborted character of that portion of the brachial series which is prolonged beyond the body-disk .
6 .
The continuity of the tentacular pore-system limited to the disk only .
The above characters are clearly sufficient to stamp the peculiarity of this extraordinary echinoderm , and , whilst excluding it from any known group of genera by their remarkable nature and by the aberrant departure they present from all previous types , are such as would seem to necessitate the relegation of the form to a family apart by itself .
To speak definitely as to the exact position of intermediacy which the organism holds between the Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea would obviously be premature , without a more detailed examination of the internal anatomy than the present specimen in its dry condition will permit , as well as some knowledge of the life-history of the form .
It may however be safely affirmed without overstepping the bounds of due caution , that Astrophiura bridges further over , from the ophiuroid side , the differences which have separated the two orders , than any previously described starfish or brittle-star .

Quantitative comparisons of the two sides .
The following is a summary of the mean results of 100 comparisons of each pair of symmetrically situated spaces .
The mean difference of temperature is very unequal on the two sides of the head ; thus the mean difference for the 17 spaces , which are , on an average , higher in temperature on the right side than on the left , is 0*0589 ' C. ( 0*106 ' F. ) ; while the mean difference for the 17 spaces which are of higher temperature on the left side than on the right , is 0*1103 ' C. ( 0*198 ' F. ) The smallest differences noted are in the 4th district , 2nd tier , and 5th district , 2nd and 3rd tiers , all right side , and 5th district , .

The tiers are numbered from 1 to 6 from below upward .
There are 5 districts in each lateral half , formed by 4 equidistant lines drawn parallel to the median line .
The districts are numbered from 1 to 5 from the median line outward .
On the median line each tier measures , vertically , 2P33 mm. ( 0'83 inch ) .
On a horizontal line , passing through the occipital protuberance , each district measures , horizontally , 21 mm. ( 0-82 inch ) .
As in the case of the anterior region , the 5th tier wants the 5th district , and both the 4th and 5th districts are absent in the 6th tier .

O ' Part IV.\#151 ; On the effect of intellectual and emotional activity on the temperature of the Head .

The rapidity and degree of this rise is different in the different regions .

Different kinds of work in one and the same person , produce 1878 .
] \#163 ; /i$ Temperature of the Head .
elevations of temperature differing from each other both in rapidity of appearance and degree .
4th .
The kind of work which affects one region in the greatest degree affects all three regions most .
The anterior region shows , as a rule , both the most rapid and the highest rise of temperature .
The middle region comes next and the posterior last .
A notable exception to the above order is found , however , in the 1st district ( and sometimes the 2nd district ) of the 3rd , 4th , and 5th tiers of the middle region .
In these spaces , the middle region often shows a greater rise of temperature than that exhibited by a considerable part of the anterior region .
The average rise of temperature for each region is as follows : Anterior region , 0*02625 ' C. ( 0*04725 ' F. ) Middle region , 0*02062 ' C. ( 0*03711 ' F. ) Posterior region , 0*01743 ' 0 .
( 0*0313/ F. ) 5th .
Intellectual work , as a rule , causes a greater rise of temperature on the left side of the head than on the right side : but m a certain number of cases the rise is either greater on the right side or is equal on the two sides .
The following are the average percentages of times of occurrence of greater rise of temperature on the left side and on the right side , and of equal rise on the two sides , together with the mean difference of rise in favour of each side : Average percentage of 1 cases in favour of .

464 On the Temperature of the Head .
[ June 20 , Alterations in the same direction , but less common and less marked may also occur in the middle and posterior regions .
( \amp ; .
) Emotional Activity .
The following results have been obtained by the recitation of poetry Or prose of an emotional character:\#151 ; 1st .
Emotional activity , of the kind specified , causes a rise of temperature in all three regions ; this rise is , moreover , more rapid and of greater degree than that seen in intellectual work .
: 2nd .
Less difference exists between different regions in the rapidity and degree of rise of temperature in emotional activity than in intellectual work ; hut the order of the regions , as regards their comparative degrees of rise of temperature , is usually the same in the two cases .
The average rise of temperature for each region is as follows:_ Anterior region , 0-036 ' C. ( 0-0648 ' E. ) * middle region , 0-0345 ' C. ( 0-0621 ' F. ) ; posterior region , 0-033 ' C. ( 0-0594 ' F. ) Recitation to oneself produces , as a rule , a greater effect than recitation aloud .
This result is in accordance with physical laws , a portion of the heat produced being , in recitation aloud , consumed in exterior work .
3rd .
In emotional activity , as in intellectual work , the left side of the head is generally more affected than the right side .
The average percentages of times of occurrence of greater rise of temperature on the left side and on the right side , and of equal rise on the two sides , together with the mean difference of rise in favour of each side , are as follow:\#151 ; Equality .

] On Destroying the Activity of Cobra Poison .
Emotional activity , of the kind we have been considering , often extends very decidedly the tract of superior temperature on the left side of all three regions .
The effect of anger , in a moderate degree , after the intensity of passion has subsided , has been usually to increase the extent of the tract of superior temperature on the left side , in all three regions .
Vexation and mental irritability cause a rise of temperature , most marked in the anterior region and in the anterior spaces of the middle region ; the left side is most affected* VII .
" Notfe on the Effect of various Substances in Destroying the Activity of Cobra Poison .
" By T. Lauder Brunton , M.D. , F.R.S. , and Sir Joseph Fairer , K.C.S.I. , M.D. , F.R.S. Received June 20 , 1878 .
In a paper , read some time ago before this Society , by Mr. Peddler , he mentioned his discovery of the fact that the activity of cobra poison was completely destroyed by admixture with perchloride of platinum .
This substance , however , could only be regarded as a chemical and not as a physiological antidote to the poison , inasmuch as it had no power to modify or prevent the action of the venom after its absorption into the blood .
Mr. Peddler expressed his opinion that the proper method of pursuing the investigation was to investigate separately the action of platinum salts and of cobra poison upon the animal body .
In the discussion which followed we stated that the method proposed by Mr. Peddler was in the present instance not likely to lead to any results , and that as the action of the substance employed by him was in all probability due to its simply forming an insoluble compound with the cobra poison and not to any action of the platinum per $e , certain other metallic salts would have a similar action to the perchloride of platinum .
Experiments have confirmed the opinion we then expressed , * and we find the action of chloride of gold is precisely similar to that of perchloride of platinum , the cobra venom being rendered entirely inert by admixture with the gold salt before its injection into the body .
Chloride of gold , however , like perchloride of platinum , is merely a chemical antidote , and does not modify the action of the venom after its absorption into the circulation .
Permanganate of potash , which has been recommended as an antidote , also destroys its activity completely .
Chloride of zinc , chloride of mercury , nitrate of silver , and carbolic acid all diminish the activity of the poison , and prolong life when mixed with it before !
its injection ; but they do not prevent death , nor do they prolong life to any great extent .
