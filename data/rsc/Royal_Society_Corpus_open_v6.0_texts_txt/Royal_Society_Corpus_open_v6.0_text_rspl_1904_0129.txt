In a series of simple and convincing experiments Wright and Douglas* have shown that in phagocytosis so called , an important if not |a cardinal rdle is played by the body humors , whereby they act upon the bacteria , thus rendering the latter an easy prey for the polynuclear leucocytes .
The demonstration of this opsonic action of the serum or plasma was mainly brought about by testing separately and combined fthe body humors and the corpuscles which had been washed in salt ( solution .
Contrary to general opinion , Wright and Douglas found that the leucocytes were capable of engulfing microbes only when the latter had been attacked by the serum or plasma .
This attack on the microbe does not lead to the death of the latter , as sera may manifest a marked opsonic effect without being in the slightest degree bactericidal .
Wright and Douglas found that the opsonic substance was more or less thermolabile , being destroyed in 10 to 15 minutes at a temperature of *60 to 65 ' C. In subsequent papers these authors have demonstrated that there is a definite type of immunity in which the blood fluids co-operate with the leucocytes to destroy the invading micro-organisms , this being different from the antitoxic and bactericidal types of immunity which have already been studied with completeness .
Technique.\#151 ; The technique we have employed is that described by JWright , and for the most part the experiments were made with living cultures of Staphylococcus albus not more than 24 hours old .
For accurate and uniform results it is essential that the emulsions of the cultures should be homogeneous , the bacteria being uniformly distributed and separated from each other .
This is best obtained by shaking , and the subsequent application of the centrifuge .
From their tendency to group themselves into masses , certain strains of staphylococci are unsuitable for determining the opsonic power of the serum .
Where - 'different bacterial emulsions are compared with each other it is essential that they should contain the same number of bacteria , a result best obtained by counting and diluting as required . !
The leucocytes were obtained from the citrated blood of the authors and other human beings or from rabbits .
The sera used were either of human or animal origin and were for the most part from normal individuals .
In all cases the proportion of serum , bacteria , and corpuscles was 3:1:3 .

[ Jan. 10 , Effect of Heat upon Serum containing Opsonin.\#151 ; Serum ceases to exert an opsonic effect upon bacteria after it has been heated in the water bath at 60 to 65 ' for 10 to 15 ' .
In most cases the opsonic effect is totally abolished at this temperature , in a few cases , however , some slight effect can be witnessed , but this is mainly , if not entirely , due to traces of serum left attached to the leucocytes where these have been incompletely washed in normal salt solution .
Experiment.\#151 ; Normal rabbit 's serum ( three parts ) , mixed with staphylococcus emulsion ( one part ) , and washed human blood corpuscles ( three parts ) .
A portion of this was tested , the serum being unheated .
Other portions were heated to 60 ' C. for varying periods .
In each case a phagocytic count was made by numbering the cocci in fifty leucocytes and then striking the average per leucocyte .

At ordinary temperatures the opsonin is remarkably stable , showing practically no diminution for 24 hours .
Effects of Exposure to Light.\#151 ; In ordinary diffused daylight the opsonic power of the serum remains unaltered for many hours , but when exposed to bright sunlight for 3 hours a serum was seen to become less opsonic in the proportion of 10 : 7 .
Are the opsonins , or are the leucocytes , the variable factors w en 1905 .
] On the Opsonic Action of the Blood Serum .
381 the phagocytic power of different bloods is compared For many years Metchnikoff has taught that the leucocyte is the dominant factor in phagocytosis .
He has also emphasised the training of the leucocyte as the essential thing in immunity .
The experiments we have made confirm the results already obtained by Wright and point to the conclusion that the leucocyte is indifferent , the variable in a series of bloods being the serum .
In a first series of experiments the leucocytes derived from seven different persons were tested with respect to their phagocytic power , one and the same staphylococcic emulsion and one and the same serum ( rabbit 's ) being used in each case .
In a second series the sera of the seven individuals whose corpuscles had been used in the above experiment were tested in respect of their opsonic power , one and the same suspension of cocci , and one and the same variety of leucocytes ( derived from one of ourselves , W. B. ) being employed throughout .

Even in this case the leucocyte is largely an indifferent factor .

The last of these are the most complex , as the lytic action occurs only after the coalition of two distinct elements , the complement which for the most part is thermo-labile , and the immune body , which is thermostable .
The agglutinins are of simpler constitution , although here special conditions of the agglutinating substance ( the serum ) and the agglutinable substance ( the bacteria ) must exist before agglutination is manifest .
Temperatures above 70 ' C. applied either to the serum or to the bacteria suffice to { 1905 .
] On the Opsonic Action of the Blood .
inhibit the agglutination , although the agglutinin is apparently not entirely destroyed .
In comparison with the lysins and agglutinins the antitoxins are believed to be relatively simple bodies .
We have asked ourselves the question to which , if any , of these classes do the opsonins belong , and we have followed the usual methods of experimentation which have been utilised to determine the constitution of such antibodies .
These experiments chiefly consist in determining the temperature at which the specific action is abolished , the temperatures at which the antibody enters into combination with the bacteria , and whether the action of heat is one of destruction or merely a conversion into some modification in which the specific action is no longer manifest .
Can the opsonin act on bacteria which have been subjected to high temperatures ?
Experiment 1 .
Technique.\#151 ; Emulsions of cultures of staphylococcus were placed in sealed glass tubes and subjected to temperatures of 100 to 134 ' C. for varying periods , the opsonic action of serum on such heated cultures being compared with that upon unheated emulsions .

for hours the diminution in phagocytic power is about 50 per cent. It is possible , too , that the readings are really higher , as it is often very difficult to count the bacteria which have been subjected to such high temperatures on account of defective penetration of the stains employed .
Effect of heating to 60 ' C. a mixture of serum and cocci which have already been digested at 37 ' C. for 15 ' .
Dr. W. Bulloch and Mr. E. E. Atkin .
3S4 [ Jan. 10 , We have already seen that a temperature of 60 ' C. applied to the serum suffices to abolish its opsonic effect .
Wright and Douglas showed , however , that if the serum were first brought into contact with bacteria at 37 ' G. for 15 ' , and the mixture were then heated to 60 ' C. for 15 ' , the cocci were picked up by leucocytes without difficulty .
It was upon this experiment that they based their conclusion that the opsonin really acts upon the bacteria and does not merely stimulate the leucocyte .
We have thought it important to determine whether prolonged heating at 60 ' C. of opsonised cocci can destroy the opsonic-power so that these cocci cannot be picked up subsequently by leucocytes .
Experiment .
Technique.\#151 ; Normal serum ( three parts ) mixed with staphylococcus emulsion ( one part ) ; mixture kept in water bath at 37 ' C. for 15 ' .
This mixture , which is spoken of below as " opsonised cocci , " was then distributed into a series of glass pipettes which were placed in the water bath at 60 ' G. for periods of 15 ' up to 5 hours .
On removal from the water bath , four volumes of the " opsonised cocci " were mixed with three volumes of corpuscles at 37 ' C. for 15 ' , and the phagocytic count made as usual .
For comparison the phagocytic count of unheated serum + cocci , and of serum heated to 60 ' C. before being mixed with cocci , is added .

24-5 23 5 22 The experiment shows that some change is produced in the bacteria during the 15 ' exposure at 37 ' C. and the change is such that subsequent heating to 60 ' for even 5 hours is inoperative , this being very different to the effect of a preliminary heating of serum at 60 C. before admixture with bacterial emulsion .

The capsules were sealed and placed in the waAer bath at 37 ' C. or in a mixture of ice and salt .
After varying periods the capsules were removed and carefully centrifugalised for 1 hour , the clear supernatant fluid from each capsule being tested upon a fresh suspension of staphylococcus to see whether the opsonin had disappeared .
As a control the opsonic power of normal serum in proper dilution is also added , likewise the ppsonic power of serum which has been heated to 60 ' C. for 15 ' .

Experiments to Determine the Nature of the Opsonic Body , and Us Mode of Action.\#151 ; We have seen above , that when heated to 60 ' C. , serum ceases to exert an opsonic effect .
We have also seen that opsonin disappears from the serum when the latter is digested with bacteria at 37 ' C. , or at 0 ' C. Is this disappearance due to destruction , or does the opsonin pass into some modification , in which an opsonic effect is not visible 1 Is the opsonin a simple , or a complex structure ?

After digestion , mixture was centrifugalised for f hour .
In this way a clear supernatant fluid ( A ) was separated from a deposit of cocci ( A ' ) .
( 2 ) Normal serum was digested with an equal quantity of emulsion of cocci at 0 ' C. for 15 ' , centrifugalised as above , and separated into a supernatant fluid ( B ) and a deposit ( B ' ) .
As the serum was mixed with equal quantity of cocci , the controls made with normal serum and " normal " cocci are given in their appropriate dilutions , which were made with 0*85 per cent , saline .
The term " normal " is applied to cocci which have not been treated in any way .

The low reading in the case of the deposit B ' would also lead to the supposition that the action of heat at 60 ' has been to destroy the opsonin altogether .
This supposition is confirmed by the following experiment .
If heated serum is unable to exert an opsonic action on staphylococci , are the latter , when digested with heated serum , capable of being opsonised by unheated serum 1 1905 .

The cocci ( A ) having been quite uninfluenced by the heated serum , were capable of being opsonised by normal serum , and they were further , as shown in No 5 , capable of abstracting all the opsonin out of normal serum .
After being acted on by the normal serum , the mere addition of corpuscles demonstrated that they had been acted upon by the opsonin ( No. 6 ) .
I Results.\#151 ; 1 .
Opsonin is present in the normal serum .
2 .
Opsonin is thermolabile .
3 .
It rapidly disappears from the serum when the latter is mixed with bacteria at 37 ' C. or at 0 ' C. 4 .
After the opsonin has united with the bacteria the mixture of serum and cocci can be heated to 60 ' C. for long periods without abolition of the opsonic effect .
5 .
The leucocyte is practically an indifferent factor when the phagocytic power of different bloods is compared .
6 .
The capacity of bacterial emulsions for extracting opsonin from the serum is only slightly diminished by subjecting these emulsions to very high temperatures over prolonged periods . .
7 .
The action of heat is to destroy the opsonin , and not merely to convert it into a non-opsonisable modification .
8 .
The opsonin is not identical with any of the anti-bodies hitherto discovered in the serum .
9 .
The opsonin is of relatively simple constitution ; where these experiments cover the same ground as those of Wright and Douglas , , the observations of these authors are confirmed .
