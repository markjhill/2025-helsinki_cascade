The following paper is the first of a series of articles which we hope to publish on the Action of Sea-snake Venoms .
The work dealt with herein was carried out mainly in the Materia Medica Laboratory of the University of Edinburgh .
The kymographic work , however , was done in the Physiology Laboratory of that University , and we desire to express our sense of indebtedness to Professor E. A. Schafer for permitting us to use his apparatus .

Previous Literature Subject .
This is very scanty .
The main contributions have been the recent ones by Captain Leonard Rogers , to which we shall have frequent occasion to refer .
They appear in the ' Proceedings ' of the Royal Society , May 7th , 1903 , and June 18th , 1903 .
We may observe that the plan of the present work had been laid down by us long before we were aware that Captain Rogers was engaged on similar lines , and that we have but very little departed from our original scheme since reading his papers .
We need not say that we have read these papers with great interest .
Species of Snakes used .
The venom used in this research was obtained for us by Dr , P. P. Pinto , of Madras , who was put on special duty for this and kindred purposes by the Government of Madras , whose kind assistance we desire gratefully to acknowledge .
Two species only were used , viz. , Enliydrina , and Enhydris curt us .
The former is said by Dr. Pjnto to be the commonest Sea-snake infesting the coast of Madras Presidency .
Most of the specimens were small .
The venom collected from six snakes , averaging 2 feet 6 inches in length , amounted to between 30 and 40 milligrammes , but owing to an unfortunate accident the exact amount cannot be stated .
The Enhydris curtusproved a comparatively rare snake .
From eight specimens , Dr. Pinto obtained *022 gramme of poison or *00275 gramme per snake .
The Hydrophis gracilis was the only other moderately large Sea-snake brought in by the fishermen , but it was too rare to enable any useful amount of venom to be collected .
We are greatly indebted to Mr. Edgar Thurston , Superintendent of the Madras Government Museum , and to Mr. Ramuni Menon , of the Presidency College , Madras , for the kind assistance they gave Dr. Pinto in the work of identification .
Method of collecting the Venom .
The snakes were brought to Dr. Pinto by the fishermen , who frequently catch them in their nets along with their fish .
The glands were removed with aseptic precautions , and if they were sufficiently large the venom was expressed from them into a watch glass and dried in a desiccator over sulphuric acid .
The smaller sacs were dried in a similar manner and sent home in sealed bottles .
They were here again dried over sulphuric acid in the exhausted receiver of an air pump .
After carefully removing all tissues adhering to them , the contained venom was extracted by first opening up and minutely sub-dividing the glands , macerating them in successive small quantities of thymol water , and filtering the solutions , which were ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
afterwards mixed together and evaporated to dryness , over sulphuric acid , in the exhausted receiver of an air pump .
There was thus obtained a yellow , brittle and scaly product , freely soluble in water and having much the same appearance and characters as the venom expressed from the fresh glands .
This product , however , necessarily contained other substances than venom ; but it may be noted that maceration of the glands in water produced perfectly clear solutions and very little swelling and softening of the particles of undissolved substances , unlike the hazy solutions with swollen and softened undissolved particles , which are obtained when the poison glands of the Cobra and of many other serpents are similarly treated .
By this treatment , 60 dry glands of the , weighing 1*09 gramme , yielded *28 gramme of impure venom , whose lethal power will he dealt with presently .
Appearance of the Venom .
The venom of both species , as we received it from India , consisted of thin scales of a very pale yellow colour .
It readily dissolved in Ringer 's fluid , which was the solvent and vehicle we employed .
The M.L.D.of Enhydrina Venom .
Rogers ( loc.cit .
supra ) estimated the potency of the mixed Sea-snake venoms employed by him " by means of numerous experiments carried out with the mixed dried venom of a number of these snakes .
" He found that the M.L.D. for rats was *00007 gramme per kilo .
He appears to have made only two experiments on rabbits .
In one of these , *00004 gramme per kilo , killed in about four hours , in the other , *00001 gramme per kilo , produced no symptoms but loss of appetite , but a second dose of *00002 gramme per kilo .
, five days later , killed in a few hours .
We estimated the M.L.D. of the two kinds of venom at our disposal quite separately .
That of Enhydrina valakadien , being in the greater quantity , was tested first .

This series of experiments could not be completed , as the supply of venom had become exhausted .

; and *00015 gramme per kilo , reduced the animal to such a state that for 6 or 7 hours it seemed moribund , ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
but by the next morning it had practically recovered .
Doses ol ' '0001 and of '00009 gramme per kilo , failed to kill .
As the stock of pure venom at our disposal had now become exhausted , we were unable to continue farther , but it is evident that '0002 gramme per kilo , might with every probability of accuracy be put down as the M.L.D. for the cat .
It will be observed that our estimations of the M.L.D. 's of venom agree fairly well with those of Rogers for rats , and with his fragmentary estimates for rabbits .
In both cases his dose is lower than ours .
Both he and we find the dose for the rabbit lower than that for the rat .
As to the latter fact , it is partly explainable by the difficulty of getting the rabbit weighed food-free , and this , obviously , would raise its apparent weight and so lower the apparent M.L.D. This difficulty is not so great with the rat , whose real weight can be got fairly nearly after 24 hours ' starvation , especially as this animal always micturates when handled .
Rogers collected his venom by getting the snakes to bite through indiarubber sheeting ; ours was obtained by expression from the dissected glands .
Whilst our method facilitates the procuring of a perfectly aseptic product , it appears to yield a venom diluted with mucus , and consequently of a lower toxicity .
We have observed a similar difference in specimens of Cobra venom obtained by these two methods .
It is of interest to compare the lethality of Cobra venom with that of the Enhydrina valakadien .
The venoms were in both cases obtained for us by Dr. Pinto , under the same conditions and by the same methods , and the experiments were also made under exactly parallel conditions .
The results are shown in the accompanying table ( IV .
) .

'0006 .010 .00009 gramme per kilo .
.00006 .0002 It will be observed that the relative lethality of the two venoms for the various kinds of animal experimented with differs widely .
Taking the lowest M.L.D. in each case as the unit , we obtain the following relative values for lethality :\#151 ; Cobra venom rats = 1 ; rabbits = 1*2 ; cats = 20 .
Enhydrina venom ( valakadien ) rabbits = 1 ; rats = 1'5 ; cats = 3'3 .
These figures , and especially the cat-rodent relationship , suggest most strongly that the two venoms differ materially from each other in their actions .
As our stock of Enhydrina valakadien venom , obtained by compression of the glands in the fresh state , had failed , we were obliged to fall back on the dried glands we had received , the venom from which was extracted in the manner already described .
The lethal power of the venom so obtained was ascertained for rats and rabbits .

The lethal power of this venom-extract of the dried glands is therefore a little less than half that of the purer specimen of venom expressed from fresh glands by Dr. Pinto .
It may , however , be noted that a purer and much more active venom than the above could readily be obtained from dry glands , as one of us has shown , if the glands are subjected to a smaller number of successive extractions with thymol water than was adopted in the present case .
The M.L.D. of Enhydricurtus Venom .
A Belgian hare , weighing 2'34 kilos .
, was given '00006 gramme per kilo , of Enhydris curtus venom , but only slight symptoms were produced .
A cat , weighing 2'265 kilos .
, received '0002 gramme per kilo , of the venom , and it also was only slightly affected .
It was therefore obvious that the M.L.D/ s of our specimens of this venom and of that of Enhydrina valakadienwere not the same .
Our stock being limited , we selected white rats as the subjects on which to fully determine the lethality of the venom under consideration .
The results were as follows :\#151 ; Bats recovered from doses of '00007 gramme per kilo .
, '00008 gramme per kilo .
, '00009 gramme per kilo .
, '0001 gramme per kilo .
, '00015 gramme per kilo .

, '0003 gramme per kilo .
, '0004 gramme per kilo .
, and on two occasions from a dose of '0005 gramme per kilo .
* The left phrenic nerve responded at 420 millims. , the left vagus at 40 millims. , and the left sciatic at 290 millims. ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
A dose of '0005 gramme per kilo , proved all but fatal to a rat weighing '275 kilo .
Ihe animal lay for several hours apparently moribund .
The next day it was much better , and it then steadily recovered .

In all the above experiments , the injections were made subcutaneously at the abdomen , and absorption was hastened by rubbing the part .
The venom was dissolved in Ringer 's fluid , and the bulk of each injection was about 1 cub. centirn .
These results indicate that the specimen of venom with which we were working was of considerably lower lethality than that possessed by our specimens of Enhydrina valakadien venom , a dose of '00009 gramme per kilo , of the more VOL. CXCVII.-----B .
2 L powerful of the latter having proved fatal , as against one of *0006 gramme per kilo , of Enhydriscurtus venom .
Whilst recording this result , we do not desire to lay any great stress on it , although both venoms obtained from fresh glands were , to the best of our belief , collected under precisely similar conditions .
We have found a similar discrepancy between the lethal power of different specimens of Cobra venom expressed for us from fresh glands , under conditions which , apparently , were identical with each other .
Symptoms , dc .
, of Sea-Snake Poisoning .
Rogers has given an excellent description of the symptoms produced by Sea-snake venom in the lower animals .
We have only two comments to make on the subject .
1 .
Rogers says that it is impossible to distinguish between the symptoms in an animal poisoned with Sea-snake venom , and one poisoned with Cobra venom .
We have , however , observed that in the former the urgency of the dyspnoea is much greater than in the latter .
The animal ( rat , rabbit , or cat ) rushes from place to place as if suffocated , instead of remaining nearly motionless as a cobraised animal does .
The explanation of this difference becomes a simple one , when it is realised that , as we shall afterwards show , in Sea-snake poisoning , the venom acts on the respiratory apparatus alone , and leaves the heart and blood vessels practically unaffected , in so far as any direct action on them is concerned .
One of us has recently pointed out in a communication to the Royal Society that Cobra venom , on the other hand , has a powerful action on the heart : ( a ) directly on its muscle fibres or on the nerve-ends therein ; ( b ) through its vago-inhibitory apparatus ; and ( \lt ; ; ) through the increased pressure against which the organ has to work , in consequence of the action of the venom on the arterioles .
Consequently , though death takes place in cobraism primarily through the respiratory system , there is a steadily progressing depression of the cardiac functions going on paid passu with the respiratory embarrassment .
It naturally follows that the dyspnoea is masked thereby .
2 .
One of us had observed that in frogs poisoned with Cobra venom , the lower eyelid invariably rises , and that the extent of this rise is a distinct indication of the intensity of the poisoning .
A similar symptom is noticed in cobraised human beings , and was recorded also by one of us as being of constant occurrence in cobraised monkeys .
We refer to lid-drop of the upper eyelid .
A poisoned monkey will throw back his head to obtain sight through the narrow slit left below by the increasing ptosis , and will thus assume a characteristic position .
Dr. F. H. A. Marshall , whom we consulted on the subject , very kindly informed us that we were correct in inferring that the lower lid of the frog is depressed by muscular effort , and raised by elastic rebound on the cessation of such effort .
It is of interest to note that no ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
such symptom is observed when an animal is dying from Daboia poisoning ; indeed , it is easy to pick out frogs poisoned by Cobra and Daboia venom from each other by attention to this symptom alone .
It is therefore of special interest to find that this lid-rise is of invariable occurrence in frogs poisoned by the venom of the Sea-snakes we have worked with .
The point allies Cobra with Sea-snake venom in action , and distinguishes these venoms from the Daboia venom , if not also from the venom of all other Viperine snakes .
We may add that the same sign has been noticed in yet another form of Colubrine snake poisoning .
It only remains to add that a frog which received '002 gramme of venom per kilo , died in 18 hrs .
; one which received '001 gramme of the venom per kilo , died in 50 hrs .
; and a third which received '0005 gramme per kilo , survived the injection 3 days , and then died .
The symptoms of the poisoning were indistinguishable from those met with in cobraised frogs , failure of pulmonary respiration being an early and constant phenomenon .
The Antagonism between Calmette 's Serum and Enhydris Venom .
ItoGERS found Calmette 's serum " of no use against the poison of the Hydrophidae."* He tested it by adding minimal and slightly supra-minimal doses of the poison of Enhydrina to cub. centims. of fresh ( Calmette 's ) serum ; white rats being used in the experiments .
Whilst accepting the conclusion that the antivenene was , for all practical purposes , powerless against Enhydrina venom , we desired to satisfy ourselves as to the existence or otherwise of even a small measure of antagonism .
We accordingly devised two parallel series of experiments .
The first was undertaken with Cobra venom in order to standardise the sample of antivenene with which we were working ; the second was carried out with the poison of Enhydris curt as .
M. Calmette most kindly furnished us with a specimen of his antivenene , which was received in August , 1903 , and used in February , 1904 , 6 months later .
The M.L.D. of the specimen of Cobra venom used had been very carefully determined for white rats and was *0005 gramme per kilo .
The Sea-snake venom used was of an almost equal lethality , since a dose of *0005 gramme per kilo , reduced a rat to a moribund condition for several hours , while a dose of '001 gramme per kilo , killed in 1 hr .
25 mins .
The doses of venom and of serum were carefully calculated per kilo , weight of each animal ; they were mixed in small conical glasses and allowed to stand for exactly 30 mins .
; they were then injected each into the corresponding animal , and the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen was the site selected for the injections .
The tables are self-explanatory .

The order in which these animals died suggests that a feeble measure of protection was afforded by the antivenene .
There is , however , a great contrast between this action and that shown by the previous table , where Cobra venom was experimented with .
One of us has brought forward evidence to show that the antidotal effect of antivenene is most probably due to a chemical reaction between it and the venom it is capable of antagonising.* In accordance with this explanation of serum antidotism , the above experiments indicate that there is a chemical difference between the composition of the two venoms under comparison .
From this we would not unnaturally expect to find a corresponding difference between their actions .
To this point we shall return later on .

ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
Action of Enhydrina valakadienVenom on the Blood .
At our request , the following observations on this subject were made by G. Scott-Oarmichael , M.B. , Ch. B. , Junior Assistant in the Department of Materia Medica , who had previously made many similar observations , and in whose accuracy we have full confidence .
( a ) Action in vivo .
\#151 ; 1 .
Bed corpuscles from blood , taken immediately after death from the left side of the hearts of white rats killed by Enhydrina venom , showed in films no evidence of haemolysis having occurred .
The corpuscles were of normal size and contour and of uniform intensity of colour , and rouleaux formation was present as in health .
Serum which had separated spontaneously from this blood placed in capillary tubes showed haemoglobin coloration to the naked eye .
The fluid in all cases was of a dark venous colour .
2 .
Bed corpuscles from the blood of rats which had received less than the minimum lethal dose of this venom likewise showed no evidence of haemolytic change , and the serum from this blood was unstained with haemoglobin .
The blood was of a darker colour than that of health .
It was examined at different intervals after the injection in each case , one examination having been made on the day of injection and another on the following day .
( b ) Action in vitro.\#151 ; These observations were made in test-tubes and on microscope slides .
1 .
When the haemolytic action on the blood of rabbits and of man was tested , it was found that no effect was produced within 18 hrs .
in mixtures of blood and Enhydrina venom containing 1 of venom in 500 , 1 : 1000 and 1 : 2500 .
With 1 : 500 , however , a very slight effect was produced in 21 hrs .
, and with 1 : 250 in 18 hrs .
; and in both cases controls with mixtures of blood and saline had not yet been affected .
2 .
In contrast with these extremely slight effects , when similar observations were made with Daboia venom , it was found that in solutions of 1 : 500 , 1 : 1000 , and 1 : 2500 this venom has a relatively strong haemolytic action , both pigment diffusion and agglutination being distinctly produced by all of the solutions within 21 hrs .
, and by 1 : 500 solutions in less than 18 hrs .
No haemolysis was observable in control experiments within 24 hrs .
Action of Sea-Snake Venom on the Heart .
Bogers applied solutions of Sea-snake venom directly to the heart of pithed frogs , and obtained " no appreciable effect " thereby .
He says :\#151 ; " As a few drops of a 1/ 1000 solution of Enhydrina poison given per venam , and , therefore , further greatly diluted in the circulation , is very rapidly fatal , it is evident that the poison should produce a very marked action on the heart when directly applied to it if the lethal effect is in any degree due to cardiac paralysis .
" Whether these conclusions be right or wrong , we considered that they were founded on insufficient data , since Fairer and Brunton* pointed out about 30 years ago that there was a great difference in the action of a presumably allied poison , viz. , that of the Cobra , according as it was applied to the surface of a frog-heart or perfused through its cavity .
In a recent contribution to the pharmacology of Cobra venom , f one of us has shown that a solution so weak as 1/ 10,000,000 of this poison exerts an appreciable effect on the isolated frog-heart , when perfused through its cavity , and that a solution of 1/ 100,000 takes but a few minutes to paralyse that organ in a condition of extreme systole .
When a 1:1000 solution of the same venom was dropped continuously on a suspended frog-heart , only a very slight quickening of the beat and a slight tendency of the organ to pass towards systole was observed .
The contrast between these two sets of results is very marked , and confirms Fairer and Brunton 's work .
We were , therefore , of opinion that it was not possible to definitely decide that Sea-snake venom had no cardiac action till experiments had been made both with the isolated heart and with the heart exposed situ .
It seemed important to make both sets of experiments , since previous work with Cobra venom had shown that the heart is acted on by that poison in two manners ; on the one hand , by the direct systole-increasing action of the venom on the muscle tissue or on its nerve-ends , and , on the other , by the tendency to inhibition caused by the direct action of the venom on the vago-inhibitory centre as well as by its indirect action on the same centre through the medium of failing respiration .
Our first object was to ascertain if either or both of these actions was likewise exerted by Sea-snake venom .
Perfusion of the Frog-Heart with Solutions of Enhydrina Venom .
A modification of Schafer 's plethysmograph was employed for this purpose .
The details of the experimental method were in all respects the same as those described by one of usf in a similar series , in which Cobra venom was under investigation .
The fluid perfused consisted of one part of ox-blood and two parts of Binger 's fluid .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; An isolated frog-ventricle was perfused with a 1 :20,000 solution of Enhydrina venom , with negative results .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; An isolated frog-ventricle was perfused with a 1 : 5000 solution of Enhydrina venom .
The beat quickened slightly , and the heart passed into fatigue in the ordinary course .

ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; Was undertaken to make sure that the quickening observed was actually due to the venom .
A heart was perfused for 2 hrs .
, and whilst its beat was very steady a 1 : 5000 solution of Enhydrina was admitted .
The following were the changes observed in the heart 's rate :\#151 ; 4 mins , before venom was admitted there were 21 *5 beats per min. 3 55 55 55 21 2 55 55 55 21 1 min. 55 55 55 21-5 1 min. after 55 55 21-5 2 mins .

Extracts from Frog-heart Perfusion Tracing .
I Rogers* found that the average quantity of dried venom obtained from single bites of thirteen different living specimens of the Enhydrina was just under l centigramme .
It will be remembered that our own estimates of the available * 'Roy .
Soc. Proc./ vol. 71 .
amounts of venom , in the glands of the species we have had to do with , were much lower than this .
Accepting Rogers ' figure of about a centigramme of venom per bite , the maximum possible concentration in the blood of an average man would be about 1 : 500,000 .
This figure is arrived at by taking the weight of an average man at 70 kilos , and his blood at about one-fourteenth of this figure .
The calculation stands thus : 70,000 grammes X 1/ 14 X 1/ 100 = 1/ 500,000 .
Since a solution 100 times as strong as this has but very feeble action on the isolated ventricle , whilst the results of perfusion with a solution twenty-five times as strong as that which could be in operation after a bite are negative , we may safely conclude that Enhydrina venom differs markedly from Cobra venom , in that it has no direct action on the heart in any strength of solution ever likely to be present in the bodies of human victims of this species of Sea-snake .
Perfusio7i of the Vessels of the Frog with Enhydrina Venom .
Two experiments were made with a solution of Enhydrina valakadien venom of a strength of 1 : 50,000 .
The results were entirely negative .
It is of interest to recall , as one of us has shown , * that Cobra venom , even in a solution so dilute as 1 :10,000,000 , produces decided constriction of the vessel walls .
The contrast between this powerful action and the absence of direct constriction by Enhydrina venom has a distinct bearing , as might have been expected , on the level of blood-pressure in these two different kinds of snake poisoning .
This point will afterwards be returned to .
We are indebted to Mr. Jolly , who carried out these experiments for us under our supervision .
KymographicExperiments with the Venom of Enhydrina valakadien .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; A cat , weighing 2*5 kilos .
, was etherised and a tracheal cannula inserted , through which ether was then given ; respirations were recorded by means of a double stethograph ; the blood pressure was taken in the carotid ; a cannula was tied into the external jugular ; and the venom solution was placed in a graduated cylinder connected with the cannula by a short piece of rubber tubing .
On this tubing a clip was placed , by the removal of which the solution could be admitted , and the fluid thus found its way slowly into the heart by its own weight , or , if required , it could be introduced faster , by means of a rubber ball arrangement which screwed on to the top of the cylinder .
After a normal had been obtained , one-fifth of the S.M.L.D. ( subcutaneous minimum * Captain R. H. Elliot , I.M.S. , ' A Contribution to the Study of the Action of Indian Cobra Poison , ' communicated to the Royal Society , January 18 , 1904 .

lethal dose ) was introduced into the circulation , dissolved in 10 cub. centims. of Rixger 's fluid .
The injection lasted 2| mins .
A distinct rise of blood pressure took place , and continued after the injection had been finished ; but the rate and force of respiration did not much alter .
6 mins , after the commencement of the first injection , a second injection was made , which occupied 3 mins .
Very little effect was produced , and 12 mins , after the commencement of the first injection a third was given , equivalent to 4 M.L.D. 's , in 20 cub. centims. of Ringer 's fluid , and this took 6 mins , to pass in , and was accompanied first by a slight fall and then by a very large rise of blood pressure .
The rise continued after the injection had been completed , and was synchronous with the increasing failure of respiration .
A fall occurred only when the heart stopped beating , or at least recording .
The heart-rate remained very constant throughout the experiment ( Table X. ) .

The blood pressure rose rapidly , then fell back to its original level , but it rose again as respiration failed , and then fell sharply to death .
The first rise was probably mainly due to the large bulk of the injection , and the second was obviously asphyxial .
The slowing of the heart , which accompanied the respiratory failure , was also probably asphyxial , and due to an action on the vago-inhibitory centre .

, was etherised , and a tracheal cannula inserted , through which the anaesthetic was continued to be given .
Blood pressure was taken in a carotid , and respiratory movement was recorded by means of a double stethograph .
Injections were made through an external jugular vein .
After taking a normal , one-fifth of the subcutaneous M.L.D. was injected intravenously , dissolved in 4 cub. centims. of Ringer 's fluid .
There was a sharp rise of blood pressure , followed by an equally sharp fall .
At the time of the second injection the pressure had fallen till it stood at the same point as that which it had occupied at the beginning of the experiment .
At the 85th minute , a second injection , the same in amount , \amp ; c. , as the last , was given ; and at the 105th minute , a third injection , double the dose of either of the two preceding , was given .
The rises which followed each of these injections were probably largely due to the bulk of fluid injected .
The heart rate remained very nearly constant for a long time and then fell slowly .
Respiratory rhythm was early affected , as is shown by the accompanying extracts from the tracings .
Rogers recorded his observation " that Cheyne-Stokes breathing is sometimes simulated " in Enhydrina poisoning , experimentally produced .
Our extracts from this tracing ( p. 269 ) are an interesting confirmation of his statement .
As death approached the blood pressure tended to fall .
This observation is not really in opposition to Rogers ' experience of a marked rise in blood pressure ushering in death , for in all his recorded experiments death occurred much more rapidly than in the ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
case we are now considering .
Indeed , it was our conviction that Rogers had confined himself too exclusively to large doses , and this led us to administer much smaller doses in addition to large ones .
W^e need hardly insist on the advisability of approximating the doses ( so far as experimental requirements admit ) as closely as possible to those likely to be met with in actual experience .
Details of the tracing will be found in the accompanying table ( Table XII .
) .
The main inference would appear to be that the venom has no cardio-inhibitory action such as one meets with in cobraism , Experiment 3.\#151 ; Extracts from Blood-pressure Tracing , showing marked changes of respiratory rhythm .
but that the increasing venosity of the blood , which is induced by slow failure ot respiration , exerts an indirect inhibitory influence on the heart through the vagal centre in the medulla oblongata .
When rapid failure of respiration occurs , with a heart still undamaged , abrupt rises of blood pressure accompany asphyxiation .
This is not the case in the slower cases whose course we have just sketched out above .
It may be urged that in cobraism , abrupt asphyxial rises of the blood-pressure curve immediately precede death , even though Cobra venom has a marked inhibitory action on the heart , both direct and indirect .
There is , however , an element in cobraism , which we have shown to be lacking in Sea-snake poisoning , viz. , the action Table XII.\#151 ; Experiment No. 3 .

Blood pressure fell steadily to the end .
Respiratory failure was presumably the cause of the cardiac slowing .
of the venom on the blood-vessels , which leads to powerful constriction of their walls and so maintains a high pressure , despite other opposing influences .
As we have ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
already shown , the venom of Enhydrina has no direct constrictive action on the arterial walls .
Experiment 4.\#151 ; A cat , weighing 2 kilos .
, was etherised , and etherisation was maintained-through a tracheal cannula .
The blood pressure was taken in a carotid artery , and the auricular and ventricular movements were recorded by means of levers attached to the heart by hooks and silk threads , the chest wall being partly removed for the purpose .
Two injections were made through an external jugular vein of five and ten times the subcutaneous minimum lethal dose , respectively , of Enhydrina valakadienvenom .
The accompanying table ( Table XIII .
) shows the changes observed .
The high rises of blood pressure after each injection are , doubtless , due to the volume of fluid injected .
It will be observed that at the beginning of the second phase of the experiment , the pressure had fallen to its original level .
The force of heat was lessened , but that is to he expected in operations so severe as this , especially in winter , even although , as in this experiment , all ordinary precautions to avoid shock are taken .
The striking feature of the experiment is well shown on the accompanying extracts from the tracings ( p. 272 ) , and is the absence of all signs of inhibition , even though the doses of venom given were relatively very high , viz. , five times the subcutaneous M.L.D. on the first administration , and ten times the subcutaneous M.L.D. on the second administration .
Both the rate of beat and the amplitude of the excursions of the auricular and ventricular levers show by their constancy that this venom has no direct action on the heart , even when given intravenously in doses far above those which would be met with in snake-bite in man .
Experiment 5.\#151 ; A cat , weighing 2'5 kilos .
, was etherised , and a cannula was placed in the trachea for the farther administration of the anesthetic .
Blood pressure was taken in the carotid , and respirations were recorded by means of a double stethograph ( the movements of the lever are expressed in millimetres as some indication of the respiratory excursions ) .
Injections were made by the external jugular vein with a fine hypodermic needle , and the venom solution consisted of *001 gramme of Enhydrina valakadien venom , extracted from glands , dissolved in 1 cub. centim. of Ringer 's fluid .
The subjoined table ( Table XIV .
) shows the results as recorded .
In this experiment we were careful to reduce the bulk of our injections , and it is here clearly demonstrated that there is no rise of blood pressure apart from that attendant on progressive asphyxiation .
Even then we do not notice any large rise , hut , on the contrary , the pressure gradually falls towards death , the heart at the same time failing .
A point of interest is the appearance , in this tracing also , of curves indicating a type of breathing like the Cheyne-Stokes type , / these curves make their appearance directly after the second injection .
The type of respiration is altered in another respect , as may be seen in the extracts from the tracing ( p. 274 ) .

Action on the Motor Nerve-ends .
If a very large dose of the Sea-snake venoms dealt with in this paper is injected intravenously into an animal , the animal dies in a few minutes , and asphyxial convulsions are absent or ill-marked .
Rogers noticed this , and attributed it to the respiratory centre being completely paralysed " before the failure of the breathing had had time to render the blood sufficiently venous to produce respiratory convulsions .
" He adds , " Another possible explanation must , however , be considered : a paralysis of the end-plates of the motor nerves might cut off the peripheral ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .

" He then proceeded to test the state of the motor nerve-ends in two legs , one of which was ligatured and one free , and he showed that those of the protected leg remained active , whilst those of the other became paralysed .
He concludes that " it is therefore impossible to say how far the absence of convulsions is due to this cause ( paralysis of the phrenic nerve-ends ) , and how far to failure of the respiratory centre .
To clear up this point he made two experiments , one on a cat and the other on a rabbit .
The phrenic ( left ) was exposed in the neck , and stimulated at intervals , the results being graphically recorded .
He was led to conclude that " the first and most important action of the poison appears to be its effect on the respiratory centre , although the paralysis of the phrenics speedily ensues , and is a very important feature of the action of the venom/ ' Rogers used a current with the secondary coil 25 millims. Ragotzi ' " has stated that in order to obtain evidence of peripheral nerve-end paralysis in cobraism , one must avoid the administration both of large rapidly fatal doses and of too small doses .
In fact , there must be a moderately large dose in circulation , and it must be allowed a sufficient time to act .
One of us has recently shown that the phrenic nerve-ends remain fully sensitive ( a ) in animals which have been poisoned by large intravenous doses of Cobra venom , and ( b ) in those which have been killed by subcutaneous doses not greatly exceeding the minimum lethal .
It was at the same time shown that the phrenic nerve-ends can be paralysed by giving lethal doses and then maintaining life by means of artificial respiration .
The obvious inference was that in cobraism the respiratory centre is first attacked ; and that this was not improbable was demonstrated by exposing the medulla oblongata and applying Cobra venom directly to its surface , when the centre speedily became paralysed , in one case death occurring in 12 mins .
In order to investigate more fully the action of Enhydrina poison on the various nerve-ends , and especially on the phrenics , three series of experiments were undertaken .
Series 1.\#151 ; Experiment 1.\#151 ; A rat weighing '195 kilo , was etherised , and received an intravenous injection of Enhydriscurtus venom .
The dose was equivalent to 14 M.L.D. 's if given subcutaneously , and was dissolved in 1 cub. centim. of Ringer 's fluid .
Death took place in 4 mins .
The chest was at once opened and the exposed phrenics were tested with the secondary current ( Neave 's hammer in circuit ) .
No diaphragmatic contraction was observed even with a maximal stimulus .
The vagi were next exposed and stimulated ; again , even a maximal stimulus failed to produce a decided response , the heart being slowed but not stopped .
A sciatic nerve was then tried and gave a response at 120 millims. Experiment 2.\#151 ; A rat weighing *132 kilo , received intravenously seventeen times the subcutaneous M.L.D. of Enhydris curtus venom , and was dead in 2|- mins .
The left phrenic nerve again gave no response to maximal stimuli ; the right responded by a feeble diaphragmatic twitch with the secondary coil at 70 millims. Even with a maximal stimulation the diaphragmatic twitch was very feeble .
Stimulation of the vagi , with the secondary coil home , again failed to inhibit the heart * Virchow 's ' Archiv fur Pathol .
Anat .
und Physiol. , ' vol. 122 , 1890 , p. 201 .
ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
completely though it slowed it .
The left sciatic responded at 180 millims. by producing a feeble muscular twitch .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; A precisely similar experiment was made with a rabbit which received ten times the subcutaneous M.L.D. intravenously .
A maximal stimulation of the phrenics produced no diaphragmatic response .
Experiment 4.\#151 ; A rat was etherised and its trachea was ligatured .
As soon as death had occurred , the nerve-ends were tested as before , with the following results\#151 ; Phrenic response at 450 millims. ; vagal response at 90 millims. Clearly , therefore , the nerve-end paresis we have noted was not accounted for by suffocation .
Experiments on cats , rats and rabbits killed by a blow on the head have shown that stimulation of a normal phrenic nerve or of a sciatic with the secondary coil at 450 millims. produces marked muscular contraction .
The exact strength of current to produce a complete temporary inhibition of the heart varied .
In rabbits and cats such inhibition was usually got with the secondary coil at 100-140 millims. , but in rats one had generally to bring the coil nearer , 80-90 millims. being a common but not always sufficiently approximated distance to cause definite inhibition .
It should be mentioned that even when the nerves of the poisoned animals above dealt with failed to give any response to a maximal stimulus , the muscles responded readily to a comparatively weak shock .
Series 2.\#151 ; Whenever it was possible to do so , we tested the condition of the phrenic , sciatic and vagal nerve-ends immediately on death in the animals used for ascertaining the minimum lethal doses .
In order to keep the conditions uniform , we watched each animal , and opened the thorax as soon as the corneal reflex had disappeared and respiration had ceased .
We are unable to lay down any rule establishing a relationship between the .
amount of nerve-end paresis noted and the doses of venom used , but we found a distinct diminution of nerve-end activity so constantly present as to leave no doubt in our minds that we were dealing with cause and effect .
The direct Action of EnhydrinaVenom on the Respiratory .
Series 3.\#151 ; We exposed the medulla oblongata of rabbits , by dividing the soft structures at the back of the neck , and cutting away the posterior occipito-atlantoid ligament .
A large quantity ( 2-5 milligrammes ) of Enhydrina venom was then dropped on to the medulla over the seat of the respiratory centre .
The type of respiration was in each case quickly and profoundly affected , and the animals died with every evidence of respiratory failure , and the excitability of the phrenic and other nerve-ends was found at death to be distinctly impaired .
We could not succeed in killing an animal with its nerve-ends still undamaged , as can be done when Cobra venom is applied in a similar way .
It would accordingly appear to be impossible with Enhydrina venom to kill a rabbit directly through its respiratory centre , before the poison has had time to enter the general circulation and thus affect the nerve-ends .
On the other hand , the rapidity with which the type of respiration was altered , both in the above experiments and in those in which the venom was intravenously injected , appears to us to leave no room for doubt that the respiratory centre is directly affected by this venom .
The conclusion would appear to be that both the centre and the nerve-ends are affected , and that this double action is responsible for the remarkable embarrassment of respiration which is characteristic of the action of Sea-snake venoms .
Summary of Conclusions .
( 1 ) Enhydrina venom has no direct action on the walls of the arterioles , or at least has no such action in any strength of solution which could be met with in the blood of a human victim of Sea-snake bite .
( 2 ) Enhydrina venom acts directly on the isolated frog-ventricle , producing a tonic and stimulating effect , but this action is produced only by very strong solutions ( 1 : 5000 ) .
The heart beat is quickened , and the result is , therefore , similar to that produced by very weak solutions of Cobra venom ( 1 : 1,000,000 or weaker ) .
( 3 ) By experimenting with the mammalian heart exposed situ , we have shown that Enhydrina venom has no direct action on the vagal cardio-inhibitory centre .
This affords a striking contrast to the condition observed in Cobra poisoning .
In the latter case , the powerful tonic and stimulant action of the venom on the heart muscle ( or probably on its nerve-ends ) is masked by equally powerful and direct stimulation of the cardio-inhibitory centre .
In Enhydrina poisoning , on the other hand , the complete absence of cardio-inhibition leaves the feeble tonic action on the heart free to manifest itself , as appears to be displayed in several of our tracings .
We cannot otherwise explain the increase in rate of the heart beats which we have not infrequently observed .
( 4 ) Enhydrina venom has apparently no direct action on the vaso-motor centre .
Rogers found that on the injection of a Viperine venom , or of the venom of the Colubrine Banded Krait ( Bungarus fasciatus ) into an animal , a marked fall of blood pressure occurred , which was of central origin .
In collaboration with Drs. Sillar and Carmichael ( of the Materia Medica Laboratory , Edinburgh ) , one of us has found that a similar and powerful action is exerted by the venom of the common Krait ( B. cceruleus).* The absence of any such action in the Sea-snake venoms with which we are dealing is , therefore , worthy of note .
( 5 ) The blood-pressure curve in Enhydrina poisoning is a remarkably steady one , provided that moderate doses are given and that care is taken to avoid the injection of large volumes of fluid into the blood-vessels .
This is due to the fact that the * Paper communicated to the Royal Society , June 9 , 1904 .
ON THE STUDY OF THE ACTION OF SEA-SNAKE VENOMS .
blood pressure is exposed neither to the influence of the rival forces which act on the heart so strongly in cobraism , nor to the direct vaso-motor changes which we have dealt with in the preceding paragraph .
( 6 ) The respiratory mechanism appears to be that which is chiefly affected by Enhydrina venom .
If large lethal doses are employed , such as Rogers appears to have confined himself to , respiration falls rapidly , and a considerable rise of blood pressure , asphyxial in origin , may precede death .
The heart beat also quickly slows , and blood pressure falls with corresponding rapidity .
Obviously , these are simply the phenomena of rapid asphyxiation .
If , however , smaller doses of venom are employed , no marked rise in blood pressure occurs .
The ordinary level is maintained till near the occurrence of death ; the beat then slows and the blood pressure falls .
Here we have an expression of gradual cardiac failure , brought about by slowly progressive asphyxiation .
The absence in slow Enhydrina poisoning of the large asphyxial rises of pressure , which are so characteristic of the final stages of Cobra poisoning , is readily explained by the fact that Enhydrina venom has no direct constrictive action on the walls of the arterioles , such as Cobra venom possesses .
( 7 ) As to the part of the respiratory mechanism that is affected by Sea-snake venom , the rapidity with which respiration is modified , both when venom is injected into a vein and also when it is applied directly to the medulla oblongata , leaves no room to doubt that the respiratory centre is directly acted on by the venom .
On the other hand , we have shown that some degree of motor nerve-end paresis is constantly present in animals dying from the effects of subcutaneous injections of this venom .
We have also emphasised the fact that in our experiments carried out by dropping venom on the exposed medulla oblongata , we have failed to kill animals through the respiratory centre with the motor nerve-ends still undamaged .
In this respect we have shown that Enhydrina venom differs in its action from Cobra venom .
It would , therefore , appear that in poisoning with Enhydrina venom , motor nerve-end paresis plays a much greater part than it does in cobraism .
It is not difficult to suppose that a blunting of the motor nerve-end mechanism , even though far from absolute , may seriously add to the embarrassment of a centre which has already been directly and gravely damaged .
We hope to return to this and other points in a future communication .
In conclusion , we desire to express our sense of indebtedness to the India Office , to the Government of India , and last , but by no means least , to the Madras Government for the assistance and facilities which they have given us in the carrying out of this research .
