] Mr. Christie in this communication gives an account of some experiments on the development of magnetism in copper by rotation .
He corroborates by his own experience the results obtained by Mr. Babbage and Mr. Herschel , in which a disc of copper was set in rotation by the rotation of one or more magnets beneath it , both in the case when poles of the same name were immediately below the disc and when of a contrary name .
The action appeared equally intense in both cases , and from this circumstance the author concludes the magnetism thus communicated to the copper to be extremely transient .
The experiment was varied by combining the revolving magnets differently , and the results are stated .
The next experiments of Mr. Christie were directed to the determination of the law according to which the force diminishes as the distance between the disc and magnets increases .
It seems to follow from these experiments , that when a thick copper plate is made to revolve under a small magnet , the force tending to deviate the needle is directly as the velocity , and inversely as the fourth power of the distance ; but that when magnets of considerable size are made to revolve under these copper discs , the diminution follows more nearly the ratio of the inverse square of the distance , -or between the square of the cube , though not in any constant ratio of an exact power .
The author then investigates the law of force when copper discs of different weights are set in rotation , which for small distances appear proportioned to the weights of the discs , but for greater ones appear to vary in some higher ratio .
