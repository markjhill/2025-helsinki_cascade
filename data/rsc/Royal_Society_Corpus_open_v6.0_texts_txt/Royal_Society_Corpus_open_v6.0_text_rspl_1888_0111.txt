In a recent memoir* Mr. Love has considered this question among others ; but he has not discussed his result [ equation ( 95 ) ] , except in its application to a rather special case involving the existence of a free edge .
When the cylinder is regarded as infinitely long , the problem is naturally of a simpler character ; and I have thought that it might be worth while to express more fully the frequency equation , as applicable to all vibrations , independent of the thickness of the shell , which are periodic with respect both to the length and the circumference of the cylinder .
In order to prevent misunderstanding , it may be well to premise that the vibrations , whose frequency is to be determined , do not include the gravest of which a thin shell is capable .
If the middle surface be simply bent , the potential energy of deformation is of a higher order of magnitude than in the contrary case , and according to the present method of treatment the frequency of vibration will appear to be zero .
It is known , however , that the only possible modes of bending of a cylindrical shell are such as are not periodic along the length , or rather have the wave-length in this direction infinitely long.f When the middle surface is stretched , as well as bent , the potential energy of bending may be neglected , except in certain very special cases .
Taking cylindrical co-ordinates ( r , 0 , js ) , and denoting the displacements parallel to z , 0 , r by u , v , w respectively , we have for the principal elongations and shear at any point ( a. , 0 , \#171 ; )\#163 ; \#151 ; du dz ' w | 1 dv a a d0 ' 1 du ^d a d\lt ; fc dz ( i ) ; and the energy per unit of area is expressed by 2nh | eg + \lt ; t22 + + + *2)* } ... ... ... . . .

In the integration of these expressions with respect to 0 and z , the mean value of each sin3 or cos3 is-|.* We may then apply Lagrange 's method .

In this motion the material is sheared without extension , every generating line of the cylinder moving along its own length .
The frequency depends upon the circumferential wave-length , and not upon the curvature of the cylinder .
The second kind of vibrations are those in which TJ = 0 , so that the motion is strictly in two dimensions .
The elimination of the ratio V/ W from ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) gives \amp ; 2{\amp ; 2\#151 ; 2(M + l ) ( 1 + s2 ) } = 0 as the frequency equation .
The first root is \amp ; 2 \#151 ; 0 , indicating infinitely slow motion .

It will be observed that when s is very large , the flexural vibrations tend to become exclusively normal , and the extensional vibrations to become exclusively tangential , as might have been expected from the theory of plane plates .
M Returning now to the general case , the determinant of ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) gives on reduction [ \amp ; 2_^2_s2]{jfc3[\amp ; 3-2(M + l ) ( jU2 + S3 +1 ) ] + 4(2M +l)/ *2 } +4(2M+l\gt ; 2s2 = 0 ... ... ... ... ... ( 24 ) .

( 25 ) .
Corresponding to the first root we have U \#151 ; 0 , W = 0 , as is readily proved on reference to the original equations with s \#151 ; 0 .
The vibrations are the purely torsional ones represented by v \#151 ; sin ficos ... ... ... ... ..(26 ) , The frequency depends upon the wave-length parallel to the axis , and not upon the radius of the cylinder .
The remaining roots of ( 25 ) correspond to motions for which V = 0 , or which take place in planes through the axis .
The general character of these vibrations may be illustrated by the case where / i is small , or the wave-length a large multiple of the radius of the cylinder .

This is the ordinary formula for the longitudinal vibrations of a rod , the fact that the section is here a thin annulus not influencing the result to this order of approximation .
Another extreme case worthy of notice occurs when s is very great .
Equation ( 24 ) then reduces to W[W-p ?
-Sr\ [ \amp ; 2\#151 ; 2(M+1 ) Ca2 + s2 ) ] =0 ... ... ... ... ( 34 ) ; so that \amp ; 2 becomes a function of p and s only through ( u,2 + s2 ) , as might have been expected from the theory of plane plates .
The first root relates to flexural vibrations ; the second to vibrations of shearing , as in ( 18 ) ; the third to vibrations involving extension of the middle surface , analogous to those in ( 22 ) .
It is scarcely necessary to add , in conclusion , that the most general deformation of the middle surface can be expressed by means of a series of such as are periodic with respect to z and 0 , so that the problem considered is really the most general small motion of an infinite cylindrical shell .
[ Another particular case worth notice arises when 6 = 1 , so that ( 24 ) assumes the form fc2(\amp ; 2 - p*-1 ) [ 7C2 - 2(M +1 ) ( p ?

As we have already seen , if pbe zero , one of the values of \amp ; 2 vanishes .
If p be small , the corresponding value of fc2 is of the order p4 .
Equation ( 35 ) gives in this case .T5.3-2M+1 .
