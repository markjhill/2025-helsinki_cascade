" ( On the Epipolic Dispersion of Light ; being a Supplement to a paper entitled 'On a case of Superficial Colour presented by a Homogeneous Liquid internally colourless .
' " By Sir John Frederick William Herschel , Bart. , F.R.S. &amp;c. The author inquires whether the peculiar coloured dispersion of white light intromitted into a solution of sulphate of quinine , is the result of an analysis of the incident light into two distinct species , or merely of a simple subdivision analogous to that which takes place in partial reflexion , as exemplified in the colours of thin plates .
He endeavours to ascertain the laws which regulate this singular mode of dispersion , which for brevity he terms epipolic , on account of the proximity of the seat of dispersion to the intromitting surface of the fluid .
It might have been expected that by passing the same incident beam successively through many such dispersive surfaces , the whole of the blue rays would at length be separated from it , and an orange , or red residual beam be left : but the author establishes , by numerous experiments , the general fact , that an epipolical beam of light , meaning thereby a beam which has been once transmitted through a quiniferous solution , and undergone its dispersing action , is incapable of farther undergoing epipolic dispersion .
There were only two liquids , out of all those examined by the author , namely oil of turpentine and pyroxylic spirit , which , when interposed in the incident beam , act like the solutions of quinine in preventing the formation of the blue film : and the only solid in which the author discovered a similar power of epipolic dispersion , is the green fluor of Alston Moor , and which by this action exhibits at its surface a fine deep blue colour .
