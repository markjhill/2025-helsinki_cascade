On the difference of Meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris .
By THOMAS HENDERSON , Esq. Communicated by J. F. W. HERSCHEL , Esq. Sec. R. S. Read May 17 , 1827 .
IN the Philosophical Transactions for 1826 , Part II .
Mr. HERSCHEL has given a detailed account of observations , which were made in the month of July , 1825 , for the purpose of ascertaining the difference of the meridians of the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris , with a computation of these observations , from which the most probable value of the difference of longitude appears to be.r 21 .
6 .
But I have perceived that in the copy of the observations delivered to him from the Royal Observatory of Greenwich , an error of one second has been committed ; as the true sidereal time of the observation made there on 9ist July , ought to be Y17 g38 5 7'r1 in place of x7h s8m 5G6'io , set down in the Table p. 104 , which he informs me was computed at the Observatory , and officially communicated to him from the Astronomer Royal .
This error seems to have had its origin in the little Table at the bottom of page 1os ; for , on subtracting the error of the clock , 47'37 , from the time i8I 8"m so3'0 , the true sidereal time is 18h 7m 43803 , instead of 18h 7m 42'03 , there given .
The error in the result of that day 's observations , arising from this cause , has been partly compensated by a mistake of three tenths of a second , which has occurred in calculating the combined observations of the same day , the gain of mean on sidereal time being stated to be 4s54 ( pp. 120 and 122 ) , in place of -4S'24 .
On checking the other observations , a few trifling alterations appear to be necessary upon the Greenwich Table of sidereal time , from the data given along with it .
These seem to be occasioned by different methods of calculation , and indeed are hardly worthy of notice .
The French astronomers not having given the data on which the calculations of the sidereal times at Paris are founded , they are assumed to be correct .
The effect of the alterations thus made upon the elements of computation , is to redeem the result of the observations of 2 st July from the suspicion which attached to it , in consequence of its disagreement with the results of the other days , and to produce a change of one-tenth of a second ( corresponding to one hundred feet nearly on the earth 's surface , ) upon the most probable value of the difference of meridians forming the subject of investigation , it now appearing to be 9l 2 1s ' .
At the same time the chronometer , which was employed for the observations at Fairlight down , is shown to have kept a more uniform rate than what previously appeared .
In this important national operation , the utmost accuracy is desirable ; and it has therefore been thought proper to subject the whole observations to a new computation .
This will make more apparent the near coincidence of the results of the different days observations , and the great precision to be expected from experiments of the nature of those in question , when , as has happened in the present instance , they are made with the utmost care and attention on the part of the observers .
The details of the new computation are as follows .
As mentioned by Mr. HERSCHEL , rockets were exploded at Wrotham , which were observed at Greenwich and Fairlight down ; at La Canche , on the French Coast , which were observed at Fairlight and Lignieres ; and at Mont Javoult , which were observed at Lignieres and Paris .
Before the difference of meridians can be eliminated from the observations , the rates of the chronometers employed at Lignieres and Fairlight must be ascertained .
Let P be the sidereal time at Paris , L the corresponding time indicated by the chronometer at Lignieres ( these times being determined by simultaneous observations of signals ) P ' and L ' , the same times for a subsequent night , then ( P'-P)-(L ' L ) is the retardation of the chronometer at Lignieres on sidereal time during the chronometer time ( L'--L ) ; 247 x ( P ' P ) ( Li'_ L ) ] " ( L[ L ) --- ) = r , is the rate of the chronometer , or the equation to be added to 24 hours of chronometer time to obtain the corresponding interval of sidereal time ; and ( '1L ) is the equation to be added to any portion of chronometer time ( L ' -L ) to reduce it to sidereal time .
In like manner with regard to the chronometer at Fairlight , let G and F be the corresponding sidereal time at Greenwich and chronometer time at Fairlight , G ' and F ' the same times for a subsequent night , then x4h X [ ( G'-G)-('F ) ] t ( F'-r - ) -r is the chronometer 's rate , or the ( ~rF equation to be added to z4 hours of chronometer time , to obtain thei corresponding interval of sidereal time ; and r ( F'F ) is the equation to be added to any portion of chro24h~ nometer time ( F'-F ) , to reduce it to sidereal time .

In this manner are obtained the following rates for the observations at Lignieres .

The rate of the Fairlight chronometer being sufficiently uniform , the mean of the whole , s " 56 51 , has been adopted for all the observations there , which cannot produce any sensible error .
The difference of meridians is now obtained from the following formula .
Let P be the sidereal time at Paris , L the corresponding chronometer time at Lignieres , L ' and F , corresponding chronometer times at Lignieres and Fairlight , and F ' , chronometer time at Fairlight , and G the corresponding sidereal time at Greenwich ; the intervals of chronometer times ( L'L ) and ( F'F ) must be reduced to intervals of sidereal time ( 1 ' ) and ( f ' -f ) by the formulae given above .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.f 293 These various results differ so little from each other , that their arithmetical mean , 9m 21"s45 , may be assumed to be near the truth .
But it may not be improper to ascertain the most probable value , and its probable error , by the calculus of probabilities as practised by GAUss , BEssEL , &amp;c. to serve as a rule for other investigations of a similar nature , in which it may be more requisite .
Each night 's result is liable to an error occasioned by the errors in the observed times of the signals , and of the transits of stars , whereby the clocks were compared with the heavens .
The probable error of a single observation of a signal and a transit , appears from a considerable number of observations , to be one tenth of a second ; and this divided by the square root of the number of these phenomena observed at any station , gives the probable error of the mean of the observed times at that station .
But the results are exposed to other causes of error , such as the small deviations of the transit instruments from their meridians , the peculiar state of the eyes of the different observers , atmospheric circumstances , and various others which fluctuate from night to night , but may be supposed constant during the same night .
Each night 's result is equally liable to these errors , which have no tendelcy to be diminished by an increased number of observations upon that night .
The probable error of each result arising from this cause is assumed to be two tenths of a second , and it is not likely to be more .
Errors in the comparison of the chronometers employed for the observations of signals at Greenwich and Paris with the transit clocks , are also to be apprehended , which errors at each observatory may be supposed to be one tenth of a second .
A probable error of one tenth of a second in the reduction of the interval at Lignieres , on the i8th , ought also to be taken into account .
By the theory of probabilities , the square of the probable error in the result of each night 's observations is equal to the sum of the squares of the various errors , which by their combination produce the error in the result ; and the weight to be attributed to each result is expressed by the reciprocal of the square of its probable error .
The computation of these quantities is exhibited in the annexed Table , in which A denotes the difference of meridians obtained from each night 's observations , e its probable error , and W its weight .

V46-73 , It may therefore be said that 9m 21 '"46 , or to the nearest tenth of a second , 9mS21'5 is the most probable value of the difference of meridians in question ; that it is likely that this determination is within two tenths of a second of the truth ; and that additional observations , even to a very considerable number , would not materially diminish the small uncertainty that still exists .
The above rectification of the observations made to ascertain the difference of longitude between Paris and Greenwich , not only adds greatly to the merit of the distinguished observers employed in the work , but trebles the value of their results by narrowing the extreme range of the experiments from oS065 to os"s .
