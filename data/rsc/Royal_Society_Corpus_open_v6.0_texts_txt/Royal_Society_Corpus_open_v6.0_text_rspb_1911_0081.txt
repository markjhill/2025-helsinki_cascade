) While carrying out an investigation on the osmotic pressure of the blood and body fluids of various Australian animals I was desirous of supplementing the data thus acquired with estimations of other physical characters .
The refractive indices of the eye fluids presented some interesting features , and I give here in tabular form the results obtained .
The instrument employed was the Abbe refractometer .
The outer layers of the crystalline lens were sufficiently fluid to be spread out as a refracting layer on the prism .

approximately 1'336 for aqueous , 1-337 for vitreous , and 1'46 for lens .
Determinations of the A of the aqueous humour of various animals show that this is .
approximately the same as the A of blood serum of these animals ( Portier(l ) , Steindorff ( 2 ) ) , and thus varies in the different classes of animals .
Moreover , on comparing the refractive index of the aqueous humour of the sea-water Teleost ( Barracouta ) ( 1*335 ) with the refractive index of the sea water ( 1-340 ) , it will be seen that we have here a unique phenomenon , virtually the tendency to the development of a " negative eye , " but , of course , the almost spherical lens of refractive index about 1-46 will correct any tendency in this direction .
My thanks are due to Professor W. A. Osborne for his kind assistance and encouragement .
