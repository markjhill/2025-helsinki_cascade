u Magnetic Survey of Belgium in 1871/ ' By the Rev. S. J. Perry .

( Abstract .
) The magnetic observations which furnished the results contained in this paper were made during the autumn months of 1871 .
The instruments used and the methods adopted were almost identical with those employed in previous magnetic surveys of France .
The dip was observed by Mr. W. Carlisle , magnetic assistant of Stony-hurst Observatory , and the rest of the observations were taken by the Rev. S. J. Perry .
This new series of determinations of the terrestrial magnetic elements was rendered the more necessary , as preceding observers had chosen very few stations in Belgium , and as the curvature of the isodynamics and isoclinals in Dr. Lamont 's maps of Belgium , Holland , and North-west Germany indicated a very considerable disturbing cause in the first-named country .
The values obtained in 1871 are a strong confirmation of the suspicions of irregularity to which former observations had given rise ; for although the lines of equal dip , declination , and horizontal force bear a sufficiently close resemblance to those of neighbouring countries , there is evidence of much disturbance ; and when the values of the dip and horizontal force are combined , the isodynamics show clearly that the coal-measures , which stretch completely across the south-east portion of Belgium , exercise a strong disturbing influence .
This local magnetism might be incapable of producing more than a decided curvature of the isodynamics of an extended tract of country ; but when all the stations of observation are situated within narrow limits , the perturbation completely masks the normal direction of the lines .

( Abstract .
) The principal object of the present Memoir is the establishment of the partial differential equation of the third order satisfied by the parameter of a family of surfaces belonging to a triple orthogonal system .
It was first remarked by Bouquet that a given family of surfaces does not in general belong to an orthogonal system , but that ( in order to its doing so ) a condition must be satisfied : it was afterwards shown by Serret that the condition is that the parameter considered as a function of the coor dinates must satisfy a partial differential equation of the third older , this equation was not obtained by him or the other French geometers en gaged on the subject , although methods of obtaining it , essentially equi valent but differing in form , were given by Darboux and Levy , t e last-named writer even found a particular form of the equation , viz. what the general equation becomes on writing therein X=0 , L=0 ( X , ^ , the first derived functions , or quantities proportional to the cosine-inc
