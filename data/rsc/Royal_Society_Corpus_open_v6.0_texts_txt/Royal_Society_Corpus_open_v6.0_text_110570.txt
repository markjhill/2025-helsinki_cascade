of Brazil and North America , in the years 1834 , 1835 , 1836 and 1837 .
" By Sir James Everard Home , Bart. , Commander Royal Navy , F.R.S. , the Observations reduced by the Rev. George Fisher , M.A. , F.R.S. The observations for the dip were made with an instrument of modern construction , by Dollond .
Each observation consisted of an equal number of readings of the position of the needle , before and after the inversion of its poles , and a mean of all the readings taken for the true dip .
Tables are subjoined , containing the dips observed at each place ; the times of making a hundred vibrations of live horizontal needles , and the mean horizontal forces computed therefrom ; and likewise the results estimated in the direction of the dipping needle , compared with direct experiments made with the dipping needle itself .
A paper was also read in part , entitled " On Low Fogs and Stationary Clouds .
