In the sub-umbrella of the Medusae waves of nervous excitation are sometimes able to pass when waves of muscular contraption have become blocked by the severity of overlapping sections . ?
Exhaustion of the sub-umbrella tissues\#151 ; especially in narrow connecting isthmuses of tissue\#151 ; may have the effect of blocking the passage of contractile waves .

A nervous connexion of this kind may be maintained between a lithocyst and the point at which the waves of contraction originate even after sever\#174 ; - forms of section have been interposed between the lithocyst and that point .

The conception of a chemical equivalent as employed in these researches corresponds to a definition first given* by one of ns , viz. , that the chemical equivalent of a body is that weight of it which does the unit of work .
We do not therefore use the term in its ordinary sense ; as , for example , when it is said that H is " equivalent " to Cl , Na , \amp ; c. The following experiments were arranged with the view of determining the effect of potassic and sodic sulphates on the rate of formation of ammonia , when nascent hydrogen is made to act on potassic nitrate .
Judging from their behaviour in other cases , it was expected that in this instance , also , their action would be one of retardation .
Experiment , however , has proved the reverse , on the whole , to be true .
The extremely delicate nature of the reaction , which is liable to be spoiled by the accidental falling in of a single speck of dust , or by slight variation of temperature , or unequal exposure of the different solutions to light , rendered the attempt to measure the effect a matter of peculiar difficulty .
At first , common sheet zinc , thoroughly cleansed from grease , was placed in a solution of potassic nitrate and hydrate , and the amount of ammonia formed during periods varying from twenty-four hours to one week was measured .
But the results were very irregular and unsatisfactory .
Galvanic couples seemed to be established at certain points on the surface of the zinc , probably due to the presence of iron or lead as impurities .
Thin zinc foil was next tried , but with little better result ; neither were any alterations in the shape or disposition of the foil attended with success .
Eresh experiments were also undertaken with sodium amalgam instead of zinc and potassic nitrate ; but the action , though rather more uniform , was still very uncertain .
It was found impossible to obtain a perfectly homogeneous solution of sodium in mercury , entirely free from sodic oxide and hydrate ; and this seriously impaired the accuracy of measuring out the amalgam .
The only plan which was found to give results at all comparable with each other , was using zinc amalgam and potassic nitrate .
The experiments were performed in wide-mouthed glass-stoppered bottles of cylindrical shape , having an internal diameter of 60 mm. , and a total capacity of 315 cub. centims. Each bottle contained 1 grm. * " Philosophical Magazine , " [ 5 ] , i , 14 .

269 otassic nitrate , 1 grm. potassic hydrate ( prepared from the sulphate | j means of baryta water ) , and a quantity of anhydrous alkaline ilphate , varying from 0 to 1 grm. ; the whole being dissolved in 50 cub. centims. of distilled water , very free from ammonia .
The .agents had been carefully purified .

mercury , were then dded , and the " system " was preserved from dust and light .
After wenty hours , the amount of ammonia was estimated by Nessler 's lethod .
Traces of this substance were occasionally present in be solutions employed , and a corresponding correction had to be aade .
In every experiment , nine solutions were prepared at the same I'rnft\#151 ; three free from sulphate , three containing sodic sulphate , and hree potassic sulphate ; and the mean of each three was taken as the rue value for that particular experiment .
Fifteen comparisons of \#166 ; ach of nine solutions , arranged in this way , were made with different mantities of sulphate .
The temperature was taken at the beginning , n the middle , and at the conclusion of the experiment ; the tempera- ; ur at night being registered by one of the automatic thermometers iold by Negretti and Zambra .
Owing to the extreme delicacy of the .eaction and the slight causes which suffice to interfere with it , the aumbers obtained from single experiments are not sufficiently reliable do measure the precise amount of change caused by varying the quantity of alkaline sulphate .
Every comparison , however , though made with a different weight of sulphate from that employed in the others , involved equal weights of potassic and of sodic sulphate ; and hence the relative effect of those two bodies has been very clearly approximated to .

[ Jan. 23 , The ratio of the working effect of sodic to that of potassic sulphate , as calculated from the numbers given above , is 100*16 : 100 , with a probable uncertainty of 1*3 per cent. This is the value , reckoned by the method of least squares , from the whole of the observations .
The rejection of the four experiments marked with an asterisk , which differ somewhat widely from the rest , would give the ratio 99*53 : 100 , with a probable uncertainty of 0*73 per cent. ; while the probable error of a single observation would then be reduced from 5*02 to 2-4 per cent. [ Owing to the number of determinations made , any error in the result is but very slightly affected by error in the ammonia estimation .
] The conclusions which we think may fairly be drawn from these numbers are:\#151 ; ( 1 .
) That sodic and potassic sulphates have a well-marked influence on the reaction to which we have referred ; ( 2 .
) That as more sulphate is added , the reaction is accelerated ; I ( 3 .
) That equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have as nearly as possible the same working effect .
The last conclusion may be otherwise expressed thus:\#151 ; If we represent our equivalent of potassic sulphate by a number , then the equivalent of sodic sulphate is represented by the same number .

Hydric Chloride and Sulphate .
By Edmund J. Mills , D.Sc .
, F.R.S. , and James Hogarth .
Received December 4 , 1878 .
While carrying out our researches on lactin , * it struck us that use might be made of it to compare the dynamical equivalents of acid bodies .
We accordingly selected hydric chloride and hydric sulphate for the measurements in question , and prepared solutions of these acids , containing respectively 73 grammes hydric chloride ( 2HC1 ) , and 196 grammes hydric sulphate ( 2H2SCh ) per litre .
An experiment was first tried with 5 grammes lactin and 10 cub. centims. of the hydric chloride solution in a total volume of 70 cub. centims. At a temperature of 17 ' C. there was no change of rotation in twenty-four hours .
In a second experiment a similar solution was raised for an hour to 40 ' C. , and then for an hour to 60 ' C. ; but without effect on the rotatory power .
The temperature of 100 ' C. was finally adopted , the change at that point taking place at a rate admitting of accurate measurement .
The method of experiment was as follows : A measuring flask was made marked to contain 60 cob .
centims. ; in this were placed 50 cub. centims. of a 10 per cent , solution of lactin ( i.e. , 5 grammes ) , the acid measured in , and the volume made up to * Pot , p. 273 .
