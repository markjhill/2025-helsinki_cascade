( Abstract .
) It is , in my memoir " On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact at any Point of a Plane Curve " ( Phil. Trans. vol. cxlix .
( 1859 ) pp. 371-400 ) , remarked that as in a plane curve there are certain singular points , viz. the points of inflexion , where three consecutive points lie in a liie , so there are singular points where six consecutive points of the curve lie in a conic ; and such a singular point is there termed a " sextactic point .
" The memoir in question ( here cited as " former memoir " ) contains the theory of the sextactic points of a cubic curve ; but it is only recently that I have succeeded in establishing the theory for a curve of the order m. The result arrived at is that the number of sextactic points is=m ( 12m-27 ) , the points in question being the intersectionis of the curve m with a curve of the order 12m-27 , the equation of which is ( 12m2-54m +57 ) H Jac. ( U , HI , O ) +(in-2 ) ( 12m-27 ) H Jac. ( U , H , &amp; 2U ) +40 ( m-2)2 Jac. ( U , H , T'J)=0 , where U=O is the equation of the given curve m , H is the Hessian or determinant formed with the second differential coefficients ( a , b , c , f , g , h ) of U , and , ( X , 33 , j if , T , g ?

We have similarly by =-by 01 + b , SU , and az2 U=a S2H + a , 4uj ; and in like manner Jac. ( U , H , 2 ) = Jac. ( U , IH , Ol ) + Jac. ( U , H , 2iU ) , which explainis the signification of the notations Jac. ( U , H , Q ; E ) , Jac. ( U , H , A The condition for a sextactic point is in the first instance obtained in a form involving the arbitrary coefficients ( A , yi , v ) ; viz. we have anl equation of the order 5 in ( A , p , v ) and of the order 12m-22 in the coordinates ( x , y , z ) .
But writing r=Xx t jy + vz , by successive transformationis we throw out the factors F , -,.~ , &amp; , thus arriving at a result independent of ( X , p , , X ) ; viz. this is the before-mentioned equation of the order 12mn-27 .
The difficulty of the investigation consists in obtaining the transforinations by means of which the equation in its originial form is thus divested of these irrelevant factors .
