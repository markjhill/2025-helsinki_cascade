An Account of a Micrometer made of Rock Crystal .
By G. Dollond , F.R.S. Read January 25 , 1821 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1821 , p. 101 .
] The author 's object in this communication is to describe a more simple application of rock crystal to the purposes of micrometrical measurements in telescopes than any hitherto adopted .
His improvement consists in the substitution of a sphere of rock crystal , in place of the usual eye-glass , by which the trouble of angular cutting is done away , it being only necessary to form the lens of a proper diameter for the focal length required .
Another advantage obtained by Mr. Dollond 's micrometer is that of being able to take the angle on each side zero without reversing the eye tube ; and also of taking intermediate angles , by moving the axis in which the sphere is placed ; and , thirdly , it possesses the property of an eye tube not intended for micrometrical measurement , for when the axis of the crystal is parallel to that of the object glass , only one image is formed , and that perfectly distinct .
After adverting to some other advantages resulting from this improvement , Mr. Dollond proceeds more particularly to describe the contrivance by reference to an annexed drawing .
