THIS interesting branch of our researches has been prosecuted by us from time to time since 1856 .
In the spring of that year we commenced our experiments by trying the effect of whirling thermometers in the air .
This process had been confidently recommended as a means of obtaining the temperature of the atmosphere , but we were sure that the plan was not absolutely correct , and one of us had , as early as 1847 , explained the phenomena of " shooting stars " by the heat developed by bodies rushing into our atmosphere .
In our early experiments we whirled a thermometer by means of a string , alternately quickly and slowly , and it was found that the thermometer was invariably higher after quick than after slow whirling , in some cases the difference amounting to as much as a degree FAHRENHEIT .
We also succeeded in exhibiting the same phenomenon by whirling a thermo-electric junction .
In 1857 we resumed the subject , using an apparatus consisting of a wheel worked by hand , communicating rapid rotation to an axle , at the extremity of which an arm carrying a thermometer , with its bulb outwards , was fixed .
The distance between the centre of the axle and the thermometer bulb was 39 inches .
The thermometers made use of were filled with ether or chloroform , and had , the smaller 275 , and the larger 330 divisions to the degree C. The lengths of the cylindrical bulbs were -9 and 1L-inch , their diameters,26 and *48 of an inch respectively .
The method of experimenting was to revolve the thermometer bulb at a certain velocity until we knew by experience that it had obtained the full thermal effect , then to stop it as suddenly as possible and observe the temperature .
Alternately with these observations others were made to ascertain the temperature after a slow velocity , the effect due to which was calculated from the other observations , on the hypothesis that it varied with the square of the velocity .
In all cases the results in the Tables are means of several experiments .

The arrangement will be understood from the adjoining sketch , where a is the axle of the whirling apparatus .
ba block of wood placed on the end of the axle ; to this is attached c c ' , a copper tube , --3ths of an i inch in diameter , with a hole in its side .

df is an iron wire soldered at d to I the copper wire .
gg are thick copK per wires , communicating at their remote ends with the galvanometer .
B/ They apply to the tube and wire with a'---:.t : , -a springing force , perfect contact being maintained by keeping the touching surfaces clean , and lubricated with oil .
A thin piece of wood , not drawn in the sketch , was attached to the block of wood .
It was made to extend to within 1 , 2 , or 3 feet off d , according as the velocity was to be 326 slow or quick .
The wires being tied to it , were prevented from twisting out of their proper position .
The distance of d from the axis of revolution was generally 44 inches .
The thermal value of the indications of the galvanometer was repeatedly ascertained by direct observations of the effect of heating the junctions .
The following Tables comprise the results of those experiments in which the junction was placed at right angles to the direction of its motion .

Taking , therefore , the means of the foregoing results , and rejecting all those obtained from a velocity under 100 feet per second , we obtain the following summary : Material of the whirled cylinder .

In the next experiments we whirled the junctions parallel to the direction of _motion .

The absence of any considerable effect arising from the shape of the body whirled , was also shown by the following results obtained with a junction of flattened wires a quarter of an inch broad and one-thirtieth of an inch thick .

Cent. The phenomena hitherto observed seemed to point to the effect of stopping air as a cause , since 145 feet per second is the velocity of air equivalent to the quantity of heat required to raise its substance , under constant pressure , by 1 ?
Cent. temperature ; and it was reasonable to infer that a portion of the effect was lost by radiation .
The following experiments , made with a junction of fine wires covered loosely with cotton-wool or tow , enabled us to eliminate all effects but those due to stopped air .
Their results will be found to agree closely with theory .

N.B. The basket was so open that its orifices amounted to half the entire area .
In several of our experiments with very slow velocities there appeared to be a greater evolution of heat than could be due to the stopping of air .
This circumstance induced us to try various modifications of the surface of the whirled body .
In the first instance we covered the bulb of the thermometer used in the second series of experiments with five folds of writing-paper , and then obtained the following results:329 Velocities in the Difference Estimated Thermal Velocit due to ' C. , alternate experiments , of thermal effect of low effect of high V1 , on thpothesis in feet per second .

We were thus led to try the effect of a further increase of what we may call '"fluid friction .

It is also evident that , as the velocity increases , this thermal cause decreases ; for at a velocity of 150 feet per second the thermal effect is such as would be due to the influence of stopped air alone .
In prosecuting still further this part of our subject we made the following arrangement .
A disc of mill-board , 32 inches in diameter , was fixed to the end of the axis of the whirling apparatus .
An ether thermometer , whose bulb was one-fourth of an inch in diameter , was tied by its stem to the face of the disc , so that the bulb was 15 inches distant from the axis of revolution , and 1 inch from the margin of the disc .
In the following Table the first five experiments were made with the above arrangement , but in the last two a thermo-electric junction of thin copper and iron wires , tied closely to the mill-board , was substituted for the ether thermometer .

The thermal effect appears even to increase at a slower rate than simply with the velocity .
This phenomenon may , we think , be ascribed to the internal fluid friction of the particles 331 of air among themselves , which Professor STOKES has proved to exist , by his researches on the motion of pendulums .
We may easily apprehend that in such experiments as our last , the entire face of the disc is covered with a film of air , which revolves along with it at very slow velocities .
As the velocity increases there will still be a film of air adhering to the disc , but with the difference that it will be constantly replaced by fresh stopped air , the thermal effect of which will ultimately be the only recognizable phenomenon .
A very interesting and important branch of our subject was to inquire into the thermal phenomena which take place at the surface of a sphere passing rapidly through air .
Some of our experiments on this subject have been made by blowing air from a large bellows against a ball ; others by whirling a ball or sphere in the air by means of the apparatus already described .
We shall commence by describing the latter , in some of which a thermo-electric junction was employed , and in others an ether thermometer .

In our first trials , the air issued from a circular aperture 21 inches in diameter , and the ball was placed , at half an inch distance , in front of the aperture .
We shall , as before , call that point of the ball which was nearest the wind , the Anterior Pole ; the most sheltered point , the Posterior Pole ; and the intermediate part , the Equator .
The balls were furnished with thermo-electric junctions of thin copper and iron wires , made flat with the surface , the junctions being in each case 90 ?
apart from one another .

In our next series , one junction was placed within the bellows , and the other in contact with the different parts of the 1-inch ball .
All the results will be seen to indicate , as might have been anticipated , that the junction within the bellows was warmer than any part of the ball .

The general result is that at slow velocities of air there is a gradual increase of temperature from the anterior to the posterior pole , but the reverse at high velocities .
We observed a great effect for slow velocities at the commencement of anl experiment , which gradually declined on continued blowing .
This phenomenon was apparently owing to circumstances in connexion with the temperature of the orifice and of the bellows .
The causes of the thermal effects on the surface of balls slowly passing through air are very complicated , as they arise from the effects of stopped air , fluid friction , and varied pressures .
In order , if possible , to throw some light on these , we made the following observations : I 1st .
That when the 12-inch globe passed through the air at the velocity of about 12 feet per second or under , the air at the equatorial part moved in the reverse direction .
We did not observe the velocity , if it existed , at which this phenomenon ceased to take place .
2nd .
An ivory ball , 1*7 inch diameter , had holes drilled from points of the surface 90 ?
asunder , which holes met at the centre of the ball .
Into the lower one ( see adjoining figure ) a bent glass tube , partly filled with water , was cemented ; in the other , at c , a porous wooden plug was placed .
It was then found that when c was made the anterior pole in a blast from the bellows , a pressure was experienced able to produce a difference of level in the tubes b and d equal to 2'5 inches .
When c was put in the equatorial position , there was , on the contrary , a suction equal to 1*2 inch .
When c was made the posterior pole there was also a suction , equal , however , to only 0'1 inch .
Having tied a thick fold of silk over the orifice d , we tried the same thing in a strong breeze of wind , when we found that on making c the anterior pole , we had a pressure amounting to 0*6 of an inch ; on making c equatorial , a suction of 0'3 ; and on making c the posterior pole , a suction of 0'05 inch .
We have not hitherto been able to detect any change in the thermal effect , owing to the whistling sound of wire or other bodies rapidly whirled .
We think it possible that this vibratory action decreases the resistance and the evolution of heat .
Some of the sounds produced are interesting and worthy of further investigation .
When a small piece of paper was attached to the revolving wire , we obtained a continuous succession of loud cracks similar to those of a whip .
But although this and other parts of our subject remain to be cleared up , we believe that it will be found that at all high velocities the thermal effect arises entirely from stopped air , and thus is independent of the shape and mass of the body , and of the temperature and density of the atmosphere .
From some experiments described in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society ' of June 19 , 1856 , p. 183 , we inferred that a body placed in a stream of air moving with a velocity of 1780 feet per second , was raised 137 ?
C. above the temperature of that stream .
This gives 152 feet per second as the velocity due to 1 ?
, while our direct results , given in the present paper , indicate 179 .
It must be obvious that a thermometer placed in the wind registers the temperature of the air , plus the greater portion , but not the whole , of the temperature due to the vis viva of its motion .
In a place perfectly sheltered from the wind , the temperature of a thermometer immersed in the air will be that of the wind , plus the whole temperature due to the vs viva of the moving air .
In accordance with this we have found that a thermometer placed in a sheltered situation , such as on the top of a wall opposite the wind , indicates a higher temperature than when it is exposed to the blast .
A minute examination of these phenomena cannot fail to interest the meteorologist .
