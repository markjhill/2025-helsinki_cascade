Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received May 3 , _____________I Read June 16 , 1904 .
This subject has been already dealt with by Ramsay and Young , * who heated ammonia in glass tubes at various temperatures , and found that decomposition began under the most favourable circumstances at a little below 500 ' , and that the amount decomposed depends on the extent of the heated surface of the solid with which the ammonia is in contact , on the nature of the surface , and on the time of exposure to heat .
We have thought it desirable to extend our knowledge of the subject still further by investigating the rate of decomposition at various temperatures .
The ammonia was contained in porcelain vessels heated in a muffle furnace , and the decomposition was traced by reading the pressure on a mercury manometer , the sum of the volumes of the ammonia and products of decomposition being kept constant .
The difficulty of finding the amount of ammonia in the vessel at the beginning of the decomposition was overcome by heating the ammonia at the end of a series of observations until complete decomposition was caused ; the pressure and temperature were then noted , and the original amount of ammonia calculated .
We have confirmed the observations of Ramsay and Young that the decomposition is never absolutely complete , but after heating at a temperature of 1100 ' for a short time the amount of ammonia remaining is so small that it can be neglected for practical purposes .
Apparatus\#151 ; The ammonia was heated in a porcelain globe A ( fig. 1 ) of about 2 litres capacity by means of a muffle furnace B ; the capillary stem of the globe was connected with a capillary glass tube by a copper sleeve and some fusible alloy .
The pressure gauge D stood 2 metres \ high , and the level of the mercury was regulated by a movable reser-| voir F. The pressure was read on a millimetre scale ; G is a movable piece of mirror glass of rectangular shape , and with a horizontal line drawn across it ; by sliding it along the edge of the millimetre scale ; and behind the glass tubes of the gauge , the readings were made with great facility .
H is a U-tube with a stop-cock at the bottom ; its object was to cut !
off the ammonia from the three-way stop-cock A ; by a column of mercury , and so prevent or indicate leakage .
One branch of the stop-cock led ; to a water-air pump , and the other to a long tube L containing caustic 1 soda , and thence to a cylinder of ammonia with a safety escape M , con-sisting of a tube dipping into a column of mercury .

1904 ] The Decomposition of Ammonia by Heat .
Ill Measurement of Temperature.\#151 ; Temperature was measured by means | of a Callendar-Griffiths pyrometer .
The disturbing effect of the j current of hot air passing over the projecting head of the thermometer iwas avoided by surrounding the head with several turns of tinned iiron .
The temperatures were read to 0-1 ' C. The thermometer was I carefully standardised with melting ice , boiling water , and boiling i sulphur , and we do not think that the temperature error can in any j case exceed 0*5 ' C. Fig- .

n u ii it ii ii ii ; \#166 ; \#187 ; Thermostat.\#151 ; To maintain the temperature constant an Ostwald s. pattern regulator was used , the vessel being of porcelain and con- .
taining air .
In addition to this a Fletcher gas regulator was fixed | on the main supply .
'Any variation of temperature caused by altera-2 tion of the barometric pressure was corrected by means of a screw at the I bottom of the U-tube containing the mercury .
It was found con-| venient to adjust the gas supply to give the required temperature by I loading the valve of the Fletcher regulator .
- Material.\#151 ; The cylinder of ammonia was obtained from the Standard I Anhydrous Ammonia Company , and was found to contain but very ^ little impurity .
In one experiment about 20 litres of ammonia were \#166 ; passed slowly through a long worm surrounded by ice and hydrochloric I VOL. LXXIV .

[ May 3j acid , but nothing appreciable was condensed .
The gas was found to be free from carbon dioxide .
A quantity of pure hydrochloric acid was neutralised by passing the gas from the cylinder through it , and the solution was then evaporated to dryness .
Chlorine was then esti-mated in the sample by the gravimetric method , and the percentage found was ( 1 ) 66*09 ; ( 2 ) 66*12 ; mean , 66*105 ; theoretical , 66*23 .
Method of Work.\#151 ; The furnace was heated , and when the temperature was sufficiently constant , the filling process was commenced .
The globe was exhausted , and ammonia admitted from the cylinder through the drying tube L ; this was repeated from eight to ten times , when the filling was regarded as complete .
Headings of pressure were then made at definite time intervals , and the temperature was also carefully noted , as nearly as possible at the same time , by means of the pyrometer .
In one or two of the experiments the temperature was sufficiently high to decompose the ammonia completely in a short time , but in most of them , when a sufficient number of readings had been made , the temperature was raised until ( practically ) complete decomposition ensued in a few minutes .
The volume of the ammonia and decomposition products was kept constant by raising the mercury reservoir F so as to keep the mercury at about the same level in the upper part of the short limb of the pressure gauge .
As each time interval was called , the level of the mercury in D was read , and that in the open limb as soon as possible afterwards ; it did not change quickly in the latter , owing to the width of the reservoir .
Some observations were also made on the effect produced by sudden change of pressure on the rate of decomposition .
Method of Calculation.\#151 ; The ultimate decomposition of ammonia is customarily represented by the equation 2NH3 = N2 + 3H2 .
Let p\ be the pressure of the ammonia in the globe at any instant during the decomposition , p{ , that of the nitrogen , that of the hydrogen , P , the total pressure at the same insta , pS , the initial pressure of the ammonia at the beginning of the experiment .
Then P1+P1 +P2 = P ..^ ( 1)\#187 ; also p{ \#171 ; \#171 ; \#166 ; 3j ?

( 3)i expressing that ( 1 ) the sum of the partial pressures is equal to the total pressure ; ( 2 ) the pressure of the hydrogen produced is three times that of the nitrogen ; ( 3 ) the sum of the pressures of the nitrogen and hydrogen is double the pressure of the ammonia decomposed .
From this it follows by substitution that pi = 2po \#151 ; P , i-e-\gt ; the pressure of the ammonia at any instant is double the initial pressure 1904.1 The Decomposition of Ammonia .
minus the total pressure at the instant of observation .
The experimental data furnish values of P and and 2 - P has been tabulated giving the pressure of ammonia at the time of observation .
From these numbers corresponding values of AP/ Atf have been calculated by taking the mean of the two consecutive differences and dividing by the time interval ; but AP/ A t \#151 ; dP/ dt approximately within the limits of experimental error , and dP/ dt = dpifdtand therefore we have the rate of change of the pressure of the ammonia at definite pressures , they have been plotted in two series of curves .
Remits.\#151 ; The rate of decomposition was found to be much influenced by the state of the globe ; it invariably increased after the globe had been used once or twice , owing probably to the action of ammonia or hydrogen upon the porcelain .
consequently we were not able to trace the effect of temperature on the rate of decomposition .
In the first experiments the projecting stem of the globe was allowed to become too hot , with the result that a trace of the alloy at the joint C found its way into the globe , and by its catalytic action increased enormously the rate of decomposition of the ammonia .
The alloy contained a small proportion of mercury , and a film of this metal was found on the interior of the globe when it accidentally broke .
In the later experiments great precautions were taken to maintain the stem of the globe at a low temperature .
The experiments are here tabulated to serve as a key to the curves .

[ May 3 , j very nearly so .
These results indicate that at the highest temperatures .
the decomposition is of the first order , i.e. , it is monomolecular , pro-j ceeding according to the equation NH3 = N + 3H ; the union of the atoms to form molecules is probably so quick that it can be neglected j when compared with the rate of decomposition of the ammonia I molecule .
The departure from this mode of decomposition at lower temperatures is possibly caused by the volume and mutual attraction of the molecules .
No formula has yet been devised to express the results satisfactorily .
In the presence of substances having a catalytic action , the resulting curve is altered in character , the curvature being greater at the higher pressures .
This is well shown in the curves at 750 ' and 791 ' ( fig. 2 ) , mercury vapour being present , and in those 797 ' and 1025 ' ( fig. 3 ) , when iron wire and platinum black respectively were present .
In these two latter experiments it will be noticed that the rates of decomposition reached and passed those without catalyser for about 100 ' higher .
Effect of Sudden Change of Pressure on the Rate of Decomposition .
As a final experiment the effect of a sudden'change of pressure was tried , the globe containing both iron wire and finely divided platinum .
The change of pressure was brpught about by allowing the gases in the globe to blow off into the air for a few seconds , and a reading of the pressure gauge was made as soon as possible afterwards .

The agreement is sufficiently close to show that the reaction is essentially of the first order , or monomolecular , apart from the little-understood disturbing influences.* Summary and Conclusion .
The rate of decomposition of ammonia has been investigated under various conditions ; the containing vessel was of porcelain .

117 I temperatures varied from 677 ' to 1111 ' .
It was found that the reaction 'is essentially monomolecular , being similar to that for arseniuretted j hydrogen , as found by va n't Hoff .
The rate of decomposition is much j quickened by the presence of traces of some of the metals , those tried j being mercury , iron , and platinum . .
We are indebted to the Government Grant Fund of the Eoyal Society for the cost of most of the apparatus employed , and wish to express | our great obligations to Principal Griffiths for the loan of some of his | apparatus for platinum thermometry , and for his kind guidance in its : use .

| for Ramsay and Young showed* that on passing a mixture of dry nitrogen and hydrogen through a heated glass tube containing iron filings , or through a red-hot iron tube , no appreciable quantity of ammonia was formed , a result which we confirmed by experiments of our own some years back , obtaining the same result also with a glass tube containing porcelain .
We find , however , that this view of the matter is not generally accepted ; Ostwald , for instance , in his * Grundlinien der anorganischen Chemie't states that , on heating ammonia , equilibrium ensues when 98 per cent , of the ammonia is decomposed .
We should like to point out that the results of our experiments , now described , show no indication whatever of any such equilibrium , for the curves all run towards the origin within the limits of experimental error , whereas , if there were any equilibrium before the ammonia was all decomposed , they would cut the horizontal axis to the left of the origin , and , moreover , the equilibrium would change with the temperature .
We have mentioned that a trace of ammonia was always found in the globe at the end of an experiment , but this probably came from the cold stem ; and , moreover , since the rate of decomposition may be taken as proportional to the amount of ammonia present , that artiount can , strictly speaking , never quite reach the zero point .
Whether a minute quantity of ammonia remains finally undecomposed would not be indicated by these results , and we intend to approach the subject from another direction , and to examine generally the conditions under which nitrogen and hydrogen combine to form ammonia .
