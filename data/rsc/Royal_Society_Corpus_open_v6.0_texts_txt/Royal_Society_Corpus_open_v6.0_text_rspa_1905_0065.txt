LANGSTROTH , Ph. D. , and D. R. McRAE , Ph. D. , Research Associates , McGill University ( Received August 14 , 1935 ) A quantitative spectroscopic method of the determination of small concentrations of lead in certain biological material is described .
It is valid for concentrations between 1 x 10 8 and 2 x 10- 5 gm/ cc , and the precision of a determination is better than 15 % .
The ability to make determinations with very small samples , and to use the material without previous treatment , are important features of the method .
The general considerations on which this type of analysis is based are discussed .
