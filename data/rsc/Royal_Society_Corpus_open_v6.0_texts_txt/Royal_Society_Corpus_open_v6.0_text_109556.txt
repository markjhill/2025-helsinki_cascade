On the Composition of Emery .
By Smithson Tenant , Esq. F.R.S. Read July 1 , 1802 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1802 , p. 398 .
] The ultimate results of the experiments made on this substance , which it seems had never before been properly analysed , are-that 25 grains contain 12 !
grains df argillaceous earth , 2 of silex , and 8 of iron ; that 1 grain was not dissolved , and that the remainder , being 1I grain , was lost in the process .
Another process gave the same components , but in somewhat different proportions .
These ingredients being verysimilar to those found by Mr. Klaproth in Diamond spar , it is thought that emery is essentially a substance of the same nature , with perhaps a somewhat greater proportion of iron .
