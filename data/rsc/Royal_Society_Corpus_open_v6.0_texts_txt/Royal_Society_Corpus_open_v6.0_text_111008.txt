" Attempt to apply instrumental measurement to the Zodiacal Light .
" By Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth .
After describing the manner in which the zodiacal light was first strongly represented to him in South Africa in 1843 , and which seemed to imply that some of the received opinions with regard to it were erroneous , the author describes an equatorial instrument which he contrived for the purpose of measuring the right ascension and declination of the apex of the light ; some instrumental method of determining these data , and thence the principal phenomena of the appearances , being evidently desirable on account of the immense extent to which the judgement may be biased by prejudice or casual circumstances , when the mere senses are trusted to for determining the extent , situation and character of so faint and vague a body .
The most favourable astronomical , atmospheric and personal conditions requisite to obtain undeniable observations of the zodiacal light are pointed out ; and aided partly by strict attention to these , and partly by the clear atmosphere of the high mountains on which he was then residing , the author found the phenomenon to be of a far more stable and determinate character than has generally been represented ; and his observations , made by the above instrument in the years 1844-45 , of which a list is given , seem to be affected with a probable error not greater than 2 ? .
Since his return from the Cape , the author 's geographical position has wholly prevented him from continuing his observations : he therefore now publishes his experiences to induce others in more favourable situations to follow up the subject ; which by comparing his results with those of other observers in the northern hemisphere , he shows has many of its principal features in a state of ambiguity , that ought not in the present day to be allowed to exist any longer ; and further , to enable others to take up the subject as nearly as possible as he left it off , the author adds to his paper a series of views of the different appearances of the zodiacal light at various seasons of the year , and explains the peculiar projections employed to give a true as well as a pictorial representation of the sky .
