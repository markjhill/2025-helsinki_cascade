" Description of an Astronomical Clock invented by the late Captain Henry Kater , F.R.S. , " drawn up from his own memorandums by his son Edward Kater , Esq. Communicated by Sir John F. W. Herschel , Bart. , V.P.R.S. The great object aimed at by Captain Kater in the construction of the escapement of a chronometer , is to communicate equal impulses to the pendulum through some principle perfect in itself , and not dependent for its success on superior execution .
In the escapement invented by him , the pendulum merely raises a weight , and is im ?
pelled by that weight through an increased space in its descent .
It neither unlocks a detent , nor has anything to do with the train ; and as the weight raised , and the spaces described , are constant quantities , this escapement is , in the strict meaning of the term , one of equal impulse .
