A new demonstration of the binomial theorem .

IT is somewhat remarkable that , amongst the various and farfetched methods and artifices by which the binomial theorem has been obtained , no one should once have thought of the only course which seems obvious and natural .
The equation ( a+ x ) x ( a +y)m= { ( a + x ) ( a +y ) } " expresses the general property of powers , whether m be positive or negative , whole or fractional ; and from this equation , without the help of any artifice , the series in question is deduced .
Some investigations have been found fault with , as drawn from principles allied to the method of fluxions ; whilst , on the other hand , a demonstration , taken from the " Theory des Fonctions , " has been represented as perfect : but I cannot help thinking that it is as much connected with the fluxional calculus as any of the rest ; for it seems to make no difference whether , in ( a +x ) ) , we substitute x+u for x , and take the coefficient of u , or substitute x+ k , and take the coefficient of x. The former substitution was made because it was known to be equivalent to the other , and has so little apparient connection with the subject , that a student would hardly understand why it was made .
The demonstration of Mr. LA CROIX in the Introduction to his " Calcul Diffrentiel ' " i liable of course to the same objection .
If we multiply a+x , continually , first by itself , and then by the powers successively arising , we easily see that the second term of each succeeding product is of the form nan-'x , n being the exponent of the power : this does not require a more formal proof , and I assume it in what follows .
Nor is it more difficult to perceive that , generally , m being positive or negative , whole or fractional , the following form may be assumed , ( a + x)m " a " +'Aam-'x + '"Aa`m'a + ` 1Aam-3x3 + where 'A , " A , " 'A , &amp;c. are expressions depending on m alone , consequently , ( a +y)m=a +Aam=-y+"Aamzy2+"iAam-3y3+ ; and because ( a +x ) ( a y)}= ( a+ ax +ay +xy ) =a(a+x+y+)-m= a(a+X + ry)6 , by making ( =+-i+ ) we have also { ( a+x ) ( a+y ) ' }-am { a+'Aam-+ ( x+'7y ) + fAam-z(x+ ry)2+ ` " Aam-3(x+Sry)+ } , or neglecting all the powers of y but the first , a= a+ 'Aamn x+ " Aam-z2x+ I"Aam-3x3a+ }+ amy I'Aa^m " r +9 " IAamzx rz rx + 3Aam-3 + + ? ?

Having thus the forms of the series , nothing is required but to substitute them in the equation ( a + x)(Y x ( a +y ) = ( a + x ) ( a+ y ) } ' and to compare the coefficients of the first power ofy on each side , and we find 'Aa2m-4+\A 'Aa2m'zx.+ 'AAa2 m-3X2 + IA/ fAaZm-4x3+ Mx r r+ 2Aa m-Z " , Aa +3 TAr2m+ 4 " " Aa2m"x3+ _='Aa2m--I / +3e"/ A/ 2AaM2 + Aazm-31 +4_"AaZm4-4 ' 'Aa2m"-2 +a " AAazm-3 J3 " 'ATa-m-4 by putting for v its value i +And by coiparing the coefficients of the difierent powers of x there arise 'A:'A 'i'A ="A +'A ; 'A AA " M " A ; " A " 'A " " A A+ S3 A ; and so on ; whence " A =''A( , A2 ; " A 'A('AZ ) " A-2fa , ~ 3 " 'A('A-3 .
; and so on .
4 Such is the law by which the coefficients are derived from each other , whatever be the value of m ; it remains to find 'A ; but I shall first observe , that if , instead of the assumed form of the expansion , we had made ( a+x ) at + 'Aam-x + " Ax + " 'Ax +as some do , our demonstration would have succeeded exactly the same ; because the exponent ( m ) and the first term ( a ) of the binomials are the same in all the three powers employed .
We have already seen that 'A m , if m be a whole positive number ; or that ( a 4x ) m a " + mam-x-x ; and from the value of 'A in this one case its value in all the others is easily discovered : thus , let ( a x-)m -= am +'Aam x + .
, the m"t power of this is a+ x ; / I V ?
m m_i i but a+'Aam a+J =_ am'mAa m xam x+-=a+-m'Ax but a+m 'Ax += ax , consequently 'A -= ; and !
ii I I-m ( a + x ) m =am +mam X-+ , next raise this to the rn power , n being a positive integer , n f/ i i-m\f n n-I I-m [ ( t2 +2 ) ms= + ^a m x. --am .

-L ^ -= ( by actual division ) a ma x+ amm a+ a " +^^ a+ In all cases therefore 'A is equal to the exponent of the power .
