Growth of Lemna minor in Mineral Culture Solutions .
507 .week by week , and became very unhealthy in appearance , whilst there was a progressive improvement in the appearance of the plants supplied with increasing amounts of auximones .
Those receiving the larger amounts retained their normal healthy appearance throughout the experiment and increased in size .
6 .
The beneficial effect of the auximones was not due to a neutralisation of the toxic substances present in the ordinary distilled water , since comparable results were obtained with conductivity water .
7 .
An interchange of culture solutions , with and without auximones , showed that the plants are very sensitive to the presence or absence of these substances .
8 .
It is suggested that some of these growth-promoting substances may act directly as organic nutrients , and others may be of the nature of accessory food substances .
I am indebted to the authorities of the Botanical Department , Imperial College of Science and Technology , South Kensington , for facilities afforded for carrying out a considerable portion of the work in their greenhouse laboratory .
I wish also to express my grateful thanks to my assistant , Miss Mockeridge , B.Sc. Without her valuable help it would have been impossible to obtain a record of the numbers and weights of the plants each week .
