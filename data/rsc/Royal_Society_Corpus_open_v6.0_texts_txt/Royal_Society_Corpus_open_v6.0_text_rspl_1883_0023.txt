( Abstract .
) The errors in the Lunar Theory have been traced to the effects of changes in the unit of time , which have , apparently uncons jiously , been introduced from time to time into astronomy , with changes in the adopted data .
The argument is clearly seen by a consideration of the different expressions for longitudes of , what may be called , the mean sun , which have adopted for the determination of the sidereal times at mean noon .
lf , and V denot ' , the longitudes of the mean sun , according to Bessel , Hansen , and Le Verrier , we have for 1850 , January 1 , Paris mean noon , In all these expressions the unit of time has been supposed to be a year of mean solal .

Similar remarks apply to the dilference between and V. Now , let be the moon 's mean motion referred to 1 as the unit time , and the moon 's mean motion referred to as the unit of time , then and But Hansen detel.mined his mean motion of the moon so as to force an agreement between his theory and observations reduced with Bessel 's unit 1 ; and his tables , erefore , represented the observations well for many years whilst 1 was adopted as the unit of time ; but directly the unit of time was cbanged by the adoption either of or V , then the effects of the erroneous determination of the moon 's mean motion by Hansen became apparent .

The necessity of adopting some definite unit of time , by fixing the constants in the expression the longitude of the mean sun , is lnsisted upon .

( Abstract .
) In this paper the author shows that no conclusions with respect to the tomic weight of glucinum can be drawn from analogy of its compounds with those of other metals , and that this long-disputed question can only be decided by the specific heat of the metal or .the vapour-density of some of its volatile compounds .
Two determlnations of the specific heat have been made by Professor .
Reynolds and by M. Nilson , the former of whom obtained a result of about and the latter only bout 0 .
The probable lnaccuracles]n Professor I Reynolds ' ratus are pointed out , and it is shown that his metal was probably impure .
The author has prepared metallic glucinum from the chloride , the vapour of which was passed over sodium contained in iron boats a glass tube .

The specific heat was determined by a modification of RegnauIt 's method of mixtures , using electrical appliances to avoid the necessity of an assistant .
