a table is given of the declination and dip at Ascension Island for the epoch 1834\#151 ; 1890 , in which the change of the dip from north to south occurs between the years 1842\#151 ; 1839 .
The same change is not only shown on the magnetarium but also the amount of the dip and declination for the epoch 1834\#151 ; 1890 .
The correlation of the maximum rate of change of the inclination with the Tninimnm rate of change of the declination about the nodes of the magnetic equator is well seen in the observations , and is also demonstrated in my paper ( prop. XVIII ) and on the , magnetarium .

In the operations of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India it is customary to determine the coefficient of refraction by reciprocal vertical observations between contiguous stations on the sides of all the principal triangles , and also as many as possible of the secondary triangles .
[ The sum of the reciprocal vertical angles , plus the angle at the earth 's centre , would be exactly equal to 180 ' if there were no refraction ; the excess gives the sum of the refractions in both the angles , and half of it is taken as the amount for each angle.\#151 ; March 2 .
] The values of the coefficient thus obtained for the operations in the Western Himalayas\#151 ; between the meridians of 73 ' and 80 ' east of Greenwich\#151 ; have been grouped together for comparison in successive-ranges of 2000 ft. of altitude between the elevations of 5,000 and 21,000 ft. above the sea level .
The operations happen naturally to have been divided into two sections ; for the regions lying between the great snowy ranges on the southern face of the Himalayas and the plains of India were first completed , and some time subsequently the still higher regions to the north , extending up to the Karakoram and Kuenlun Ranges , which look down on the plains of Turkestan .
The first portion appertains to what is called the HVW .
Himalayan Series , the second to what is called the Kashmir Triangulation .
Thus the values of the coefficients of refraction were obtained separately for \#174 ; ach section , and the results are shown in the following table , where t e heights have reference to the middle points of the sides of the triangles , of which the number is given for each group :\#151 ; 218 Terrestrial Refraction in the Western Himalayas .

These differences of behaviour in the two regions are very curious and difficult to account for .
They point to some difference in the atmospheric conditions to the north and south of the outer Himalayan Range , and this may possibly arise from the circumstance that the atmosphere to the south is more heavily laden with moisture than the atmosphere to the north ; for the great southern range is the first to receive the clouds which come up from the Indian Ocean , and which are the chief source of Himalayan moisture ; these clouds are mostly condensed into rain on the southern face of the range , and thus only a comparatively small portion of their contents is carried on beyond into the more northerly regions , [ Whatever the cause , the fact is very remarkable that the co-t efficient of refraction has a minimum value at an altitude of 20,000 ft. on the north side of the Himalayan ranges , and a maximum value at the same altitude on the south side.\#151 ; March 2 .
