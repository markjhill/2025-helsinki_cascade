Some Positions respecting the Influence of the Voltaic Battery in obviating the Effects of the Division of the Eighth Pair of Nerves .
Drawn up by A. P. Wilson Philip , M.D. F.R.S. Edinb .
Communicated by B. C. Brodie , Esq. F.R.S. Read July 5 , 1821 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1822 , p. 22 .
] The positions established by Dr. Pllilip , to the satisfaction of Mr. Brodie , are detailed in this paper in the following order .
First .
When the nerves are divided and the ends not displaced , if the animal live some hours , food swallowed before the operation is much digested ; but if the ends of the nerves be turned from each other , no perfectly digested food is , under the same circumstances , found in the stomach , nor does digestion go on though the animal live ; but galvanism applied to the nerves occasions a degree of digestion in the food contained in the stomach , and when galvanized the animal does not suffer from dyspnoea .
When the nerves are simply divided , and the animal lives for six hours , the lungs become congested ; but they appear healthy when galvanism has before been sent through the lower portion of the divided nerves .
