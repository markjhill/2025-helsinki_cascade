) In a previous communication , we gave reasons for thinking that decompression symptoms may be avoided by maintaining a steady rate of 20 minutes per atmosphere during this process .
The actual time selected was purely empirical , being based on the statistics of Caisson " Works , Diving Operations , and Laboratory Experiments .
It is clear that a more scientific foundation would be obtained if we could determine ( 1 ) the rate at which the tissue fluids are saturated with nitrogen ; ( 2 ) the rapidity with which dissolved gas escapes during decompression .
The most direct method would be to analyse samples of arterial blood under various pressure conditions ; but this is not , unfortunately , practicable in the case of man .
Another way is the examination of venous samples under similar circumstances .
This plan can be followed , and we hope to communicate some results in another paper , but the technic is difficult and still in need of improvement .
A third line of research is the indirect determination of the tissue gases , and this will be discussed in the present communication .
If a condition of diuresis be produced by drinking considerable amounts of water , the profuse secretion of urine which results will afford some measure of the dissolved tissue fluid gases .
We have proceeded in the following way :\#151 ; The subject of the experiment drinks at least a quart of warm water , and , after an interval of 10 to 15 minutes , enters the pressure chamber , the pressure being then raised a definite amount .
Directly the desired pressure has been attained , he empties his bladder .
Ten minutes later the bladder is emptied again .
Samples of the urine passed are then run 22 Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood .
Influence of [ Oct. 6 , into glass bulbs with rubber connections , care being taken to drive out any air bubbles that may be present .
The rubber junctions are then clamped , and the dissolved gas subsequently pumped out by means of Hill 's blood-pump , the volume determined , and the mixture analysed by the potash and pyrogallic acid method .
In this manner , a sample of urine , passed since the pressure limit had been reached , was available for analysis , and a series of specimens could be obtained .
It was first , of course , necessary to determine the amount of gas dissolved by the urine under normal pressure conditions .
Six analyses were made , and the mean volume of dissolved nitrogen per 100 c.c. , reduced to 760 mm. and 0 ' C. , was found to be 1T4 c.c. The individual observations , made at different times and under different circumstances , exhibit only a small range of variation , they are 1*21 , 1T9 , 0'97 , 1T0 , 1'31 , T07 , 1T4 .
The coefficient of variability determined by one of us ( M. G. ) is only 9-5699 \#177 ; 1-8799 .
We are thus entitled to assume that , in our own cases , the coefficient of solubility for atmospheric nitrogen under normal barometric pressure , and at body temperature , is between 0-11 and 0'12 .
We next determined the changes in the amount of dissolved nitrogen with varying pressures .
The following are the results of a typical experiment:\#151 ; Experiment 31 , 31.5.06 .

First of all , we note that an exposure of more than five minutes to a positive pressure of 30 lbs. is necessary in order to produce saturation ; the mean of five samples taken under these conditions is 1/ 99 , as compared with 3'3 , the theoretical value .
Saturation appears to be attained in 10 minutes , * however .
Thus , the mean of seven samples , taken not less than 10 minutes after attaining the above-mentioned pressure , was 3-32 .
For a pressure of +45 lbs. the same statement appears to hold , but the time limit is probably slightly lower , as , on two occasions , full saturation was obtained in eight minutes .
The mean of eight observations at this pressure , for exposures of less than 10 minutes , is 4-23 , the theoretical value being 4'4 .
The next point to notice is that the escape of dissolved gas is a much slower matter than could be expected .
Thus , in experiments at +3 atmospheres , samples were taken when the pressure had fallen during slow decompression to +2 and +1 atmospheres .
The means of 7 and 8 observations at these pressures were , respectively , 3-63 and 275 , i.e. , the samples were super-saturated .
These results , however , are not surprising , since some of the urine taken in the specimen must have been separated from the blood while under the higher pressure , hence we could not assert , on the strength of these observations alone , that any definite retardation occurs in the equilibrating process .
But , if we consider the analyses made after returning to the normal pressure , we find very strong evidence in support of such a view .
In the experiment recorded above , a sample passed sixteen minutes after decompression contained 2'373 per cent , of nitrogen , in another experiment the amount was T66 , the mean of 5 being 1'64 .
Saturation of the kidney under the conditions of diuresis is probably far quicker than that of other and less vascular organs .
24 Messrs. L. Hill and M. Greenwood .
Influence of [ Oct. 6 , Of samples passed immediately after decompression not one yielded less than 1'64 per cent. , the mean of 6 being 1/ 99 .
We are thus led to conclude that , even with a decompression rate of 20 minutes per atmosphere , the excess of dissolved nitrogen has not escaped entirely from the tissue fluids , even 15 minutes after decompression .
As the matter is of importance , we must examine the validity of our method a little more closely .
The accuracy of the analytical process itself was tested by submitting a sample of boiled water to a vacuum in the Hill pump and proceeding exactly as in the urine analyses .
Ho measurable gas was obtained , so that the error due to leakage may be regarded as negligeable .
In any case , we disregard analyses in which , owing to the presence of unusually large quantities of oxygen , we can reasonably suspect contamination with air .
In general , only very small quantities of oxygen were found .
The admixture of urine that had collected in the bladder while the subject was exposed to a higher pressure would lead to erroneous results , but the complete emptying of the bladder at each observation avoids this source of fallacy .
All the urine of the samples passed 15 minutes after decompression must have been separated from the blood after the pressure had fallen to + 0 lb. , with the exception of the amount present in the tubules and renal pelves , this latter quantity being so small in comparison with the total volume ( 135 c.c. ) passed , that the resultant error can hardly be appreciable .
That our experiments are not sufficiently numerous to admit of definite statement as to the exact time relations of the process may be granted ; but the qualitative accuracy of the conclusion seems unassailable .
We have obtained a striking confirmation of our view in the following manner .
At the caisson works now being carried out by the London County Council in connection with the new Rotherhithe Tunnel , a positive pressure of 14\#151 ; 17 lbs. is employed and only three minutes allowed for decompression* We have analysed samples obtained from six caisson workers obtained directly after leaving the air lock , with the following result:\#151 ; It Nitrogen .
1-595 2 1-658 3 1-506 4 1-414 5 1-747 6 1-744 * With such low pressures there is little risk in so short a decompression period , t The men had some beer to drink and most of them passed water just before decompression .

] It must be admitted that these observations indicate in a manner not to be disregarded the extreme danger of rapid decompression from high pressures .
It might even be doubted whether 20 minutes per atmosphere is an absolutely safe allowance ; indeed , a few fatal cases , recorded in the literature of caisson works , in which this time appears to have been allowed , support such a contention .
It may well be , however , that a certain steepness of pressure-slope between dissolved and free gas is necessary for the formation of bubbles sufficiently large to produce injury .
So far as our observations go , with a decompression rate of 20 minutes an atmosphere the dissolved nitrogen falls in a given time to the same level , whatever be the height of pressure attained during the experiment .
That is to say , the excess of dissolved nitrogen on returning to zero is no greater after exposure to three atmospheres than after raising the pressure to two atmospheres only .
It would seem that the velocity of escape diminishes from some critical point .
If this be so , it would be an argument for retarding the later stages of decompression in order that an equilibrium may be re-established on returning to normal conditions .
The causes underlying these results remain for subsequent consideration ; in the light of other experiments we have carried out , we think it possible that a physical explanation will be found adequate to account for the facts , but our investigations are not yet sufficiently complete to permit its immediate statement .
A complete table of our analytical results is subjoined ; the figures queried are possibly vitiated by experimental errors , we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the others .
Our general conclusions from the present investigation are :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The body fluids of man exposed to compressed air absorb nitrogen in accordance with Dalton 's law .
( 2 ) Saturation of the body fluids is attained after exposure to pressures of +30\#151 ; 45 lbs. for from 10 to 15 minutes.* ( 3 ) Even with a decompression rate of 20 minutes an atmosphere , equilibrium between dissolved and atmospheric nitrogen is not completed 15 minutes after decompression .
Our results agree in principle with those deduced by ~V .
