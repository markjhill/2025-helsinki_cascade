" Extract of a Letter to GEORGE RENNIE , Esq. , F.R.S. , from P. A. SECCHI , Director of the Astronomical Observatory of the Collegio Romano , containing explanatory remarks on a drawing of the Lunar SpotJ 'Copernicus , ' presented by him to the Royal Society .
Dated Rome , March 13 , 1856 .
" Communicated by GEORGE RENNIE , Esq. , F.R.S. " As to the drawing of the spot of the moon , it is a first attempt to obtain an accurate representation of the interesting spot ' Copernicus .
' In such large dimensions , photography directly taken with the telescope has been impossible ; I therefore made first an accurate triangulation of the spot with the micrometer , and the principal points were thus laid down on the chart , after which operation the rest was filled in by the eye alone .
The power used has been always either 1000 or 760 .
As it was impossible to carry through such a work in a single night , on the first night of good opportunity a general outline was taken , and on the other evenings particular drawings were made , and all these parts , taken in different grades of light and shadow , were afterwards harmonised together and compared with the moon when the point of light was seen to be the same as on the first night .
So this work occupied more than six months , that is , all the favourable positions ( two at each lunation ) which could be obtained .
I do not pretend it to be yet accurate enough to be transferred from photography* to any kind of engraving , but I am watching every good occasion to make it complete .
But before bestowing more time and labour , I should be glad to know the impression such a work may make among the scientific men of England .
I must observe that the most distant outliers of the crater have not been included , " &amp;c.
