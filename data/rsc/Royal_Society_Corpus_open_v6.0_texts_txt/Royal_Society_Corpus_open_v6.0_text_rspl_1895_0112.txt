[ Nov. 28 , fertile brown body .
The latter can be easily detected in stained colonies at this stage , and its remains may be seen even in colonies which have been mounted dry .
Its position differs from that of the ordinary brown bodies , which are situated at a deeper level in the colony .
The communication between the fertile zocecium and the young ovicell permits of the passage of the embryonic structures into the cavity of the latter .
The fertile brown body , which remains a conspicuous object for a long period , is usually found in the ovicell , not far from the zooecium in which it was produced ; and it forms a kind of centre from which the lobes of the branching embryophore pass out .
The primary embryo , has meanwhile divided repeatedly , so that the ovicell contains a large number of secondary embryos , some of which are already developing into larvae , and others are still undergoing division .
A definite relation thus exists between the size of the colony and the extent to which the ovicell or the embryo has developed , although variation in these respects occurs within rather wide limits .
This fact is illustrated by series of measurements .
The healthy development of the embryos is shown to depend on the functional activity of the polypides , which no doubt nourish the developing larvae .
There are reasons for believing that complete degeneration of the polypides does not ordinarily take place at a time when their activity is required for the nourishment of the ovicell .
Some details are given with regard to the changes which take place in the older colonies , and particularly with regard to the secondary thickening of the calcareous matter and to the development of new broods of embryos .
It would hardly be possible to find two Cyclostomes which are more different from one another than are and The fact of the occurrence of embryonic fission in both genera , accompanied as it is by complete dissimilarity of details , may be taken as affording strong grounds for believing that the existence of embryonic fission is a fundamental phenomenon which occurs throughout the Cyclostomata .

" Flame Spectra observed at Swedish Bessemer Works .
" By C. J. Lundstrom , Ortofta , Sweden .
Communicated by Professor W. N. Hartley , F.R.S. Received April 1 , \#151 ; Read June 20 , \#151 ; Revised October 18 , 1895 .
Introduction .
As no examinations of the Bessemer flame from Swedish steel works had been previously made , I resolved , some years ago , to devote attention to this subject , in order to see to what extent the Bessemer spectrum in Sweden differs from those of other countries , and partly to ascertain whether the spectroscope might be of any practical use in examining the Bessemer " blow .
" My observations were made at the following Bessemer works : Nykroppa , Hagfors , Langshyttan , and Ulfshyttan and partly also at Domnarfvet .
Embracing the present opportunity , I beg to be allowed to express my thanks to all the managers and engineers of these works for the courtesy I have met with .
Especially I am gratefully indebted to Mr. Martin Nisser , the manager of the Klosters Iron Works , for the interest he has shown \gt ; in procuring a spectroscope adapted to the requirements of this investigation , which he placed at my disposal .
