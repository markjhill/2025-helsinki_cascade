( Abstract .
) This paper is , in substance , the same as a former paper , bearing a similar title , read before the Royal Society on the 10th January 1856 , but contains a more detailed account of the mode of performing the experiments .
A repetition of the experiments mentioned in the former paper has led to very nearly the same numerical results , except in the case of molybdenum , which is found to give 4'8 thermal units by combining with oxygen , instead of 3-38 , the number formerly given .
