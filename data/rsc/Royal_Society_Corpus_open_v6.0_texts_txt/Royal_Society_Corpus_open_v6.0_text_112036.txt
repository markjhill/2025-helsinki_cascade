( Abstract .
) The objects of this paper are various ; but the subject appears to the author more especially important in consequence of the state of competition amonig assurance establishments , which he holds to be injurious to the in terest of those valuable establishments , and to those of the assuring population .
The author 's purpose in this paper is greatly to extend the modes of calculatingo , valuations , and to improve the methods of calculation hitherto used by actuaries , which are in many cases very laborious , and in some almost impracticable .
This part commences with observationls on the ingenious plan of Barrett , which is shown to be capable of improvement and extension .
Parts of the excellent work of the late Mr. David Jones , ' Tables of Life Annuities , ' published under the care and suggestion of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge , founded on those ideas of Barrett , are by the author here improved and extended so as to give methods easier for common purposes , and capable of extension to almost all difficulties which are likely to occur in the calculation of the value of property .
