On a New Species of Rhinoceros found in the interior of Africa , the Skull of which bears a close Resemblance to that found in a Fossil State in Siberia and other Countries .

] The animal described in this paper was shot about 300 miles west of La Goa Bay , 6 miles from the city of Mashow , and 1000 miles in a straight direction from the Cape of Good Hope .
It is graminivorous , and not gregarious .
The skull is 36 inches long ; and the position of the horns , though differing in many respects from those of other existing species , bear so close a resemblance to those of the fossil skulls from Siberia , as to leave no prominent characteristic mark between them ; hence the author doubts whether many races of animals supposed to be extinct are really so : he thinks it probable that they may have retired to uninhabited parts of the globe .
The small capacity of the skull of the rhinoceros , as compared with that of the elephant , accounts for its inferior intellect , for the extreme difficulty of rendering the animal tractable , and for the failure of all attempts that have been made at taming him ; and renders it not improbable that the unicorn , not to be tamed , mentioned by Job , is identical with the rhinoceros , since no other animal so devoid of intellect has ever been described .
In that age , says the author , the short horn , which cannot be regarded as a defensive weapon , might easily have been overlooked , and the smoothness of the skin would give it a greater resemblance to the horse than any other animal .
This paper is accompanied by two plates , exhibiting the skull of the African and of the fossil Siberian rhinoceros , and a fossil horn of the latter .
