" An Account of some Experiments exhibiting new instances of the Absorbing Power of Streams ; with a few remarks on the Pulsation of Jets .
" By Mr. G. Robinson .
Communicated by W. Bowman , Esq. , F.R.S. The experiments of which an account is given in this paper illustrate the absorbing power of a stream of fluid , whether issuing from the open orifice of a reservoir , or flowing through rigid tubes .
The effects of this power are seen in the position of the fluid contained in a vertical tube open at both ends , placed within the reservoir , and of which one end is brought within the influence of the effluent stream ; and also , when one end of a bent tube is brought into the stream issuing from the open orifice of a reservoir , while the other end is immersed in a coloured fluid .
The author accounts for the intermitting or pulsatory character of the jet issuing from an open horizontal pipe , having a small hole on the upper side , by the introduction of air , which , accumulating from time to time , forms a bubble , which when it has attained a certain size , occasions an obstruction to the free passage of the liquid , until the obstacle is overcome by increased pressure from behind , and the jet then resumes its former velocity .
These changes occurring periodically , give rise to the appearance of pulsation which is observed in these circumstances .
