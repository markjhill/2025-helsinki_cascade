] In examining the structure of the vertebrw in different animals , the .
author was particularly struck with the mechanism of the spine and spinal canal in birds , by which great motion is gained in the neck without injury to the spinal marrow .
The cervical vertebrme in birds vary from 9 to 24 in number ; they differ considerably from each other , and are articulated by complex joints , , in some respects resembling the articulation of the olecranon with the humerus in the human subject , but admitting also of lateral motion .
The varying positions of the articulating surfaces are favoured by the interposition of a cartilage , adapted to the surface of each bone , and enclosed between reduplications of sinovial membrane ; each joint is thus double , and resembles the articulation of the human lower jaw .
The canal of each vertebra is contracted in the centre , and enlarges above and lbelow .
In front it is closed by the bodies of the vertebrae ; but in the skeleton its posterior part is imperfect , being filled up in the recent state by membrane , and protected by the ligamentum nuchae .
The author then describes the appearance , on dissection , of the membranes of the spinal marrow , and of the mechanism by which its compression in the various and extensive motions of the neck is prevented ; he also adverts to the exact correspondence between the extent of motion permitted , and the size and form of the canal in the human spine , and to some pathological consequences connected with such structure .
Drawings of some of the cervical vertebrae in birds , with a description of their different parts , are annexed to this paper .
