" On the Explanation of the so-called 'Mysterious Circles .
' " By the Rev. Robert H. Atherton .
Communicated by the Earl of Rosse , P.R.S. &amp;c. Received November 28 , 1850 .
The author refers to explanations which have been given of the phenomenon , of which he proposes to give a new one , and points out various courses which the propelled air may be supposed to to take with reference to the cards .
He then offers what he considers to be the true explanation of the phenomenon .
He considers that no sooner has the air struck upon the loose card , than it is reflected , spreading partly , if not entirely , over its surface , and then ascends , carrying with it the interposing atmosphere , and excluding the surrounding air .
This , he submits , is analogous to ordinary suction , and by this means the loose card is at once drawn up and fixed .
He considers that the reflected air , thus rising and driven out by the descending current , will have additional power when the fixed card is considerably larger than the other .
