The following determinations of the magnetic elements among the Caribees or Windward Islands were made in August , 1886 , on the occasion of the Eclipse Expedition of that year to Grenada .
The instruments employed were magnetometer Elliott Ho. 61 , and Dip Circle Dover 83 , belonging to the Science and Art Department .
The method of observation was similar to that adopted in the Magnetic Survey of the British Isles for epoch January 1st , 1886 , for which these instruments were also employed .

( Abstract .
) It was observed during the course of some experiments on the electrolytic deposition of copper that the resistance of the electrolytic cells employed was greater the lower the current density , and the experiments described in this paper were undertaken to inquire more definitely into the matter .
Many physicists have already observed the same effect , and have ascribed it to a resistance at the junctions of the electrodes with the electrolyte , and called it " transfer " resistance .
In these experiments a prismatic electrolytic cell of triangular cross-section was employed , and the area of the electrodes was equal to that of the cross-section of the liquid .
The electrodes experimented with were electrotype copper , lead , zinc , and platinum , and the electrolytes , solutions of CuS04 of various sp. gr. , neutral and acidulated , of ZnS04 , MgS04 , NaCl , NazC03 , dilute H2S04 , \amp ; c. The electrodes were placed at different distances apart , but in general had an area of 50 square cm .
All the measurements were made by noting the swing of a Thomson 's reflecting galvanometer , used as a potentiometer , and standardised before each trial by means of a Clark 's cell .
The current was measured by observing the potential difference across a known resistance .
The P.D. of the cell was proportional to the swing of the spot of light .
The counter B.M.P. was obtained by taking the swing on breaking the circuit , the galvanometer being connected across the terminals of the cell ; but this swing is not proportional to the C.E.M.F. existing m the cell whilst the circuit is completed .
Readings were , there-
