IT is a fundamental proposition of analysis that a system of n differential equations of the first order containing n+1 variables admits of n integrals , each of which is expressed by a function of the variables equated to an arbitrary constant .
But when a system of n differential equations of the first order connects n+r variables , r being greater than unity , no existing theory assigns in a general manner the number of theoretically possible integrals of the above species , or shows us how to discover them .
Yet such cases are of great importance .
I wish to develope here the theory of a method for the solution of the above classes of equations , which was published by me in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society ' for March 6th of the present year , and which enables us to assign the number of theoretically possible integrals , and to reduce their discovery to the solution of a system of simultaneous differential equations equal in number to the number of integrals , and expressible as exact differential equations .
The solution of the problem as thus reduced may be effected by known methods , but I have thought it desirable to discuss this part of the subject also in direct sequence to the other , and in conformity with its method .
Of the Connexion between ordinary and partial Differential Equations .
It has been found convenient , in researches bearing upon the general theory of differential equations , to use the term 'integral ' in two distinct senses , viz. to denote , as above , a relation satisfying the differential equation or system of equations , and expressed by the equating of a function of the variables to a constant , and to denote the function itself .
The particular sense intended will always be shown by the connexion .
With this convention two systems of differential equations will be said to be equivalent when they have in either of the above senses ( and the one implies the other ) the same system of integrals .
This will explain the meaning of the following proposition .
PROPosITION I.-A system of n ordinary differential equations of the first order connectizg n+r variables may be converted into an equivalent system of r linear partial differential equations of the first order .
Let x , , x , ... x , +r be the variables , then the supposed given system of differential equa tions may , by algebraic solution with respect to dx , , dx2 , ' ... dx , , , be reduced to the form dx1 = A , l d , ,n , +A12dn , ,+2 .

dgnJrr rxl x nru , a system of r linear partial differential equations , the common integrals of which will be the integrals of the system ( I. ) .
We say ' the common integrals of which , ' because in fact these equations express the conditions to all of which P must be subject in order that P=c may be an integral of the system ( I. ) .
The formal connexion between the systems ( I. ) and ( II .
) deserves to be carefully noticed .
The several partial differential equations of the system ( II .
) may be formed by inspection from the columns in the right-hand member of the system ( I. ) by the following rule .
For the differential dx , +i in any column write the differential coefficient dP dP dP dP , to this add the series of differential coefficients 9 ' ... multiplied in succesdx , + dxll dx , ) ' ' sion by the descending coefficients of the column , and equate the final result to 0 .
The symmetrical form of the equation dP JP dp r= x-dx,1 dXdx2. .
+rdx 438 shows that by an exactly similar rule any system of n partial differential equations of the first order , the terms of which consist of the differential coefficients of P multiplied by functions of the independent variables xi , S2 , ... xan+ , r may be converted into an equivalent system of r common differential equations of the first order .
For the proposed system of partial differential equations is by algebraic reduction expressible in the form dP dP dP dP 7 dA , d , , +A,2 2 ***+Al dr dP dP dP dP ^-2=A2 , +A1 &gt; +22 d2.2r dP'* ( III .
) dP dP dP dP dAndl d++An2 +2 n+ Are dP+ dP dP dP If the values of - , v.*. .
in this system be substituted in the previous general dP dP " dP equation , and the coefficients of the differential coefficients dP ' dP*'.in the dX +l ' WXn+2 ' d"x +r result be separately equated to 0 , we shall have dx , + , +A , , dx , +A2 , dx2 , ... +An , dx , =0 dxn+2+A,2 dx , +A22 dx2..+An2 dXn=0 ... d. .
( IV .
) dx , n+r+Alr dx A2r d2 ... +Anr dxn=0 .
These , equations may in like manner be formed by inspection from the columns of dP the second member of ( III .
) , by writing for d7+ in any column dx , , adding to this dxl , dx2 , ... dx , multiplied by the descending coefficients of the column , and equating the final sum to 0 .
The rule for the one case differs from that for the other only in that differentials take the place of differential coefficients .
As an objection may be felt to the legitimacy of that step of the above process in dP dP dP which , the differential coefficients k-- ' -9 " Tbeing eliminated , the coefficients of the remaining ones are separately equated to 0 , I will point out another mode of procedure which leads to the same result , and which is founded upon LAGRANGE'S method of solution .
Let the equations of the system ( III .
) be added together after having been multiplied respectively by X , , X2 , ... Xn , which are to be regarded as indeterminate functions of the variables x , x2 , ... xn+ .
The result will be a linear partial differential equation of the first order , of which the Lagrangian auxiliary system of ordinary differential equations will be dx 2 dAx dx , n -dxn+ , dx .

) .
Of the Determination of the N2umber of Integrals of a system of Diferential Equations of the First Order and Degree .
We still suppose the given system of differential equations to be expressed under the general form ( I. ) , and reduced by Prop. I. to the equivalent partial differential system ( II .
) .
Now if for the expression of that system we introduce a series of symbols A , , A , ... A , defined as follows , viz. di =d d d , =+ &amp; , ~+Ali..+A , ,A ... . . ? .
( 1 .
) the system will assume the form A , P=o0 , AP=0 , ... A -0 , ... ... . .
( 2 .
) and we shall now establish the following proposition PROPOSITIO II.--If AtP=O , AP= 0 represent any two linear partial differential equations of the system ( II .
) , then will the equation of which the symbolical expression is ( A , Aj-AjA)P=o ... ... ... ... ( 3 .
) also be a linear partial differential equation of the first order , and it will be satisfied by all the common integrals of the two equations from which it is formed .
For , representing any one of the quantities x , , x ... x , by x , and any function of those d quantities by X , A , consists of a series of terms of the form X / .
Again , representing any one of the same series of quantities , , x2 , ... n by y , and any function of them by Y , Aj will consist of terms of the form Y d. Hence ( A , -A,2AA)P will consist of terms of the form dddd ( Xd ?
y-Yy X~ P. dx ay yx Effecting the differentiations , this term becomes die dP d2P dX dP d2P dA die X dxdydy d-x Y dxdy or die dP dX dP Xd ddy x which involves only the first differential coefficients of P. Hence ( 3 .
) will be a linear partial differential equation of the first order .
Hence also the ultimate form of ( 3 .
) will be the same as if Ai , when operating on A ?
P , operated only on the coefficients A,1 ... .
A3 involved in Aj , and vice versdi .
Thus the,440 ultimate form of ( 3 .
) will be dP dP dP ( A , A , -i.AjA ) dl+(AiAj-AjA2 ... $ +(^AA , nj-AjAn ) O. .
( 4 .
) Secondly , the equation ( A ; AjAA4)P=O will be satisfied by any common integral of A , P=O and A , P=O .
For let p=c be a common integral of the latter equations .
Then , identically , A , -=0 , A:j=O ; therefore , since Aj and Ai involve only operations of differentiation together with algebraic ones , AjA , p= 0 , A , Ajp=0 ; A. AP-Aj AjA , =O0 ; whence ( 3 .
) is also identically satisfied .
PROPOSITION III.-If , by the successive application of Prop. II .
, and bypermitted processes of algebraic elimination , we derivefrom , the system of partial differential equations AIP=O , 2P-- ... ... AP= , into which the given system of differential equations has been converted , ajfinal system of partial differential equations which , while including the above system , shall be such that the application of Prop. II .
to any pair of the equations contained shall lead only to an identity , then the number of integrals of the given system of differential equations will be equal to the number of variables they contain , diminished by the number of partial differential equations of the above final system .
The developed form of the system lP=O , A2PO , ... AP=O ... ... .
( 1 .
) is the following:dP dP dP dP dP dP d , C+2 12d A. ( 2 .
) dP dP dP dXn+r+Atlr *X*I *nd X. Comparing these with ( 4 .
) , Prop. II .
, which is the developed form of the equation ( A , j-Aj , A ; )P=O0 , we see that the latter equation is necessarily algebraically independent of the above system ; for no equation derived from that system by algebraic processes dP dP could be free , as ( 4 .
) is , from all the differential coefficients dx7 ** .
-d+ .
Again , as ( AiV\-AA)P=0 is satisfied by all the common integrals of AiP=0 and AP=O0 , it follows that the system of r+1 equations , AP= , ... ,.P=O , ( , Aj-Aa , )P=O ... ... ( 3 .
) will be satisfied by all the common integrals of the system ( 1 .
) .
To this system of r+l 441 equations we can also give a form analogous to the developed form of the system ( 2 .
) .
dP dP It will be noticed that the differential coefficients -- ' ... , dappear there , each in dx , +i dxn r only one equation , and each with the coefficient unity .
Now let the last equation of ( 3 .
) in its developed form be divided by the coefficient of dand let also the value of uxn dP P which it gives be substituted in the other equations of ( 3 .
) ; then we shall have in dxn the whole a system of n+1 equations possessing the same general character as the system ( 2 .
) .
To this new system the same procedure may be applied , viz. the genesis of a new equation by means of Prop. II .
, and the transference of another differential dP coefficient d , _ to the list of those which form the respective first terms of the equations of the system .
We will suppose this procedure to have been repeated until a system composed of m partial differential equations such that the further application of Prop. II .
leads only to identities has been formed .
If n+r--m=p , that system will be of the form dP dP dP dx+Hl dx H dZ = dP dP dP ^ +21 2^1 &lt; ~ ... ... ... ( 4 .
) d ?
+Hi , .
p =0 .
dP dmP JP And if , in analogy with former notation , we write dddd +Hli +H ... +Hpd =Ai , it will take the symbolical form A , P=O , A2P=O , ... AmP=O ; but it will differ from all former systems of equations in that all the conditions represented by ( Aa , A , )P= 0 ... ... ... .
( 5 .
) will be identically satisfied , -satisfied , in consequence not of any ascertained peculiarity of the integral P , but of the constitution of the system of symbols Al , A2,..Am .
The course of argument has shown that the common integrals of the system ( 4 .
) will be identical with those of the parent system ( 2 .
) .
Now we shall show that the existence of the condition ( 5 .
) renders the integration theoretically possible ; that the system ofp ordinary differential equations into which , by Prop. II .
, the final system of partial differential equations ( 4 .
) is resolvable admits of exactly integrals .
Asp=n+r--m , this is to say that the -number of integrals is equal to the number of original variables diminished by the number of final partial differential equations .
442 The proof of this will consist of two parts:-lst .
It will be shown that , if a system of p integrals exists , the conditions represented by ( 8 .
) will be identically satisfied .
2ndly .
It will be shown that , when the conditions represented by ( 5 .
) are identically satisfied , the solution either of the final system of partial differential equations ( 4 .
) , or of the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations , by a system of p integrals is theoretically possible .
It will follow from these conjoined , that the number of actually existing integrals is exactly p. 1st .
The system of ordinary differential equations corresponding to ( 4 .
) may be expressed in the form dxl=H , ldxp+p+Hl2dxp+2 + Hilmdxp+m , ) v~ ... ~ .
~.:~ ... . .
** ... .
+ ( 6 .
) dxp=HFpldxp ++H , p , dxp+. .
+Hpmdxp+m .
Now suppose this system to have p integrals .
Then , by means of these , x , , x2 , ... p can be eliminated from the coefficients HI , , &amp;c. in the second members , which will thus become exact differentials of those functions of the variables Xp+ ... x , p , which express the values of x , , ... Xp .
Hence we shall have the system of conditions dd d+HkiT ... ... .Hki .
( 7 .
) k representing any integer from 1 to p , and i , j any integers from 1 to nm , and the bracketed symbols of differentiation referring to Hk , H , k as transformed .
Hence , the unbracketed symbols referring to the prior state of the functions , we have dd dx , d dxp d dcp.iJ dxp-i+dxp+i dlx * ' ' +-dx , pi dxp ddd dxp +i +Hl ; d , I.Hpi d$ -dx +Nd--x Hdx In the same way ( dxp+j)= i so that ( 7 .
) becomes A , Hk , -AHk , = ... .
( 8 .
) Now if we construct , in analogy with ( 4 .
) , Prop. II .
, the developed form of the conditional equation ( 5 .
) of the present section , we shall have dP dP ( AiH , -AHl ) ... +(AiHpj-A , Hpi ) d =o , or , Z denoting summation from k=1 to k=p , 2(AiH1j Aj-Hki ) =-0 .
Now as by ( 8 .
) the coefficients vanish identically , the equation , and generally the system of conditional equations of which it is the type , will be identically satisfied .
AJ8 2ndly .
We proceed to show that the system of m linear partial differential equations ( 7 .
) , represented under the form A , P=O , A2P=O , ... AMP=O , and satisfying identically the system of conditions represented by ( AnAj-AjA , )P=0 , will admit of p integrals expressing distinct values of P ; and the system of ordinary differential equations ( 6 .
) corresponding to the above system of partial differential equations will be expressible as a system of exact differential equations , and will by integration give the above systems of integrals .
Beginning with the first partial differential equation .
of the system ( 4 .
) , and forming the corresponding Lagrangian system of ordinary differential equations dx , dx , _ dxp Hpl dxp+2=0 , dXp+m=O we see that the integrals of this system will be of the form U1l -. .
*..tp =p , -+2C=p+2 * .
p* +mp-m -pm 11 ... ubp being functions of all the variables xl ... Xp+m^ among which , by virtue of the integrals of the second line , ,4p2 , ... Xp+m may be regarded as constant .
The general integral will be F(ul,..U , x , P+ , ... x+m)=0 , the form of F being perfectly arbitrary .
Now the general form of any equation of the system ( 4 .
) is dP dP dP d H , ii ** .
+H -pi =..d.x .
( 9 .
) Let us transform this by assuming ... p *** P. p+ * p+m as independent variables .
Then referring the right-hand members of the following equations to the new , the left-hand to the old system of variables , we have dP _dP dP du1 dP dup dpd+i x p+i d dxp x^ * whence , substituting in ( 9 .
) , dP dP du du dJul + , drp+ du p+ i d. +Hp dxp dp d ?
p+ dup +du , d+H+P***+ Hp d ) =0 ?
or dP dP dP __v+(a ^ ) ... +(A)du ) =0 ; . .
* ( 10 .
) and in this equation we may give to i the successive values 1 , 2,. .
p. If , then , we write d+ d j=l and P=u , , we have ( AA , a , )AOU , = o0 .
But Au , ==-0 ; therefore , by the above , A'iAA0 .
Now Aiu is expressible at most as a function of u , , .
, .
z,3p+1 ... xp+m .
But this transd formation converts , as has been seen , A , into d , .
Thus we have , Au =0 , so that A\u , is free from x , p+ .
Thus the system ( 11 .
) is free from x , , .
Lastly , since by the above transformation A ... .
A , p are converted into A2 ... Ap , the system of conditions ( A , A--A , Ai)P=O is converted into ( A^Aj-A ; ' )P=0 .
It is thus seen that the system ofp partial differential equations A , P=0 , AXP=O , ... 'AP=0 , containing p+m independent variables x , , x2 ... Xp , , , , and satisfying the conditions ( AjAj--AjA)P= 0 , is convertible into a system of p-1 partial differential equations , A'P=-0 , AP - , APP=0 , containing p+m-1 independent variables u , ... , , , p+ , ... xp+ , , and satisfying the condition ( a , A , -AA)=P 0 .
And as this system possesses the same character as that upon which the previous transformation depended , it will admit of transformation into a system of p-2 partial differ ential equations containing p+m-2 independent variables ; and so on until we arrive at a single final partial differential equation containing p+l independent variables , and having therefore p distinct integrals , which will be the common integrals of the primary system of partial differential equations as well as of the system of ordinary differential equations to which they correspond .
Cor. The property of the coefficients A2 , , &amp;c. of the system ( 11 .
) , of being free from the variable x+ , , enables us , by properly determining the integrals of the partial differential equation AIP=0 , to reduce the system to a form of great simplicity .
Let Aiu be any one of those coefficients .
Its developed form is dd ( +dH+ ) +Huid.t .
+x pi Pdp * *. .
when x , +i=O each ui shall reduce to xi .
For this purpose it ig only necessary to choose as arbitrary constants t set of arbitrary values of x , x , ... x , corresponding to xp+ , =O .
Let " x , : x,. .
, :x be such arbitrary constants , and let the given system of integrals be reduced to the formr and the functions ui,..t I , will possess the required property .
Changing , then , each % into xj , the expression ( 12 .
) reduces to Hi , and it only remains to express this in terms of c5 , .
, .
, which , as +1=0 , is done by merely changing x , , .
p , into Thus the system ( 11 .
) is reduced to dP dP d_P +(H12 ) dl + ( Hp2 ) d= -t+2 J. ? .
LdP dP dP Where the brackets denote that in the enclosed portion x , ,1 is to be made 0 , and xi , x,..x , % converted into ul , u,2. .
, Up .
Now this form is identical , the above conversion of letters excepted , with that of the : system ( 4 .
) , omitting that equation of , the latter system by the integration of which the forms of z , ... .
up are determined .
'It follows from the above that , obtaining the integrals of A1P=0 in such a form that the arbitrary constants shall represent the arbitrary values of xl ... when x+--=0 , and representing the functions which are equal to those arbitrary constants by x , , , ... , then if in the remaining equations A,2P=0 ... AmP=0 we change x ... x , - ' d to ~~~~~ ... ... .~~--~~~~ a'~ dPd dS '. .
p5 TX " *_d d , x ad-nd -+ and'd-to 0 , the common integrals of the transformed system of p-1 will be the fsame as those of the previous system of p partial differential equations .
In the same way a third system of p-2 partial differential equations may be formed , and so on , till we obtain a single final partial differential equation which will ; have the common integrals of the parent system .
By this method , which is due to JACOBI and NUTANI , all the labour of the successive transformations is avoided .
The successive integrals thus introduced are termed ' Haupt-ntegrale .
' Instead of applying the foregoing methods , general or particular , to the final system of partial differential equations , we may apply it to the solution of the corresponding final system of ordinary differential equations .
In this case they would really represent the ' method 'of solution known as the variation of parameters , and the conditions ( AiAj.--A/ A)P=0 would secure the sufficiency of that method , If , in the system of ordinary differential equations , ( 6 .
) we regard x+2 , ... Xp+ , as constant , we get dI -Hllxp==0,1 ... ... ... ... . .
( 13 .
) dxp-HW p+i=OJ .
3p2 DIFFERENTIAr Integrate this in the form 1=-15 ... %=C=p ; then , treating l , ... cp as functions of the variables before regarded as constant , and endeavouring to satisfy the unreduced equations ( 6 .
) , we obtain , in virtue of the above conditions , a system of differential equations equal in number to the system given , but containing one variable fewer .
The system ( 13 .
) by which the forms of , , ... .
are here determined , is the Lagrangian auxiliary of the first partial differential equation A1P=0 integrated in the other method ; and so in each subsequent stage .
And with respect to the other parts of the process , it obviously makes no difference whether we take as the new variables u , , ... up , or cl , ... cp under the condition ( necessarily involved in the method of the variation of parameters ) that they shall after integration be replaced by u , , ... p. But it would not have sufficed simply to refer the solution of the final system of ordinary differential equations to the method of the variation of parameters , first , because the necessity and sufficiency of the conditions which form the ground of that method and are the warrant of its success were to be shown ; secondly , because the connexion of the systems of ordinary differential equations which arise in the method of parameters with the successive partial differential equations forms an essential part of the demonstration .
General Rule .
The results of the foregoing inquiry may be collected into the following General Rule : To find the number p of possible integrals of a system of n differential equations of the first order connecting n+r variables xs , x2,. .
x , , .
, , and to determine those integrals .
Rule.-Suppose P an integral of the given system .
Determine from the given system di , dx2 , ... dxn as functions of the other differentials .
Substitute these values in the equation dP dp dP d + , l.+ d$X2 + dX+n+r O , and equate to 0 the coefficients of the remaining differentials .
This will give a system of r partial differential equations of the form dP dP dP d +Al+jAll ' d +AI _= ?
, dP dP dP r rnl n rn nl nnnnnr of the differential coefficients appearing each only in one equation and with coefficient unity .
Representing these equations in the symbolical form AP=0 , A2P=0 , ... AP=O , deduce any equation or equations of the form ( AAj-AjAi)P= 0 .
448 If all such prove to be identities , the given system of differential equations admits of n integrals , and is reducible to a system of exact differential equations .
But if any such equation is not an identity , it will constitute a new partial differential equation of the form dP dP dP B1 -+B -* , ... +B = 0 .
dx1 dn d And this , combined with the previous ones , will enable us to form a system of r+1 dP dP dP partial differential equations , in which ah in only one equadxn ' dxn+1 dXn+ appear each in only one equation and with coefficient unity .
Upon this system let the same process be repeated as upon the previous system of r partial differential equations , and so continually repeated until we arrive at a final system of partial differential equations such that , if that system be represented in the form AP=O ... AP= O , the condition ( z , AjaA)P= 0 shall be identically satisfied for every pair .
Then , the number of such partial differential equations being m , the number of integrals of the original system of partial differential equations will be n+r-m , i. e. it will be equal to the number of the original variables diminished by the number of final partial differential equations .
And if by that final system we eliminate m of the differential coefficients from dP dP dP dxl d.l +d$2 2 **+ , ( nr=0 and equate to 0 the coefficients of the remaining differential coefficients , we shall have a system of n+r--m differential equations expressible as exact differential equations for the determination of the integrals .
Actually to determine these , we should endeavour in the first instance to reduce the final system of differential equations , as such reduction is theoretically possible , to a system of exact differential equations .
If the means of doing this are not obvious , the method of the variation of parameters or the equivalent methods of Prop. III .
must be applied .
Lastly , if the process which consists in the application of the theorem ( AjA/ -AjA , )P =0 do not stop with the formation of the final system of partial differential equations , but lead to algebraic relations among the variables , the given system of differential equations will have no integrals properly so called , but it may admit of solutions analogous to those the theory of which has been developed by PFAFF , JACOBI , and others for the differential equation X , dxi+Xdxa ... +Xndxn=O .

Now if upon any two of these we repeat the same process as upon ( 1 .

Thus the system of partial differential equations is complete .
As then there are three equations in this final system , while the number of original variables was four , the primary system will admit of one integral of the form P=-c .

The solution of the partial differential equation Rr+Ss+Tt+U(s2-rt)=V , as well as of the special equations Rr+Ss+Tt=V , Rr+ Ss+Tt+ U(s2rt)= O , the theory of which constitutes an exception to that of the more general form , depends , in general upon the integration of three simultaneous differential equations between five variables .
' To this-integration the method of the foregoing sections is applicable .
The only cases .
for which the 9theory of the ultimate solution can be said to be complete , are those in which the auxiliary system of common differential equations admits either three integrals of the form P-=c , or two integrals of that form .
We may apply the method of the foregoing sections , not only to the determination of the integrals , but also to the discovery of the a priori conditions connecting the coeffi^ cients R , S , T , L , Y in order that each of these species of integration may be possible .
For example , the solution of the equation Rr+Ss+Tt+(s2-rt ) =V depending upon the integration of the system d]=-m , dx+R , dyY dp= -m2dy+Tdx , dz = pdz +qdy , in which m , and m2 are roots of the equation mi-Sm+RT-V=0 , let it be required to determine the conditions under which the system admits three integrals .
Eliminating dg , dp , dz between the above equations and dP d , dP d dP dP dx+ y+ dz+ ddp+ ddq-0 and equating to 0 the coefficients of dx and die in the result , we obtain two partial differential equations which may be thus represented , viz. AP=-0 , A'P=O , in which dddd A=--m d+T dp+ dddd d=y+ Rj-m2 , p +qT 45 !
D That there may be three integrals , it is here necessary that there should be but two partial differential equations in the completed system .
Hence the equation ( aA'-A)P= O must vanish identically .
Developing this , we have the conditions ARE +A^mI=0 , Am2+AT=0 , Aq--Al=0 .
Now on performing the operations denoted by A and A ' , the last equation gives m2--1 = 0 .
Hence referring to the quadratic , we see that S2-4RT+4V=0 ... ... ... ( I. ) To this must be added the two other reduced conditions , ARE +A'm=o , ... ... ... .
( II .

) m representing one of the equal roots of the reduced quadratic .
The first of the above conditions was given by AMPERE* .
The others are probably new .
Satisfied , they enable us to predict that the partial differential equation under consideration admits a complete primitive involving three constants , and a general primitive arising from the variation of those constants in subjection to any two arbitrary conditions .

We have supposed each linear partial differential equation employed in the processes of this paper to be of the form dP dP dP A.dx 2.A2 .
+-ndx , and we have supposed each system of partial differential equations which arises , to be so reduced that each equation shall have some one of the partial differential coefficients of P entering into it alone and with a coefficient equal to unity .
The first of these conditions is virtually sufficiently general , because any linear partial differential equation can be deprived of its second member .
The advantage of the second condition is that each newly-formed equation will be really new , and not an algebraic combination of the old ones .
But neither of these conditions is necessary .
From two linear partial differential equations of the form A , P=H , AP= K , in which H and K are functions of the independent variables , arises a new equation , ( AA2-A2A1)P=A1K-A2H , ... ... .

) which will be satisfied by all the simultaneous integrals of the equations from which it is derived .
It may be rigorously proved that , in applying this process , the generated system ( including the original equations ) will be complete when no new , equation arises from the combination of any one of the equations with any one of the equations of the original system .
I will illustrate this by investigating the conditions of integrability of the expression die d 2y dny\ T ' ' dx , ' , d)d " / dx .
If this expression admit of an integrral V , it is easy to see that V will satisfy the two partial differential equations dV dV , dV dV dV+ d+y+Y.*+8d die .._l .

The above are , in fact , the partial differential equations which we should obtain by Prop. I. as the equivalents of the system of ordinary differential equations , dV= plx , dy=yldx , die , =y2x , ... die _ , l=ydx .
