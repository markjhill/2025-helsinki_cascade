The condenser on which the following experiments were made is the one referred to in a paper by one of us read before the Royal Society on June 1st , 1893 ( 'Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 54 , p. 7 ) .
It is a rs 5-microfarad condenser of tinfoil and paraffined paper , made by Messrs , if Muirhead .
In the paper referred to it was shown that when it is si allowed to discharge itself through a coil containing induction the rate of dissipation of energy ( calculated from the damping of the cl oscillations that occur ) is greater than that due to the resistance of i the outside circuit : the additional dissipation being equal to what Si would have taken place if about 59 ohms had been added to the e circuit resistance .
The following experiments were made with the idea of ascertaining l1 whether this additional dissipation is the result simply of viscosity in so the dielectric of the condenser or to true hysteresis of the charge t with respect to the potential difference between the condenser plates .
{ i A sharp distinction is not always made between the two phenomena ; jjj it cannot be too clearly borne in mind that , on the one hand , viscosity | i\#174 ; a " time 99 effect\#151 ; i.e. , it depends on the rate of change of the f variables ; while , on the other hand , the phenomenon of hysteresis , cj does not in any way involve the rate at which the changes in the $jj\lt ; quantities are made .

[ Mar. 21 , f oscillatory discharge , are hence unsaited for discriminating between the two causes : to test whether true hysteresis exists it is essential to so arrange the experiment that all viscous effects shall have had time to subside before any measurement of charge is made .
Hence the interesting experiments made during the last three years by ' Riccardo Amo* in which a dielectic cylinder begins to rotate when " placed in a rotating electrostatic field , as well as the experiments made by P. Janet , f and by one of us using oscillatory discharges , do not serve as test experiments on this question .
The arrangement which we adopted to test for hysteresis is as follows:\#151 ; Fig , 1 .

1895.1 Oft the Question of Dielectric Hysteresis .
471 terminals .
The charge that the condenser possesses at any time can be ascertained by discharging it ( by means of the switch ) through a ballistic galvanometer .
Since the methods for testing for hysteresis consist in putting the thing tested through cyclic series of states , it is essential that any change of state involved in the measuring operations should itself form part of a cycle .
This was accomplished by making the cycles in the manner indicated in Pig .
2 , which has been drawn as it might appear if considerable hysteresis were present .
Fig. 2 .
Potential .
Commencing at the point R in the cycle ( i.e. with no difference of potential between the terminals ) , the potential difference is gradually increased until the point P on the curve is reached ; the condenser is then discharged ; the portion of the curve PU is traced during the " instantaneous " discharge , and the galvanometer indicates the loss of charge PT , which includes whatever viscous flow takes place during the time of throw of needle ( 2|r seconds ) .
While the galvanometer is still in connection with the condenser a further viscous flow takes place , until , if the cyclic state has been set up , the starting point R is arrived at .
Before allowing the switch to again connect the condenser to B ( Pig* 1 ) the rheostat is unwound so as to bring B back to A ; there is then no potential difference between B nnd A , and the condenser receives no charge when the switch completes connection .
After this connection has been made the potential difference is again gradually increased , but to a higher ^alue than before\#151 ; to S ( say ) ; it is gradually diminished till it has the same value as at P ; we thus arrive at a point Q ; the condenser is then discharged through the galvanometer ; the throw of the needle measures the loss of charge QT , which includes the same Messrs. A. W. Porter and D. K. Morris .
[ Mar 21 viscous effect as before ; the point U is reached during the throw of needle : after which , a further viscous flow takes place , until ( if the cyclic state be set up ) the point R is returned to once more .
The contact B is moved back to A while the condenser is still detached .from it ; and this series of operations is then many times repeated .
If the dissipation of energy in the condenser is due to hysteresis , then , as in the magnetic analogue , we know that the cyclic curve will embrace an area , and the point Q will not coincide with the point P ; and the converse of this is also true if time has been given for viscous effects to subside .
If , on the other hand , experiment shows no difference in the charge when at Q from what it is at P , there can be no hysteresis , unless of an amount so small as to elude this method of detecting it .
The following figure ( Fig. 3 ) shows the kind of curve that will be traced if hysteresis be absent .
Fig. 3 .
Potential The experimental results are given in Table I. The point P was so chosen that the charge was then almost exactly half of the maximum charge .
The duration of a cycle of operations was never less than five minutes .
The galvanometer throws were read by a telescope and scale , and are expressed in centimetres .
As both galvanometer mirror and telescope are of fine quality there is no difficulty in detecting a tenth of a millimetre on the scale .
It will be observed that the throws fall off gradually throughout the experiment in consequence of gradual failure of the battery power ; but as this affects both series to the same extent it has no influence on the ratios .
Individual values of the ratio Throw at Q/ Throw at P differ amongst themselves by small amounts , being below unity in 11 cases , above in 12 , and equal to unity in one case .

Hence the position of the point Q in the diagram is indistinguishable from the position of the point P ; and we may conclude that when time has been given for viscous effects to subside the charge of the condenser is the same for a given value of the potential difference , whether that value has been arrived at from higher or from lower values than itself .
474 On the Question oj Dielectric Hysteresis .
[ Mar. 21 Since , until further experiments be made , this conclusion can only be taken as applying to the condenser when under the conditions of this experiment , it is necessary to form an idea as to the highest value of the electromotive intensity which was produced in the dielectric . .
Only a very rough estimate of its value can be made without dismounting the condenser .
If we assume that the thickness of the paraffined paper is about *01 cm .
, then with 11 volts potential difference between the plates , the electromotive intensity equals 1,100 volts per cm .
, or about 3'7 electrostatic units .
If we take the dielectric constant of paraffined paper as 2 , the corresponding electrostatic induction is 7*4 electrostatic units .
It may be mentioned that in the experiments of Signor Arno the induction ranged from -03 to 14 58 electrostatic units .
In order to give an idea of the viscous effects which come into play in the same condenser , we have ascertained the variation of the charge which it takes up on the application of an unvaried E.M.F. to its terminals for different intervals of time .
The results are plotted in Fig. 4 .

" On the Changes in Movement and Sensation produced by Hemisection of the Spinal Cord in the Cat. " By Charles Devereux Marshall , F.R.C.S. Communicated by Professor V. Horsley , F.R.S. Received January 31 , 1895 .
( Abstract ) .
The present research was undertaken in order to determine more exactly the nature and origin of epileptiform convulsions and the paths in the spinal cord by which both afferent and efferent impulses are transmitted .
The method employed was as follows :\#151 ; Hemisection of the spinal cord was performed in the lower dorsa region on the right side , the animals being anaesthetized with ether and strict antiseptic precautions being observed .
The animals were kept alive for different periods of time after the operation , and the effects produced on the voluntary movements , sensibility , and the reflexes were carefully noted .
After death the spinal cords were at once removed , and after hardening and staining , by Marchi 's method , both the lesion and the tracts of degeneration were investigated by microscopic examination .
There were 16 experiments performed .
The following results are briefly what were obtained .
( a. ) Motion.\#151 ; After hemisection of the cord there is immediate paralysis of the limb below , and on the same side as the section , this remains for a time , and then gradual recovery takes place to a greater or less extent ; sometimes the recovery is so complete that it is with difficulty that one can determine which was the paralyzed limb .
At other times more or less permanent weakness is left so as to cause a limp when walking , foot-drop is not infrequently seen and the animal does not appear to appreciate correctly the position that the leg occupies .
( t. ) The Reflexes are , as a rule , greatly exaggerated below and on the same side as the lesion , and sometimes continue so for a long period ; in many cases they get less as time goes on ; occasionally they are not so well marked as on the opposite or uninjured side .
