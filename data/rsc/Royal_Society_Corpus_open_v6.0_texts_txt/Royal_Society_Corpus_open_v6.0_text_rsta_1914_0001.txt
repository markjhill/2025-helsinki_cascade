23 IT has long been well known that refractive indices of simple gaseous compounds do not obey the additive law so closely as those of solids or liquids .
From the study of these last GLADSTONE and DALE , and their followers , succeeded in obtaining refraction equivalents for a large number of the elements which were fairly constant for the same class of compound .
But in gases the discrepancies were found to be VOL. COXIII .

CLIyE HBERTSON ) TTTfIBF , TSON ON THE much wider , and this appeared more surprising since , in other fields of esearch , the gaseous state has proved pecnliarly favonrable for the discovery of simple relations .
of .\mdash ; The investigation , of the present paper forms part , was designed to throw light on the cause of these anomalies .
The first step was to enlarge the field of the enquiry the accumulation of data , and with this object we have , either together or in collaboration with others , determined and redetermined the refractio and dispersion in the gaseous state of fourteen elements and ten compounds within the limits of the visible spectrum , and the refraction of six elements and four compounds for a single wave-length .
The number is still far too small .
Many interesting compounds remain to be investigated .
But , as the present instalment of work has occupied nearly two years and has led to certain definite conclusions , it seems better to publish it rather than to await the addition of more difficult and , pel'haps , less instructive examples .
Choice of \mdash ; In selecting the compounds to be examined we have been guided by the principle that the molecule should consist of as few atoms as possible , and that the action and dispersion of each constituent should be measurable in the gaseous state .
It is unfortunate that the list of compounds which comply with these requirements is very short .
All compounds of carbon are excluded .
Of those substances which are dealt with in the present paper , the most important are the acids , which form a ular series of simple diatomic molecules .
Steam , and form an interesting cycle , and the two oxides of nitrogen are very instructive since the constituents are the same in both cases .
* Ozone is remarkable as an example of the effect of polymerization on the refractiv of J\amp ; sults.\mdash ; The choice of a formula for the expression of results is of fundamental importance .
Previous workers on the subject of aseous refractivities have almost invariably used that of CAUCHY , with two terms or three , according to the degree of accuracy of their figures .
But this formula is not based on modern physical theory .
Moreover , we have shown a previous paper that , when only two constants are used , it is inadequate to express the experimental results , even in the visible spectrum ; while if a third constant and term involving is introduced , the shape of the dispersion curve cannot be easily grasped on inspection of the figures .
For these reasons we have bandon this formula , and have used , tentatively , formula of type , It is unnecessary to defend the adoption for seous indices of this expression , which has been widely used for solids , and is in general outline established on theory * The examinatio1l of and has been postponed on account of its difficulty , but promises to be no less interesting and important owing to the association which characterises it .

REFRACTION AND RSION OF THE HALOGENS , HALOGEN ACIDS , and confirmed by experiment .
But it is desirable to emphasise the fact that the calculation of the constants given in this paper a formula containing only one term on the right-hand side is only provisional , since the main conclusion of the authors is that , both for elements and compounds , a single term is inadequate , except in the case of monatomic } .
The simple form of the formula is , however , useful for indicating at a glance the direction and magnitude of the changes in refractive and dispersive power which take place when elements combine to form a compound .
If are the refractive indices of a substance for two wave-lengths for which the frequencies are we approximately , since is usually small compared with ? .
The left side of the equation expresses the power of the substance , which is thus seen to be inversely proportional to of be the formulae which express the refractivity of two gaseous elements in the region of the visible spectrum , and let express the refractivity of the compound which they form .
If the molecules of the two elements are diatomic , and one molecule of the compound is formed of one atom of each , then the change of refractive power on combination is of \mdash ; If the additive law ictly followed the dispersive power of a compound , measured in a region remote from free frequencies , would lie between the dispersive powel .
S of its constituents , i. e. , would lie between and .
For it can be shown that , for a short region of the spectrum , elnote from free frequencies , so that is large compared with and can be neglected , , and this expression lies between these limits .
Hence , if the experimental value of differs this value , the variation must be due to the changes in one or more of the four quantities ) , consequent on combination .
It is evident that all four unknown quantities cannot be determined from a knowledge of , which is all we obtain from a determination of the dispersion of the compound .
But two old 1 ) distinguished .
The value of may vary owing to nges in ) , consequent 011 combination , i.e. , to real modifications of the free periods of the vibratol.s ; or it may be due to the introduction of a new free period , or the elimination of an old one , previously wrapped up in and Summary of Results.\mdash ; Before proceeding to rive the experimental work it will be convenient to summarise the results obtained:\mdash ; ( 1 ) In hydrochloric , hydrobromic , hydriodic acids , sulphur dioxide*and sulphuretted the refracbivity of the compound is less than the sum of the refractivities of the elements , and the dispersive power of the compound lies between those of its constituents ; ( 2 ) In nitrous oxide , nitric oxide , ammonia , and ozone the refractivity of the compound is greater than the sum of those of its constituents , and the dispersive power is greater than that of either constituent ; ( 3 ) In steam the refractivity of the compound is less , and the dispersive power greater , than those of its constituents ; ( 4 ) In all cases the change in dispersive power is great elatively to the in refractive power .
We have framed a hypothesis which , in opinion , Vould accouunb for these changes in a qualitative manner , and we hope to publish it Previous Work.\mdash ; The refractive of gaseous has ] been measured twice .
DULONG found 000772 for white light with , prepared from , whose density was ( air 1 ) .
MASCART found for white light .
He worked at low pressures at the temperature C. and compared the refractivity with that of air under the same conditions .
The dispersion of the gas has not previously been measured .
\mdash ; The gas we used was prepared by dropping strong hydrochloric acid on potassium permanganate .
After washing in water and drying by sulphuric acid it was condensed in a bath of acetone cooled with solid .
and then allowed to boil off till the air in the connecting tubes had been .
The efractometer tube , previously evacuated , was then placed in connection with the chlorine by a capillary tube so fine that the gas entered tube sufficiently slowly interference bands to be .
When the of in the refractonleter reached that of the atmosphere the bands came to rest , and the pressure and temperature were read .

REFRACTION AND DISPERSION OF THE HALOGENS , HALOGEN ACIDS , ETC .
After each experiment was over the gas was absorbed over soda lime and only experiments in which the impurities were negligible were used in determining the refractive index .
The light used was that of the green mercury line , Refractiviby.\mdash ; The following figures were obtained in five experiments , the experimental values being reduced to C. and 760 mm. by the formula:\mdash ; . . . .
7976 , 7985 , 7966 , 7986 , 7981 .
Mean 7980 .
Conditions.\mdash ; The practice of reducing observations of refractivity to the standard temperature of C. and the pressure of 760 mm. , dates from a time when deviations from the laws of and GAY-LUSSAC were alike unknown .
As accuracy improved and the field of esearch was extended to vapours , these criter.ia became insufficient and sometimes meaningless .
MASCART , the volume of whose work entitles him to be considered the leading authority on the subject , at first adopted the old conditions , and even in the case of ) expressed the refractivity as it would be at and 760 mm. But , in his later work , when dealing with chlorine and bromine and with some organic compounds which the coefficients of thermal expansion and compressibility were unknown , he contented himself with mining the refractivity at pressures as low as possible and comparing it with that of air at the same temperature LE Rovx , in his experiments on sulphur , mercury , phosphorus and arsenic , expressed the ratio of the refractivity to the density , and and PRYTZ adopted the same system .
It is evident that this principle is the most convenient for those who wish to compare the refractivity of equal numbers of atoms of different elements , or of molecules of different compounds .
Accordingly , in the present work , we have reduced all refractivities to the values which they would have had if the gas or vapour had the density of hydrogen at C. and 76 cm .
, ( 000089849 ) lnultiplied by the ratio of the theoretical molecular weight of the substance in question to that of hydrogen .
But , in order to avoid confusion , we shall denote this value by the symbol , where denotes the standard density as here defined , and the density at C. and 76 cm .
The density of chlorine at the temperature and pressure uf been determined recently by TREADWELL and CHRISTIE .

and at that temperature the molecular volume of chlorine would be .
That of hydrogen is .
Hence the refractivity observed must be multiplied by the ratio of these .
We arrive at the number ; and since the accuracy of the experimGnts is not greater than 1 part in 1000 we may accept 000784 as the efractivity of chlorine for the green mercury line .
\mdash ; Assuming this value , the dispersion was measured at seven other points the by the method described in papers .

She describes the spectrum as consisting of ( 1 ) a region of general absorption which , in a column of gas 60 cm .
long , from 4650 to 2599 , and lengthens in both directions with pressure , but chiefly towards the less refrangible , reaching at atmospheres ; and ( 2 ) a line spectrum lying between 4799 and 5350 which consists of groups 01 dark lines , giving a fluted appearance to the eye .
With increased pressure these lines became more intense but did not increase in numbers where they had been visible before .
In addition there may be patches absorption in the region ofline See .

REFRACTION AND RSION O , The region of which the efractivity was measured by us extended to and thus covers the whole ran ge of the line spectrum and 2001t..U .
which are affected by the general absorption .
It is , therefore , of intel.est to find that the observed values of the refractivity lie on a smooth curve .
But it is significant that the calculated curve cuts acl .
OSS the experimental , in which the curvature is greater .
This appears to indicate that a single term forllmla is inadequate to express the results , and second term is required , in which both and small , to represent the influence of the absorption band .
In the region of the line spectrum it was to be expected that if any variations of refractive index accompanied the variations of absorption they would be found either in the immediate neighbourhood of each dark line or possibly affecting the whole breadth of each group of lines forming a .
In order to investigate this point the following test was made : The paths of the two interfering rays of light were equalised , so that when the wave-length of the light employed was continuously changed from red to violet no change was observed in the position of the interference bands in the field of view .
Chlorine was then admitted into one tube till the path of that beam had been retarded by 450 bands .
Next , by means of the compensator , same beam was accelerated by an equal amount .
If , now , the wave-length of the light be changed from red to violet any movement of the bands would be due to the difference of refractivity of glass and chlorine for the particular wave-length which is in the field of view .
The bands can easily be read to 1/ 10 , so that when 450 bands have passed a difference of refractivity of 1/ 4500 can be detected .
The slit was then narrowed till the interference systems due to 5790 and 5769 were clearly separated in the field of view : i. e. , till the light composing aIly particular part of the image varied by less than 20 .
On changing the wave-length continuously from red to violet no sudden change in the bands could be detected .
It may therefore be concluded that between 6708 and 4799 any sudden change of refractivity exceeding must be confined to a breadth of less than 20 .U .
and probably to less than half that amount .
It is not possible to detect small changes in the refractivity in a narrower section of the spectrum than this , since , if the light is sufficiently dispersed , it becomes too feeble to read nths o band .
BROMINE .
Previous DuFET records MASCART'S value for the line .
The dispersion of the gas has , apparently , not been attempted .
Preparation.\mdash ; The purest bromine obtainable from Kahlbaum was used .
Before every experiment the bulb containing the liquid was cooled to C. and exhausted , *This compensator , of special constrnction , retards all -lengths equally except in so fnr as dispersion atfects them .
so as to get rid traces of JIBr , formed since the previous experiment .
Since it was necessary for the gas ) pass through greased taps more elaborate precautions for purification would have been useless .
The grease used was specially prepared from pure paraffin wax aIltl oil .
After each experiment the vapour which entered the refractometer ) was admitted to contact with the mercury and absorbed .
Any admixture of HBr would have been measurable as hydrogen .
In the experiments on which we rely to obtain the index the residue was negligible .
Procedure.\mdash ; In order to reduce the obseryed refractivity to standard conditions it was necessary to measure the density of pour employed .
For this purpose the bulb containing the liquid was connected with a density bulb in parallel with the fractometer tube and a determination of the density of the vapour accompanied each experiment .
The atomic weight of bromine was taken as .
Owing to the great absorption of the vapour in the green it was necessary to use red light for the determination of the absolute index .
With as many as 80 or 90 bands could be read , whereas at the band system was no longer readable after 25 bands had passed .
The absolute index was determined from the followin five experiments which were well corroborated by several others not quite so trustworthy:\mdash ; TABLE II.\mdash ; Refractive Index of gaseous Bromine , . . .
\mdash ; Owing to the strong absorption of the vapour in the visible region measurements of the dispersion were difficult , and the accuracy attained was much inferior to that shown in the case of chlorine .

The experimental numbers fall approximately on a smooth curve which is given by .
The figures calculated from this equation are given in column 3 .
Relation of Di , sper.to Abso ption.\mdash ; As in the case of chlorine a test was made for a rapid change of affecting a narrow section of the spectrum , but none was detected .
In this case also the change of refractivity is small compared with the increase of the absorption as we pass from the red to the green .
IODINE .
Jfeasurements.\mdash ; The only determination of the index of iodine on record is that of HURION , ae who gives the red and for the violet .
He employed a prism and heated the iodine to It was hoped that with a refractometer a higher degree of accuracy could be obtained , but the results of experiment were disappointing .
The absorption band which has its maximum at 5000 extends so far into the red that , with the faint light available in a Jamin apparatus , the band system was very soon obliterated .
In the red as many as 21 bands could be observed with difficulty , but dc Physique , ' I. , VII .
, p. 181 .
VOL. CCXIII.\mdash ; A. at it was not possible to read more than three , and on the violet side of the region of absorption no measurements were possible .
In attempting to measure the dispersion the experimenter has to choose between a small number of bands read over a slightly wider range and a larger numl ) read over a small range .
In either case the errors of observation are relatively large .
Procedure.\mdash ; A weighed quantity of iodine was introduced into the refractometer tube which was evacuated and sealed off .
* The tube was then heated till the solid had all sublimed and the hands observed .
Refraction.\mdash ; The wave-length selected for the absolute determination was 6438 , and this was obtained from white light of a Nernst lamp by means of a fixed deviation spectroscope .
The volume of the refractometer tube was .
and the weight of iodine which it contained was00473 .
The best experiments gave for the value , and this is probably correct to 1 or 2 per cent. It agrees well with HURION'S value , which was probably for a longer wave-length than 6438 .
Dispersion.\mdash ; Assuming this value the following numbers were obtained for the refractivity in the red-orange , the number of bands read being for TABLE IV.\mdash ; Dispersion of gaseous Iodine . .
2180 , , 2140In another set of readings the Ilumber of read was only in the red , and the following readings were taken:\mdash ; 6708 , C438 , 6215 , 6180 , , 5100 , , 5000 .
1970 , 2100 , 2130 , 2130 , 2170 , 2250 , 2210 , 2160 , 2120 .
These numbers are , of course , of little individual value , but they show at least the order of magnitude of the variation of refractivity in .
through an absorption band .
The last set is interesting in showing the fall of index which seems to occur a little on the red side of the region of greatest absorption .
* The method is more fnlly desct.ibed in paper by one of us ( see ' Phil. Trans , vol. 204 , p. 323 , REFRACTION AND DISPERSION THE HALOGENS , HALOGEN ACII ) , ETC .
It was not considered worth while to spend further time in multiplying observations which could never command great confidence , owing to the fewness of the bands read .
We hope to return to this element , using the method of crossed prisms , which is more suitable than that of the interferometer .
HYDROCHLORIC ACID .
Previous DuLONG obtained for white light , and MASCART for the line .
The dispersion has never before been attempted .
Preparation.\mdash ; The gas was prepared by dropping sulphuric acid on pure sodium chloride .
After passing through two drying bulbs filled with sulphuric acid it was condensed in liquid air and allowed to boil off .
When the gas had flowed through the connecting tubes for 15 minutes so to displace the air , it was admitted to the refractometer and allowed to flow till the pressure was atmospheric .
The following table gives the experimental values found , reduced to C. and 760 mm. by the formula inlent , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 .

After passing through tubes containing red phosphorus and phosphorus pentoxide , it was condensed in liquid air , sometimes twice and sometimes one.e only .
In successful experiments the acid was obtained as a pure white solid and a colourless liquid .
After an experiment the gas was absorbed over a tube containing soda lime in vacuo .
Only those experiments in which the impurity was negligible were used for the determination of the index .
Procedure.\mdash ; The procedure was similar to that adopted for bromine , for , strange to say , the coefficients of expansion and compressibility have not been determined .
It was , therefore , necessary to supplement the of activily by measurements of density .

The degree of accuracy was not carried beyond one part in a thousand , since errors in reading the refractivity were not less than this amount .
The gas was weighed atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the room , which averaged C. , and the values were reduced to C. and 760 by the formula Three experiments gave , for the weight of a litre , on these assumptiolB , , and , the of which is The theoretical weight is ACID .
Previous NIASCABT found for the line .
The dispersion has not been attempted .
ration.\mdash ; The gas was prepared by slowly pure aqueous solution of MR. CLIyE CUTHBERTSON AND MAUDE RTSON ON THE the acid on phosphorus pentoxide and proceeding as in the case of hydrobromic acid .
The solid obtained on freezing was colourless , but the liquid was usually a pale pink , owing to a trace of dissolved iodine .
As the boiling point of HI is far below that of iodine the quantity of iodine subliming , at the boiling point of HI , from this mixture was negligible .
ests for impurity , similar to those in the case of HBr , were equally satisfactory .
\mdash ; In this case also measurements of refractivity had to be supplemented by those of density as this has not previously been determined carefully .
In three trustworthy experiments the following figures were obtained for the refractivity at the green mercury line : .
9237 , 9277 , 9260 .
Mean 9258 .
The mean is taken as the best value .
Disper.sion.\mdash ; From seven experiments the following values were obtained for the dispersion :\mdash ; TABLE VII.\mdash ; Dispersion of Hydriodic Acid .
Using SELLMEYER'S equation the refractivity can be expressed by the formula The calculated values are shown in column and the differences in column 4 .
Density of Hydriodic Acid.\mdash ; The density of this gas also has not been accurately measured .
Calculated in the same way as in the case of hydrobromic acid three experiments gave for ) weight of a litre , mean The theoretical weight is , taking and , and the weight of a litre of oxygen as REFRACTION AND ) ERSION OF rEAlI .
Previous determinations on the refractivity of water vapour are by DUFET as follows:\mdash ; No one appears to have attempted the dispersion .
Procedure.\mdash ; A weighed quantity of distilled water , sealed up in a thin capillary bube , was introduced into the refractometer tube , which was then evacuated and sealed off .
On breaking the capillary by a jerk the tube was filled with vapour .
After adjusting the tubes between the mirrors of the interferometer the centre of the tube containing the water was first cooled to a known temperature and then the tube was heated till the whole of the water present had evaporated .
To the number of the bands read was added a proportionate number for the vapour present at the initial temperature .
In order to eliminate the errors of ) other experiments were made in which ths ends of the tube were kept near the maximum temperature required ( about C. ) and the centre of the tube gradually cooled to the temperature of ice .
.\mdash ; Experiments were made with four charges of water .
The results are given below:\mdash ; Refractivity of STEAM .
It will be seen that the second charge yielded results considerably lower than the other three .
The cause of the discrepancy was found to be the unequal distribution of vapour between the main portion of the refractometer tube the small " " appendix\ldquo ; left when the side tube is sealed off .
the temperature of the ends is markedly higher than that of the middle ( as it was in this series ) , the error becomes considerable .
Neglecting this expsriment we take the mean of the other MR CLIVE CUTHBERTSON AND MAUDE CUTtlBERTSON ON THE three as the value for the reen mercury line .
The variations of these experiments indicate that this result is probably correct to 1 part in 500 .
Dispersion.\mdash ; Assuming this value the following table shows the values obtained from seven experiments with the largest charge of water , the number of bands read being about 380 for TABL VIII.\mdash ; Dispersion of Steam .

Previous Work.\mdash ; No previous work on the refractivity of ozone is recorded in the usual books of reference .
The difficulties are considerable .
It is impossible to prepare ozone even approximately pure , and if it were possible it would be inadvisable to do so , since the decomposition of the molecules during the time necessary to measure the refraction and dispersion would introduce fruitful sources of error .
Procedure.\mdash ; Of the two best methods of preparing the gas , electrolysis of a solution of sulphuric acid has produced the highest percentages of ozone , FISCHER and MASSENEZ* having obtained over 28 per cent. by weight .
But the objections to this method seemed to us to outweigh its advantages .
It was necessary that the gas used should be absolutely pure oxygen , for the smallest trace of moisture , air or hydrogen would introduce large errors ; and in the electrolytic process the gas is produced wet and is mixed with air in the connections .
For these reasons the method selected was that of ozonising by means of the silent discharge in a vessel of the type * ' Zeit .

17 used by BERTHELOT .
The average yield was 6 per cent. by volume , but on one or two occasions it reached 10 per cent. We failed to identify the causes which produced these higher yields , and were unable to repeat them , but succeeded in obtaining between 5 and 7 per cent. with fair regularity .
Methods.\mdash ; As in the case of other gases , the work was divided into two parts ( 1 ) the determination of the refractivity for a single wave-length ( the green mercury line ) , and ( 2 ) the measurement of the dispersion in the visible spectrum relatively to this value .
For the measurement of the refractivity two methods were employed .
In the first of these the quantity of ozone present was estimated by destroying the ozone by heat , and measuring the increase of the gas in volume .
In the second , the ozone was estimated chemically by bubbling the mixture of gases through a solution of potassium iodide , and titrating with thiosulphate of soda .
As the results of the enquiry were remarkable the following details may be of interest :\mdash ; Dry oxygen , prepared by heat.ing permanganate of potash , and stored in a gas holder over mercury , was led through an ozoniser into the interferometer tube , which was previously evacuated .
The interference bands which crossed the field were counted till atmospheric pressure was reached .
The pressure was then read by connecting the apparatus with a mercury manometer filled with oxygen and separated from the ozonised gas by a long capillary tube .
The temperature of the water bath was observed and the tap which led to the refractometer tube turned off Having again evacuated the connections the gas in the refractometer tube was allowed to flow slowly into the pump , passing through a spiral of fused silica heated to redness , which effectually destroyed the ozone .
From the pump it was transferred to another gas holder over mercury and thence again allowed to flow into the refractometer tube , where its temperature and pressure were again measured .
If is the volume of the ozonised , and that of the deozonised oxygen , the percentage of ozone is given by .
In the present case was about 150 , so that if the total increase of volume is 6 .
In order to determine the value of the refractivity to 1 per cent. it is therefore necessary that the total error in pumping the gas round the cycle should not exceed06 .
In practice this accuracy was not quite attained .
It was necessary to grease stopcocks with a mixture of pure paraffin and vaseline , which will not hold a vacuum indefinitely ; while , in order to destroy the ozone , the gas had to be pumped through a spiral 12 inches long of fine capillary bore , which made it difficult to evacuate the last traces from the connections .
It was also necessary to know the refractivity of the oxygen very accurately , since an error in this figure is multiplied in the ratio of .
After a sufficient number of trials had been made to prove that our oxygen was approximately pure , its refractivity was assumed to be that previously determined by u * C. and M. CUTHIIERTSON , ' Roy .

Second method .
To check these results a second set of experiments was made , in which the quantity of ozone was estimated by chemical tests .
This method was found to give more concordant figures .
TABLE X.\mdash ; Refractivity of pure Ozone .
( Second Method .
) The results obtained by the two methods are tolerably concordant , and would be even better if the third experiment were omitted .
Their mean is , but having regard to the smallness of the proportion of ozone present it would be unsafe to rely on this number beyond the second significant figure , and we therefore conclude that the refractive index of pure ozone for the mercury green line is Comparison with the Refractive Index of Oxygen.\mdash ; It will be observed that this result is remarkable .
The refractivity of oxygen is 0002717 , and if the third atom of oxygen on joining the molecule had the same refractive effect as in the normal gas we should expect a refractivity of The experimental value 520 is very largely in excess of this , and indicates the existence of interesting peculiarities in the molecule which may probably be ascribed to the linkage .
Dispersion of Ozone.\mdash ; Nine experiments made on the dispersion of mixtures of ozone and oxygen .
In each of these the refractive index of the mixture for the green mercury line was separately determined , and the other seven refractivities were calculated with reference to it from the observations as previously described .
The first experiment , being a trial , is omitted , and the refractivity of ozone calculated from the remaining eight as follows:\mdash ; TABLE XI.\mdash ; Dispersion of Mixtures of Ozone and Oxygen .
Adding together all the values of the refractivities for each wave-length separately , and dividing by the number of experiments , we obtain the refractivities for the average mixture of ozone and oxygen , which are given as " " means Assuming the percentage of ozone in this mixture is found as follows:\mdash ; , whence To find the refractivities for the other seven wave-lengths we have only to use this value and the refractivity for the corresponding wave-length of oxygen which we take from our previous determinations , p. 2 .
Thus The numbers obtained in this way are shown in the next line .
It is at once noticeable that the dispersive power of ozone is much greater than that of oxygen .
And here again , as in the case of chlorine , we find that the curvature of the experimental curve is greater than that calculated .
Using and we btain the formula , whence we find whereas the experimental value is 52000 .
As in the case of chlorine , the inference is that a second term is required .

ious Determinations .
Previous determinations of the refractivity of ammonia are as follows:\mdash ; It would occupy too much space to analyse the causes of these discrepancies , which are chiefly due to differences in the standard conditions assulned and in the coefficients of thermal expansion and compressibility adopted .
But the figures in the last column give approximately the figures corrected for the theoretical density .

After passing over red hot lime and cold dry lime it was condensed at C. and allowed to boil off , the middle fraction being collected .

Using SELLMEYER'S formula the results are expressed by NITROUS OXIDE .
Previous Work.\mdash ; DUFET gives MASCART'S gas was prepared from ammonium nitrate and contained 10 per cent. of impurity .
The gas we used was obtained from two sources : ( 1 ) The commercial gas , obtained in cylinders , condensed and fi.actionated at the temperature of liquid air , and ( 2 ) gas prepared by the action of ammonium nitrite on hydroxylamine hydrosulphate .
It was bubbled through strong potash and dried with sulphuric acid and phosphorus pentoxide .
Refractir Index.\mdash ; Three sets of experiments on different samples gave In reducing these experiments the coefficient of thermal expansion used was 00371 .
The purity of the gas was tested by absorption in an excess of water boiled in vacuo .
The bubble of gas left unabsorbed was not so great as 1/ 2000 of the whole ; and even this was probably due to the error of the test experiment , which is not very easy .
But as traces of air were probably present we think 5100 a more trustworthy value than the exact experimental mean , and probably correct to 1/ 500 at least .

.\mdash ; In the determination of the refractivities for the green mercury line the principal source of error is the impurity of the gas , and , in the case of vapours which absorb light , such as the halogens and sulphur , the limitation of the number of bands which can be read before the light fails .
It will be seen that experiments of a series generally agreed to 1 part in 500 , and the mean is probably within 1 in a 1000 of the truth .
In iodine and ozone , however , the errors may amount to 1 or 2 per cent. Dispersion .
will be observed that the values of the refractivities for the other seven wave-lengths are relative to that found for the green mercury line .
The degree of accuracy attainable depends on the number of bands read the dispersive power of the gas .
As an example take nitric oxide .
Here The dispersive power is and if 400 green bands are counted , the number which represents the effect of dispersion is bands .
We consider that 1/ 15 of a band can be read ; so that the value of the dispersive power should be correct to 1 part in 95 .
It may be assumed that by determining the constants from eight independent values of the refractivity instead of two the accuracy is at least doubled , and the error should not exceed 1/ 200 of the effect itself .
This claim is supported by the experimental results .
Thus , in the six experiments from which the dispersion of HC1 was determined , the values of were 816 , 815 , 813 , 818 , 805 .
In eight experiments on HBr they were 1370 , 1388 , 139.3 , 1.356 , 1372 , 1376 , 1368 , 1363 .
TION OF THE CONSTANTS .
The calculation of the constants and of the formula by the method of least squares is very laborious if carried out in the ordinary manner .
The following modification was , therefore , adopted .
Using subscripts to denote the eight refractive indices and their frequencies we have eight equations of the form VOL. CCXIII.\mdash ; A. Subtracting the from the equation , we obtain four equations similar to Let be expressed by , and by , and similarly for the other three equations .
Then it can be shown that , applying the method ofleast squares , , and hence .
