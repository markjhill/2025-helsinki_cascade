A paper was read , entitled , " Onthe Male Organs of some of the Cartilaginous Fishes .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. , Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals .
In this paper , which is wholly occupied with anatomical details , the author refers to his paper on the Torpedo , which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1834 ; and also to Miiller 's work " De Ghindularum secernentium structura penitiori , " whose descriptions and views are not in accordance with those given in that paper .
In the present memoir he adduces evidence of the ac ?
curacy of his former statement , chiefly founded on microscopical observations , and offers some conjectures respecting the functions of several organs found in cartilaginous fishes ; but does not pretend to attach undue importance to his speculations .
