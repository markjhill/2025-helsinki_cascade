spiratory Organs of Animals , and the preservation of independent Temperatures .
" By George Macilwain , Esq. , Consulting Surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary .
Communicated by Wiliiam Lawrence , Esq. , F.R.S. The author expresses his dissent from the prevailing opinion that the temperature maintained by animals above the surrounding medium is proportionate to the extent of their respiration ; and adduces many instances among different classes of animals in which he can trace no such correspondence , and others , on the contrary , where increased powers of respiration appear to diminish instead of raising the animal temperature .
Hence the author is disposed to regard respiration as a refrigerating rather than a heating process .
