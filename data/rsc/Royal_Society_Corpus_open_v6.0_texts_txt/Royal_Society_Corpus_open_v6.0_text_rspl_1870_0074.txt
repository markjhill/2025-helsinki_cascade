General Sir EDWARD SABINE , K.C.B. , President , in the Chair .
Pursuant to notice given at the last Meeting , Capt. Douglas Galton proposed and Prof. Huxley seconded the Right Hon. Robert Lowe , M.P. , for election and immediate ballot .
The ballot having been taken , Mr. Lowe was declared duly elected .
The following communications were read :\#151 ; I. " On the Temperature of the Interior of the Earth , as indicated by Observations made during the Construction of the Great Tunnel through the Alps .
" By D. T. Ansted , M.A. , P.R.S. , Eor .
Sec. G.S. Received April 6 , 1871 .
It had been arranged from the commencement of the Alpine tunnel ( often , though incorrectly , called the Mont-Cenis tunnel ) that observations should be taken at intervals of about one kilometre ( 3281 feet ) from both the French and Italian ends , with a view to determine as nearly as possible the law of increment ; and before the completion of the work it had become evident that the ordinary estimate of increased temperature due to the depth below the surface of the earth would by no means apply to this particular case .
The actual length of the tunnel being 40,140 feet , and the culminating point of the mountain being 5280 feet vertically above a point 21,156 feet from the Italian end , there was evidently scope for a number of valuable observations .
The result also might be expected to show the influence of marked irregularities in the contour of the mountains , and also of changes in the nature of the rock .
The experiments and observations were entrusted to the resident engineers at each end of the tunnel , Signor Borelli undertaking them from the Italian side .
It does not appear that any special construction of thermometer was supplied , or that the subject greatly interested the resident engineers .
Careful observations were made and duly recorded by Signor Borelli , but the attempt failed in the hands of his colleague at the other end .
Thus one great source of value was lost , and the observations at equal distances from both ends cannot be compared .
The rocks through which the tunnel has been driven consist to a very large extent of a peculiar calcareous schist , partly talcose , and containing many bands and strings of quartz .
The whole of the Italian end is through rock of this kind , and it was reached at about 11,000 feet from the entrance from the French side .
The rocks on the French side were at first very different , including nearly 7000 feet of a peculiar sandstone with indications of anthracite , about 1000 feet of very hard quartzite , and 3000 feet of gypsum , limestone , and calcareous schist , a large proportion being gypsum .
It would have been in the highest degree desirable to have been able to compare observations of temperature made at similar depths in different VOL. XIX .
2 Q 482 Mr. D. T. Ansted on the Earth 's interior [ May 25 , kinds of rock .
All the rocks may be regarded as metamorphic ; they are , however , stratified , dipping at an angle of 50 ' , or thereabouts , to the northwest , and corresponding in age to the secondary rocks of England , from the Oxford clay to the Rhsetie inclusive .
There was very little water met with in tunnelling .
The observations made by Signor Borelli have been recently made public in a memoir by Signor F. Giordano , that appeared in the Bulletin of the * R. Comitato Geologico d'ltalia ' ( No. 1 , 2 , Jan. and Feb. 1871 ) ; and in this communication the general subject is discussed .
The following account , though not a translation of M. Giordano 's memoir , derives most of its facts from the statements there made .
The geological notes and some of the conclusions , however , result from the author 's personal observations , assisted by the account published last year by Professor Sismonda , and a memoir that appeared also last year in the f Comptes Rendus , ' written by M. Elie de Beaumont .
The temperature observations include the temperature of the air , of the water issuing in springs ( always small ) met with in the progress of the works , and of the rock .
To obtain the latter , borings were made either in the walls of the tunnel or in the headings in advance of the tunnel , and generally to a distance of 7 to 10 feet .
The excavation of the complete tunnel from the Italian end was suspended when 6 kilometres had been completed ( about 20,000 feet , or less than halfway ) ; but as the excavation from this end had been much more rapid than from the other , the work was continued by a small heading to a further distance of about 3000 feet , when the opening was made to the work on the French side .
Thus several of the observations were made by borings into the wall of the heading , and at a long distance from the completed tunnel and from good ventilation .
No observations whatever are recorded from the French side of the tunnel , either during the work or at the time of meeting .
We are informed , however , that a rush of air took place at the moment of the last blast , driving the smoke rapidly towards the Italian end .
It should be mentioned that the northern , or French end , is only 1160m(3806 feet ) above the sea , whereas the Italian end is 1292m,50 ( 4241 feet ) , showing a difference of level of 435 feet .
Thus the tunnel would seem to act as a chimney , and it is not unlikely that a natural ventilating-current may be established .
On the morning of the 26th of December , 1870 , the day when the communication was made , the external temperature in the Bardonneclie valley was considerably below the freezing-point , but within the mouth of the tunnel several degrees above .
On this day , besides the temperature of the rock , that of the small springs near the end and that of the air were recorded ; but the number of men employed , the frequent blasts , and the active works going on must have had a marked influence on the latter , especially as for 3300 feet the excavation of the tunnel had been stopped and only a heading pushed on in advance .
During the continuance of the 1871 .
] as indicated by the Alpine-Tunnel .
483 work , the smoke and foul air were drawn out of the tunnel by a ventilator near the roof .

Initial temperature probably rather higher .
Depth in feet .
It thus appears that the observed difference of temperature of the rock between the distance of 1640 feet from the entrance and the distance of 21,156 feet is 27'*5 F. The difference of depth beneath the surface in that distance is about 4600 feet .
It is thought possible that the real difference may be somewhat less , as the increased temperature of the air in the heading , owing to the number of men employed and the frequent blasting , may have influenced the result in some measure ; and it is perhaps safer to estimate the total increment at something less than 2 6| ' F. In the absence of observations that can be absolutely depended on , we may perhaps assume the true maximum temperature of the rock to be 84 ' .
The part of the tunnel having this permanent temperature is 1295 " or 4250 feet above the sea , and the corresponding point of the surface is 9530 feet above the sea , showing a difference of 5280 feet .
A careful esti2 q 2 484 Mr. D.T. Ansted on the Earth 's interior [ May 25 , mate of the distribution of the mountain mass seems to show that this is somewhat in excess of the true difference , and that if the slope were perfectly even the difference would be reduced to about 5080 feet .
It is necessary now to estimate as nearly as possible the mean annual temperature of the air at the surface , and the depth and temperature of the stratum of invariable temperature within the earth .
None of these has as yet been determined by experiment ; but it is found generally that the stratum of invariable temperature is nearly 2 ' F. warmer than the mean temperature of the air at the surface , and that the mean temperature of the air decreases in ascending to the higher parts of the atmosphere at the rate of 1 ' F. in 317 feet .
As , however , the mean temperature of the air at the mouth of the tunnel is not known by observation , we must take Turin as the nearest point of departure , this city being 820 feet above the sea , and its mean annual temperature 54'*5 F. The difference of level between Turin and the mountain-summit being 8710 feet , this , divided by 317 , gives 27'*5 as the amount to be deducted from 54'*5 .
Thus the calculated mean annual temperature would be 27''5 F. ; adding to this 2 ' , we have the calculated temperature of the stratum of invariable temperature 29'-5 F. As some check on this estimate , it may be worth while to refer to a somewhat analogous case determined by observation by Dolfuss-Ausset , in 1865-66 , on the mountain of St. Theodule and in the valleys of Aosta and the Yallais .
In this case the mean temperature of the air was found to be _ 5'*10 C. ( 22'-8 F. ) at the height of 3333m ( 10,936 feet ) .
The excess of elevation of this summit above the crest of the Alps over the tunnel being 1406 feet , the latter should be ( at the rate of 1 ' F. per 317 feet ) 4'*5 F. warmer , or have a temperature of 270,3 F. , a result nearly in accordance with the other calculation .
Estimated in this way , the difference of temperature between the mean temperature of the air on the assumed surface above the central point of the tunnel would be ( 84'\#151 ; 270,5= ) 56'*5 F. , and the rate of increment ( the / 5080 \ i* difference of level being 5080 feet ) 1 ' in ( .^ 90 feet nearly ; or if we assume the stratum of invariable temperature to be 80 feet below the surface , the rate will be 1 ' in ( " 5475 \#151 ; J91 feet , showing , no doubt , a very considerable difference when compared with most other observations made in Europe and elsewhere at various levels , but not altogether unparalleled in special cases .
It is , of course , possible that the difference may be^ due to the topographical conditions and geological structure of the earth s crust under the crest of a great mountain-chain of comparatively recent elevation .
But there is an important fact to be observed not alluded to by Signor Giordano , but bearing very strongly on the general question of the rate of increment .
The slope of the Alps in this part of the range above the tunnel is nearly regular on the French side , but very sudden at rs towards Italy , after which there is a wide step or terrace , for a distance o 1871 ] .
as indicated by the Alpine-Tunnel .
485 about two miles .
It results that the depth from the summit of the ridge to the tunnel being 5280 feet , the depth from the surface to the tunnel at the Torrent of Merdovine , where the step or terrace commences , and which is 8240 feet in horizontal distance from the summit , is only 1700 feet , showing a diminution of 3580 feet of elevation in 8240 feet of distance , or , allowing for a sudden rise near the summit , a slope of 1 in 2\#163 ; , or an angle of 21 ' .
On the other hand , the depth from the surface to the tunnel between the Torrent of Merdovine and a point about 3000 feet from the entrance ( a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet ) shows hardly any appreciable difference , varying only a few hundred feet from one point in the profile to another .
Beyond this point there is another rapid descent to the valley of Bardonneche , where the mouth of the tunnel is situated .
Temperature observations were taken ( l ) at a point under the summit of the crest , ( 2 ) at a point under the Torrent of Merdovine , and ( 3 ) under the last point mentioned , 3000 feet from the entrance .
These show respectively 85'* 1 F. , 74'*5 F. , and 62'*6 F. In each case the observations were made from borings , and they may all be regarded as good and fairly to be compared with each other .
Making the corrections already explained , the result would be , first , that borings of 1700 feet made in different parts of the terrace below the steep mountain face for a breadth of about two miles might show a rate varying from 1 ' of increase of temperature in 43 feet of depth to 1 ' in 63 feet ; whilst on the steep slope the rate at the lowest part of the slope being 1 ' in 63 feet , the rate at the summit is 1 ' in 91 feet , the horizontal distance between the two places of observation being 8240 feet , or about a mile and a half .
In all these cases there is no difference in the nature of the rock .
There are two intermediate observations , numbered ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in the Table , which correspond to depths below the surface of 3000 and 4500 feet respectively .
Estimated as before , the rate of increment is in the former case 1 ' in 65 feet , in the latter 1 ' in 84 feet .
One observation ( No. 14 ) was made 1800 feet beyond the centre of the tunnel towards the north , at a depth which may be fairly estimated at 4750 feet .
The temperature observed was 80o,6 F. , which , reduced as before , shows a rate equivalent to 1 ' in 93*4 feet .

[ May 25 , The absence of observations from the French side appears more and more unfortunate as we advance in the investigation , and renders the general result by no means so satisfactory as it would otherwise be .
It would appear , indeed , that distance from the surface alone is not by any means the only cause of increased temperature in the case of a lofty mountain mass ; but how far this is due to imperfect observation , the want of properly sheltered instruments , and local causes connected with the progress of the works , it is not easy to say .
There may also , no doubt , be some difference arising from the imperfect modes of estimating the mean annual temperature and the temperature and depth of the stratum of permanent temperature .
But although all these are subject to a certain amount of correction , there is enough general accordance of the observations to show that the conclusions indicated must be accepted .
Considering that we are in the heart of the great mountain axis of Europe , the conditions are simple and favourable .
There is little or no permanent snow or ice on either side , and no glaciers : one slope ( that to the south ) is at first rapid , and then in steps ; the other slope is very regular .
The tunnel is of great length , and most parts of it of enormous depths below the surface , compared with any other depths that have been reached ; and it has been mentioned already that the geological conditions are unusually simple , especially in the southern end of the tunnel , to which all the observations are confined , No case has ever before occurred in which there was so much opportunity of making systematic and trustworthy observations on the subject of the internal temperature of the earth ; but as it is not unlikely that the successful completion of the tunnel under the Mont Frejus may be followed by other similar undertakings in other parts of the Alps , the experience here gained may at any rate be turned to account to secure better and more systematic work elsewhere .
Note.\#151 ; Since the above memoir was written , the author has been in correspondence with Prof. Sismonda of Turin , and has obtained permission to repeat the observations recorded , to make corresponding observations in the bore-holes at the French end of the tunnel , and to obtain observations of the temperature at the surface .
These observations will be made with instruments provided by the British Association Committee for investigating the rate of increase of underground temperature , and will be conducted by the author , who hopes to visit the tunnel during the present summer .
