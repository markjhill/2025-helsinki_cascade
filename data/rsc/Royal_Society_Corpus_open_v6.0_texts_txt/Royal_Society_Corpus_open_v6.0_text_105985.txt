Observations on the Bill of Mortality , in Chester , for the Year 1772 .
By Doctor Haygarth .
A Faithful and minute register of mortality , and of the various diseases most fatal to mankind , at different ages , must evidently be of the most important consequence , to the politician , the philosopher , and the physician , in their several endeavours to relieve the miseries , and promote the happiness of human nature .
Red , Nov. 18 , 1772 .
A writer , of distinguished abilities in political arithmetic , has offered many arguments , which give too much cause to apprehend , that England , in about 70 years , has lost near a quarter of her people .
Accurate registers of mortality , with other collateral inquiries , can , with most certainty , confirm or confute this opinion , and determine a question , of the most striking importance to our very existence as a nation .
The doctrine of annuities for widows , and other persons in old age , the value of reversionary payments , and of assurances on lives , and other important questions in civil society , can only be determined by faithful registers , showing the duraK 2 tion tion of human life , in various situations of town and country .
The slightest survey , of the following Tables , will manifesty show , how erroneous and unjust every calculation , relating to this subject , must be , drawn from the London bills , or perhaps those of most other considerable towns , and applied to the inhabitants of this city .
Chester is healthy to an uncommon degree , when compared with towns of the same size .
Various circumstances , which contribute to render this place so remarkably salubrious , might be pointed out ; but it can here be only observed , in general , that this salutary effect may , with great probability , be chiefly attributed to the dry situation , clear air , pure water , and general temperance of the people .
In August 1772 , the inhabitants of St. Michael 's , one of the nine parishes into which Chester is divided , and situated in the very center of the city , were numbered with great accuracy : in this parish were 151 families , 127 houses , 618 inhabitants , 246 males , 372 females , 166 married , 41 widows , 21 widowers , and 137 children under 15 years old .
Hence the number of persons , never married above 15 , is 253 .
From this account also it appears , that near 4 5/ 6 persons dwell in each house ; that the proportion , of females to males , is as 62 to 41 , or nearly as 3 to 2 ; that the widows are to the widowers nearly as 2 to 1 ; that the number married is little more than one quarter of the inhabitants : the common proportion of married people is about one third of the whole .
The number of christenings , at St. Michael 's , for the last ten years , are 147 , or 14,7 yearly ; the burials , during the same period , are 127 , or 12,7 yearly .
Hence the proportion of annual births to inhabitants is nearly as 1 to 42 , and burials nearly as 1 to 48 2/ 3 .
During 1772 , only nine persons died in this parish ; hence the proportion of deaths to the living , this year , is less than 1 in 68 .
These facts must appear most astonishing to any one , who reflects , that in the largest towns , such as London , 1 in 20 3/ 4 dies annually ; and , that in towns of a moderate size , as Leeds , 1 in 21 2/ 5 ; that in Northampton and Shrewsbury , either of them less than Chester , 1 in 26 2/ 5 dies yearly .
These facts , relating to this parish , are true , beyond a possibility of doubt ; and yet they are so very extraordinary , that one cannot , without farther enquiries , apply to the whole town , by analogy , the observations which were made upon only a small proportion of the inhabitants .
However no peculiarity of air , water , or any other obvious circumstance , can be supposed , to render this parish more healthy than the rest of the town .
How far these facts have been accidental , the following , and other collateral enquiries , will discover .
For the last eight years , preceding 1772 , there have been 385 births , and 375 deaths annually in Chester .
The number of deaths this year , excluding those who were killed by the dreadful explosion of gunpowder , is 379 ; so that , probably , the conclusions drawn from the following Tables , which were executed with great care and fidelity , will not be liable to any considerable errors ; and such errors , by continuing this account for a period of years , will most effectually be corrected .
The following observations are offered as a small specimen of the conclusions , that may then , with more certainty , be deduced from such a register of mortality .
From the following bills , which distinguish the ages at which the inhabitants die , it appears , as far as one year 's observation may be trusted , that , taking the whole town , 1 in 31 , 1 dies annually .
This proportion , of deaths to the living , is probably too high , because the births , upon an average , exceed the burials ; a fact , which affords another proof , that the place is uncommonly healthy .
Other facts amply confirm this observation .
Half the inhabitants , born in London , die under 2 years and three-quarters old ; in Vienna , under 2 ; in Manchester , under 5 ; in Norwich , under 5 ; in Northampton , under 10 ; in Chester , this year , above half who died were 20 years old .
Of all the children born in this city , 1 in 5 1/ 3 lives to above 70 , and 1 in 15 3/ 4 attains 80 years of age ; whereas in Northampton , only 1 in 21 2/ 3 ; in Norwich , 1 in 27 ; and in London , 1 in 40 lives till 80 .
In the Hotel-Dieu , a large hospital in Paris , above 1 in 5 dies , of all that are admitted ; in St. Thomas 's and St. Bartholomew 's , in London , 1 in 13 ; in the Chester infirmary , since its first institution in 1755 , 'till 1772 inclusive , only 1 in 25 1/ 6 .
But Table IV , will , at one view , show , in the most satisfactory manner , the comparative state of health , between this and some other towns of different magnitudes .
It is curious to compare , by this table , in the early part of life , the probability that the inhabitants in Chester have , to live longer than in Northampton .
Norwich , and especially much longer than in London .
But when they have arrived to 70 years old , the chance of living , at all the places , is nearly equal .
It is a matter of curiosity , to observe how much longer women live than men .
This fact is well established , by former observations on this subject , and is confirmed by the following register ( Table I. ) .
During the last year 12 widowers have died , and 53 widows ; that is above four times the number .
Between 80 and 90 years old , 2 men and 18 women have died ; that is nine times as many .
Above 90 years old , 4 have died , and all women To know at what period of life each disease is most fatal to mankind , is manifestly a sort of intelligence the most important , both to the patient and the physician ; and though an enquiry , of this nature , may be attended with considerable difficulties , yet the advantage of such information is so obvious to all , it seems wonderful , that no attempt has been made , to execute a plan so generally beneficial to mankind .
The Table of diseases ( No. II .
) has been compiled with all possible accuracy .
At the beginning of the year was printed a catalogue , with a clear and concise description of the diseases most fatal in this place .
The faculty , in general , have sent written certificates , or given verbal information , to the clerks of each parish , of what diseases the patients died .
The most considerable errors , in this table , will be among the diseases of children , who are not able to describe their complaints ; and concerning whose disorders medical advice is more rarely desired .
The article of Convulsions is particularly to be suspected ; for when an infant is seized with a fever , or almost any other disorder , if there be any distortion of features , expressing pain , or any irregular motion of the eyes , nurses always denominate the disease , inward convulsions .
Consumption is another term , which the English are inclined to apply to many disorders , besides the disease of the lungs , to which medical people give that peculiar name .
In this Table , particular care has been taken , to distinguish the weakness of Infancy , and decay of old age , which are generally confounded with pulmonary consumptions .
And to prevent every error of this kind , with all possible accuracy , strict injunctions were given , that no disorder , unless attended with a cough , should be called consumption .
Notwithstanding this care to separate , as far as prejudice would allow , every other disease from consumptions , it is matter of astonishment to observe , that , between the ages of 10 and 50 , more people die of consumptions , than of all other diseases : this is the period of life , when every faculty , and every enjoyment , both of body and mind , are in their most vigorous perfection .
It becomes therefore an enquiry , of the most striking consequence to society , to discover the cause , in order to prevent the fatality , of a disease , which makes such dreadful havoc among mankind .
The Scrophula has been suspected as the most general cause of consumptions ; but this disease is less common in Chester than in most other places .
Would the limits of this paper admit of such a discussion , very strong evidence could be produced , that the most frequent and most fatal cause of consumptions , in this town and neighbourhood , is catching cold , which occasions a cough , that is entirely neglected for many weeks or months , and is never supposed to be dangerous , 'till it becomes desperate .
There are no marshes so near this city , as to insect the air : hence we have no dysenteries , and very few intermitting or remitting fevers , unless a few faint irregular paroxysms may be supposed to require that denomination .
This fact may be brought in evidence , to support the observation , that marshy effluvia are the cause of those diseases ; an opinion lately controverted by a very ingenious writer .
For more than 30 years past , the miliary fever has been supposed endemic in this city and neighbourhood ; but very probable evidence has been produced , by the most judicious physicians , that this eruption is very rarely , or never , critical and salutary , but that it is generally , or always , fabricated by close warm rooms , too many bed-cloaths , hot medicines and diet .
If this be universally true , it is much to be wished , that the miliary fever may be entirely banished from the catalogue of diseases .
It must give singular pleasure , to every benevolent heart , and well-wisher to this place , to find only one fatal miliary fever in the register of this year .
May not this circumstance , with great probability , be attributed to the method , lately adopted , of treating fevers , by admitting fresh air into sick chambers , and administering such regimen and remedies , as are cooling , and check putrefaction ?
It is observable , ( Table III .
) that the healthiest months of this year , were July and August ; and that the most sickly was November ; and that Autumn and Winter , compared with the Spring and Summer quarters , were more fatal , nearly in the proportion of three to two .
That Summer is less fatal than Winter , is a fact , confirmed by various observations , made in different places both of town and country .
A most ingenious philosopher , by a train of experiments , planned with amazing sagacity , among a great variety of curious and useful discoveries , has proved , in a very satisfactory manner , that air , rendered noxious by the breath of animals , or by putrefaction , is restored , by vegetables growing in it , to a state fit for respiration , and the support of animal life .
Hence is it not probable , that vegetation , among other causes , contributes to render Spring and Summer so remarkably more healthy , than the rest of the year .
The only disease , that was generally epidemic this year , was the chincough , which began about August , and , during the remainder of 1772 , infected a very large proportion of the children of the whole town ; about the end of the year , the disorder almost entirely ceased .
In Liverpool , the chincough became epidemic in May , and declined in November .
From the Table of diseases it appears , that most of the children , who died of this disorder , were under two years of age .
Vomits of emetic tartar were of signal service , during this epidemic , in mitigating both the cough and fever .
When we reflect , that the weakest infants puke up their food without much difficulty or fatigue , that nature takes this method so frequently of relieving them , and that emetic tartar , when dissolved in water , imparts to it no sensible taste , so that there could be no difficulty in giving it , there is a high degree of probability , that this remedy might have saved many more lives , if it had been more generally administered to children , in early infancy .
In the Table of diseases ( No. II .
) the technical are added to the vulgar names , and the arrangement of a justly celebrated professor is adopted , in order to convey more distinct ideas to the faculty , and to place disorders of a similar nature nearest each other , for their mutual illustration .
