" Note on the Electrodeposition of Alloys and on the Electromotive Forces of Metals in Cyanide Solutions .

It is known that the electrodeposition of such alloys as brass , bronze , and German silver is not practicable from mixed solutions of fbe sulphates or chlorides of the constituent metals , but can be accomplished by using cyanide solutions or neutral solutions containing cyanide of potassium in excess , thereby apparently departing from the law of Berzelius that out of a solution of mixed metals the least electropositive metal is deposited first .
To ascertain the cause of these facts the author has investigated-\#151 ; ( a. ) The electromotive forces of a number of metals in aqueous solutions of cyanide of potassium .

( d. ) The electromotive forces of zinc and copper in a " brassing " solution consisting of the mixed cyanides of zinc and copper , having excess of cyanide of potassium present , and their variation at different temperatures .
It is found that the effect of higher concentration of the cyanide solutions is invariably to increase the electromotive force of copper more than it increases that of zinc .
In a cold dilute solution of cyanide of potassium the electromotive force of zinc against carbon is 1T58 volt , while that of copper against .carbon is 0*948 volt , or zinc is 0*210 volt higher than copper .
In a boiling saturated solution of cyanide of potassium , the electromotive force of zinc against carbon is 0*768 volt , and that of copper ..against carbon is 1*300 volt ; or copper is 0*532 volt higher than zinc .
It is therefore possible to construct a voltaic battery containing one metal only , namely copper , and one electrolyte only , namely an aqueous solution of cyanide of potassium , kept hot at the anode and cold at the cathode of the cell .

The neutral temperature for a solution of given concentration is lowered by adding cyanide of potassium , and is raised by adding ammonia .
The neutral point , however , is not well defined , the behaviour of copper being very uncertain ; in general the electromotive force of clean copper in a cyanide solution rises , in some cases as much as 0'06 volt , in a few seconds after immersion , but is rapidly though temporarily lowered on agitation .

] The Fructification of the Carboniferous Catamites .
389 Since the degree of concentration of the solution greatly affects the electromotive force of the metal , and since in the act of deposition of a metal from its solution the concentration of the liquid around the cathode is reduced , owing to slowness of diffusion , it follows that in electrodeposition the counter electromotive force at the cathode will vary with the rate at which metal is being deposited , and will , therefore , vary with the current-density employed .
And since , moreover , the variations in electromotive force due to differences of concentration are greater for copper than for zinc , it follows that in the deposition of brass from a mixed solution of cyanides of a medium concentration in which zinc is slightly more electropositive than copper , there will be a certain density of current with which the metals will be deposited in nearly equal quantities , whilst for weaker current-densities the less electropositive metal will be deposited in excess , and for stronger current-densities the more electropositive metal will be deposited in excess .
Hence to variations in the concentration of the electrolyte near the cathode are due the departures , observed with all currents except weak ones , from the law that out of a solution of mixed metals the least electropositive is deposited first .

" On the true Fructification of the Carboniferous Cala-mites .

( Abstract .
) The true systematic position of the Carboniferous Calamites has long been a debateable subject , owing to the lack of satisfactory evidence respecting the character of their fructification .
Some years ago , Mr. Carruthers and the late Mr. Binney expressed their conviction that Calamostachys Binneyana stood in that relationship to Calamites , a conclusion which the author was unable to accept ; but in 1869 he obtained a fragment of a new Cryptogamic fruit , of which he published an account in the ' Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester .
' The central axis of this Strobilus presented so many details of structure hitherto seen only in Calamites as convinced the author that it was the true fructification of these plants .
Many years elapsed before a second example of this interesting fruit was discovered , but seven or eight specimens of it recently found in a nodule from near Oldham , have come into the author 's possession ; these examples are in a sufficiently excellent state of
