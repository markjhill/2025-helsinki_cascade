Effects of Temperature on [ May 24 alumina in being a sesquioxide , but is at once distinguished as it does not afford an alum-like double sulphate as do alumina and its homo-logues , and has comparatively little in common with that group , save the tendency to form highly basic salts .
Mlson and Pettersson* admitting this , maintain that beryllium is a leading member of another .group of triads , which includes the rare earth-metals scandium , yttrium , lanthanum , didymium , terbium , erbium , \amp ; c. The recent spectroscopic evidence above referred to is opposed to this contention , us the spectrum of beryllium is stated to be wholly unlike the spectra* afforded by the rare earth-metals with which it is classed in the memoir .above cited .
If , then , beryllium does not find a place in the two known families of metallic triads , or pseudo-triads , it must stand alone ; and in any case as a triad it is outside Mendeleef 's classification .
But if the atomic weight of beryllium be 9'2 , according to my result , the metal is a diad and the symbol for its oxide is BeO .
It is , therefore , the first i member of Mendeleef s second series of elements .
This position I is quite in accordance with the spectroscopic evidence obtained by Professor Hartley , from which he concludes that " beryllium is the first !
member of a diad series of elements , of which in all probability calcium , strontium , and barium are homologues .

" The Effects of Temperature on the Electromotive Force and Resistance of Batteries .

" By William Henry Preece , F.R.S. Received May 21 , 1883 .
In the discussion on my previous paper read on February 22 , 1883 , it was suggested that I should continue the observations on the influence of temperature to the case of secondary batteries .
I am indebted to Mr. Tribe for one of his cells made so as to fit my apparatus , and charged at different times with solutions of various degrees of saturation .
The negative element of this cell consisted of pure peroxide of lead in the form of a plate 4 inches square carried in a grooved frame , from one end of which projected the necessary conductor .
This element \#166 ; was placed between two plates of finely divided lead likewise 4 inches square .
These were joined together , and formed the positive element of the cell .
Each half of the positive plate was about a quarter of an inch distant from the negative , and all three plates were encased in a iihin specially prepared fabric .
The elements were contained in a leaden case , and the liquid was sulphuric acid of the strengths given in the various experiments .
This cell was placed inside the cylindrical .copper vessel used in the previous experiments , and precisely the .same method of observation was adopted .
The results are given in * " Proc. Roy .

The different results are for different degrees of saturation .
-It i is evident from an inspection of those tables and diagrams , that the influence of heat on secondary cells is the same in kind as in the Daniell cell , but that it differs very much in degree .
The electromotive force practically remains constant for all degrees of temperature , but the internal resistance diminishes as the temperature increases at a very steady rate , increasing again as the temperature is lowered .
The effect of varying the percentage of acid in solution is not very marked , though as might have been [ anticipated from Kohlrausch 's .observations , the 30 per cent , proportion gives the lowest resistance .
The mean average reduction in resistance between 0 ' and 100 ' 0 .
, is .59-6 per cent. This is shown by the following table :\#151 ; Resistance in ohms .
