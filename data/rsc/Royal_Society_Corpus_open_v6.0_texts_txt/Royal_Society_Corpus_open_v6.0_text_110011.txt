] The peculiar appearance which the blood sometimes assumes after its coagulation , and which has been termed " buff , " has been referred by Mr. Hewson to its increased tenuity and slow coagulation .
Dr. Davy is inclined to ascribe the separation of the colouring matter from a part of the coagulum , or diminished viscidity to the former rather than the latter cause ; for he has remarked that blood drawn in several inflammatory diseases coagulates with its usual rapidity , and yet forms the buffy coat : its specific gravity also rather exceeds than falls short of that of healthy blood .
Dr. Davy next adverts to the opinion that the age of the morbid adhesions , which on dissection are often found to connect together serous membranes , is proportionate to their strength : but as he has found strong adhesions formed in twenty-four hours between surfaces of the pleura , in consequence of inflammation artificially excited ; and as he has remarked a peculiar tenacity in the coagulable lymph of the blood , enabling it to be drawn out into bands and fibres , which become solid and opake , and thus represent ordinary adhesions , he is inclined to doubt the correctness of the above opinion. .
Lastly , the author mentions the supposed pouring out of serous ; fluids into certain cavities , after death ; and cites experiments to .
show that , under ordinary circumstances , no such effusion or exudation of serum takes place .
