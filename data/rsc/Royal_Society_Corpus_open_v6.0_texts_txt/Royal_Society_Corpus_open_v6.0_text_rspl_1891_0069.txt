[ June 11 , On comparing the tractive force of the cobalt with that of iron , each with 5 amperes of current , it will be seen from the table that it was still very high , being no less , for the iron , than 0'437 lb. = 222 lbs. per square inch of section , or more than 12,000 times its own weight .
Although this amount of tractive force is greater than any so far recorded for iron , yet the magnetising force was not sufficient to break down the property of the increase of magnetic force of the heated cobalt .
It is well , however , that I should point out that the property only pertains in the highest degree to the metal when in a state of purity , as several of the specimens experimented upon , from different sources , only exhibit the property in a feeble manner , the diminution being due to the presence of iron in the cobalt .
As the determination of the limit of the magnetisability of iron by different methods is of some importance to magnetical science , an experiment was made on a cylinder of annealed charcoal iron wire 0'2 inch long , ( M)5 inch in diameter , and | grain in weight .
The cylinder was driven up the end of a thick copper wire for the purpose of suspension as in the previous experiments .
The tractive force of this specimen of iron at 13 ' C. , with 40 amperes of current , was 0'75 lb. , which is equal to 381 lbs. per square inch of section , or 7000 times the weight of the iron .
That the limit of magnetisability was virtually arrived at in this experiment was shown by reducing the current to 20 amperes , when the tractive force remained at 0'734 lb. = 373 lbs. per square inch of section , or only 8 lbs. less per square inch than the tractive force obtained with 40 amperes of current .
