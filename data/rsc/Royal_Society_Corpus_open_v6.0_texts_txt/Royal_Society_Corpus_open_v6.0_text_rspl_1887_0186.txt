[ Mar. 1 , It seemed probable that this additional centre would be the frontal area itself , but further experiments have proved that this is not the case\#151 ; at least not necessarily so .
For the movement is still obtained on exciting the occipital lobe , or the superior temporal gyrus , even after complete excision of the whole of the frontal area , and indeed of nearly the whole of the so-called motor region on both sides of the brain in front of the fissure of Rolando .
It would seem , therefore , that under these conditions the additional centre must be looked for elsewhere\#151 ; possibly in the grey matter of the corpora quadrigemina , or in the basal ganglia.* In this investigation , as well as in that related in the preceding paper , I have received much valuable aid from my assistant , Mr. E. P. France , whose services I desire cordially to acknowledge .
The expenses have been defrayed by the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research .

( Abstract .
) In a previous communication , * the authors have given a detailed description of a number of micro-organisms\#151 ; Bacilli and Micrococci \#151 ; which they had obtained in the course of investigations on the distribution of micro-organisms in the atmosphere .
The present paper deals similarly with a number of typical and characteristic micro-organisms which they have derived from various natural waters .
The authors refer to the forms which have been obtained from water by previous observers , more especially to the " peach-coloured bacterium , " the " Oladothrix dichotomaand the " Grenothrix Jciihni-ana , " as well as to others which have been more recently isolated by means of the method of gelatine-plate cultivation .
The authors point out the striking difference between the aerial and aquatic micro-organisms , micrococci being the predominant forms amongst the former , whilst bacillar forms are almost exclusively present in water .
In fact all the aquatic forms described are bacilli .
