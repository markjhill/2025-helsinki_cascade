Observations on the Functions of the Brain .
By Sir Evefard Home , Bart. F.R.S. Read May 26 , 1814 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1814 , p. 469 .
] The observations comprised in this paper , are selected from those cases of injury to the brain which have occurred to the author in the course of his professional pursuits .
The facts thus accidentally forced upon his notice , may be regarded as so many experiments made on different portions of the living brain ; and the remarks upon them relate to those effects which tend to elucidate their several functions .
The collection of observations here given , are classed under different heads ; and with respect to the first set , which relate to the pressure of water on the brain , the subject is again subdivided according to the parts in which the water may be collected , whether in any of the ventricles , or between the membranes .
In the next place , the consequences of concussion of the brain generally , are also considered .
The effects of extravasation of blood , in various situations , are separately described .
The consequences that ensue from formation of matter , and immediate relief of the symptoms by its removal , are noticed .
The symptoms that occur from depression , or from thickening of different parts of the skull , are next distinguished , as well as those which arise from pressure of soft tumours in different situations .
In addition to the preceding , which are all instances of pressure variously modified , the author adds his observations relating to wounds , inflammation , and suppuration of the cerebrum in different parts ; and his remarks upon injuries done to the medulla spinalis , which form the concluding section of his classification .
