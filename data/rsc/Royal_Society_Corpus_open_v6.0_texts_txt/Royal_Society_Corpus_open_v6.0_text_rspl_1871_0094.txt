( Abstract .
) The authors first refer to their preliminary communication read before the Royal Society on March 9 , 1871 , in which they described the combined effect of heat and pressure upon the solid paraffins .
They showed that , when these substances are exposed to a high temperature in a closed vessel , ' they are almost completely resolved , with the evolution of but little gas , into hydrocarbons which remain liquid at the ordinary temperature .
In the present communication they describe how this transformation may be easily effected on the small scale .
A few grams of ordinary paraffin are sealed up in a piece of strong combustion-tubing , bent in the form of the letter y ; the tube is securely surrounded by strong wire gauze , and the limb containing the paraffin is gently heated along its entire length in a gas com-bustion-furnace .
If the heat is properly regulated , the paraffin rapidly distils over and solidifies in the cold portion of the tube .
The gas-flames are then turned down , the tube reversed , and the paraffin again distilled .
After a very few repetitions of this process the paraffin acquires the consistency of butter , and the warmth of the hand is sufficient to liquefy it ; and after about a dozen distillations , the greater portion of the substance remains permanently liquid .
It seems to be absolutely necessary that the paraffin should thus be distilled over and condensed ; by merely heating it in the tube in such a manner that the condensed vapours flow back again upon the heated portion , the liquefaction is never accomplished .
It appears that only paraffins boiling at an extremely high temperature , and those usually solid under ordinary conditions , are thus susceptible of decomposition .
The readiness with which they yield liquid hydrocarbons appears to depend upon the complexity of their constitution .
The authors have not determined with certainty the limits of the decomposition , but they find that the mixed paraffin and olefine , boiling at about 255 ' , may be repeatedly distilled backwards and forwards in a sealed y*tube without suffering the slightest change .
The authors have repeated the process of conversion of solid paraffin into liquid products upon a large scale , in the hope of obtaining an insight into the constitution of the higher members of the C"H2 , ( +2 series of hydrocarbons .
The paraffin employed was obtained from shale ; it melted at 46'\gt ; and had a specific gravity ( when solidified under pressure ) of 0'906 at 13'-Its composition was:\#151 ; Carbon ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 85114 Hydrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 14*81 99-95 * 1872 .

Heated in a sealed tube in the manner above described , it was readily split up into liquid hydrocarbons , which were shown to be mixtures of hydrides and olefines .
The four litres of liquid were submitted to a systematic fractional distillation over sodium ; the greater portion of the operation was effected in an apparatus after Warren 's design .
The following fractions were thus isolated ( boiling-points uncorrected ) :\#151 ; ( 1 ) at 35- 37 ( 2 ) 65- 70 ( 3 ) 94- 97 ( 4 ) 122-125 ( 5 ) 145-148 ( 6 ) 170-172 ( 7 ) at 193-195 ( 8 ) 212-215 ( 9 ) 230-235 ( 10 ) 252-255 ( 11 ) 273-276 ( 12 ) 290-295 By means of bromine all these fractions were shown to be mixtures of hydrides and olefines ; and an attempt was made in each to determine , by means 'f this reagent , the relative quantities of the two series of hydrocarbons .
The method by which this was accomplished is detailed in the original memoir .
It was shown that in the lower fractions ( up to 200 ' ) the amount of hydride was sensibly equal to that of the olefine .
Thus the fraction boiling at 65-70 ' was shown to be a mixture of hexane and hexylene in equal proportions ; the fraction at 94-97 ' was also made up of heptane and heptylene in equi-yalent amounts .
In the higher fractions , however , there is a decided mcroase in the amount of the hydride present .
fter treatment with bromine the hydrides could be isolated in the pure state .

The mode of decomposition of the paraffins under the influence of heat and pressure appears to be general for the higher terms of the series of normal hydrocarbons .
If the paraffins be represented constitutionally , by linking together the carbon atoms in a single chain , the simultaneous formation of hydride and olefine obviously arises from the loosening of the affinities of the CHa groups .
Under the influence of heat , these groups become disassociated , and recombine to form saturated hydrocarbons .
Assuming , for the sake of simplicity , that this decomposition may occur so low down in the series as in the case of butane , it might be thus represented:\#151 ; HHHH HH HH III !

491 hydride and olefine containing an equal number of carbon atoms as in the above equation .
Neither supposition is exactly substantiated by experiment .
If the action of heat gave rise to the former mode of decomposition , we ought to obtain a larger quantity of ethylene after prolonged heating , especially when the liquefied portion is rich in hydrocarbons of low molecular weight ; but it has already been pointed out that the process of liquefaction is accompanied with the production of comparatively little gas .
On the other hand , an examination of the amounts of bromine required to render the hydrocarbons boiling above 200 ' permanently red , shows that the proportion of hydride to olefine in the several mixtures becomes gradually larger as the molecular weight increases .
It would doubtless have been interesting to have determined the relative amounts of the twelve fractions isolated from the decomposed paraffin ; but when it is considered that their separation was only effected after several thousand distillations , it will be evident that the quantities obtained after such prolonged treatment can afford no real indication of the amounts present in the original liquid .
It appears , however , that the amounts of liquid boiling at 94-97 ' and 122-125 ' were but slightly , if at all , less than the quantities boiling at 252\#151 ; 255 ' and 273-276 ' .

( Abstract .
) The deep-sea dredging-cruises of H.M. Ships * Lightning * and * Porcupine ' during the summers of 1868 , 1869 , and 1870 in the North Atlantic , were comprehended within a belt 1500 miles in length by from 100 to 150 miles in width , extending from the Faeroe Islands along the northern and western coasts of Scotland and Ireland and the coasts of Portugal and Spain to the Strait of Gibraltar .
In this area fifty-seven successful hauls of the dredge were made during the three summers in water exceeding 500 fathoms in depth , sixteen beyond 1000 fathoms , and two beyond 2000 fathoms .
Even at the latter extreme depth Echinodermata appeared to be abun-ant* At 2435 and at 2090 fathoms all the Echinoderm orders were represented the Echinidea by a small variety of Echinus , D. \amp ; K. , and a young example of Brissopsis lyrifera , Forbes ; the Asteridea by a species e genus Archaster ; the Ophiuridea by Ophiocten sericeum , Forbes , an Ophiacantha spinulosa , M. \amp ; T. ; the Holothuridea by Echinocucumis ypica , Sars ; and the Crinoidea by a very remarkable new form of the pwcrinidae , which has been described under the name of Bathycrinus deilisi Wy .
