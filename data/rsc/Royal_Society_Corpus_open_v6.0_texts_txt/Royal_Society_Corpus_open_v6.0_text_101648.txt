An Extract of a Letter , written to the Publisher by Mr. J. L. about poisonous Fish in one of the Bahama Islands .
Sir , I Do herewith send you an account , I lately received from NewProvidence , one of the Bahama Islands , concerning Fish there , which is as follows ; I have not met with any rarities here worth that acceptance , though I have been diligent in inquiring after them : Of those which I have heard of , this seems most remarkable to me .
The Fish , that are here , are many of them poisonous , bringing a great pain on their joints who eat them , which continues so for some short time , and at last with two or three days itching the pain is rubbed off .
Those of the same species , size , shapes , colour and taste , are one of them poison , the other not in the least hurtful : And those that are , are so only to some of the company .
The distemper to Men never , that we hear of , proves mortal .
Doggs and Cats sometimes eat their last .
In men that have once had that disease , upon the first eating of fish , though it be those that are wholesome , the poisonous ferment in their body is revived thereby , and their pain increased .
Thus far the ingenious person from whom I had this relation , who having been but a very little while upon the Island when he writ this , could not send so perfect an account of this odd Observation , as one could wish , or as I expect to hear from him in answer to some Quaere 's I lately sent him by a Ship bound thither .
When his Answer comes to my hand , if there be any thing in it , which may gratisie your curiosity , I shall be glad of that or any other occasion to assure you , that I am , &amp;c.
