Communicated by Warren De La Rue , D.C.L. , F.R.S. Received June 21 , 1880 .
At the request of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm , we some years ago undertook an extended research into the physical properties of the rare earth-metals and their compounds .
Having performed the laborious task of separating and purifying their oxides , we are now able to publish our first series of determinations concerning their principal properties , which chemically are of the greatest importance , viz. , molecular heat and molecular volume .
The rare earths , with a few exceptions ( CeOa , Th03 , Zr03 ) , belong co a group of sesquioxides .
In order to obtain a larger number for comparison , we have extended our research not only to the rare earths , but also to some other nearly related compounds , the molecular heat and volume of which were hitherto unknown .
As to these values , previously known for some other oxides , A1303 , Fe303 , Cr303 , according to Regnault , Kopp , and others , we have already observed in our preceding paper " On the Essential Properties and Chemical Character of Beryllium , " that only such determinations are strictly comparable which are made by the same method , under the same circumstances , and referred to the same unit of measure .
The specific densities and molecular volumes , which are given in the following tables , are obtained by means of a method , specially adapted to prevent the errors arising from adhesion of air to pulverulent substances.* The densities taken by this method will therefore generally be found a little higher and the molecular volumes a little lower than the numbers usually given by others .
The specific heats of the different compounds are determined with Bunsen 's ice-calorimeter , by means of the same process which we have more fully described in our detailed memoir on beryllium.f All the numbers given are the means of at least two determinations , which agree perfectly , the experiments being made under the most favourable circumstances .
As to the values obtained , we beg to observe that the specific and molecular heat will be found a little smaller by the icemelting method than by other methods , on account of the different unit of comparison .
The molecular weight of the different oxides was determined by a special analysis or synthesis of the sulphates , and the very same chemi- * For the details , see Otto Pqttersson , " Molacularvolumina einiger Reihen von isomorphen Salzen , " in " Nov. Act .

2640 9-861 00548 14-47 26-77 Hitherto it was supposed to be a general rule , that the atomic heat of oxygen in any oxide was not less than 3'5 or greater than 5*1 .
The numbers above given compel us , however , to assign a still lower value to the atomic heat of oxygen in alumina and beryllia , viz. , 2"34.S Into these oxides it enters with a minimum capacity of heat and volume .
From these earths upwards the molecular heat and volume of the ses-quioxides gradually increase with increasing molecular weights .
The following table shows that the molecular heat ( 1 ) of Er208 , Yb203 , La203 , and Di203 nearly agrees with those for other sesqui-oxides , determined by Regnault ; ( 2 ) that of Be303 , approaches to the same for alumina ; and ( 3 ) that of Zr02 , Ce02 , and Th02 is as high as the values for Sn02 , Ti02 , and zircon , determined by the same author , and for Mn02 according to Kopp .
The validity of Neumann 's law receives hereby a new confirmation .

The values for the salts of chromium , iron , indium , lanthanum , cerium , and didymium are nearly identical ; whilst even the values of the remainder approach each other very nearly .
As the following hydrated sulphates are decomposed when heated to 100 ' , their capacity of heat was determined between 0 ' and 46 ' in the vapour of boiling CS2 ; the beryllium sulphate not bearing even that temperature without losing water , its molecular heat could not be ascertained .

In fact , the molecular heat and volume of water in these salts descends to a minimum value hitherto unknown .
Comparing the values given above , we readily find that in those groups of compounds intimately connected by isomorphism , the molecular heat of the compounds increases and the molecular volume decreases with increasing molecular weight of the compound or atomic weight of the element .
This will be shown by the following table , in which the different isomorphous compounds , partly of yttrium , erbium , and ytterbium , partly of lanthanum and didymium , are brought into comparison:\#151 ; * According to Cleve .

- \#151 ; Especially with regard to beryllia , and the question of its real composition , the values given* above are of the greatest importance .
In respect of this we observe that : 1st , the atomic heat of oxygen in beryllia is identical with that in alumina and nearly identical with the same value in other closely related oxides , if beryllia = Be203 ( see our preceding paper , p. 42 ) ; 2nd , under the same supposition the molecular heat and volume of beryllia and alumina are nearly identical , whether the latter earth be examined in the state of crystallised sapphire or of an amorphous powder , and , further , if we consider chrysoberyl not as an aluminate , but as 1 03 , this mineral has Bei J yielded identical values ; 3rd , the molecular heat and value of beryllium sulphate , compared with the same values for the other nearly allied sulphates of aluminium , scandium , gallium , and yttrium , support the formula Be203 which we have given .
Taking into consideration the above-mentioned circumstances , and those related in our former papers , with the fact that the atomic heat and volume of metallic beryllium , as well as the molecular heat and volume of beryllia and its sulphate , would assume values quite exceptional , if the formula for the oxide were BeO , we think , therefore , the question of the valence of beryllium may be considered as finally decided .
In fact , there is no physical property of beryllium , beryllia , or its sulphates , which does not testify to our view being the correct one , and from a chemical point of view the same holds good .
It is , we think , unnecessary to take up space here with a repetition of the various reasons which support this conclusion .
We refer , therefore , to our detailed paper on beryllium , above quoted , and only mention here that this metal belongs on account of its sulphate , 3K2S04+Be23S04 , to the series of the gadolinite and cerite metals , this salt having a composition , typical for all the members of this series ( Be , Sc , Y , La , Ce , Di , Tr , Ya , Yp , x , Er , Tm , Yb ) .
The series of these elements , the 1880.1 On the Absorption Spectra of Cobalt Salts .
leading member of which beryllium unquestionably is , stands certainly in the nearest proximity with an other series , that of aluminium ( Alg , Ga2 , Tn2 , Cr2 , Mn2 , Fe2 ) , but this nevertheless decidedly differs from the former by an other typical double sulphate , K , S04+R23S04+24H20 .
or alum .
The fact , which has been alleged as a proof of the bivalence of beryllium , namely , that the chloride fuses and sublimes at a higher temperature than aluminium chloride is of no importance , for it will be found that amongst the members of the former series , with its difficultly fusible and volatilisable chlorides , many analogies exist for beryllium , not only in this but in many other respects .

( Abstract .
) The following investigation was commenced with Mr. Lockyer , and although he has been unable to continue the work , the author is indebted to him for much aid and many suggestions .
The cobalt salt first examined was the anhydrous chloride .
In order to establish clearly its absorption spectrum , different samples of this salt were made by various processes .
All , however , gave the same spectrum .
The bromide of cobalt yields a similar spectrum , but its position is different , it is nearer to the red .
