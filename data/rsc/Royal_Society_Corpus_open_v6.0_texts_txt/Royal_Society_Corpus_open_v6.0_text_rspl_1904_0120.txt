In continuation bf this investigation* the transport numbers of several substances have been measured when dissolved in liquefied hydrogen bromide .
The substances selected were ethyl ether , acetone , methyl hexyl ketone and triethylammonium bromide , the first two of which have been shown to form compounds with hydrogen bromide .
As a preliminary to the main series of experiments the validity of Faraday 's law for solutions in hydrogen bromide was tested , and the law found to hold within the limits of the errors of experiment of the method employed , which consisted in the direct comparison of the amount of hydrogen evolved during the electrolysis of various substances in hydrogen bromide solution , with the weight of silver deposited at the cathode of a silver voltameter .
In one experiment the amount of hydrogen evolved was 19-7 c.c. , the hydrogen equivalent of the silver deposited being 19 -8 c.c. The transport numbers were determined by the- method of Hittorf at a temperature of \#151 ; 81 ' .
Great difficulties were experienced in carrying out the analyses with the required degree of accuracy , and the method of analysis finally found to be successful was one depending on the direct weighing of the whole solution to be analysed in a specially constructed absorbing apparatus , and the subsequent determination of the hydrogen bromide by titration , the difference giving the amount of dissolved substance contained in the solution taken .
The following mean values were found for the transport number of the cation:\#151 ; Ether ... ... ... ... ... ... . .
Triethylammonium bromide Acetone ... ... ... ... ... . .
, Methyl hexylketone ... ... .
n = 1*0 , p = 0-82 n = 0-5 to 0-75 , - 0*20 n \#151 ; l-04 , p = 0-35 n \#151 ; l-0 , p = 0-38 n \#151 ; l-8 , p = 0'95 n = 0*9 , p = 0'39 n = 1 *8 , p 0-77 n = concentration expressed in gramme-molecules per litre .
p-= cation transport number .
The experiments show that the cation transport number increases with increasing concentration , and that the ether ( or acetone , \amp ; c. ) , functions as the cation or as a component part of it .
