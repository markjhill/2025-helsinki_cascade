) ( From the Laboratory of Physiology , St. Mary 's Hospital Medical School .
) In 1854 Graham suggested that muscular contraction might be due to osmotic influences ( 6 ) .
In 1878 FitzGerald suggested , on the other hand , that muscular contraction might be due to changes in tension at the surface of the fibrils of muscle ( 4 ) .
The application of these ' two hypotheses to the problem of muscular contraction is still under investigation and discussion .
Two principal objections have been raised to the osmotic explanation :\#151 ; { I ) " Neither theoretically nor practically is it possible to construct a model in the manner imagined by McDougall , which will , on being distended , produce anything near the shortening which is observed in living muscle .
Living muscle may contract certainly to one-third of its length " ( 25 ) .
( 2 ) It is impossible to conceive that water will flow into the sarcostyles from the sarcoplasm , not in a third or a tenth of a second , only , but as in the case .of the wing muscles of insects , in less than one-two thousandth of a second " ( 10 ) .
These two objections seem to be shared by Bernstein ( 2 ) , Macallum ( 9 ) , and Schafer ( 24 ) .
On the other hand , Macdonald ( 11 ) , Macdougall ( 13 ) , Pauli ( 15 ) , and Zuntz(27 ) , support the hypothesis that muscular contraction is due to a rise of osmotic pressure .
The structure of striated mammalian muscle is generally agreed to be a series of fibrils suspended in sarcoplasm , the whole surrounded by the sarco-lemma .
The fibrils consist of alternating bands of anisotropous and isotropous substance , the former corresponding to the portion of the fibril which is contained in the dim band , the latter to the light band of the fibril ( 26 ) .
Accepting this , the model that I wish to describe assumes that during contraction lactic acid is formed , causing the portion of the fibril contained in the dim band to swell and become spherical ( see figure ) .
Such a process is exemplified by a parchment paper osmometer containing a protein solution .
If the osmometer is placed in a dilute solution of acid , the acid diffuses in and .causes an increased absorption of water , with a rise of pressure .
One explanation of this rise of pressure is that , as the acid diffuses into the VOL. lxxxviii.\#151 ; B. M Mr. H. E. Roaf .
The VQj'po'ULv-Pvessuve osmometer , it unites with the protein to form an ionising salt Of this salt the protein ion cannot pass through the parchment paper membrane , and the acidic ion is held back by the opposite electrical charge , on the protein .
The pressure inside the osmometer consists of the sum of the protein and acidic ions and the free acid ; the pressure outside the osmometer consists of the free acid alone .
Therefore the excess pressure inside is due to the protein and acidic ions ( 14 , 17 , 18 , 20 ) .
If in calculating the rate of contraction we assume that the lactic acid is liberated in the isotropous substance , and that it must diffuse into the anisotropous substance , we are using the most unfavourable conditions for the B Diagram illustrating to scale the osmotic contraction of two segments of four fibrils of frog 's sartorius muscle .

osmotic hypothesis .
The anisotropous substance is considered to be an ellipsoid , but calculations assuming that the anisotropous substance is cylindrical give practically the same results .
In calculating the extent and rate of contraction the results will depend upon the dimensions of the structures concerned .
Measurements made by Dr. F. O'B .
Ellison on frog 's sartorius show that there the length of the dim band is 0*9 / x , the length of the light band is 0 9 fi , and the diameter of the fibril is approximately 0'3 / i. As the diameter of the fibril and relative lengths of the dim and light bands may vary in different muscles , the calculations are made so as to show what variations these differences may allow in the extent and rate of contraction .
In the Table ( p. 146 ) , therefore , Hypothesis of Contraction of Striated Muscle .
the calculations are made for ellipsoids 09 / z long and 0'4 , 0*3 , 0'2 , and 01 f.in diameter ; that is with half-axes , a and 045 / x and 0*20 , 0*15 , 010 , and 0-05 / x respectively .
We can assume that the ellipsoid swells to become a sphere of the same surface area , that the ellipsoid is really an extended sphere with the walls thrown into folds , or that it has inextensible longitudinal fibres and extensible circular fibres .
The first assumption is not valid , as one cannot imagine a surface area of constant magnitude which would be so mobile as to change from the surface of an ellipsoid to that of a sphere .
The other two assumptions give the same results and they form the mechanical basis of the ensuing calculations .
We can simplify the description by dealing with one dim band and an adjacent light band , since the result is the same even if one dim band is associated with the two adjacent half light bands .
Extent of Contraction .
The quotation given above refers specifically to Macdougall 's hypothesis ( 13 ) , but the same criticism seems to be tacitly applied to all osmotic hypotheses .
Assuming that the ellipsoid becomes a sphere , the longitudinal perimeter of the ellipsoid ( Table , p. 146 , column 3 ) will be the circumference of the sphere .
The dim band , therefore , shortens in the ratio of the length of ellipsoid to diameter of sphere , that is as 2 is to 2r .
Not only does the dim band shorten but the area of the dim band increases .
The fibrils being closely packed together , the increase in area of dim band will be proportional to the squares of the radii of the ellipsoid and sphere respectively , or as b2 is to r3 .
The relative volumes of the dim band in the two conditions are given by this ratio multiplied by the corresponding length of the band .
These relative volumes , 2 x b2 , and 2 x are given in the Table ( columns 4 and 8 ) .
The volume of the dim band is more than doubled as the result of contraction ( column 9 ) .
The extent of contraction can be estimated by assuming\#151 ; ( a ) that , as measured above , the light band is exactly the same length as the dim band , or ( b ) that the length of the light band is such that , during contraction , the whole of the muscle can be just absorbed by the dim band .
These figures are given in the Table ( columns 10,11 , and 12 ) .
The length of the muscle fibre which can be absorbed by the dim band is easy to calculate , as the area of the light band is exactly the same as that of the dim band before contraction , hence the relative length is the number of times that the volume of the contracted dim band contains the volume of the dim band before contraction .
M 2 Mr. H. E. Roaf .
Th A model to illustrate the above principles was made ( 22 ) by enclosing four rubber balloons in silk bags and suspending them from a disc ; a rubber cylinder was placed round these , extending from the supporting disc to a similar disc below .
The whole was filled with water : a certain amount of water was removed from the cylinder surrounding the balloons and the same volume was injected into the balloons .
The total volume was thus unchanged and the model contracted to 50 per cent , of its original length .
By more careful construction there is no doubt that a greater degree of contraction can be produced .
The diagram shows , to scale , the contraction when ellipsoids 0*9 / * .
long and 0-3 / * , in diameter become spheres of the same circumference , the light bands before contraction being of the same length as the dim band .
The results of the calculations in this section are independent of the actual dimensions , but they depend on the relative dimensions .
The results in the following section , however , depend on the absolute values .
Rate of Contraction .
Graham pointed out that " in minute microscopic cells the osmotic movements should attain the highest velocity , being mainly dependent upon the extent of the surface " ( 7 ) .
This statement can be amplified by calculating the rate at which the ellipsoids would swell to form spheres .
The amount of liquid that is absorbed ( column 13 ) is the difference between the volume of the sphere ( column 6 ) and the volume of the ellipsoid ( column 2 ) .
This amount of liquid passes through a surface which can be taken to be of the same extent as the surface of the sphere ( column 7 ) .
To calculate the rate at which absorption of water may take place through the membrane we may utilise the data which I obtained in some direct determinations of the osmotic pressure of haemoglobin solutions ( 17 , 20 ) .
The surface area of the parchment paper was 19 sq .
cm .
and osmotic equilibrium was attained in about three days by the absorption of about 5 c.c. of water .
If the rate of diffusion into the anisotropic substance is the same as the rate of diffusion through the parchment paper , the length of time until equilibrium will be reached will be directly proportional to the volume of liquid passing in , and inversely proportional to the surface area through which the liquid can pass .
The increase in volume when the ellipsoids become spheres ( column 13 ) and the surface of the spheres ( column 7 ) are given in the Table .
In order to compare the increase in volume and surface of the osmometer with the corresponding measurements of the ellipsoids , the measurements in Hypothesis of Contraction of Striated .
143 centimetres must be converted into microns : that is , 5 must be multiplied by ( 10000)3 and 19 by ( 10000)2 .
The ratio , 5 x ( 10000)3 .
Increase in volume of ellipsoid 19 x ( 10000)2 Surface of sphere denoting the relative surface through which unit volume passes into the anisotropic substance compared with unit volume through unit surface in the osmometer , is given in column 14 of the Table .
In calculating the rate of diffusion we must distinguish between two processes , namely , the rate at which lactic acid diffuses from the isotropous into the anisotropous substance , and the rate at which water diffuses from the isotropous into the anisotropous substance .
In each case the rate of diffusion must depend on the driving force , that is , the difference of pressure divided by the distance .
Let us assume that in the osmometer there is perfect mixing , so that the distance is the thickness of the parchment paper ; 43 thicknesses of dry parchment paper were measured in a screw micrometer , their thickness was 37 mm. ; each piece is , therefore , at least 0 086 mm. thick .
As the parchment paper swells when wet , the actual thickness must be greater than this .
Further , let us assume that the anisotropous substance is a gel , and let us take the greatest distance , namely , the radius of the sphere ( column 5 ) , as the distance that determines the driving force in the ellipsoid .
If the difference of pressure between the anisotropous substance and the isotropous substance were the same as that between the contents of an osmometer and its surrounding fluid , the driving force ( being inversely as the distances across which the force acts ) would be , as shown in the Table ( column 15 ) , very much greater in the case of the muscle fibre ; in other words , the osmotic gradient would be much steeper .
If acid is placed with the haemoglobin inside the osmometer , equilibrium is reached in two to three days ( 17 , 20 ) , but when the acid is placed outside , the pressure reaches its maximum more gradually , depending on the rate at which acid enters the osmometer .
Let us assume that the latter arrangement corresponds with the conditions existing inside a muscle fibre ; let us take three days as the period required to reach osmotic equilibrium once the pressure has been produced , and let us take 14 days as the period required for the acid to diffuse into the osmometer and cause a rise of pressure .
As the parchment paper is saturated with water the rate at which water enters the outer surface of the parchment paper determines the rate at which water enters the osmometer ; that is , the rate of entry is proportional Mr. H. E. Roaf .
Th Vtxpout- Pvessuve to the osmotic gradient .
The time required to reach osmotic equilibrium in the fibril ( column 17 ) is calculated by dividing three days , in seconds , by the relative surface through which unit volume passes ( column 14 ) and also by the relative driving force ( column 15 ) .
In the case of the diffusion of acid , the acid must diffuse through the thickness of the paper before it can affect the contents of the osmometer .
Therefore , in calculating the time required to reach equilibrium , the distance must be taken into account a second time .
For this reason the equilibrium for acid will be reached in inverse proportion to the square of the distance ( square of column 15 ) .
The length of time required to reach equilibrium for lactic acid in the muscle ( column 16 ) is found by dividing 14 days , in seconds , by the relative surface through which unit volume passes ( column 14 ) , and also by the squares of the figures in column 15 .
In order to control the above calculation the rate of diffusion of lactic acid was measured by allowing it to diffuse into gelatine containing an indicator .
A 2-per-cent , solution of gelatine was coloured by Congo red , and tubes 3 mm. in diameter were filled with it .
After the gelatine had solidified , the tubes were cut into short lengths and placed into 25 c.c. of solution .
The length of tube in which the indicator had changed colour was measured at definite time-intervals .
Two tubes were placed in each flask , two flasks of each solution were used , and there were two ends to each tube , therefore the measurements are the average of eight determinations in each case .

145 proportional to the square of the distance , therefore we can calculate the rate of diffusion of lactic acid in muscle fibre .
Taking the rate of diffusion as between 2 and 3 mm. for the first hour , we can calculate the time for the acid to diffuse one micron as follows:\#151 ; A micron is ( \gt ; 001 mm. , therefore the acid would diffuse one micron in between ( 1/ 2000)2 and ( 1/ 3000)2 of an hour , or between 00009 and O'OOOT of a second respectively .
The radius of the spheres is about one-third of a micron , therefore the time for the acid to diffuse into the anisotropic substance is one-ninth of the above , or O'OOOl and O'OOOOT of a second respectively .
These times are somewhat less than those given in the Table ( column 16 ) .
In the Table the calculation is for the establishment of equilibrium , but these figures show the time for diffusion of just sufficient acid to cause a change of colour of the indicator .
Considering this difference and the different ways in which the times were calculated the agreement is very satisfactory .
If we sum the two time-intervals ( columns 16 and 17 ) we get the total time for complete osmotic contraction of muscle , if the two processes are successive ( column 18 ) .
As the processes would be more or less concurrent , the time would actually be less .
In spite of the fact that in these calculations , wherever there was any doubt , the assumptions were made to the disadvantage of the view now defended , it will be seen that if the maximum contraction of frog 's sartorius requires at least 0 04 second there is more than sufficient time for the contraction to be the result of osmotic swelling of the anisotropic substance .
The calculation for the wing muscles of insects has not been attempted owing to the lack of data .
Although the fibrils are coarser the presence of minute canals in the anisotropous substance must be remembered , so that probably the results would be equally convincing .
If it were permissible to consider the rate of diffusion of water as proportional to the square of the distance the ellipsoids would become spheres with sufficient rapidity to allow ample time for the contraction of insect 's muscle .
Absolute Force of Muscle .
In the preceding discussion the term osmotic pressure has been used , but any other process which produces a lowering of vapour pressure could be used as the force by which water is moved into the anisotropous substance .
In order , however , to make the discussion more concrete , I may quote the following experiment as showing the effect of lactic acid on the osmotic pressure of a protein ( 14 , 18 ) .
As the proteins of muscle are difficult to obtain in an unaltered condition I have used haemoglobin .
It is more sensitive to reagents than the proteins of serum ( 21 ) .

Bernstein ( 2 ) states that the force of frog 's muscle is about 600 grm. per square centimetre , which amounts to a pressure of 445 mm. of mercury .
The percentage of protein in muscle is about 18 , so this is equivalent to 24'8 mm. per 1 per cent , of protein , a pressure not much greater than that recorded above with a strength of acid which is less than that formed in muscle during contraction .
Macallum(8 ) and Macdonald ( 12 ) have shown that the inorganic constituents of muscle are mainly confined to the dim band .
Some years ago 1 endeavoured to find out if the proteins were also mainly confined to the dim band .
Crab 's muscle was stained by immersion in dilute Millon 's reagent , copper sulphate followed by alkali , and other protein reagents .
In each case the dim band appeared to stain more deeply .
The experiments were discontinued , as the appearances might have been due to the colour seeming darker because of the opacity of the dim band .
If the proteins are unequally distributed less pressure per 1 per cent , of protein would suffice for muscular contraction .
Another way to calculate the osmotic force of muscular contraction is to regard the increase of pressure as due to the amount of lactic acid combined as an ionising salt with protein , the increase in pressure being considered to be due to the addition of the lactic ion to the protein .
The increase in pressure ( 153 mm. ) is equivalent to a 0'009 normal solution .
This added to the 0'01 normal solution , the amount of uncombined acid which should be equally distributed inside and outside the osmometer , Mr. H. E. Roaf .
The Vapour-Pressure gives a concentration of 0*019 normal .
To produce this concentration in the 25 c.c. of solution in the osmometer would require 5 c.c. of a decinormal solution of lactic acid .
It would be difficult to show the disappearance of this amount from the 600 c.c. of N/ 100 solution outside the osmometer .
In the last osmometer of the experiment 4*9 c.c. had disappeared , but such a close result is probably a coincidence .
If we wish to make a similar comparison in muscle we must calculate the relative volume of the anisotropic substance to the whole muscle in the uncontracted and contracted states .
A disc of paper was divided into as many smaller discs as possible by a cork borer .
These smaller discs collectively weighed 0*581 grm. , and the residue weighed 0*224 grm. It was found , however , that there were certain larger pieces from the edge of the large disc that were too small to form small discs .
If these pieces were excluded the weight of the residue was 0*153 grm. The larger the whole disc the less relatively is the waste at the edges , so that we can consider the weight of the smaller discs as between 79*2 and 72*2 per cent , of the whole ; these weights represent the relative area of the combined smaller discs to the whole disc .
These figures give the relative volume of small cylinders inside a larger cylinder of the same length .
The volume of an ellipsoid is two-thirds of a cylinder of the same length and diameter .
Therefore the volume of the ellipsoids will be two-thirds of the above , namely , between 52*8 and 48*1 per cent , of the volume of the dim band .
As the volume of the light band is approximately the same as that of the dim band , the ellipsoids will occupy half the above amount , that is between 26*4 and 24*1 per cent , of the uncontracted muscle .
In the contracted condition the whole of the muscle is contained in the dim band , and the ellipsoids become spheres .
In the preceding paragraph we have calculated the relative volume of cylinders inside a larger cylinder , and since the volume of a sphere is two-thirds of the volume of a cylinder surrounding it , we see that the spheres occupy between 52*8 and 48*1 per cent , of the whole contracted muscle .
If as in the osmometer experiment the concentration of lactic acid in the isotropous substance remains as low as 0*01 normal , and the concentration in the whole muscle is equivalent to 0*025 normal ( 5 ) , we can calculate the amount of lactic acid in the anisotropous substance .
If the muscle prevented from shortening , the concentration would be about 0*07 normal If , on the other hand , the muscle is allowed to shorten , the concentration of lactic acid in the anisotropous substance would be about 0*04 normal .
These figures are obtained by subtracting from the total concentration of lactic acid Hypothesis of Contraction of Striated Muscle .
149 the amount contained in the isotropous substance and concentrating the remainder in the anisotropous substance .
That is [ 0-025-0-01 ( 100-X)/ 100 ] .
100/ X , where X is the percentage of the whole muscle formed by the anisotropic substance as calculated above .
If we subtract the amount of uncombined lactic acid ( 0"01 normal ) from the above we have left 0'06 normal and 0"03 normal respectively , as the amount of lactic acid as ionising salt in the anisotropic substance .
These would give osmotic pressures of 1018 mm. and 509 mm. , both of which exceed the 445 mm. which Bernstein states is the maximum required ( 2 ) .
By the formation of a lactic-acid salt of protein a negative potential would be produced .
This is apparently the explanation of the negative potential produced when a muscle contracts ( 1 , 3 , 16 , 19 ) .
The time relations of acid production are such that the acid can be considered as the cause of contraction ( 23 ) .
There is one further point .
It is claimed that if the contraction of muscle is due to changes in surface tension one explanation suffices for it and for amoeboid movement .
Granting that amoeboid movement is due to changes in surface tension , may it not be that the changes in surface tension are due to electrical charges , the result of acid production ?
Thus amoeboid movement and muscular contraction may be related , but in a different way from that advocated by those who claim that muscular contraction is due to changes in tension at surfaces of separation .
We do not yet know enough about unstriped muscle to suggest how its contraction is brought about .
The above outline gives a definite conception of muscular contraction which accounts for all the known facts .
If an equally tangible explanation could be furnished based on surface-tension changes , the two hypotheses might be compared one with another , and the two together might lead to a conception closer to the truth than can be arrived at from either hypothesis taken by itself .
Summary of Conclusions .
1 .
I he contraction of striated muscle can be explained on the hypothesis that lactic acid is set free , and that this combines with protein to form a salt , with a consequent rise of osmotic pressure .
2 .
Muscle can shorten by osmotic processes until its length is somewhere between 37 and 3 per cent , of its original length ( Table , columns 10 and 12 ) .
3 .
The osmotic process can occur in frog 's sartorius in less than 0"04 of a second ( Table , column 18 ) .
Contraction of Striated Muscle .
4 .
In order to determine whether all cases can be explained by this hypothesis it is necessary to have measurements of the structures concerned .
Insect 's muscle , for instance , should he the test as regards the rapidity of contraction .
5 .
The amount of lactic acid formed during muscle contraction can cause sufficient rise in osmotic pressure to account for the force exerted by muscle contraction .
6 .
The electrical changes in muscle can be explained by the formation of a protein salt of lactic acid .
Many of the experiments on which this paper is founded have been carried out by the aid of grants from the Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society .
