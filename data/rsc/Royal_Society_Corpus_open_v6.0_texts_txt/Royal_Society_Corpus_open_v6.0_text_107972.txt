An Account of the Magnetical Experiments made on the western coast of Africa , 1830-1 , by Commander EDWARD BELCHER , of H. .

R.S. Read June 21 , 1832 .
I HAVE the honour of communicating the results of some experiments made on the western coast of Africa , by Commander EDWARD BELCHER , of His MAJESTY'S ship -IEtna , for the purpose of determining the relative horizontal intensities of the magnetic force , on the different parts of the coasts he has been lately surveying .
The experiments were made with four needles , constructed for the purpose , on nearly the same plan as that adopted by Professor HANSTEEN , and made by Mr. DOLLOND .
They were nearly cylindrical , and furnished with a moveable collar or suspension stirrup , for the purpose of adjusting them horizontally , and were respectively four , three and a half , three , and two and a half inches in length .
Captain BELCHER has kindly sent me his observations with these needles , which he has most accurately made , together with similar ones made in England since his return ; and the near agreement between these and others made by myself before their embarkation , affords a satisfactory proof that the magnetism of the needles has not undergone any material change during the period of the voyage ; a proof most essential in obtaining a correct result in experiments of this nature , and the want of which has rendered many others made of late years in different parts of the world , little better than useless .
The sudden changes in the intensities of magnetic needles , particularly those kept on ship-board , arising from a variety of causes , are well known to those accustomed to use them .
Hence arises the necessity in experiments , such as those described in this paper , of frequently repeating them at the same place between the same limits of arc , since the value of the result depends upon the permanency of the magnetism in the needles , in order that the experiments made with them may be strictly comparative .
The observations were frequently repeated in different places , at some distance from each other , at each station , and a mean of these taken as one result , as at Goree and Rio Nuniez .
The observations at Bathurst were made in the Government-house , and also at some distance from it , but exhibit no material difference .
By thus varying the place of observation at each station , a mean result is obtained , which is most probably more free from errors , particularly those arising from irregularities caused by the vicinity of iron ores and other peculiarities of the soil ; an instance of which took place at the Isles de Los .
Captain BELCHER observes , that " these islands being of volcanic origin , the sands even contain iron sufficient to influence the needle , and the rocks in some positions so forcibly , as to cause one of the needles suspended horizontally , to cease almost instantaneously after twenty vibrations .
" The whole detail of Captain BELCHER'S experiments is very extensive ; the following tables therefore contain only the abstract of them , together with the results which I have deduced from them .
They do him the greatest credit , and evince his indefatigable exertions , as well as excellent judgement .
Table I. contains the means of a great number of observations obtained by observing the times of completing a certain number of vibrations with the respective needles vibrating between the same limits of arc , viz. 30 ?
and 10 ? .
Table II .
contains the horizontal forces at the different places , considering the horizontal force at Portsmouth equal to unity , and computed from the formula varies as , - , where t is the time of completing n vibrations of the needle , when solicited by the force p. The needles were suspended by a few fibres of silk .
