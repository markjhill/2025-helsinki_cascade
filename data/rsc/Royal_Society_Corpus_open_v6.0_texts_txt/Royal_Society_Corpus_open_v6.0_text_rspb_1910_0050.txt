) ( From the Physiological Laboratory , University of London , South Kensington .
) From the study of the inhibitory action of the sera of rabbits fed on diets containing varying amounts of cholesterol on the haemolysis of blood by saponin we were led to the conclusion , in an earlier paper* of this series , that when cholesterol , free or in the form of esters , is given with the food of rabbits some is absorbed and finds its way into the blood stream as free cholesterol ; and also that when phytosterol is used instead of cholesterol it behaves similarly , and some appears in the blood either itself or in the form of cholesterol .
The method adopted in these experiments only gave information as to the amount of free cholesterol under various conditions , but not as to the amount of cholesterol esters that might be present .
It seemed to us desirable to confirm these results by a chemical method , and also , if possible , to estimate both the free cholesterol and the esters present at the same time in the blood under various conditions .
The usual methods for the chemical estimation of cholesterol are not sufficiently accurate to give reliable information in the case of a fluid such as blood , which contains but a small percentage of cholesterol , and which is only available in relatively small quantities .
The discovery of Windausf in 1909 that cholesterol , but not cholesterol esters , readily combines quantitatively with digitonin to form a highly insoluble compound , digitonin cholesteride , according to the following equation\#151 ; C55II94O28 + C27H46O = C82H140O29 , afforded a means of solving the problem .
According to Windaus , digitonin cholesteride is insoluble in water , acetone , ether , ethyl acetate and benzene .

Origin and [ June 17 , dissolves at 18 ' only 0*014 gramme , at 78 ' about 016 gramme ; 100 c.c. of 50-per-cent , alcohol , at a boiling temperature , dissolves 0*03 gramme .
It is readily soluble in pyridin and # slightly so in methyl alcohol .
On these properties Windaus based an accurate method* for estimating cholesterol , which he applied to the determination of the amount of free and combined \#166 ; cholesterol in kidneys .
The mode of procedure we adopted was worked out before the appearance of Windaus ' later paper , and differs in detail from that recommended by him .
Our object was to devise a plan suitable for the estimation of small quantities of cholesterol in material limited in \#166 ; quantity , and to ascertain , as far as possible , the limits of accuracy attainable under these conditions .
Method.\#151 ; The blood was mixed with plaster of Paris and the dry product finely powdered and submitted to prolonged extraction with ether .
For the \#166 ; estimation of free cholesterol the ethereal extract was evaporated to dryness , the residue weighed and taken up with 95-per-cent , alcohol .
Excess of digitonin in 95-per-cent , alcohol was then added , and the mixture , after .standing some time , was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum desiccator .
The precipitate was then washed by decantation with ether into a previously weighed filter paper or Gooch crucible , until the ethereal washings gave no residue on evaporation .
The excess of digitonin was then washed away by warm water .
In most cases the filtration proved tedious , and it was found more satisfactory , on the whole , to use a tared filter paper , care being taken to subject the tare to exactly the same treatment as the filter paper which received the precipitate .
The washing with water was continued until there was no residue on evaporation .
The precipitate was then dried in an air-oven at 110 ' C. and weighed , both drying and weighing being \#166 ; carried out in stoppered glass bottles , as the compound is somewhat hygroscopic .
In order to estimate the cholesterol present in the form of \#166 ; esters , the ethereal washings containing the fat and cholesterol esters may be saponified with excess of sodium ethylate , the unsaponifiable matter dissolved in alcohol , and precipitated with digitonin as above .
It is preferable , however , should the amount of material available permit , to take a separate quantity of material , and after extracting with ether , saponify the residue , and , estimating the total free and combined cholesterol present , obtain the amount of ester cholesterol by difference .
In order to test the efficiency of the method , the following experiments were carried out:\#151 ; I. Experiments using small quantities of pure cholesterol , which were * Windaus , ' Zeitschrift fur physiol .

In the material one wishes to analyse cholesterol may be present both free and combined , and it was therefore necessary to test the accuracy of the method as applied to the estimation of pure specimens of esters of cholesterol when in the presence of comparatively large-quantities of some substance other than cholesterol , which has to be removed by washing or saponification .
For these experiments we used known weights of cholesterol oleate and cholesterol acetate in weighed quantities of fat ( beef suet ) purified by melting and filtering through glass wool , the process being repeated until the fat was clear .
Separate analysis of the fat gave a percentage of total cholesterol of 007 .

Though the errors of experiment will be relatively greater the smaller the quantity of material used , we believe that dependable results can , with care , be obtained with so small an amount as 20 c.c. of blood .

563 Y. Experiments on the Cholesterol and Cholesterol Ester Content of the Blood of Rabbits Fed on Diets containing Varying Amounts of Cholesterol.\#151 ; The methods of feeding the animals under experiment were similar to those described in our former paper.* Large healthy rabbits were selected , as nearly the same weight as possible , and great care was taken to keep them in good health , and , as far as possible , under the same conditions .
The blood of these rabbits was taken and divided into two portions , as nearly equal as possible , which were weighed and mixed with sand and plaster of Paris , as already mentioned .
The mixtures , when dry , were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with ether , the ether evaporated to dryness , and the residues weighed .
The free cholesterol was estimated by direct precipitation with digitonin in the case of the residue from one portion , and the total cholesterol estimated by saponifying the ethereal extract from the other portion and estimating the cholesterol in the residue obtained after saponification .
The cholesterol present in the form of ester was then , obtained by difference .
In the first set of experiments four rabbits were fed , for comparison , two on extracted bran alone and two on extracted bran plus a measured quantity of cholesterol .
These rabbits were kept under the same conditions , and to be comparable , as far as possible , were killed within about ten minutes of each other .

In order to obtain information on this point 16 rabbits were fed on a mixture of oats , bran , cooked germ of wheat , and some free phytosterol for six days .
They were then killed , and the total blood ( 1074 grammes ) extracted in the manner already described .
The ether extract was saponified , and the crude cholesterol recrystallised once from a small quantity of 90-per-cent , alcohol .
The product thus obtained was slightly coloured and weighed 0*73 gramme .
This was dissolved in 7*5 c.c. ether , and the solution mixed with 7*5 c.c. of a solution of 5 grammes of bromine in 100 c.c. of glacial acetic acid .
After standing for 1 hour in a freezmg mixture , the cholesterol dibromide which had separated out was filtered on the pump and washed with 0*4 c.c. of glacial acetic acid and 0*4 c.c. of 50-per-cent , acetic acid .
This cholesterol dibromide weighed 0*75 gramme , and without further purification melted at 115 ' C. ( pure cholesterol dibromide melts at 120 ' C. ) .
The washings were mixed with the main filtrate an again allowed to stand in a freezing mixture .

567 separated , but was not weighed .
The filtrate from this precipitate , which should have contained any phytosterol which might have been present , was boiled for two hours with 5 c.c. of glacial acetic acid and gramme of zinc dust to reduce the phytosterol dibromide to phytosterol .
The liquid was filtered from the excess of zinc and poured into water , when a small amount of solid matter separated .
This was taken up in ether , and the ethereal solution , after shaking with dilute carbonate of soda to get rid of acetic acid , was dried and evaporated .
A small quantity of oily crystalline substance was left .
This was boiled for some time with acetic anhydride to convert it into the acetate , and then poured into water .
The acetate which separated was crystallised from 95-per-cent , alcohol , and the crystals under the microscope appeared to have the form of large thin plates .
These were compared with slides of cholesterol acetate and phytosterol acetate , and appeared to resemble the former more closely than the latter .
After crystallising three times from alcohol the crystals melted sharply at 101 ' C. Cholesterol acetate melts at 114 ' C. , and phytosterol acetate at 127 ' C. The quantity of material was much too small for any attempt at further purification .
The minute quantity of material remaining , along with the residue obtained by evaporating mother liquors , was saponified , and the crude product dissolved in pyridine and treated with benzoyl chloride .
On pouring into water a small quantity of solid matter separated .
This was mixed with some oily matter , and owing to its small amount was difficult to purify .
The crystals which separated from alcohol appeared under the microscope to have the form of square plates similar to those of cholesterol benzoate .
There was not enough to determine the melting point .
The crude sterol from the blood therefore consisted almost entirely of cholesterol , and contained no detectable quantity of phytosterol .
Had the increased sterol content of the blood of bran-fed rabbits compared with the blood of animals fed on extracted bran been due to absorbed phytosterol , we think we could not have failed to obtain some definite evidence of its presence by the above method .
Conclusions .
( 1 ) The digitonin method for the estimation of cholesterol is very accurate , and is capable of yielding reliable results even when only relatively small quantities of material are available .
( 2 ) When cholesterol is given with the food of rabbits , some is absorbed and finds its way into the blood stream .
An increase of both free cholesterol and cholesterol esters takes place .
( 3 ) When animals are fed on phytosterol , this substance is in part absorbed , Mr. V. H. Veley and Dr. A. D. Waller .
[ June 17 , and there results an increase in the free cholesterol of the blood .
Phytosterol does not appear in the blood as such .
We take this opportunity of expressing our thanks to the Government Grant Committee of the Eoyal Society for assistance in carrying out this work .
On the Comparative Toxicity of Theobromine and , as Measured by their Direct Effect upon the Contractility of Isolated Muscle .
The isolation of caffeine from coffee is generally assigned to Eobiquet , Pelletier and Caventou ( 1821 ) , * though the so-called coffee base , obtained a year previously by Eungef was probably impure caffeine .
The identity of theine , extracted from tea by Oudey ( 1838 ) , j with caffeine was established by the analyses of Jobst ( 1843).S The association of caffeine with uric acid was noted originally by StenhouseJ ] who found the latter in a sample of Paraguay tea .
Theobromine was first isolated by WoskrcsenskylT from cocoa ( 1842 ) , and its association with alloxan , on the one hand , and caffeine on the other , was established by subsequent observers .
According to the investigations of Emil Fischer ( 1894\#151 ; 1898 ) , ** uric acid , theobromine , caffeine , and other allied substances , are derived from the parent base purine , to which the following , as one of two alternative formulae , was eventually assigned:\#151 ; * ' Berzelius Jahresber .
