" On the Variation of a Triple Integral/ ' By Richard Abbott , Esq. F.R.A.S. Communicated by Benjamin Gompertz , Esq. , F.R.S. In the calculus of variations , the discovery of which has immortalised the name of Lagrange , that illustrious mathematician , by differentiating the function with respect to a new variable which en ?
ters into it , reduced the general problem of indeterminate maxima and minima to the solution of an equation depending on the variation of the given integral , whether single or multiple , and whose differential coefhcient contains any number of variables , or which even de ?
pends on other integrals .
The author investigates , in the present memoir , the case in which the given function is a triple integral ; its variation being composed of two distinct parts , namely , a triple inte ?
gral and another part , the determination of which must he sought from the limits of the triple integral .
