] maintained at a temperature of 251 ' ( which is 75 ' below the melting point of lead ) for thirty-one days .
At the end of this period the solid lead was cut into sections , and the amount of gold which had diffused into each of them was determined in the usual way .
Other experiments follow , in which the lead was maintained at 200 ' , and at various lower temperatures down to that of the laboratory .
The following are the results :\#151 ; Diffusivity of gold in fluid lead at 550 ' h. 319 99 solid 251 ' ... .
0-03 99 99 " 200 ' ... .
0-007 99 99 " 165 ' ... .
0-004 99 99 " 100 ' ... .
0-00002 The experiments at the ordinary temperature are still in progress , but there is evidence that slow diffusion of gold in lead occurs at the ordinary temperature .
The author points out that if clean surfaces of lead and gold are held together in vacuo at a temperature of only 40 ' for four days , they will unite firmly , and can only be separated by the application of a load equal to one-third of the breaking strain of lead itself .
The author thinks it will be considered remarkable that gold placed at the bottom of a cylinder of lead , 70 mm. long ( which is to all appearance solid ) , will have diffused to the top in notable quantities at the end of three days .
He points out that at 100 ' the diffusivity of gold in solid lead can readily be measured , though its diffusivity is only 1/ 100,000 of that in fluid lead at a temperature of 500 ' .
He also states that experiments which are still in progress show that the diffusivity of solid gold in solid silver , or copper , at 800 ' is of the same order as that of gold in solid lead at 100 ' .
He concludes by warmly thanking Mr. A. Stansfield , B.Sc. , who assisted him in all but the earlier portion of the work , and by expressing the hope that the experiments described in the paper will show that the diffusion can readily be measured in solid metals , and that they will carry one step further the work of Graham .
