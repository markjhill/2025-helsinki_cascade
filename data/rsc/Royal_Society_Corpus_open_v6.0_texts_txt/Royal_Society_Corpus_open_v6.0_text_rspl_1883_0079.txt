47 reason that I have sought to extend my observations to other compounds of titanium , and to vary the nature of the reactions involved in the chemical process .
Unfortunately it is found that comparatively few bodies containing titanium lend themselves to the purpose of atomic weight determination .
I am , however , making observations with the tetrabromide , which , in some respects , is to be preferred to the tetrachloride , and the results furnished by its analysis will be given in a second communication , which will also contain details respecting the preparation of the substances used , the methods of weighing , the processes of manipulation , effect of errors , \amp ; c. With reference to the tetrabromide , I may here say that I find it can be very easily made by the action of hydrobromic acid gas upon the chloride , and that this proves to be a more convenient method of preparation than that by which it was first obtained by Duppa .

" On the Life History of the Dock iEcidium rumicis , Schlecth ) .

Communicated by W. Thiselton Dyer , M.A. , F.R.S. Received November 10 , 1883 .
This vEcidium , which is common in this country upon Jiydrolapathum , Huds , , obtusifolius , Linn. , Linn. , and conglomerate , Murray , was regarded by Fuck el* and Cookef as being a condition of JJromyces rumicis ( Schum .
) , is now stated by WinterJ in his last work to be a condition of Puccinia magnusiana .
During the present year I have conducted a series of cultures , in which the life history of this fungus has been carefully , if not laboriously , worked out , from which it appears that rumicis bears the same relationship to Puccinia phragmitis ( Schum .
) ( =P .
, D C. ) as JEcidium berberidis , Grmel .
, bears to Puccinia graminis , Perss .
History of the Subject.\#151 ; Winter , in 1875 , S showed that those botanists who had associated this AEcidium with the TJromyces , simply because these two fungi occurred upon the same host plant , were wrong , and that the fungus in question was the secidiospore of Puccinia phragmitis .
Stahl , in 1876 , repeated Winter 's experiment , and confirmed it .
Now it happens that there are two Puccinice common upon Phragmitis communis , the ( Schum .
) , and P. magnusiana , Korn.|| In March , 1877 , Schroter^f placed the spores * Fuckel , " Symbol .

[ Nov. 22 , of hoth these Puccinice upon Bumex ( the species Winter originally experimented with ) , and found that the ^Ecidium was only produced from P. magnusiana .
Winter , * in the " Kryptogamen-Flora , " now in course of publication , accepts Schroter 's statement , and gives as the aecidiospores of P magnusiana , not only the JEcidium on Bumex hydrolapathum , but also on B. conglomeratus , obtusifolius , and acetosa , and adds a note to the effect that the ri^cidium upon Bheum officinale has probably the same life history .
Personal Investigations.\#151 ; In 1882 I performed a number of experimental cultures for the purpose of personally observing the life history of the hetercecismal uredines generally .
For instance , upon two occasions , a handful of reed leaves and stems were laid upon healthy plants of Bumex conglomeratus ; after a time these plants became affected with JEJcidmm rumicis , and I naturally concluded that this had arisen from the spores of magnusiana which I had observed upon the reeds employed .
Afterwards , upon three separate occasions , when I had become more expert in performing these experiments , I applied the spores of P. magnusiana to other plants of Bumex conglomeratus and once to B. obtusifolius , but without producing any riUcidium .
Subsequent research has rendered clear that on the reeds used in my first two experiments , both were present .
Being desirous of finding , if possible , the aecidiospores of P. phragmitis , if this plant possessed any , I this year placed its spores upon various Banunculi ( B. repens and but without any result .
It then occurred to me that Winter might be in error in affiliating all the dock aecidia to P. magnusiana , and that perchance on some of them the aecidiospores of P. phragmitis might occur .
This presumption was favoured by the fact that the aedicia we have been in the habit in this country of lumping together as lacearum include two species which , although resembling each other very closely in appearance , have distinct life histories .
I , therefore , on 16th May ( 1883 ) , placed sporesf of Puccinia phragmitis upon 'Bumex crispus , and in due time obtained an abundant crop of JEcidium rumicis .
On 16th June , when the ^Ecidiurn was perfectly mature , I placed some of its spores upon two plants of Phragmitis where it produced , first the uredo ( distinguished from the uredo of P. magnusiana by the absence of paraphyses ) , and later the perfect Puccinia phragmitis .
Subsequently plants of Bumex hydrolapathum , obtusifolius , conglomeratus , and Bheum officinale , were successfully infected with Puccinia phragmitis spores ; whereas the infection of other specimens of these plants with Puccinia was in all * Winter , " Babenhorst 's Kryptogamen-Flora , " 1881 , p. 222 .

I have elsewhere spoken of these spores as " promycelium spores .

" Some Relations of Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-Electric Action of Metals in Electrolytes .
" By G. Gore , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received November 14 , 1883 .
( Abstract .
) The author states that the object of this research was " to ascertain the thermo-electric action of a series of metals in particular liquids , and to examine the relations of the thermo-electric to the cliemico-electric behaviour of metals in electrolytes , and to ordinary chemical corrosion , and the source of the voltaic current .
" With this object , the thermo-electric tension series , also the chemico-electric tension series , at 60 ' and 160 ' F. of thirteen metals in solutions of twenty-two different salts , alkalies , and acids , were experimentally found , and are shown in two tables .
The same thermo- and chemico-electric series were also determined in solutions of different strengths of the same substances , and are also exhibited in two tables ; and the effects of difference of strength of liquid upon the orders of those series are inferred from the results .
Several other tables contain series of determinations of the electric potentials , in volts , of numerous thermo-electric , and also of chemico-electric couples of the same series of metals in the weak solutions and in the strong ones , and show the influence of strength of liquid upon thermo-electric and chemico-electric potential .
The measurements of potential were made by means of a new form of thermopile ( see " Proc. Birm .
Phil. Soc. , " vol. iv , Part 1 ) .
The influence of temperature upon the chemico-electric potential of those metals in the series of weak solutions , and also in the strong ones , at 60 ' and 160 ' F. , was also determined , and the results are given in several tables .
The " voltaic reversal points , " or temperatures at which the two metals of a voltaic pair balanced each other , and produced no current , in fifty-four different cases discovered during the research , were also determined and are given .
The metals and solutions employed were the same as those used in the previous series of experiments .
