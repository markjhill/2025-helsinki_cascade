From this last equation the value of may be deduced ; but it is more convenient to ambiguities of sign as follows .
In the formula , put , then ( 1 ) , since Also , in the formula dn put , and ( 2 ) , whence from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) xtracting the square root , we have ; it is evident from the -series for ( see S 8 of the paper ) , that the sign of the real or imaginary parts is positive as above .
