A paper was read , " On the Thermostat or Heat Governor , a self-acttng physical Apparatus for regulating Temperature j " constructed by Andrew Ur , M.D. , F.R.S. The principle of the instrument here described is the unequal expansion of different metals by heat .
A bar of zinc , alloyed with four or five per cent. of copper , and one of tin , about an inch in breadth , one quarter of an inch thick , and two feet long , is firmly and closely riveted along its face to the face of a similar bar of steel of about one third in thickness .
The product of the rigidity and strength should be nearly the same , so that the texture of each may pretty equally resist the strains of flexure .
Twelve such compound bars are united in pairs by a hinge joint at each of their ends ; having the zinc or alloy bars fronting one another .
At ordinary temperatures these bars will be parallel , and nearly in contact ; but when heated , they bend outwards , receding from each other at their middle parts , like two bows tied together at their ends .
When a more considerable expansion is wanted , a series of such bars is laid one over the other .
The movement thus resuhing is applied by the author in various ways to regulate the opening of dampers , letting in either cold air or cold water , or closing the draught of a fireplace , as the case may be .
He proposes its employment to regu ?
late the safety valves of steam boilers , as working with more certainty than the common expedients .
