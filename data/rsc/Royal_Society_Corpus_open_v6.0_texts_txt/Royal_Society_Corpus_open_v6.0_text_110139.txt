] The author commences by observing , that on attempting the various methods proposed by astronomers for ascertaining by actual observation the amount of atmospherical refraction at low altitudes , they all proved impracticable at Port Bowen , by reason of the intense cold , which rendered it impossible to use the repeating circle or other similar instruments .
The method therefore proposed by Lieutenant Foster , and modified by Captain Parry , which was found successful , was , to place a board edgeways and truly horizontal on that part of the high land behind which a given star set , and observe the moments of its disappearance .
Then , determining at leisure the zenith distance of the upper edge of the board on the return of the sun , and in weather better fitted for delicate observations , the stars fixed on were a Aquilse and Arcturus ; and the paper before us gives a detailed account of a series of observations of the moments of disappearance of both these stars , and also of the zenith distances of the boards employed by the several observers enumerated in the title .
In some cases also , the reappearance of the star below the board was observed , thus giving an observation at another altitude , and the angular breadth of the board was afterwards measured by a micrometer from the station of observation .
