Electric Potential Gradient and only determination of k is by Eucken , * and that eight of his values of k are low compared to those of other observers .
If the values of 7 we have used for Cl2 , S02 , and H2S are correct , the direction of the displacement of the pbints for these gases from the straight line would arise from using a low value of k in deriving / .
In conclusion , we wish to express our indebtedness to Mr. M. Alexander , M.Sc .
, who carried out part of the preliminary work , and calibrated some of the instruments used ; to Mr. H. S. Tily , who took the measurements of the discs ; and to Mr. H. E. Straw bridge , whose skilful execution of the mechanical work made the success of the experiments possible .
Grants for the apparatus were received from the New Zealand Government Research Scholarship Fund .

Electric Potential Gradient and Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .

It has long been known at Kew Observatory that thick fog is generally accompanied by a high value of the electrical potential gradient .
During fog the oscillations of potential , which are common even in the electrically quietest of days , are sometimes very large ; but whether they are exceptionally large , when expressed as a percentage of the mean gradient for the hour , has not been investigated .
There is this peculiarity , however , that sometimes during fog the gradient oscillates between a positive and a negative value , a phenomenon which is quite exceptional except during rain or a thunderstorm .
It occurred to me to examine the records for a series of years to see whether any information could be derived as to the existence or formation of fog .
The appearance of the electrogram during heavy fog is usually so characteristic that from it alone one could say with a close approach to certainty that fog existed .
Thus electrograms may be of considerable value as confirmatory evidence of fog when direct evidence is lacking .
But the * Eucken 's observations were relative to air , for which he assumes \#163 ; = 5*66 x 10 ~5 .
We have reduced his observations to the basis of Jc \#151 ; 5*22 x 10"5 .
Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .
211 influence of light fog or mist does not seem sufficiently regular and dominant to encourage the hope that potential gradient curves by themselves can serve satisfactorily as a prognostic of fog .
During the inquiry several results were reached which seemed of scientific interest , especially in connection with the diurnal variation of potential gradient .
It has been the practice at Kew Observatory for many years to take visibility observations at certain fixed hours of the day .
For this purpose use has been made of a number of distant objects , particulars of which are given in Table I. Numbers 2 to 13 were originally assigned to the objects .
In some cases a single number includes two or three different objects , those grouped together not differing very much in distance from the Observatory .
What was originally intended by this grouping is not known .
It may have been that the possibility was foreseen that some of the objects would , in course of time , cease to be available .
The objects differ much in size , outline , and colour , and those of them that are trees naturally present considerable difference of appearance at different seasons of the year .
Also the distances are largely a matter of accident , not being based on any very definite plan .
Thus the scheme would no doubt be capable of improvement , but , such as it is , it has been in continuous operation since May , 1892 .
It owed its inauguration to the late Dr. R. H. Scott , F.R.S. , when director of the Meteorological Office .

Electric Potential Gradient and The objects to which an asterisk is attached have ceased to exist , or become invisible , owing to the growth of intermediate trees .
The objects are always looked at from ground level , but are not all visible from one spot .
The observer enters in the observation book the number belonging to the nearest of the objects that is invisible .
If all the objects are visible , the entry is 1 ; if all but Mortlake chimney are visible , the entry is 2 ; and so on .
Thus an increasing number answers to increasing opacity of the air .
The scale is thus most conveniently regarded as one of opacity rather than visibility .
The range of visibility included under 1 is undoubtedly too large for any nicety of discrimination .
In summer months entries even of figure 2 , as will be seen presently , are rare , and at that season at least several objects more distant than Mortlake chimney would be desirable .
The Surrey hills are visible from the roof , but at the epoch when the scheme was introduced no object more distant than the Mortlake chimney was visible from the ground .
Entries from 2 to 6 are regarded as answering to mist , larger numbers representing different degrees of fog .
In some of the subsequent applications Nos. 4 , 5 , and 6 are put in one group called 4 ' , Nos. 7 , 8 , and 9 in another group , 5 ' , and finally Nos. 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , in a group called 6 ' .
This gives five degrees of opacity , 2 , 3 , 4 ' , 5 ' , and 6 ' , which might also be described as mi , m2 , w ?
3 , / i , / 2 , the letters m and / representing mist and fog respectively , and the suffix representing intensity .
The visibility of an object naturally depends on the hour of the day and the season of the year , as well as on the opacity of the air .
Thus in applications of the opacity data it will probably be found expedient to treat the different hours of the day and the different seasons of the year independently .
This is , of course , especially true of early or late observation hours .
For instance , of recent years , 7 h. ( 7 a.m. ) has been a regular observation hour , but while 7 h. in June or July is quite a favourable hour for distant observations , this is not the case near mid-winter when the sun is below the horizon .

In 1911 the opacity observations for previous years were classified by the Observatory staff , in response to a request from the Meteorological Office for fog data .
The epoch dealt with extended from the start in May , 1892 , to the end of 1910 , but the results for 1894 were defective , owing to the loss of observation books .
Thus it appeared best for the present inquiry to omit the two incomplete years 1892 and 1894 altogether .
Monthly mean opacity results have been derived from the remaining 17 years combined .
The results so obtained are given in Tables II and III for the 4 regular hours of observation , 10 h. ( 10 a.m. ) , 12 h. ( noon ) , 14 h. ( 2 p.m. ) , and 16 h. ( 4 p.m. ) .
i Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .
213 Observations at 14 h. were generally lacking for Saturday , and observations at both 14 h. and 16 h. for Sunday .
Thus the number of observations available was less for these hours than for 10 h. and 12 h. This is one of the reasons why it appeared best to express all the results as percentages .
In each case equal weight has been allowed to each individual observation .
If , instead , equal weight had been allowed to the means derived from the separate years , it would have made little difference , as the number of observations lacking did not vary much from year to year .
The number of occasions of thick mist or fog was so small , especially in the summer months , that it appeared unnecessary to take up the room required to give full particulars for each of the 13 degrees of opacity for each of the 12 months .
This is done in Table II only for three seasons : Winter ( comprising November , December , January , and February ) ; Equinox ( comprising March , April , September , and October ) , and Summer ( comprising May , June , July , and August ) .
Under Year is given the results derived from all the observations of the year combined .
The division of the year into two seasons , winter and summer , the latter including the six months April to September , is more usual for meteorological purposes , but it has the disadvantage of grouping together months which differ very widely .
By restricting winter to the four months , January , February , November , and December , and summer to the four months May to August , we secure two seasons of comparative homogeneity , so far , at least , as atmospheric opacity is concerned .
The third season , termed equinox for brevity , is less homogeneous .
Also the conditions are probably more variable from year to year in the four months comprising it than in other months , depending as they do on whether winter is early or late .
It is at once apparent from Table II that certain of the opacity figures , especially Nos. 6 , 8 , and 10 , appear but seldom as compared with the figures next them , whether larger or smaller .
This is explained , at least partly , in the case of No. 6 , by the fact that the corresponding distant object , as time went on , got eclipsed by intermediate trees , and practically ceased to exist .
In the other cases there is no obvious explanation , but it would be at least premature to assume that the phenomenon was independent of the nature of the particular distant object .
The fact , whatever its explanation , was one of the reasons for the combination of the higher opacity figures in the groups adopted in Table III .
A study of Tables II and III shows that , of the four observation hours included , 14 h. is the best and 10 h. the worst for visibility , the whole year round .
On the whole 16 h. shows less opacity than 12 h. , even in winter .
In summer the opacity figures 5 ' and 6 ' are very rare , and even figure 4 ' is Table II.\#151 ; Frequency of Opacity Observations as Percentages of Total Observations .

The results obtained for equinox at all four hours show a pretty close approach to the results for the year as a whole , which implies that equinox , as far as opacity is concerned , comes nearly midway between summer and winter .
A study of Table III shows that at each of the four hours July emerges as the month of greatest visibility , though its superiority to August is very small , especially at 10 h. Except at 16 h. , May has fully more occasions than June when all objects are visible , but the number of occasions falling under 4 ' and 5 ' are greater for May than for June .
At the other end of the Dr. C. Cliree .
Electric Potential Gradient and scale , November makes , on the whole , the poorest appearance , especially at 10 h. February shows decidedly better visibility at all the hours than the other winter months , but it is very much inferior to March .
There is also a very big difference between October and November .
It is pretty obvious that , except in winter , opacity from 4 ' to 6 ' happens so rarely that it must be difficult to obtain satisfactory mean results at these opacities for any correlated phenomenon .
S 3 .
There would have been an obvious advantage in using for comparison potential gradient results for the same 17 years .
No measurements had , however , been made of potential gradient for the earlier years , and changes had been introduced in the Kelvin water-dropping electrograph , its position , and the external environment , the effects of which it would have been impossible adequately to allow for .
The investigation was thus limited , in the first instance , to the ten years , 1900 to 1909 .
Use was made of curve measurements already existing .
These were limited to the selected days , usually 10 a month , on which the diurnal inequalities published yearly have been based .
The essential characteristic of a selected day is the absence of negative potential .
In general , negative potential means rain , and rain implies negative potential .
But there are exceptions to both rules .
As already mentioned , negative potential is occasionally encountered during fog , and it occurs on other occasions without rain actually falling at the station itself .
On the other hand , there is occasionally rain , at least light rain , during the whole duration of which the gradient remains positive .
The characteristic of rain is not so much negative potential as changes of sign from positive to negative and negative to positive .
No day on which rain was known to have fallen would be selected , unless the fall were very slight and had no apparently serious effect on the potential .
Days in which there were prominent irregularities in the changes of potential , e.g. , sudden rapid rises or falls , or in which the insulation of the electrograph was decidedly inferior , were naturally excluded , provided there was an adequate choice of better days .
But sometimes it is difficult , especially in winter months , to get as many as 10 days completely free from negative potential , and irregular curves have to be included which we would prefer to omit .
Occasionally it has been necessary to employ " days " consisting of 24-hour periods not commencing at Greenwich midnight , and even with that expedient it has been impossible in some months to get the full number of days .
The principle of selection would , in some cases , militate against the selection of days of very thick fog .
Suppose , for instance , a rise of temperature during the day , following a very thick night of fog .
The afternoon and i Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .
217 subsequent night might be quite free from fog .
The potential gradient record for the earlier and later parts of the day would then present so violent a contrast that one would naturally exclude the day when making a choice which had in view the determination of the regular diurnal inequality .
One of the things one specially wishes to avoid is a large difference between successive midnight values , owing to the uncertainties latent in the ordinary method of applying non-cyclic corrections .
The mode of procedure was as follows : The individual hourly readings given in the original tabulation sheets were entered in columns headed 1 to 13 , according to the corresponding opacity figuTe entered in the meteorological observation books .
This was done for the 10 months of the same name , the readings for each month being multiplied by the factor necessary to convert electrogram ordinates into volts per metre in the open .
The columns were then summed and means taken , respect being paid only to the total number of observations , irrespective of the years from which they were derived .
To explain the full significance of this , a word of explanation is necessary as to the procedure normally followed at Kew Observatory .
On all fair days , when possible , absolute eye readings of potential gradient are taken with a portable apparatus , under conditions which are intended to give the potential gradient in the open , that is as it would be in the absence of trees , buildings , or observers .
Comparing the voltages thus obtained with the corresponding measurements in millimetres of the electrogram ordinates , a factor is obtained .
Applying this to any ordinate measured in millimetres , we obtain the corresponding value of the potential gradient in the open .
Each month is treated by itself .
If instrumental conditions were perfect , and the position of the water jet invariable , one would expect the factor to be constant .
It varies , however , very considerably , sometimes for causes definitely ascertained , such as change of sensitiveness in the quadrant electrometer of the electrograph .
In other cases the cause is more or less uncertain .
At times , undoubtedly , inferior insulation is a contributory cause .
Sometimes the number of eye reading comparisons in the open has been undesirably small , or the differences between the results of individual comparisons during the same month have been unusually prominent .
Thus , no doubt , the factors applied have a very sensible probable error , especially in the winter months , when observational conditions are least favourable and insulation troubles are apt to be at their maximum .
It was explained in a previous paper* that special experiments made in 1910 showed that in years piioi to that date the conditions of an infinite plane had not been sufficiently * ' Phil. Trans. , ' A , vol. 215 , p. 133 .
W i 218 Dr. C. Chree .
Electric Potential Gradient and realised in the absolute observations , and that a constant multiplier was thus necessary to the values assigned to the voltages in earlier years .
This factor has been duly applied in the present case .
It must be allowed that uncertainty as to the factors may be more important in an investigation such as the present than it is in the usual course .
When one is concerned with the diurnal inequality of one single month , supposing the factor really constant throughout the month , an error in its value would not affect the type of the diurnal inequality in the least ; it would only affect its amplitude .
Even if the factor varied throughout the month , so long as the variation were wholly irregular and unrelated to the hours of the day , the effect on the diurnal inequality would be unlikely to be serious .
In the present case , however , it might be different .
Suppose , for instance , the accepted value of the factor to be considerably too high for a certain January when fog was unusually prevalent , and considerably too low for another January wholly free from fog , the result would undoubtedly be to simulate a true fog relation .
It is reasonable , however , to suppose that any such effects , provided they are of an accidental character , must be very largely eliminated when 10 years ' observations are employed .
As regards the possibility of an effect of the kind not of an accidental character , the only probable way in which this could happen would be from an influence of fog on the insulation of the electrograph .
That is a conceivable possibility .
But if anything of the kind happens , it would be a deterioration , not an improvement , of insulation we should expect to find during fog , and , as we shall see presently , the phenomena observed cannot possibly be explained by inferior insulation .
The results of the inquiry appear in Tables IY and Y. Table IY , like Table II , includes all the 13 opacity figures , but is confined to the three seasons and the year ; while Table V treats of individual months , but employs the 6 opacity categories employed in Table III .
The figures represent the potential gradient in volts per metre in the open .
The number of observations on which individual data in Table IV depend is given in small type within brackets .
In Table V the letters or ii are intended to indicate a lesser or greater insufficiency of observations , meaning that the observations were less than 10 but exceeded 5 , while implies 5 or less .
It is not intended to claim that results based on 10 or more observations are thoroughly representative .
In Table IV the first column devoted to potentials gives the mean values of the gradient derived from the selected days of the 10 years .
The data assigned to the year in that Table are arithmetic means of the corresponding data from the three seasons ; equal weight is allotted in this case to the 3 seasons , not to the individual observations .

Electric Potential Gradient and that at all seasons the potential answering to opacity 2 is substantially greater than that answering to opacity 1 .
Also the number of observations for opacity 2 is sufficient to exclude the possibility of this difference being accidental , except perhaps at 14 h. in summer .
The number of observations for the higher opacity figures is rather restricted , especially in summer and at 14 h. Even in winter at 10 h. we should be hardly justified in concluding that the potential gradient goes on increasing as the opacity increases up to the limit ; but there is an obvious tendency for the potentials under the higher opacity figures to exceed those for opacity 2 .
Except in summer , where the differences at 12 h. , 14 h. , and 16 h. might be accidental , the potentials derived from the whole body of selected days are substantially higher than those under opacity heading 1 .
This excess is greatest in winter , and greater at 10 h. than at the other4 three hours .
This is , of course , only a natural consequence of the two facts that occurrences of opacity 2 and higher opacities are most frequent in winter and at 10 h. , and that higher potential goes with higher opacity .
But the consequences on the diurnal inequality and the annual inequality merit explicit mention .
It is obvious that if we restricted ourselves in our choice of selected days to days of superior visibility , we should , at least in winter , get a considerably different diurnal inequality .
According to Table IY the excess of the 10 h. over the 14 h. value of potential gradient at that season is 59 volts from the actually selected days , but only 24 volts from the observations at opacity 1 .
A smaller , but still substantial reduction in the range , when we confine ourselves to observations of opacity 1 is seen in equinox , and even in summer there is a small reduction .
As regards the annual inequality , if we take a mean from the values for the four hours , we have Winter .

Thus we cannot draw any very exact conclusion as to the true daily mean from the mean for the four specified hours .
But it seems quite clear that if we confined ourselves to observations of opacity 1 , i Table V-Mean Potential Gradients 1900-1909 for Different Atmospheric Opacitie Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .

Electric Potential Gradient and we should obtain not merely a lower mean value for the year than we obtain at present , but also a reduced difference between summer and winter .
In Table V there is one case , viz. , 14 h. in October , when there was no occurrence of opacity 2 .
Out of the other 47 cases there are only six in which the voltage for opacity 2 is less than that for opacity 1 , and of these six cases half had results for opacity 2 based on less than five observations .
There is only one case , viz. , 10 h. for September , where the opacity 1 figure shows an excess which it would seem unreasonable to regard as accidental .
S 4 .
In view of the large influence of atmospheric opacity on the potential gradient , it appeared desirable to ascertain whether the present method of selecting electrically quiet days gives a choice which is fairly representative of the average opacity at different seasons of the year .
An analysis of the opacity figures for the selected days of 1900 to 1909 was accordingly made and the results appear in Table YI .
They are limited to the three seasons and to the same six grades of opacity as were employed in Table III .
The only considerable difference between Tables II and VI\#151 ; and rather an unexpected one\#151 ; is that in winter the percentage figures for opacity 1 are all decidedly lower in Table YI than in Table II .
In other words , the selected electrically quiet days contained in winter a smaller proportion of days of good visibility than the normal .
The excess in the opacity percentages in Table VI occurs mainly for the lower opacities 2 , 3 , and 4 ' .
The figures for equinox in Tables II and VI are closely alike .
In the case of summer the percentage of occurrences for opacity 1 is in every case greater in Table VI than in Table II .

223 Tables II and VI are not based on identically the same years , the former including seven years not included in the latter .
Some difference between the two would thus be expected .
The most natural explanation is , however , that superior visibility is apt to be associated in winter with meteorological instability , while in summer inferior visibility is more associated with broken weather .
In the selection of the electrically quiet days broken weather is avoided as far as possible . .

The next investigation dealt with the three years 1910 , 1911 , and 1912 .
It was confined to the four winter months , and the two hours 10 h. and 16 h. But it included all days in which the potential at the hour was positive , provided rain were not actually falling , special measurements of the curves not previously measured having been made for the purpose .
Table VII contains the mean results from the three years .
The same six degrees of opacity are employed as in Tables III and VI .

Thus in the monthly means all days are treated alike , irrespective of the years they come from ; and in the means assigned to winter all days are treated alike , irrespective of the month or year they come from .
The reason for this was the small number of occasions of high opacity , and the desirability of VOL. xcv.\#151 ; a. T Dr. C. Chree .
Electric Potential Gradient and reducing accidental features as far as possible .
The number of observations actually available was 307 at 10 h. and 282 at 16 h. The reduced number for the later hour was due to blanks in the visibility data .
The first ten lines give the values of the potential gradient corresponding to the specified opacities , the number of observations being given in each case in smaller type in brackets .
The last four lines give the percentage of the total number of observations having the respective atmospheric opacities .
The normal distribution of observations as regards opacity is derived from Table II .
The difference between the potentials for opacities 1 and 2 is even more decisive in Table VII , especially at 10 h. , than in Tables IY and Y. Also the evidence for a still further material rise in the potential as the opacity rises above 2 seems overwhelming , at least at 10 h. The observations at that hour for winter for opacities 4 ' and 5 ' numbered 46 and 13 respectively , so the phenomenon can hardly be ascribed wholly to accident .
The deficiency in the potentials for opacity 1 , as compared with those from all the selected days , is conspicuous in every case .
A remarkable feature is the absolute identity of the mean potentials for opacity 1 at 10 h. and 16 h. Considering the variability in the corresponding results for the individual months , the result must be regarded as partly accidental ; but it at least emphasises the importance of the part which the diurnal variation of atmospheric opacity may play in the problems of atmospheric electricity .
An interesting by-product of the investigation disclosed by the figures at the foot of Table YII is the* fact that , as compared with the earlier years , 1910 , 1911 , and 1912 show a marked reduction in the number of hours having the high opacity figures 5 ' and 6 ' .
Fog , according to the Kew criterion , had only about half the frequency it possessed in the earlier years 1892 to 1909 .

Visibility observations at 7 a.m. were not taken at Kew Observatory until nearly the end of 1910 , some months after the Observatory passed into the hands of the Meteorological Office .
Table VIII gives a summary of the results derived from the two years 1911 and 1912 , omitting the months of January and December , when visibility observations are prejudiced by the absence of daylight .
Only those hours were omitted when potential was negative , or rain was falling , or the potential trace was defective , or the visibility observation was lacking .
This entailed , of course , special measurement of the electrograms on other than the selected days .
The first column in Table VIII gives for comparison the monthly mean potential gradient at 7 A.M. as derived from the annual tables based on the selected days ; each figure in that column is the arithmetic mean of the i Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .

In the other columns equal weight is attached to each observation , irrespective of the year it belongs to .
The opacity headings have the same meanings as in Tables V to VII ; but the number of observations for the two highest categories was so- few that the two were combined .
As before , the number of observations is given in small type in brackets .
It is obvious that the phenomena described at the later observation hours exist also at 7 h. There are only two months in Table VIII , August and September , in which the potential for opacity 2 is not largely in excess of that for opacity 1 .
The deficiency in the figure for opacity 2 in these two months is too small to claim much significance .
At the same time , September showed the same phenomenon , and to a marked degree , in Table V , so the point may be worth further investigation .
It will be noticed that at 7 a.m. opacity 2 days are fairly common , even in summer .
In fact , for the four months May to August combined they represent 28 per cent , of the total number of days .
Thus , even for summer , the substantial superiority of the potential for opacity 2 over that for opacity 1 seems fairly established .
The number of occasions of higher opacity is small in most individual months .
The only exceptions to this are the occurrences of opacity 3 in September and of opacities 5 ' and 6 ' in October .
In both these cases the excess in the potential over that for opacities 1 and 2 is substantial .
Comparing the potentials from the selected days with those for opacity 1 , we have in every month a large excess in the former figures .
The average excess is 37 for the four summer months , 82 for the four equinoctial months , and 102 for the two winter months .
The range shown by the selected days ( excess of February over June value ) is 118 , whereas the range for opacity 1 ( excess of November over June value ) is only 73 volts .

Electric Potential Gradient and S 7 .
In 1911 the practice was introduced of measuring the electrograms .daily , irrespective of the type of weather , at 3 h. , 9 h. , 15 h. , and 21 h. , and at the end of April , 1914 , the hours of the ordinary meteorological observations , including the visibility observations , were altered from 10 h. , 12 h. , 14 h. , 16 h. , and 22 h. , to 9 h. , 13 h. , 15 h. , 18 h. , and 21 h. This has , incidentally , supplied a large number of corresponding data for potential gradient and atmospheric opacity at 9 h. and 15 h. The correspondence is not exact because the visibility observation occupies a few minutes at most , whereas the potential gradient is intended to be a mean value from 60 minutes centering at the hour .
When we are dealing with means from a large number of observations the difference is unessential .
For the present investigation hours were omitted when there was rain , or the potential was negative or so highly oscillatory that no satisfactory reading could be taken .
There were also a few omissions when the electrograph insulation was defective , or the record failed , and other occasions when there was no opacity figure assigned .
Taking the four winter months , the period November , 1914 , to February , 1917 , supplied for comparative purposes a total of 286 hours at 9 h. , and 258 hours at 15 h. The mean results obtained for the four months and for winter , allowing in each case equal weight to each observation , are given in Table IX .
The opacity headings have the same significance as before , and the number of observations is given in small type in brackets .
The comparative figures in the first column from the selected days are from the same months as the other figures , equal weight in their case being allowed to each Table IX.\#151 ; Potential and Opacity Results , 1914-1917 .

A good many of the potentials for opacities 3 to 6 ' are based on too few observations to possess much individual weight , but the general results are clearly shown .
The tendency in the potential to rise as the opacity increases seems undoubted .
The difference between the potential at 9 h. and 15 b. in winter , which was 80 volts on the average selected day , falls to 16 volts when we confine ourselves to occasions when all the distant objects were visible .
The years employed in Tables VIE and IX are entirely different , and no conclusions can safely be drawn in the way of a comparison of absolute voltages at hours 9 and 10 or hours 15 and 16 .
This is all the more the case because the site of the electrograph and height of the water-dropper discharge tube above the ground were altered in 1915 .
S 8 .
The observers at 21 h. or 22 h. do not , of course , see the more distant objects unless th^re is moonlight .
They thus do not employ the opacity terminology , but report mist ( m ) or fog ( / ) when clearly apparent .
Naturally no great nicety of distinction is possible .
There were accordingly corresponding data for potential gradient and clear atmosphere , mist and fog at 21 h. from November , 1914 , to February , 1917 .
There were , however , no eye observations of visibility of any kind at 3 h. In the absence of direct information to the contrary , it has been assumed that the atmospheric conditions as regards mist or fog at 3 h. , were the same as at 21 h. on the previous day .
The rain-gauge charts of course supplied the necessary information as to the presence or absence of rain .
Table X shows the mean results obtained .
Comparative figures are given for the selected days , and the number of observations for the separate categories are shown as before .
Occasionally , no doubt , when there is a sudden change of wind or weather , fog conditions in the Thames valley alter markedly between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. next morning .

Electric Potential Gradient and the results for 3 h. in Table X are less reliable than the others .
At the same time the close resemblance between the results at that hour from the different months for clear and for misty weather , and the large differences between the potentials for these two categories seem inexplicable , unless we accept the general accuracy of the assigned weather characteristics .
In every case in Table X there is a marked rise in the potential as we pass from clear to misty conditions , and in the case of 3 h. the same is true when we pass from misty to foggy conditions .
At 21 h. the potential for fog falls below that for mist in three of the months , but the opposite is the case in the only month , December , for which there was at all an adequate number of foggy observations .
One important respect in which Table X differs from the earlier Tables is , that it shows an enhanced difference between the mean value at the two hours when we confine ourselves to occasions in which the atmosphere is clear , instead of taking all selected days .
This is the more important because the extreme maximum and minimum of potential for the day occur , the one between 19 h. and 21 h. , the other between 3 h. and 4 h. A similar investigation to the last was carried out for the winter of 1913-14 , employing the potential gradient results that had been obtained daily at 3 h. , 9 h. , 15 h. , and 21 h. There being no corresponding visibility observations , it was assumed that the conditions as to clear atmosphere , mist , or fog were the same at 9h .
as at 10 h. , at 15 h. as at 16 h. , and at 21 h. as at 22 h. , also that the meteorological conditions at 3 h. were the same as at 22 h. on the previous day .
The results appear in Table XI , the observations from the four months , November , December , January , and February , being combined .
The number of observations is given in small figures in brackets , and corresponding voltages are added from the selected days .

In all cases days of rain or negative potential have been omitted .
As already explained , identity is not to be expected between corresponding data from different groups of years ; but instrumental and other similar sources of uncertainty ought not to have any serious effect on the relative values of the potential gradient at different hours of the day for the same group of years .

The main difference from the inequality derived from all selected days would be that the secondary minimum in the early afternoon in winter would be largely , if not entirely , obliterated .
In summer the double oscillation would apparently remain nearly as prominent as before .
This may mean that the afternoon minimum in summer , and also to a certain extent in equinox , is due to a different cause from that which is chiefly operative in winter .
It must , however , be remembered that the criteria in use are unsuitable for determining degrees of opacity in summer .
Category 1 is at that season far too wide for discrimination .
It is at least conceivable that if we had a criterion which excluded half the days as atmospherically opaque , the diurnal inequality derived from the remainder might differ substantially from that derived from the present selected days .
The preparation of diurnal inequalities is in general a matter of routine .
A scheme is brought into operation and adhered to .
So far this is a very good thing .
Nothing could be more unsatisfactory than frequent modifications of the scheme .
But it is well occasionally to consider what exactly is the use , present or prospective , of such inequalities .
In the case of such an element as atmospheric temperature the results are in themselves immediately 230 Dr. C. Chree .
Electric Potential Gradient and useful ; though , once the average character of the diurnal change has been fairly ascertained , the value of successive years ' data diminishes .
They do not cease to possess a practical value , because Nature , so far as we know , never repeats herself exactly , and the differences between different years are considerable .
A second use , which in the case of an element like atmospheric electricity , is probably the most important , is to secure information calculated to throw light on the causes of the phenomena or on their relation to other phenomena .
The practical utility of diurnal inequalities depends on how closely the great majority of days approach the average day .
The immediate utility is much reduced if the inequality represents a mean from which most individual days differ widely .
One of the outstanding features in diurnal inequalities of potential gradient has been the conspicuous differences between corresponding months and even seasons in different years .
It is a question not merely of the amplitude , but even of the type of the inequality .
We now see that at least in winter there naturally must be great differences between months having much and months having little mist and fog .
It is a question not merely of the total of misty and foggy hours in the month , but of how they are distributed throughout the day .
There may , of course , be other important contributory causes to the differences between different years .
The most natural way of increasing our knowledge in that direction is to form separate diurnal inequalities from days of different meteorological character , bqt the variations in meteorological character throughout the 24 hours are generally considerable and sometimes enormous .
Thus less direct ways of attacking the problem may be preferable .
S 10 .
Some of the physical aspects of the problem can best be realised by considering a specific imaginary case .
Suppose the figure to represent the cross-section BOB ' of a long symmetrical valley , AOA ' being the horizontal through 0 , the lowest point and centre of the cross-section .
Let there be level plateaus to the right of B and left of B ' , the slopes at B and B ' on the valley side being infinitesimal .
Suppose the complete width BB ' ( = AA ' ) to be 2000 metres , and the vertical heights of B and B ' above AA ' to be 100 metres .
So far as potential gradient near O or near the vertical OC is concerned , the conditions approach so nearly to those for an infinite plane Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .
that the difference may for our present purpose be neglected .
The same is supposed to be true of the immediate vicinity of B and B ' .
On an ordinary day we may take 200 volts per metre as the mean value of the potential gradient throughout the height 00 .
If now fog fills the valley just short of the level BOB ' , the mean value of the potential gradient throughout OC will naturally be higher , say 500 volts per metre .
The potentials of the surface of the ground at O and B may not be absolutely identical\#151 ; a point we shall return to\#151 ; but the difference at all events is at most a volt or two , more likely a fraction of a volt .
Thus on the average day the potential at C will be 20,000 volts higher than that at B , while on the foggy day it will be 50,000 volts higher .
Thus there will be a horizontal potential gradient averaging 20 volts per metre in the one case and 50 volts in the other .
We should thus expect a horizontal electric current of the order of one-tenth of the vertical air-earth current to flow from the atmosphere over the centre of the valley to either side .
If such a current exists , the presence of fog may make a large difference to its magnitude .
The problem must be a complicated one .
At a considerable height above the ground all trace of the influence of the valley must disappear , and the equipotential surfaces be horizontal .
Thus the average gradient between the height in question and C must be less than that between the said height and B. Accordingly , if the air-earth current be , as usual , directed downwards , and if it consists of positive ions , more of these will naturally travel to B than to O ( through C ) .
This suggests a way in which the horizontal current indicated above could be maintained .
The potential gradient being much higher at O under the foggy conditions supposed than at B , which is clear of fog , there will be a much larger negative ground charge at the former station than the latter .
The vertical air-earth current may be due not to positive ions travelling down , but to negative ions travelling up .
There is a greater supply of negative ions at O than at B , under a higher electrical pressure ; and if the conductivity of the atmosphere were the same at the two places , we should have a larger vertical current at O than at B. But the moisture in the foggy air will naturally load up the ions and reduce their mobility , and whether the vertical current at O or at B is the bigger is thus a question which only experiment can decide .
It is obviously a question of interest .
The supply of negative electricity at the earth 's surface is usually adequate to maintain the vertical current only for half an hour or so .
This negative charge may be constantly being manufactured inside the earth ( the corresponding positive charge being perhaps stored in some radioactive material ) .
But , however this may be , we should naturally expect , even in fine weather , still more in foggy , some 232 Dr. C. Chree .
Electric Potential Gradient and superficial earth currents to pass from the centre to the sides of the valley or conversely .
With shifting fog or passing clouds there are undoubtedly at times changes of potential gradient of the order of 100 volts per minute .
Conditions at 0 and B will not in general alter simultaneously .
Thus it is difficult to see how the earth potentials at 0 and B can do anything but differ , though the differences may be too small to detect easily .
The whole question of earth currents is a difficult one , and the growing use of large artificial electric currents near large centres of population introduces fresh complications .
Thus , while there is an obvious field for enquiry , it is one that promises to be very difficult to explore .
Appendix ( October 30 ) .
A comparison has been made between the results of the opacity observations at 15 h. for the months of October , November , December , January , February , and March , with the corresponding measurements of the air-earth electric current , and the positive and negative free charges in the atmosphere .
The comparison extended from October , 1914 , to March , 1918 .
The results for the air-earth current were derived from observations made wTith Mr. C. T. R Wilson 's apparatus , those for the positive and negative charges were obtained with an Ebert apparatus .
The results of the individual observations appear month by month in the 'Geophysical Journal ' of the Meteorological Office .
In dealing with the positive and negative charges , only those days were utilised when results were available for the charges of both signs .
A factor is probably wanted to reduce the observations made with the Wilson apparatus to the theoretical free exposure in an infinite plane , but this should not have any influence on relative values .
In the Table of results equal value has been assigned to each observation , irrespective of the year it belonged to , or in the case of the winter mean of the month it came from .
In calculating E+ / E_ , values of E+ and E- going to three significant figures were used .
The number of observations is given in small type in brackets .
In five months out of the six the current is less for opacity 2 than opacity 1 .
Thus the difference , though not large in the winter mean , is probably real .
In every month the current is very decidedly reduced when the opacity exceeds 2 .
The number of observations with higher opacity than 2 is insufficient to warrant much weight being assigned to individual figures , but it seems practically certain that with the higher opacities the reduction in current is large .
In the case of free positive charges , no certain conclusion can perhaps be drawn .
If opacity has an effect , it would seem to be small .
In the case of free negative charges , the difference between the results i Atmospheric Opacity at Kew Observatory .

under opacities 1 and 2 is small .
In view , however , of the consistently lower values obtained for E+/ E- for opacity 2 , there can be little doubt that the difference is real .
For opacities greater than 2 , the increase in the negative charge and the reduction in E+/ E- seems fairly established , in spite of the undesirably low number of the observations .
The effect of mist and fog is to increase the free negative charge in the air near the ground ( which has its usual negative surface charge enhanced by fog ) , but so greatly to reduce the mobility of the ions that in spite of the increased potential gradient there is a substantial reduction of the air-earth current .
Mean values for E+ , E- , and E+/ E- , based on observations made at Kew Observatory during 1911 , 1912 , and 1914 , and a discussion of the apparatus and methods will be found in papers by Messrs. Gordon Dobson* and E. H. Nichols.f On the Nature of Sun-Spots .

Mem. R.S. ( Abstract.\#151 ; Received October 31 , 1918 .
) The researches described in the present paper were undertaken in connection with a more general investigation of the sun , considered as a typical star .
The gradual development of the work dates from 1891 , when three attacks , along converging lines , were begun by the writer at the Kenwood Observatory .
One of these involved a study of the spectra of sun-spots , requiring the development of instruments and methods adequate to record photographically the minute peculiarities of their widened lines .
The second was a photographic investigation of the solar atmosphere , rendered possible by the initiation and gradual improvement of the spectroheliograph .
A series of laboratory experiments was also undertaken for the purpose of interpreting the phenomena detected in both of these series of researches .
The forms of the bright calcium flocculi , first recorded with the spectroheliograph in 1892 , afforded no definite evidence of currents in the sun 's * 4 Meteorological Office Geophysical Memoirs/ No. 7 , vol. 1 , p. 155 , especially pp. 162 et seq. t 4 Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity/ vol. 21 , p. 87 ( 1916 ) .
