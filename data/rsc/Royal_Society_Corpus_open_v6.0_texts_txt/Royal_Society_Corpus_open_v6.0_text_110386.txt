M. Poisson , in a memoir which he has lately published on theTheory of the Moon , expresses the three coordinates of her path , namely , her true longitude , her distances , and her true latitude , in terms of the time .
The author observes that the reasons for so doing adduced by M. Poisson , are the same as those which led Mr. Lubbock also to deviate from the course which had previously been always pursued by mathematicians , and to employ equations in which the true lon ?
gitude is the independent variable .
Instead , however , of integrating the equations of motion by the method of indeterminate coefficients , as the author had proposed , M. Poisson recommends the adoption of the method of the variation of the elliptic constants .
In the present paper , Mr. Lubbock states the reasons which have determined him not to employ the latter method , founded chiefly on the advantages of obtaining complete uniformity in the methods used in the theories of the moon and of the planets , and also in that of a greater rapidity of approximation by the improvements introduced in these methods .
Laplace , in the Mecanique Celeste , alludes to an equation of long period , of which the argument is twice the longitude of the moon 's node , plus the longitude of her perigee , minus three times the longi ?
tude of the sun 's perigee ; and M. Poisson has shown that the coeflicient of the corresponding argument in the development of the disturbing function equals zero : but the author shows that the same result may be arrived at very simply , by means of the method of developing the variation of the disturbing function .
