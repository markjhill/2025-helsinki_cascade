An Account of Experiments to determine the Acceleration of the Pendulum in dif.erent Latitudes .
By Captain Edward Sabine , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R.S. and F.L.S. Read March 8 , 1821 .

] The clocks and pendulums used in these experiments are the property of the Royal Society , and were prepared by their direction , under the superintendence of Captain Kater , whose description of them is quoted by the author at the commencement of this paper .
The experiments were made during two voyages of discovery in search of a North-west Passage , the first in 1818 , and the second in 1819 and 1820 ; and Captain Sabine details in succession the proceedings at each station , where an opportunity was afforded of landing and setting up the clocks ; and concludes by recapitulating the number of vibrations made by each pendulum in the different latitudes in which it was tried , and by stating the deductions regarding the figure of the earth which follow from the acceleration thus determined .
In the first voyage , the number of vibrations was ascertained at two stations only ; namely , at Gardie House on the Island of Brassa , and on Waygat , or Hare Island , on the West coast of Greenland ; the latitude of the first being 600 91 42 " N. , and of the second 700 26 ' 17 " N. The number of vibrations in a mean solar day at London being 86497 4 , at Brassa they were 86530*507 , and at Hare Island 86562-6386 ; giving an acceleration of 33-107 vibrations between London and Brassa , and of 32-1316 between Brassa and Hare Island ; or 65-2386 between London and Hare Island .
Captain Sabine next proceeds to detail the preliminary experiments relating to the pendulums , and the results of his various observations , made during the second voyage ; from which it appears that at Melville Island in the Polar sea , in latitude 740 471 12-4 " N. , the mean diurnal acceleration amounted to 74 734 vibrations .
From the observations detailed at length in this paper , respecting the length of the seconds ' pendulum , at the several places of observation , it appears that its length at London being , as ascertained by Captain Kater , 39*13929 inches , at Brassait is 39A16929 inches ; at Hare Island 39-1984 , and at Melville Island 39-207 inches .
This paper concludes with a table , showing the diminution of gravity from the pole to the equator , and the resulting ellipticity of the earth , deduced from the preceding observations .
The method followed in obtaining these deductions is the same which is described by Captain Kater in the Philosophical Transactions for 1819 .
