" 'On the Meteorological Results shown by the Self-registering Instruments at Greenwich during the extraordinary Storm of October 30 , 1863 .
" By JAMES GILAISHER , F.R.S. , F.R.A.S. , &amp;c. Received November 23 , 1863 .
In the vear 1841 Osler 's anemometer was erected at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , and from that time , up to the year 1860 , the greatest pressure on the square foot recorded was 25 lbs. In February 1860 one of 28 lbs. was registered , which was the greatest up to October 30 of the present year ; on that day a pressure of no less than 291 lbs. took place c during a heavy squlall of wind and rain , which passed over the observatory at 3h .
30m .
P.M. At this time , moreover , the readings of the several other self-registering meteorological instruments at the Royal Observatory , Greenwich , exhibited very large changes , and of so remarkable a character , that the Astronoimer Royal expressed a wish that I should bring them unLder the notice of the Royal Society .
The following are extracts from the several registers of the day mentioned : At 6h .
A.M. , on October 30 , the barometer read 29 32 in .
, and it commenced falling slowly after this time , reaching 29 30 in .
at 8h .
A.M. The decrease then became more decided , and a steady fall was experienced 29 10 in .
was reached by Okh .
P.M. , and 28 96 in .
by 2h .
P.mi .
; from 2h .
P.M. to 3bh .
P.M. the decline was very rapid ; and the minimum reading , 28 80 in .
, was reached at the latter time .
After 3h .
30m .
P.M. the barometer turned to increase rapidly ; at 3h .
39m .
P.M. it read 28 85 in .
; at 4h .
P.m. , 28 92 in .
; 4h .
20m .
P.M. , 29 00 in .
; at 5h .
P.M. , 29-07 in .
; and afterwards a gradual increase took place to 29 30 in .
by 11h .
P.M. At 8h .
A.M. , with the first indications of decided barometric fall , the wind commenced to blow strongly from S.W. ; at 8b .
20m .
A.M. it had reached a force of I lb. on the square foot ; shortly after , 2 lbs. , and at 8h .
30m .
A.M. 3 lbs. A force of 1klb .
to 3 lbs generally prevailed , till 9h .
25m .
A.M. ; at 9h .
30m .
A.M. a gust of short durationi was experienced of 15 lbs. , which produced a decline of temperature of 2 ? .
From 9h .
35m .
A.M. to 9h .
50M .
A.M. the pressure of the wind varied between 3 lbs. and 5lbs .
; from 1 lb. to 3 lbs. from 9h1 .
59m .
A.M. to Oh .
45m .
P.M. ; there was no pressure for two or three minutes about Oh .
50m .
P.m. ; the wind them again commenced blowing , strongly , reaching 4 lbs. at Oh .
55m .
P.M. , and from 3 lbs. to 5 lbs. from lh .
P.M. to lh .
15m .
P.M. , the pressure was generally 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. from lh .
15m .
P.M. to 2h .
P.M. ; from 2h .
Om .
P.M. to 2h .
45m .
P.M. it varied between 4 lb. and 2 lbs. ; the wind again commnenced blowing strongly , reached 3k lbs. at 2h .
50m .
P.M. , 4 lbs. at 3h .
P.M. , 5 lbs. at 3h .
1Gm .
P.M. , 7 lbs. at 3h .
16m .
P.M. , 12 lbs. at 3h .
20m .
P.M. , 13 lbs. at 3h .
23m .
P.M. , 11 lbs. at 3h .
2Gm .
P.M. , 17 lbs. at 3h .
29ni .
P.M. , and 292 lbs. at 3h .
30m .
P.M. ; then declinied suddenly , pressing with forces varying between 6 lbs. and 9 lbs. from 3h .
35m .
P.M. to 3h .
45m .
P.M. , and 4 lbs. to 6 lbs. from 3h .
45m- .
P.M. to 4h .
P.M. ; another gust at 4h .
1OGm .
P.M. reached 8 lbs. ; again declined to 4 lbs. at 4h .
15m .
P.M. ; after this time , till 5h .
P.M. , the pressure varied between 2 lbs. and 4 lbs. , betweeni 2 lbs. and 3 lbs. from 5h .
P.ml .
to 6h .
P.M. , from k lb. to 2 lbs. ( with occasional lulls ) from 6h .
P.M. to 7h .
P.M. , from 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. from 7h .
P.M. to 9h .
P.M. ; scarcely any pressure was recorded between 9h .
P.M. and lOh .
P.M. , and from lOh .
P.M. to 11h .
P.M. the amnount varied between 1k lb. to 3 lbs. At the time of the great gust , viz. 3h .
30m .
P.M. , the barometer reached its minimum , 28 80 in .
; the temperature declined rapidly ( from 53*k at 3h .
15m .
P.M. to 46f by 4h , P.M. , and to 430 by 5h .
P.M. ) ; and the direction of the wind immediately changed to the amount of 90 ?
, following the direction of the sun , or from S.S.W. to W.N.W. At the Radcliffe Observatory , Oxford , the barometer-reading at 6h .
A.M. was 29-18 in .
, and decreased to 28 80 in .
at 2h .
30Mm .
; it then suddenly increased to 28 85 in .
at 211 .
35m .
, and to 29 25 in .
by 1 lh .
P.M. At 2h .
the direction of the wind was S. ; at 3h.:30m .
it was W. , and continued W. till 4hi .
30m .
, and then returned to S.W. by 5b .
The temperature at 2h .
was 5lV , declined to 430 at 2h .
30m .
, and to 4lP by 5b .
The general changes of temperature agree very closely with those at Greenlwich ; but , as in the case of the barometer , those at Oxford preceded those at Greenwich by one hour nearly .
The general fact frequently nioticed of a chanlge in the direction of the winid simultaneously with a sudden and great pressure , and for the most part in one direction ( that is to say , in the direction of the sun 's motion , or N. to E. to S. ) , is very remarkable , and not easily accounlted for .
