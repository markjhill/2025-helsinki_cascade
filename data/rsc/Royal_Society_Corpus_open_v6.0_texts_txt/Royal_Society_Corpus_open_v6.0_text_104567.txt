Tables of specific Gravities , extracted from various Authors , with some observations upon the same ; communicated in a Letter to Martin Folks Esq ; President of the Royal Society , by Richard Davies M.D. THE manifold applications which may be made , for the purposes of Natural Philosophy , of the relations which Bodies bear to each other , by their respective Specific Gravities , engaged me some years since to collect all the experiments of this sort I could meet with in the course of my studies , and also to make several new ones of my own with the same design .
Presented Feb. 18 .
1747 .
When my collection began to be somewhat considerable , I disposed the several bodies in Tables according to their species , which I found to be the most convenient method , as my tables were by this means capable of receiving additions in any part , without destroying the form of the whole : and as they were thereby easy and ready to be consulted , and well disposed for the forming of immediate comparisons between the several bodies of the same species .
But having now no farther opportunities of enlarging my collection , I hereby beg leave to recommend the prosecution of my design to others , as a subject well deserving the attention of some of the members of the Royal Society , to whom I therefore present these my tables : wishing they may prove of some use and service to the inquisitive and philosophical part of the world .
As I persuade myself they really will , when they shall be further rectified , by the omission of the crroneous or uncertain experiments ; when they shall be enlarged by the addition of such others , as may still be found in good authors , or which yet remain unpublished in the closets of the curious : and especially if some such gentlemen as have skill , leisure , and opportunities , shall please to supply their remaining defects , by the communication of their own observations , made upon those bodies , whose specific gravities have not as yet been carefully recorded .
Denique cur alias aliis praestare videmus Ponder res rebus , nihilo majore figura ?
Nam , si tantundem est in Lanae glomere , quantum Corporis in Plumbo'st , tantundum pendere par est .
Lucret .
A short account of the Authors , from whose writings and experiments , the following Tables have been collected , with some remarks upon the experiments themselves , and the manner in which they appear to have been made .
THE ancients have left but few particulars concerning the different specific gravities of bodies , tho ' it is plain they were in the general sufficiently acquainted with them .
It was by the knowledge of the various weights of gold and silver , that Archimedes is recorded to have detected the famous fraud committed in Hiero 's crown , as Vitruvius has at large related in his Architecture , 1 .

c. 13 .
and it is from the same great philosopher , that we have derived the demonstration of those hydrostatical rules , by which the proportions are best to be known , of the several weights or densities of different bodies , having the same bulk or magnitude : as may be seen in his tract De insidentibus humido , lost in the Greek original , but retrieved in great measure , as it is said , from an Arabic translation .
It was published in Latin , with a commentary by Federicus Commandinus at Bononia 1565 , 4~ , and the substance of it by Dr. Barrow in his Archimedes , printed likewise in 4~ at London 1675 .
Pliny , in the xviii .
book of his Natural History , has set down the proportional weights of some sorts of grain , among which he says that barley is the lightest .
Levissimum ex his hordeum , raro excedit , [ in singulos nimirum modios ] xv libras , et faba xxii .
Ponderosius far , magisque etiamnum triticum .
And a little further on , ex his generibus [ frumenti scilicet ] quae Romam invehuntur , levissimum est Gallicum , atque e Chersoneso advectum : quippe non excedunt in modium vicenas libras , si quis granum ip sum ponderet .
Adjicit Sardum selibras , Alexandrinum et trientes : hoc et Siculi pondus .
Baeoticum totam libram addit : Africum et dodrantes .
In Transpadana Italia scio vicenas quinas libras farris modios pendere : circa Clusium et senas .
And the same author in his xxxiii .
book , speaking of quicksilver , observes that it is the heaviest of all substances , gold only excepted .
Omnia ei innatant , praeter aurum : id unum ad se trahit .
Which Vitruvius had also taken notice of , and had mentioned besides the weight of a known measure of it , that of four Roman Sextarii .
Eae autem [ guttae nempe argentivivi quae inter se congruunt et una confunduntur ] cum sint quatuor sextariorum mensurae , cum expenduntur , inveniuntur esse pondo centum .
Cum in aliquo vase est confusum , si supra id lapidis centenarii pondus imponitur , natat in summo : neque eum liquorem potest onere suo premere , nec elidere , nec dissipare : centenario sublato , si ibi auri scrupulum imponatur , non natabit , sed ad imum per se deprimetur , Ita non amplitudine ponderis , sed genere singularum rerum gravitatem esse , non est negandum .

Again , Q. Rhemnius Fannius Palaemon , in his fragment De ponderibus et mensuris , has given us an observation , of the proportional gravities of Water , Oil , and Honey .
Librae , ut memorant , bessem sextarius addet , Seu puros pendas latices , seu dona Lyaei , Addunt semissem Librae labentis Olivi , Selibramque ferunt mellis superesse bilibri .
That is to say , that the Sextarius of either water or wine weighed 20 ounces , the same measure of oil 18 , and of honey 30 .
Their specific weights were therefore in proportion as 1.0 , 0.9 , and 1.5 , exactly agreeable to what Villalpandus determined about the beginning of the last century : Yet was this author himself sensible that these were not to be looked upon as very nice experiments .
Haec tamen assensu facili sunt credita nobis .
Namque nec errantes undis labentibus amnes , Nec mersi puteis latices , aut font ~ Manantes , par pondus habent : non denique vina , Quae campi aut colles nuperve aut ante tulere , Quod tibi mechanica promptum est depromere Musa .
After which he proceeds to describe a good pretty instrument for the ready finding of the different specific gravities of fluids , and shows how those of solids also may be hydrostatically discovered .
And so much shall suffice for what I had to mention from the ancients relating to this subject : I now come to those who have written within these last hundred and fifty years .
Francis Bacon , Lord Verulam &amp;c. in his Historia densi et rari , printed in the second volume of his works in folio , London 1741 .
p. 69 .
has given a table , which he calls , Tabula coitionis et expansionis materiae per spatia in tangibilibus ( quae scilicet dotantur ponder ) cum supputatione rationum in corporibus diversis .
This tract does not appear to have been published till after his death , which happened in the year 1626 , but was probably written several years before ; and the experiments were even as he tells us made long before that .
Hanc Tabulam multis abhinc annis confeci , atque ut memini , bona usus diligentia .
I therefore apprehend it to be the oldest table of Specific Gravities now extant .
The experiments therein mentioned were not made hydrostatically , but with a cube of an ounce weight of pure Gold , as he says , to which he caused cubes of other materials to be made equal in size : as he did also two hollow ones of silver , and of equal weights , the one to be weighed empty , and the other filled with such liquid as he wanted to examine .
He was himself sensible that his experiments of this sort were , notwithstanding his care , very defective , possit proculdubio tabula multo exactior componi , videlicet tum ex pluribus , tum ex ampliore mensura : id quod ad exactas rationes plurimum facit , et omnino paranda est , cum res sit ex fundamentalibus .
From among these , notwithstanding their imperfection , as they appear to have been some of the first experiments of the sort regularly digested , and as they were besides made by so great a man , I have extracted the specific gravities of the fixed metals , which I have inserted as examples in the following tables : after reducing them to the common form , upon the supposition that pure gold was , according to Ghetaldus , just 19 times as heavy as water .
And this I have rather chosen to do , than to make use of his Lordship 's own weight of water given in the table , which in the manner he took it could not be very exact , and which besides would not have brought out the specific gravity of pure gold more than 18 times as much ; and that of the other metals in proportion .
This table contains in all 78 articles .
There are also in the third volume of the same edition of his works , p. 223 , Certain experiments made by the Lord Bacon about weight in air and water .
These are truly hydrostatical , but very imperfect , I have not therefore inserted any of them in the following collection .
Marinus Ghetaldus , a nobleman of Ragusa , published in quarto at Rome , in 1603 , his treatise entitled , Promotus Archimedes , seu de variis corporum generibus gravitate et magnitudine comparatis , wherein he has given a comparison between the specific gravities of water and eleven other different substances , from his own hydrostatical experiments made with care and exactness .
These I have inserted : expressing the numbers as they stand in his own book , but I have afterwards also for uniformity reduced them to the decimal form .
I have besides at the end transcribed at large the two tables of this author , in which every one of the twelve sorts of bodies he treats about is successively compared with all the others , both in weight and magnitude .
Father Johannes Baptista Villalpandus , a Jesuit of Cordoua in Spain , in his Apparatus Urbis et Templi Hierosolymitani , printed in folio at Rome in 1604 , exhibited a table of the proportional weights of the seven metals and some other substances , from his own experiments , made with great care as he tells us , by the means of six equal solid cubes of the fixed metals , and a hollow cubical vessel 8 times as large , for the comparing Mercury , Honey , Water , and Oil with the same .
His numbers , which are inserted under his name in the following tables , were also again published afterwards by Joh. Henr .
Alstedius in his Encyclopaedia universa , printed in 2 vols .
in folio at Herborn 1630 , and by Henry Van Etten , in his Mathematical recreations , from whence they have been often transcribed into other books .
Villalpandus 's book , which is only the third volume of a work begun to be published several years before , was itself printed so soon after Ghetaldus 's , that it is probable he either never saw that author , or not at least till after his own experiments were made .
Mr. Edmund Gunter , in his Description and Use of the Sector , printed after his death by Mr. Samuel Foster in 1626 , having occasion to make mention of the specific weights of the several fixed metals , quoted Ghetaldus , and made use of his proportions , and so did also Mr. William Oughtred , in his Circles of Proportion , first published in quarto 1633 , with this only difference , as to the form , that he changed Ghetaldus 's unit into 210 , whereby he expressed all his relations in whole numbers .
It is likewise probable that D. Henrion took from the same place the numbers he applied in his Usage du Compass de Proportion , printed at Paris in 1631 , 8~ .
although he has not given them all with exactness , for the sake as it seems of using simpler vulgar fractions .
Father Marinus Mersennus , a French Minim , in his Cogitata Physico Mathematica , printed at Paris in 1644 .
4~ , has given from the observations of his accurate friend Petrus Petitus , a table of the specific gravities of the metals and some other bodies , making Gold 100 , Water 51/ 3 , and the rest in proportion .
These I have reduced to the common form , and inserted under his name in the following tables .
The same were afterwards made use of by Father Francis Milliet de Chales , Jesuit , in his Cursus Mathematicus , Monsieur Ozanam , Professor Wolfius , and several others .
I have not seen Petitus 's own book , but it was entitled L ' Usage ou le moyen de pratiquer par un Regle toutes les Operations du Compass de Proportion-augmentees des Tables de la Pesanteur et Grandeur des Metaux &amp;c. had a privilege dated in 1625 .
tho ' it is said not to have been printed till some years after .
The same Father Mersennus has also taken notice , in his general preface , of a table of 20 specific gravities , some time before published by Mons. Aleaume , which he there sets down , but which he also observes to be very incorrect .
I have not therefore inserted any of them in this collection .
Mr. Smethwick , one of the earliest members of the Royal Society , communicated to the same in July 1670 , the weights of a cubic inch of several different substances ; said to have been formerly taken by Mr. Reynolds in the Tower of London .
This gentle man was the same who composed several tables relating to the price of Gold and Silver , which were published in a book entitled The Secrets of the Goldsmith 's Art , at London 1676 , in octavo .
These weights are expressed in decimals of an Averdupois Pound , are carried to 8 places of figures , and seem to have been carefully and accurately collected .
I have therefore in the following tables reduced them to the common form , in order to give them their proper authority with the rest .
I am ignorant whether these weights were ever before printed or not , neither can I give any account , after what particular manner the experiments were made , from which they were taken .
They were communicated to me from the register-books of the Royal Society ; and I shall only observe , that the absolute weight here assigned of a cubic inch of common water does not differ more than a small fraction of a grain , from the weight of the same afterwards determined by Mr. Ward of Chester .
The Philosophical Society , meeting at Oxford , directed several experiments to be made hydrostatically by their members , concerning the specific gravities of various bodies ; which being digested into a table , were by Dr. Musgrave communicated to the Royal Society the 21st day of March 1684 .
soon after which they were printed in the 169th number of the Philosophical Transactions .
These experiments were , according to Dr. Musgrave , made by Mr. Caswell and Mr. Walker : they are all originals , and esteemed some of the most accurate that are extant .
The honourable Robert Boyle , at the end of his Medicina hydrostatica , first published at London in 1690 , 8~ .
subjoined a table of the specific gravities of several bodies , accurately taken from his own hydrostatical experiments .
Besides which , there are also in the same tract , and in other parts of his works , several experiments of this excellent author 's , which he has given occasionally , together with the uses resulting from them .
To such of these in the following collection , as were taken from the table just mentioned , I have barely annexed his name , but to such of the others as occurred , I have also added the volume , page , and column , of the late folio edition of his works in 1744 , where the same are to be found .
It may be noted , that in the first edition of the Medicina hydrostatica , there were several errors of the press .
Such of them as I could discover by calculation , I have corrected in the following pages .
There is a table published under the name of J. C. in the 199th number of the Philosophical Transactions , A~ .
1693 : and this is evidently a supplement to that above-mentioned of the Philosophical Society meeting at Oxford .
The experiments were , according to the initials J. C. made by the same curious person Mr. John Caswell , and are therefore of the same estimation as the others .
M. Homberg , of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris , read a memoir in 1699 , wherein he took no tice of the expansion of all substances by heat , and the contraction of the same by cold : from whence it must follow , that the specific gravities of the same bodies would constantly be found less in the summer and greater in the winter .
And this he showed from the experiments he had made upon several fluids , both in the summer and the winter-seasons , by means of an instrument he had contrived and called an Araeometer , being a large phial , to which he had adjusted a long and slender stem , whereby he could to good exactness determine , when it was filled with equal bulks or quantities of the several fluids he proposed to examine .
The result of his trials with this instrument he digested into a short table , which was printed in the memoirs of the Academy for the same year 1699 .
This table John Caspar Eisenschmid afterwards republished with several additions , in his tract De Ponderibus et Mensuris , printed at Strasburg in 1708 , 8~ .
changing it to a more convenient form for his purpose , by reducing the different fluids therein named to the known bulk of a cubical Paris inch .
So much of this table as I thought might be of service , I have here subjoined to the others in the following collection , but I have also made an alteration in the form , the better to fit it for general use , by omitting the absolute weights of the several bodies in summer and winter , and placing instead of them , after the name of each body a decimal number , expressing the proportion of its weight in winter to its weight in summer , supposed to be every-where represented by unity .
Sir Isaac Newton Knt. in his Opticks printed in 4~ .
at London 1704 , gave a table of the specific gravities of several diaphanous bodies .
The experiments were made by him with a view chiefly to optical enquiries , and to enable him to compare their densities with their several refractive powers : we may therefore be well assuted that they were made by the great author with the most scrupulous care and exactness .
The table consists of 22 articles .
John Harris D. D. in his Lexicon Technicum , first printed at London in 1704 , fol. republished at large the several tables of specific gravities of the Oxford Society and I. C. from the Philosophical Transactions , and that of the honourable Robert Boyle from his Medicina hydrostatica , to which last he also added some experiments of his own , made as it seems with good accuracy .
These are here extracted , and placed under his name in the following tables .
Mr. John Ward of Chester , in his Young Mathematician 's Guide , first printed , as I take it in 1706 , acquaints us , that he had himself for his own satisfaction , made several experiments upon the different specific gravities of various bodies ; and that he was of opinion , that he had obtained the proportion of the weight that one body bears to another of the same bulk and magnitude , as nicely as the nature of such matter , as might be contracted or brought into a lesser body ( viz. either by drying , hammering , or otherwise ) would admit of .
And he has accordingly given us in the said book the weight of a cubic inch of 24 different substances , both in Troy and Averdupois ounces and decimal parts of an ounce ; which he further assures us required more charge , care , and trouble , to find out nicely , than he was at first aware of .
This table appears to have been well-esteem 'd , and to have had the sanction of Mr. Cotes 's approbation , by his taking it , when reduced to the common form , into that collection which he drew up for his own hydrostatical lectures .
Roger Cotes M A. and Plumian Professor of Astronomy and experimental Philosophy at Cambridge , first giving about the year 1707 a Course of Hydrostatical and Pneumatical Experiments , in conjunction with Mr. Whiston in that University , drew up , for the use of that course , a very accurate Table of Specific Gravities , collecting from several places such experiments as he took to be most exact , and the best to be depended upon .
And as the judgment of so great a man cannot but give a general reputation to such experiments as he had so selected , I have thought proper , in the following tables , to distinguish all such by the addition of the letter C , after the names of such persons from whom they first appear to have been taken , adding also the name of Cotes at length , to such others as I have not met with elsewhere , and which I therefore take to have been transcribed from the memoranda of his own experiments .
This table of Mr. Cotes 's used first to be given in M.S. to those who attended his lectures ; but it was afterwards printed in a single sheet , relating to a Course of Experiments at Cambridge in 1720 , and since in Mr. Cotes 's Hydrostatical and Pneumatical Lectures , when they were published at large in 8~ .
by his successor Dr. Smith , now the worthy Master of Trinity College .
In these printed Lectures were inserted the gravities of Human Blood , its Serum , &amp;c. from Dr. Jurin , instead of those that had before been made use of from Mr. Boyle .
Mr. Francis Hauksbee , now Clerk to the Royal Society , did , about the year 1710 , begin , in conjunction with Mr. Whiston , who had then newly left the University , to give hydrostatical lectures &amp;c. in London ; for the purpose of which he reprinted in a thin volume in 4~ , in which are the schemes of his experiments , Mr. Cotes 's table of Specific Gravities above-mentioned .
To which he added , from trials of his own , the weights of Steel , soft , hard , and tempered , which are printed with his name in the following Tables , as are also some other experiments , which he has since occasionally made , and communicated to me .
Mr. Cotes 's table , with the above-mention 'd additions of Mr. Hauksbee , was afterwards again published by Dr. Shaw , in his Abridgment of Mr. Boyle 's Philosophical Works , at London , 1725 , 4~ .
vol. ii .
p. 345 .
John Friend M. D. at the end of his Praelectiones Chymicae , printed at London in 1709 , 8~ .
has published some new tables of the Specific Gravities both of solid and fluid bodies , entirely taken from his own original experiments .
And as these tables contain an account of a very useful set of bodies , upon which few or no other experiments have been made : it is great pity that this truly learned and elegant writer was not more accurate in his trials than he appears to have been .
Many of his experiments having indeed been made in so lax and improper a manner , and so many errors having been committed in them , that one can not with security depend upon these tables , tho ' containing otherwise facts one would so much desire to be truly informed about .
I have however here inserted the several particulars of his two last tables , which immediately concern Specific Gravities , after correcting such errors in calculation as I could certainly come at : And I hope that I shall be excused for this free censure upon part of the works of a gentleman , who has so well deserved of the learned world , and acquired so just a reputation in it .
James Jurin , M. D. and several years Secretary of the Royal Society , gave , in No. 361 of the Philosophical Transactions , Ao .
1719 , some original and very accurate experiments made by himself , upon the Specific Gravity of Human Blood , at several times during the six preceding years .
These were accompanied with a very curious discourse , which has since been translated by himself , into Latin , and reprinted in his Dissertationes Physico Mathematicae , Lond. 1732 .
8~ .
This gentleman has also , in No. 369 of the same Transactions , obliged us with some very judicious and useful remarks , relating to the caution to be used in examining the specific gravity of solids , by weighing them in water ; for want of attending to which , several sorts of bodies , such as human CalL ll culi , culi , the substance of all woods , &amp;c. have appeared , from their pores and small cavities filled up with air , to be considerably lighter than they really are .
John Woodward M. D. and Professor of Physic in Gresham College , had , as he acquaints us in several places of his works , made a great number of experiments upon the specific weights , of mineral and other fossil bodies , but which being probably contained in those of his papers which he ordered to be suppressed at his death , are thereby lost to the world , to which they would without all doubt have been very acceptable .
All I have been able to pick up are a very few mentioned in the Catalogue of the English Fossils in his Collection , published since his decease , in 8~ .
at London 1729 .
Mr. Gabriel Fahrenheit F. R. S. communicated , in No. 383 .
of the Philosophical Transactions , A Table of the Specific Gravities of 28 several substances , from hydrostatical experiments of his own , made with great care and exactness ; to which he subjoined some observations upon the manner in which his trials were performed , together with a description of the instruments in particular which he made use of to examine the gravities of Fluids .
To some of his experiments which he thought required a greater nicety , he has affixed an asterisk in his table , signifying such to have been adjusted to the temperature of the air , when his Thermometers stood at the height of 48 degrees .
This gentleman , who is well known by the reputation of his Mercurial Thermometers , which he made with great curiosity , and which are now generally used , was in England in the year 1724 .
Professor Peter van Musschenbroek , of Utrecht , published in his Elementa Physicae at Leyden in 8~ .
1734 .
a large table of Specific Gravities , which he afterwards yet somewhat further enlarged in his Essai de Physique in French , at Leyden 1739 .
4~ .
This table contains almost all the preceding ones , but without the names of the authors from whom they were collected .
I have among those which follow inserted , under this author 's name , such experiments as I had not before met with elsewhere : making use of the Latin edition as the more correct , except in such articles which are only to be found in the French .
Mr. John Ellicott F. R. S. having an opportunity in the year 1745 .
to examine the weight of some large Diamonds , he accordingly , with the utmost care , and with exquisite assay-scales which very sensibly turned with the 200th part of a grain , took the specific gravities of 14 of those Diamonds , 4 of which came from the Brasils , and the other 10 from the East Indies .
These experiments he communicated to the President of the Royal Society , who caused them to be read at one of their meetings , and afterwards published them in No. 476 .
of the Philosophical Transactions .
Among these Brasilian Diamonds , one was of the absolute weight of 92,425 , another of 88,21 ; and among the East-Indian ones , one of 29,525 Troy grains .
And as the size of these stones made them much fitter for these enquiries , than any others which had probably ever before been used for the same purpose , so the known accuracy of the author , the goodness of his instruments , and the consistency of all his experiments , sufficiently show the specific gravities he has delivered in his paper , may entirely be depended upon .
The same curious person also communicated the Specific Gravities of fine and standard Gold , published under his name in the following tables , and which were deduced from experiments he was so kind as to make on purpose at my request .
As I have just had occasion to mention Diamonds , it may possibly not be foreign to the purpose here to take some notice of the Diamond Carat weight , used among jewellers , which weight was originally the Carat or 144th part of the Venetian ounce , equal to 3,2 Troy Grains , but which is now , for want of an acknowledged standard , somewhat degenerated from its first weight .
I have myself found it , upon a medium of several experiments , equal to 3,17 Troy Grains ; and I have the rather taken notice of this weight here , because there happens to be a mistake about it , both in Dr. Arbuthnot 's and Mr. Dodson 's tables , who have set down as it seems the number of Diamond Carats in a Troy Ounce , instead of the weight of the Diamond Carat itself .
This Carat is again divided into four of its own Grains , and those into halves and quarters , commonly called the eighths and sixteenths of a Carat : and thus the largest of the Diamonds just above-mentioned , weighed , in the jewellers phrase , better than 29 Carats and almost half a Grain .
Mr James Dodson , in his book called The Calculator , printed in 8~ .
at London in 1747 , has inserted a useful table of Specific Gravities , in which he has by the first initial letter of their names distinguished the several authors he has quoted : and amongst these are several new experiments marked with an L , which I am told were communicated from his own trials , by Mr. Charles Labelye , engineer , and which concern particularly the weights of several sorts of stone and other materials used in building .
These I have also distinguished by an L. as they stand in Mr. Dodson 'd book .
Mr. Geo. Graham , F. R. S. made for me , at the request of a friend , some accurate trials upon the weight , of Gold and Silver , both when reported fine , and when reduced to the English Standard : all which I have inserted under his name in the following tables .
Wherein I have besides reportled some other single Experiments which I occasionally met with , from Frederick Slare M. D. John Keill of Oxford , M. D. Stephen Hales D.D. and Edward Bailey of Havant in Hampshire , M. D. Richard Davies M. D. I have lastly to this Collection of Experiments added some of my own , which I endeavoured to make with as much accuracy , as the instruments I was provided with would allow of .
My hydrostatical Balance was one constructed several years since by Mr. Francis Hauksbee , which I have constantly found to turn sensibly with half a grain : and the bodies upon which I made most of my trials , were taken from a collection of the Materia Medica formerly made by Signor Vigani , and still preserved in the library of Queen 's College in Cambridge .

L ... 7.156 Notes and Observations .
As I thought the uses that might be made of these Tables , either in business or in philosophy , would best be illustrated by a few short notes , I have therefore here occasionally inserted such observations as occurred to me , whilst I was revising them for the press : and as many of these related chiefly to the present defects of my tables , those I thought would probably be of service , to such as might hereafter take the trouble of improving or correcting them .
As the particulars contained in the Tables were extracted from different books , at different times , and at first only intended for my own private use , I was not solicitous to preserve one uniform language , but generally set down every experiment in my common-place , in the words of the author I took it from : and as I have since found , that by a translation I might sometimes happen not so justly to represent the body intended , I have upon the whole judged it best , here also to transcribe them in the same languages in which they were at first delivered .
To make experiments of this sort with a sufficient degree of accuracy requires a pretty deal of care and pains : and as in such as I have made myself , I have found great convenience in the use of decimal weights , preferably to those of the common form , I would also recommend the use of such to others , who shall please to employ themselves in the like enquiries .
Those I have provided for myself have a Troy Ounce for their integer , and my least weight is the thousandth part of that quantity , differing consequently from the half of a Troy Grain only as 24 does from 25 , which is inconsiderable so far as those small weights are concerned .
My four smallest are respectively of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of those thousandth parts , and together make 10 , or an unit of the next denomination , that of the 100th part of an ounce .
I then have four others , making 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 100ths , and together the unit of of the next denomination , or one tenth of an ounce , and so on .
By these I save the trouble of reducing the common weights to their lowest denomination in every experiment , and sometimes perhaps avoid making mistakes in that very trifling work .
Whenever two or more original writers nearly concur in their experiments upon any subject , the Gravity so deduced may be well depended upon .
But where they differ remarkably it must either be imputed to the unequal gravity of the subject itself , or to some error in the trials , which may easily happen in matters that depend on the observation of so many minute particulars .
All those cases that so sensibly differ would well deserve to be reexamined .
The first Table above , that of Metals , as it is composed of the most perfect and uniform bodies in nature , seems capable of being adjusted with the greatest precision , both with relation to the pure Metals themselves , and to the several degrees of their mixtures one with another , if experiments in all these cases were but made with a sufficient degree of accuracy .
Gold , in the experiments I have made myself , I could never find to come up to the weight assigned it in some of the former tables , and particularly those I have made upon our own coin , and some others have always remarkably fallen short of the weight assigned to the Standard in those same tables .
I have inserted that trial in which I found Guineas to come out best ; and I may venture to affirm , that that experiment , in particular , was made with as much accuracy as my instrument was capable of , the Pieces were all washed in soap and water , cleaned with a brush , and the air-bubbles well freed and the like .
That experiment is besides abundantly confirmed since , by the exact trials lately made by Mr. Graham and Mr. Ellicot , which were performed with the greatest care ; and the fine Gold also mentioned by the last was chosen and prepared with the greatest curiosity .
It may be observed , that the gold medals of Q. Eliz .
and Q. Mary , quoted by J. C. were , without doubt , the large Sovereigns of those Queens , which were of the old Standard of England , or of gold appointed to be 23 carats , 3 grains and a half fine : That the Mentz Ducat , mentioned by the same , if it was one of those ad Legem Imperii , which are always in their own mints affirmed to be fine , come out considerably too light : and that the gold coin of the Commonwealth , and the pistols of France , were like our present gold money of the goodness of 22 carats .
Mercury is placed in this table among the Metals , by reason of its near agreement with those bodies in its specific gravity ; tho ' it otherwise so widely differs from them in most of its properties .
Brass is considerably condensed by hammering ; whether Gold , Silver , and the other Metals are also condensed in like manner , hardly appears yet to have been sufficiently tried .
Of the mixed Metals , hardly any except Brass , appear to have had their specific gravities very carefully ascertained : bell-metal , princes metal , however , and some others , might deserve to be examined in that particular .
It might possibly be queried also , whether several mixed Metals do not either rarifie or condense upon mixture , so as thereby to acquire a different specific gravity , than the natural law of their composition , at first seems to require .
It may lastly be observed , that the specific gravities of all the known Metals are such , as that none of them come up to 20 times the weight of common water , or fall sensibly below 7 times the same weight .

1.666 The second Table is composed of subjects no way strictly allied to each other , either by their gravities , or their other essential properties ; and perhaps they might better , on that account , have been divided into different tables .
The bodies themselves are chiefly of an uncertain and heterogeneous nature ; being so far as appears composed of different elements , and those also combined in various proportions , such as Sulphur and Arsenic , joined with Stone , Metal , and the like : and from these several degrees of mixture it must follow , that most of these kinds of bodies , tho so far similar as to be called by the same names , yet must necessarily admit of a considerable latitude in their specific gravities .
Many useful deductions may nevertheless be drawn from those considerations , relating to the comparative goodness &amp;c. of such bodies .
Cinnabar native appears to be a compound of Mercury and Sulphur , with a portion of earthy or stony matter ; and that which is heaviest must abound most with the Mercury .
The different appearances which this body makes , would also give us a suspicion that there are other varieties in its composition , besides those just taken notice of : some sorts of Cinnabar , such as the Hungarian , breaking into polished planes and squares like Talc , whilst others , like the Persian of this table , break rough and with shining granulae or micae ; and that without any considerable difference in their gravities .
By the factitious Cinnabar it may be determined , what proportion of Mercury will so incorporate with Sulphur , as to make up an uniform body .
Antimony may in like manner be considered as a composition of its Regulus and Sulphur .
The black sand used on writing is said by Mr. Boyle to be a rich Iron Ore : he also says that Emeri , Loadstone , and all such ponderous stones , contain some kind of metal , which he had himself separated from them .
IV .
120 .
a. The great variety of Ores of all kinds well deserve to be accurately examined , for the sake of the many conclusions that may be drawn from thence , concerning the natures of concrete bodies , and for many other purposes in Metallurgy .
But I have as yet met with a very small number of experiments upon these substances .
Dr. Woodward has indeed mentioned a great many observations of this sort which he had made , and kept exact registers of : but as they were probably among those papers which he ordered to be destroyed at his death , we must look upon them as now lost to the world .
The Marcasites and Pyrites are very uncertain and strange kinds of bodies , their gravities are often very great : a Marcasite here taken from Fahrenheit was found nearly to equal the heaviest mineral Bismuth itself ; and yet it is very seldom that any Metal or semimetal can be obtained in any quantity from these substances , all that is in them being usually destroyed , and carried away by their sulphur .
Black Lead is also a very odd kind of Mineral , having all the appearance of a Semimetal , and yet falling short even of the weight of common earth .
The Semimetals generally exceed in their specific gravity even the baser Metals themselves .
It may be observed , that it appears by this table , that the specific gravities of ores , including the metallic stones , are usually found to lie between 7 and 3 times the weight of water .
Lead and Silver ores are the heaviest , those of Copper , Tin and Iron being considerably lighter .
The Gold Ore we have an account of must be so poor as hardly to be worth taking any notice of : but we have in general too few of these experiments , to draw any certain conclusions from them .

2.252 As the mean gravity of Crystal appears , by the foregoing table , to be little more to that of water than as two and a half to one ; it may well be suspected , that the Granite , Psendo-Topazius , S apphire , and such other Gemms which greatly exceed Crystal in weight , do contain a considerable portion of some sort of Metal in their composition : as was observed of these bodies by Dr. Woodward , in his Method of Fossils , p. 24 .
As to the white Sapphire , which is reputed by Dr. Woodward to be a species of Gemm intermediate between Chrystals and the Diamond in hardness , I have not yet obtained any good account of its specific gravity .
The weight of the Diamond is ascertained in No. 476 .
of the Philosophical Transactions , where it appears , that by experiments made with the greatest care , by Mr. John Ellicot F. R. S. with most exact instruments , and upon 14 different Diamonds , some of them very large , brought from different places , and having the greatest varieties of colour and shape possible ; they were all found to agree in weight to a surprising degree of accuracy , being all somewhat above three times and a half the weight of common water .
This indeed differs very sensibly from what had been found in some former experiments , but it is hardly probable that those had been made upon Diamonds of so large a size as these : Mr. Boyle who found their weight less than 3 times that of common water , has himself told us in the same place , V. 83 .
b. that the stone he made use of only weighed about 8 grains .
And tho no doubt can be made of the exactness of Sir Isaac Newton 's experiment , riment , by which also the specific weight of the Diamond came out less than Mr. Ellicot 's , yet it may well be questioned , whether Sir Isaac had , at the time when he made his trials , either so many or so perfect and weighty stones , as a favourable opportunity offered to this last gentleman .
I shall therefore only observe , that , admitting this last to be the true specific weight of the Diamond , the refractive power of the same , in proportion to its density , should in Sir Isaac Newton 's table be lessened from 14556 to 14071 ; which would still be greater than what is found in any other body ; but is upon the whole more conformable to the general law of that table .
Sir Isaac Newton conjectured a Diamond to be an unctuous substance coagulated , and found it to have its refractive power nearly in the same proportion to its density as those of Camphire , Oyl-Olive , Lintseed Oil , Spirit of Turpentine and Amber , which are fat sulphureous unctuous bodies : all which have their refractive powers two or three times greater in respect to their densities than the refractive powers of other substances in respect of theirs .
Yet must it be allowed that a Diamond suffers no change by heat in any degree , contrary to the known property of Sulphurs ; and as it is most reasonable in our Philosophy to treat such bodies as simple , in which we are not able to produce any change or separation of parts , we must therefore on that account consider a Diamond as a simple body and of the Crystalline kind .
Glass , which is a factitious concrete of Sand and Alkaline Salt , is nearly found to assume the mean gravity of Stones and Chrystals .
If there is no mistake in the gravity of what Dr. Friend calls Vitrum Venetum , it differs very remarkably from all other kinds of Glass .
I do not know whether the Jasper and Hyacinth spurious of J.C. are to be understood as natural or artificial Gemms .

1.079 The mean gravity of Stone appears to be to that of water as about two and a half to one , and many stones of great hardness , such as the Onyx , Turquoise , Agate , Marble , Flint &amp;c. do not much exceed that weight .
It may therefore well be doubted whether such Stones whose specific gravity comes up to near three times that of water , or even beyond it , owe their density to metalline additions ; or whether they are really formed of a different species of matter , as the Diamond seems to be .
Coral by its density appears to be a stone , tho in a vegetating state : or it may possibly from some late observations , be of an animal nature .
What is called Lapis Hibernicus , is a soft stone containing Vitriol .
We have not many observations upon Earths : by those we have , it seems probable that they contain the same kind of matter in a lax form , of which Stones are a more solid and denser concretion .
Lapis de Goa is but a trifling composition , perhaps hardly worth retaining in the tables .
What species of body should Alabaster be accounted ?
which with a stone-like hardness , yet falls so much below other Stones , or even Earths , in gravity .

0.698 Sulphur is in gravity very nearly the same as Earth , so that its purity can hardly be ascertained by its weight , unless the matter it is associated with is of a stony density .
The semidiaphanous Sulphur is a beautiful kind which I have but seldom seen : it is in lumps of the size of a small bean .
Coal , the sorts here taken notice of are considerably lighter than Sulphur : but there are many other kinds , and of different weights .
I take the Gagates or Jet to differ very little from the Channel Coal .
The different sorts of Amber may be observed not to differ considerably in their several gravities .
Sulphurs seem to be the lightest of all mineral bodies .

The weights of vegetable Gums nearly correspond with those of the ligneous parts .

0.237 Dr. Jurin has observed in the Phil. Trans. No. 369 .
that the substance of all wood is specifically heavier than water , so as to sink in it , after the air is extracted from the pores and air-vessels of the wood , by placing it in warm water under the receiver of an air-pump ; or if an air-pump cannot be had , by letting the wood continue some time in boiling water over a fire .
The several weights therefore above given must be looked upon as the weights of the concrete bodies , in the condition they were , before the Air was either forcibly got out , or the water driven into the small hollows : and both these considerations may have their use as notwithstanding that the specific weights of the solid particles are truly heavier than water , we shall from the weights of the bodies as they are now compounded , be enabled to make some judgment of their porosity , so far as they may be penetrable by water or other fluids .

These Stones and Pearls are the heaviest of all the animal productions we are acquainted with .
Dr. Jurin has observed , Phil. Trans. No. 369 .
that , in examining fresh Human Calculi whilst they were still impregnated with Urine , he had met such as exceeded the weight of some sorts of burnt earthen ware and alabaster , and approached very near to that of brick , and the softer sort of paving stone ; which I have myself also found to be true .
Whereas those who have made their experiments upon such Calculi , as had most probably been a considerable time taken out of the bladder , and had consequently lost much of their weight , by the evaporation of the urine , with which they had at first been saturated , have found those Stones commonly to have been but about one half part , and some of them no more than a fourth part , heavier than an equal bulk of Water .
From whence it has been too hastily concluded , that these Stones have very improperly been called by that name , as not at all approaching to the Specific Gravity of even the lightest real stones that we have any account of .
The Calculus Humanus and Animal Bezoar approach nearly to each other in their Specific Gravity .
Mr. Boyle has taken notice of the great difference to be found between the gravity of the true and the factitious Crabs-eyes .
It is strange that the factitious should be made of such materials as can bring them so near to the mean gravity of true stones : and this consideration may deserve the attention of those , who may think that any praticular dependence is to be had upon the use of these bodies in medicine .
Dr. Jurin was the first who carefully examined the Specific Gravities of the different parts which compose Human Blood ; and his experiments were performed with the greatest accuracy .
It may be observed , that the Blood is , by an easy analysis divided into Serum and Crassamentum ; and the Crassamentum again into the Glutinous and the Red globular parts , whose Specific Gravities are the greatest .
It had before these experiments been the general received opinion , that the globules of the Blood were lighter than the Serum ; and this indeed seemed to follow from Mr. Boyle 's Experiments in his Natural History of Human Blood ; from which he deduced the Specific Gravity of the mass itself , to be to that of Water as 1040 to 1000 , and that of the Serum alone to be to the same as 1190 .
And these numbers 1040 and 1190 had accordingly , till Dr. Jurin re-examined the affair , been constantly taken to represent the true gravities of Human Blood and its Serum respectivley .
See Dr. Jurin 's dissertation in Phil. Trans. No. 361 .
Milk is made by Dr. Friend to fall more short of the Gravity of Water , than it is made to exceed the same by J. C. Possibly this difference might arise from the Milk 's being taken in one case warm from the cow , and in the other after it had stood some time .

1.233 Most of the experiments in the ninth table are taken from Dr. Friend , who weighed the Salts in Spirits of Wine , and registered the proportional gravity of the Salts to the Spirits .
But the misfortune is , that the gravity of the Spirits of Wine he made use of is not registered : so that the experiments cannot with certainty be reduced to the common standard of Water .
He has delivered the gravity of Spirits of Wine to be 0.818 , and that of Spirits of Wine rectified to be 0.78 .
I have supposed the Salts to be weighed in the last , as being the fittest for the purpose : but which he really used can only be conjectured .
There appears indeed to be a way to discover the weight of the Spirits of Wine , in which Dr. Friend weighed his Salts : for he weighed 60 Grains of Mercury , both in Water and in Spirits of Wine , and the loss of its weight was respectively 41/ 4 Grains and 22/ 3 .
Now the gravities of these Fluids must be in the same proportion , and this would give for the weight of the Spirits of Wine 0.627 , which is much too little for the weight of his own rectified Spirits tho even that is less than what is assigned by any other author .
So that , upon the whole , nothing can really be concluded from this experiment ; and it must be allowed besides , that 60 Grains of Mercury take up too small a bulk in these Fluids , to have their gravities determined with any exactness thereby .
As Professor Musschenbroek has given in his table the specific weights of many of the same salts which are mentioned by Dr. Friend , but which differ considerably from the weights above set down , as resulting from the Doctor 's experiments , I have also transcribed the Professor 's numbers from his own table .
These do not however appear to me to be derived from new or differing experiments , but from the very same related by Dr. Friend , only computed from the supposition of a heavier sort of Spirits of Wine , whose specific gravity is supposed to have been 0.823 .
The gravity of the Sublimate eorrosive , set down 8.000 , I take to be a mistake , made by the writing down its comparative weight to that of the Spirits themselves , instead of the water to which it should have been referred .
It requires great care and attention to take the Specific Gravities of Salts with sufficient accuracy .
They dissolve in Water , and in some degree in all Fluids that partkae of the nature of Water .
If therefore Spirits of Wine are made use of for this purpose , they ought to be highly rectified , their own gravity accurately ascertained , and their degree of heat should be preserved uniform .
For as this Fluid rarefies much faster than Water does , a small difference of heat would sensibly affect the gravities of the Salts to be determined by it .
And perhaps Spirit of Turpentine were a more proper Fluid to be employed on these occasions .
It is remarkable , that Tartar vitriolat .
Sal Gem .
Sal mirabile , Sal maritimum , Nitre , &amp;c. being Salts composed of different Acids and an Alkaline Salt , should so far exceed in gravity the Vitriolic Salts , composed of the most heavy Acid and a metallic Earth .
Is not this owing to its forming less solid Chrystals , and to its containing large quantities of Air concealed in its Pores ?
The great difference in the weight of the Nitre , in the several experiments of Fahrenheit , Newton , and Friend , may possibly be owing to the quantity of its concealed Air .

0.00118 The same , by an experiment made by the late Mr. Francis Hauksbee F.R.S. when the barometer stood at 29.7 inches .
See Physico Mathem .
Exp. page .

0.00113 As to the absolute weight of water with which all the other bodies are compared in these Tables , Mr. Boyle tells us in his Medicina Hydrostatica , printed in the new Edition of his Works , V. 19 .
b. that he had found by his own experiments , that a cubic inch of clear water weighed 256 Troy Grains .
And Mr. Ward of Chester , who afterwards pursued this affair with great accuracy , determined that a cubic inch of common clear water did weigh by his trials 253.18 like Troy Grains , or 0.527458 decimals of the Troy Ounce , or 0.578697 of the Ounce Averdupois , agreeable to what Mr. Reynolds had formerly delivered , who found the inch cubic of Rain Water to weigh by his experiments 0.579036 decimals of the same Averdupois ounce , differing from the other only 0.000339 parts .
But , as the accuracy of all the experiments in these tables depends upon the identity of the weight of Common Water , it may not be improper to ascertain that point by a Note taken from Mr. Boyle 's Medicina Hydrostatica , V. 18 .
b. where he expresses himself in the following manner .
It speciously may , and probably will be objected , that there may be a great disparity betwixt the liquors that are called , and that deservedly , Common Water .
And some travellers tell us from the press , that the water of a certain eastern river , which if I mistake not is Ganges , is by a fifth part lighter than our water .
But ` ` having had upon several occasions the opportunity as well as curiosity to examine the weight of divers waters , some of them taken up in places very distant from one another .
I found the difference between their specific gravities far less than almost any body would expect .
And if I be not much deceived by my memory ( which I must have recourse to , because I have not by me the notes I took of those trials ) the difference between waters , where one would expect a notable disparity , was but about the thousandth part ( and sometimes perchance very far less ) of the weight of either .
Nor did I find any difference considerable in reference to our question , between the weight of divers waters of different kinds , as spring-water , river-water , rain-water , and snowwater ; though this last was somewhat lighter than any of the rest .
And having had the curiosity to procure some water brought into England , if I much misremember not , from the river Ganges itself ; I found it very little , if at all , lighter than some of our common waters .
' ' The heaviest fluid we are acquainted with , next to Mercury , is Oil of Vitriol , or water impregnated with the Vitriolic Acid in the highest degree we can obtain it , being almost double the weight of Water .
The next is probably the saturated solution of the fixed Salt of Vegetables ; being a ponderous Salt , and dissolving freely in Water .
The next to this is Spirit of Nitre .
Spirit of Salt is lighter , and inferior in weight to the saturated solution of Salt itself .
It is observable , that marine or common Salt and Nitre differ little in gravity , contrary to the nature of their Spirits .
The several solutions of common Salt , if accurately repeated , would show in what proportion the gravities of fluids increase , upon the addition of Salt : and that Sea-Water does not contain one twenty-fourth part of Salt .
I have omitted in this table the three animal fluids , Milk , Serum of Blood , and Urine , as the same may be seen before in the 8th table , that of animal parts ; but it may be noted in general that the specific gravity of all these fluids is nearly the same as that of Sea Water .
There are in Dr. Freind 's table several decoctions of Plants , which I have inserted , altho ' they are not I think of much use , nor greatly to be depended upon .
Several of them are lighter than common Water , in contradiction to Dr. Jurin 's observation , that Vegetable Parts are all heavier than Water : But it is probable these Experiments were made before the Decoctions were reduced to the temper of Common Water .
What is meant by the Aqua cocta of Dr. Friend in his table , I cannot imagine ; not having any idea of such a change by boiling or otherwise , as can deprive common water of a full fourth part of its weight .
Since the density of the Air is as the force by which it is compressed , it follows that the weight of any portion of Air must vary in the same proportion with the weight of the whole Atmosphere : which in our climate is not less than one tenth of the whole weight , allowing the Barometer to vary from 28 to 31 Inches .
Again , by an experiment of the late Mr. Hauksbee 's in his Phys. Mechan .
exp .
page .
170 .
the density of the air varies one eighth part between the greatest degree of Heat in Summer , and that of Cold in the Winter Season .
So that the Air , in a hard frost when the Mercury stands at 31 inches , is near a fifth part specifically heavier , than it is in a hot day when the Mercury stands at 28 inches .

1.04386 The Oils of Olive and sweet Almonds congealing with the cold , could not be examined by the Araeometer in the winter season .
According to this table , the increase of the specific weight of common water in the winter above its weight in the summer , is not more than about the one hundred and twenty-fourth part of the whole ; which is little more than half of what Professor Musschenbroek has else where accounted the same , desorte qu ' un pied cubique Rhenan d'Eau , qui pese environ 64 livres en Ete , se trouvera etre en Hiver de presque 65 livres .
Essai de Physique p. 424 .
but sure this difference is much too great .
Notwithstanding that all fluids are condensed by cold , it is only till such time as they are ready to freeze ; for upon the freezing they immediately expand again , so as for the ice to be lighter specifically than the fluid of which it is formed , and to swim in it : Musschenbroek gives the specific weight of Ice to be to that of Water commonly as 8 to 9 .
La pesanteur de la Glace est ordinairement a celle de l'Eau , comme 8a 9 .

I am not acquainted with any other accurate experiments upon this subject , and it is hard to get ice in which there are not large bubbles of air included .
The Philosophical Society at Oxford , together with their Table of Specific Gravity already so often mentioned in the foregoing pages , communicated besides at the same time , to the Royal Society , another Table of a grosser nature indeed , but which being printed in the same Number 169 .
of the Philosophical Transactions , and appearing to be of use for many purposes : I have thought sthe same not improper to be here also trancribed .

The following bodies were poured gently into the vessel , and those in the first 12 experiments were weighed in scales turning with two ounces ; but the last 7 were weighed in scales turning with one ounce .
The pounds and ounces here mentioned are Averdupois weight .

21 6 The proportion given by this Author as the true one of the Averdupois Pound to the Troy Pound is , that fourteen of the former are equal to seventeen of the latter .
From whence the Averdupois Pound would be found equal to 6994.285 , and the Ounce to 437.143 Troy Grains ; which is indeed a little less than the same have since been determined by others ; for Mr. Ward of Chester gives from a very nice experiment as he calls it , of his own , that one pound Averdupois was equal to 14 ounces 11 penyweight and 151/ 2 Troy Grains , or to 69991/ 2 , and consequently the ounce Averdupois to 437.47 of the same grains .
And several Gentlemen of the Royal Society , who very carefully on 22 April 1743 .
examined the original standards of weights kept in the Chamberlain 's Office of his MAJESTY'S Exchequer , found , upon the medium of the several trials which they made with those standards , that the Pound Averdupois was equal to 7000.14 , and the Ounce Averdupois to 437.51 Troy Grains .
