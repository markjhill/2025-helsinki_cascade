Cronebane Copper Mines , near Rathdrun , SIR , Nov. zi , 1795 .
TFHE extraordinary circumstance of native gold being found in this vicinity , early excited my attention , and led me to seize the first opportunity -that presented itself after my late arrival here , to inspect the place where the discovery was made .
I went thither on Tuesday , the 8d of this monfth with Mr. LLOYD , of Havodtnos , and Mr. WEAVER .
The former having given you some account of the circumstances which attended the original discovery , and , since he left me , a favourable day having enabled me to take a second view of the adjacent count try , I shall now attempt to describe the general appearance , and add such further information as has coirle to my knowP ledge .
The workings which the peasantry recently undertook , are on the north-east side of the mountain Croughan K insh-elly , within the barony of Arklow , avid county of Wicklow , on the lands of the Earl of CARYSFORT , wherein the Earl of ORMOND claims a right to the minerals , in consequencee ( as I have been informed ) , of a grant in the reign of King HENRY the Second , by Prince JOHN , during his command of his father 's forces in Ireland ; which grant was renewed and confirmed by Queen ELIZABETH , and again by King CHARLES the Second , The summit of the mountain is the boundary between the countiesofWicklowand Wexford ; seven English niles westfrom Arklow , ten to the south-westward of Rathdrum , and six southwesterly from Cronebane mines ; by estimation about six hundred yards above the level of the sea .
It extends W by N and Eby S , and stretches away to the north-eastward , to Ballycoage , where shafts have formerly been sunk , and some copper and magnetic iron ore has been found ; and thence to the NO there ex. tends a tract of mineral country , eight miles in length , running through the lands of Ballymurtagh , Ballygahan , Tigrony , Cronebane , Connery , and Kilmacoe , in all which veins of copper ore are found ; and terminating at the slatequarry atBalnabarny .
On the highest part of the mountain are bare rocks , being a variety of argillite , * whose joints range NNE and SSW , hade to the SSW , and in one part include a rib of quartz , three inches , wide , which follows the direction of the strata .
Around the rocks , , for some distance , is sound ground , covered with heath ; descending to the eastward , there is , springy ground , abounding with coarse grass ; and below that , a very extensive bog , in which the turf is from four to .
, nine feet thick , aid beneath it , in , the substratum of clay , are many angular fragments of quartz , containg chlorite , and ferruginous earth .
Below the turbary the ground falls with a quick descent , and three ravines are observed .
The central one , which is the most considerable , has been worn by torrents , which derive their source from the bog ; the others are formed lower down the mountain by springs , which uniting with the former , below their junction the gold has been found .
The smaller have not water sufficient to wash away the incumbent clay , so as to lay bare the substratum ; and their beds only contain gravel , -consisting of quartz with chlorite , and other substances of which the mountain consists .
The great ravine presents a more interesting aspect ; the water in its descent has , in a very short distance from the bog , entirely carried off the clay , and considerably worn down the substrata of rock , which it has laid open to inspection .
Descending along the bed of the great ravine , whose general course is to the eastward , a yellow argillaceous shistus is first seen ; the laminae are much shattered , are very thin , have a slight hade to the SSW , and range ES and WNW .
Included within the shist , is a vein of compact barren quartz , about three feet wide , ranging NO and SW ; below this is another vein , about nine inches wide , having the same range as the former , and hading to the northward , consisting of quartz , including ferruginous earth .
Lower down , is a vein of a compact aggregate substance , apparently compounded of quartz , ochraceous earth , chert , minute particles of mica , and some little argillite , of unknown breadth , ranging E and W , .
hading fast to the southward , and including strings of quartz , from one to two inches thick , the quartz containing ferruginous earth .
The yellow argillaceous shistus is a gain seen with its former hade and range ; and then , adjacent to a qu~artz vein , is laminated blue argillaceous shistus , ranging NO and SW , and hlading SE ; which is afterwards seen varying its range and hade , running EN and WSW , and hading NNW ; lower down , the blue shist is observed more compact , though still laminated .
The ground , less steep , becomes springy , is enclosed , and the ravine , shallower , has deposited a considerable quantity of clay , sand , and gravel .
Following the course of the ravine , or , as it may now more properly be called , the brook , arrive at the road which leads to Arklow ; here is a ford , and the brook has the Irish name of Augbatinavouglt ( the river that drowned the old maali ) ; hence it descends to the Aughrim river , just above its confluence with that from Rathdrum , which , after their junction , take , the general name of the Ovo , that discharging itself into the sea near the town of Arklow , forms an harbour for vessels of small burden .
The lands of Ballinvally are to the southward , and the lands of Ballinagore to the northward , of the ford , where the blue shistus rock , whose joints are nearly vertical , is seen ranging EN and WSW , including small strings of quartz , which contain ferruginous earth .
The same kind of earth is also seen in the quartz , contained in a vein from ten to twelve inches wide , ranging EN and WSW , and hading to the southward , which has been laid open in forming the Arklow road .
Here the valley is from twenty to thirty yards in width , and is covered with substances washed down from the mountain , which on the sides have accumulated to the depth of about twelve feet .
A thin stratum of vegetable soil lies uppermost ; then clay , mingled with fine sand , composed of small particles of quartz , mica , and shist ; beneath which the same substances are larger , and constitute a bed of gravel , that also contains nodules of fine grained iron stone , which produces so per cent. of crude iron : incumbent on the rock are large tumblers of quartz , a variety of argillite and shistus ; many pieces of the quartz are perfectly pure , others are attached to the shistus , others contain chlorite , pyrites , mica , and ferruginous earth ; and the arsenical cubical pyrites frequently occurs , imbedded in the blue shistus .
In this.mass of matter , before the workings began , the brook had formed its channel down to the surface of the rock , and between six and seven feet wide , but in times of floods extended itself entirely over the valley .
Researches have been made for the gold , amidst the sand and gravel along the run of the brook , for near half a mile in length ; but it is only about one hundred and fifty yards above , and about two hundred yards below the ford , that the trials have been attended with much success : within that space , the valley is tolerably level , and the banks of the brook have not more than five feet of sand and gravel above the rock ; added to this , it takes a small turn to the southward , and , consequently , the rude surfaces of the shistus rock in some degree cross its course , and form natural impediments to the particles of gold being carried further down the stream , which still lower has a more rapid descent ; besides , the rude manner in which the country people worked , seldom enabled them to penetrate to the rock , in those places where the sand and gravel were of any material depth .
Their method was , to turn the course of the water wherever they deemed necessary , and then , with any instruments they could procure , to dig holes down to the rock , and by washing , in bowls and sieves , the sand and gravel they threw out , to separate the particles of gold which it contained ; and from the slovenly and hasty way in which their operations were performed , much gold most probably escaped their search ; and that indeed actually appears to have been the case , for since the late rains washed the clay and gravel which had been thrown up , gold has been found lying on the surface .
The situation of the place , and the constant command of water , do , however , very clearly point out the great facility with which the gold might be separated from the trash , by adopting the mode of working practised at the best managed tin stream works in the county of Cornwall ; that is , entirely to remove ( by machinery ) the whole cover off the rock , and then wash it in proper buddles and sieves .
And by thus continuing the operations , constantly advancing in the ravine towards the mountain , as long as gold should be found , the vein that forms its matrix might probably be laid bare .
The discovery was made public , and the workings began , early in the month of September last , and continued till the i5th of October , when a party of the Kildare militia arrived , and took possession by order of government ; and the great concourse of people , who were busily engaged in endeavouring to procure a share of the treasure , immediately desisted from their labour , and peaceably retired .
Calculations have been made , that during the foregoing period , gold to the amount of three thousand pounds Irish sterling was sold to various persons ; the average price was three pounds fifteen shillingsper ounce ; hence eight hundred ounces appear to have been collected within the short space of six weeks .
The gold is of a bright yellow colour , perfectly malleable ; the specific gravity of an apparently clean piece 19 , ooo .
A specimen , assayed here by Mr. WEAVER , in the moist way , produced from 24 grains , '22-j-U grains of pure gold , and 1-iA43n of silver .
Some of the gold is intimately blended with , and adherent to quartz ; some ( it is said ) was found united to the G e fine grained iron stone , but the major part was entirely free from the matrix ; every piece more or less rounded on the edges , of various weights , forms , and sizes , from the most minute particle up to 2 OZ .
1 7dwt .
; only two pieces are known to have been found of superior weight , and one of those is j , and the other 22 ounces .
IV much regret not having been present when the work was going on , that I might have seen the gold as found , before prepared for sale by breaking off any extraneous matter that adhered for in that state , a proper attention to the substances with which it was united , and a subsequent diligent inspection of the several veins that range through the mountain , might assist towards the discovery of that from whence it was detached .
I shall shortly return to England ; and on my arrival , will send specimens of the gold , and of the different substances of the mountain , to be deposited ( if you think proper ) in the coblection of the Royal Society , And am , with great respect , &amp;c. ABRAHAM MILLS .
The bearings are all taken by the compass , without allowing for the variation .
BESIDES these accounts of the gold found in Ireland , the following information has been received on that subject .
WILLIAM MOLESWORTH , Esq. of Dublin , in a letter to RICHARD MOLESWORTH , Esq. F. R. S. writes , that he weighed the largest piece of gold in his balance , both in air and water ; North SKE T CII 0 tillW GL D JJJX / bT , 'JfikV .

and its specific gravity , to that of sterling gold , as 12 to 18 .
Also that RICHARD KIRWAN , Esq. F. R. S. found the specific gravity of another specimen to be as 13 to 18 .
Hence , as the gold was worth 4 an ounce , Mr. WILLIAM MOLESWORTMI Concl udes , that the specimens are full of pores and cavities , which increase their bulk , and that there are some extraneous substances , such as dirt or clay , contained in those cavities .
This opinion was discovered to be well founded , by cutting through some of the small lumps .
STANESBY ALOHORNE , Esq. his Majesty 's Assay-master at the Tower of London , assayed two specimens of this native gold .
The first appeared to contain , in qu carats , 216 of fine gold ; i8i of fine silver ; 3 of alloy , which seemed to be copper tinged with a little iron .
The second specimen differed only in holding 2 1isinstead of 2468 of fine gold .
Major JOHN BROWN , of the royal engineers , transmitted to the Right Hon. THOMAS PELHAM a sketch of the.spot where the gold ; was found , which Mr. PELHAM has obligingly permitted to be engraved , for the use of the Royal Society .
