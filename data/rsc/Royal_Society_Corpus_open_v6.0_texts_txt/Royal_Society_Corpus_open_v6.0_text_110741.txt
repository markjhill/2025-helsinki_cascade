" A new Method of solving Numerical Equations .
" By Mr. Thomas Weddle , of Stamfordham .
Communicated by S. H. Christie , Esq. , M.A. , Sec. R.S. The object of this paper is to develope a new and remarkably simple method of approximating to the real roots of numerical equa ?
tions , which possesses several important advantages .
After describing the nature of the transformations which are subsequently employed , the author proceeds to develope the process he uses for obtaining one of the roots of a numerical equation .
Passing over the difficult question of determining the limits of the roots , he supposes the first significant figure ( R ) of a root to have been ascertained , and transforms the proposed equation into one whose roots are the roots of the original , divided by this figure ( or -p ) : one root of this equation lying between 1 and 2 , the first significant figure ( r ) of the decimal part is obtained , and the equation transformed into another whose roots are those of the former , divided by 1 -fthis decimal ( or 1 -f r ) .
This last equation is again similarly transformed ; these transformations being readily effected by the methods first given .
Proceeding thus , the root of the original equation is obtained in the form of a continued product .
After applying this method to finding a root of an equation of the 4th , and likewise one of the 5th degree , the author applies it to a class of equations to which he considers it peculiarly adapted , namely , those in which several terms are want ?
ing .
One of these is of the 16th degree , having only six terms ; and another is of the 622nd degree , having only four terms .
