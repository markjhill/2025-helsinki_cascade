A paper was then read , entitled , " Note on the Tides .
" By John WTilliam Lubbock , Esq. V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society .
This communication contains some interesting results which Mr. Lubbock has obtained from observations made at Plymouth , Ports ?
mouth , and Sheerness , under the superintendence of the Masters attendant at those dockyards .
Mr , Dessiou has , with extraordinary perseverance , just completed the discussion of about 6000 additional observations of the tides at the London Docks , with a view to found on a more certain basis the corrections of the moon 's parallax and declination .
The results which he has obtained are utterly irreconcilable with the theory of Bernoulli , and therefore the tables com ?
puted upon that theory must be rejected as inaccurate .
