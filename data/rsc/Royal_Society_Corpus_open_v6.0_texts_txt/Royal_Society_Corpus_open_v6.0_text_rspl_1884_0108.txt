( Abstract .
) The numerous cervine remains which occur in the various collections in Britain and on the Continent have been studied by the author for the last twenty-five years , and in this communication two species , the one hitherto ill-defined , and the other new to science , have been described .
The first , or Cervus verticornis , Dawkins , remarkable for the singular forward and downward curvature of the first time , is represented by a large series of skulls and antlers , which enable the author to define the changes in antler-form from youth to old age , as well as to relegate it to the division of deer with palmated antlers , and to establish its geological age to be Pleiocene , and early Pleistocene , in Norfolk and Suffolk .
The second , or Cervus Savini , is represented by several skulls and many antlers , which present considerable modifications in form at varying ages .
It also belongs to the section of deer with palmated antlers , and is probably the ancestral form of the extinct ( Cervns Browni , Dawkins ) and living ( 0 .
dama ) types of fallow deer .
It has hitherto only been met with in the early Pleistocene forest-bed series of Norfolk and Suffolk .
