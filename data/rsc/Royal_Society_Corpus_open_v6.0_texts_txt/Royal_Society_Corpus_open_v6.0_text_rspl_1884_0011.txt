46 Mr. A. W. Blithe .
Observations on the [ May 15 , .working places A , B , C , shown in the accompanying plan , and early in the present year that I could get into those marked D , E. With the exception of some burnt hay or dried grass which I found at the point X in one of the return air-ways , I saw no traces of burning nor deposits of coked coal-dust in any of the main roadways , but I found well-marked deposits of coked coal-dust in all the working places in both districts of workings as far as I was able to penetrate .
The plan shows that the current of fresh air which came down the downcast shaft was split up into three separate currents at the points K and L. The districts A , B , C , and D , E , were thus ventilated quite independently of each other , and thus it was impossible for any outburst of fire-damp which might take place in one of them to affect the quality of the air in the other .
We are thus compelled to fall back upon some other mode of explanation in this case , and I now submit that in the present , and in my previous papers , I have brought forward sufficient evidence to show that the coal-dust hypothesis is the only tenable one .
If it be admitted , however , that this hypothesis is applicable to Dinas explosion , the conclusion is inevitable that , it is equally applicable to every case of the same kind that has ever occurred .

" Observations on the Ingesta and Egesta of Mr. Edward Payson Weston during his Walk of 5,000 miles in 100 days .
By A. Wynter Blyth , Medical Officer of Health for St. Marylebone .
Communicated by B. W. Richardson , M.D. , F.R.S. Received April 30 , 1884 .
On the 15th day of March , 1884 , Mr , Edward P. Weston finished successfully a pedestrian feat , which consisted in walking 50 miles a day , Sundays excepted , until he had traversed 5,000 miles .
The last 300 miles were walked on a level track in the Victoria Hall ; and frequent observations of the pedestrian 's pulse and respiration , \amp ; c. , were made during six days by Mr. Green , M.R.C.S. , acting under the instructions of a Committee , the active members of whom were Dr. B. W. Richardson and Dr. Ridge .
Mr. Green also made some volumetric determinations of urea for the purposes of his clinical report ; and he measured the urine , preserved the faeces , and weighed or measured all the food , whether liquid or solid .
Day by day I received the urine for detailed analysis , and at the termination of the walk I also received a jar containing the faeces collected during the five days ending at midnight , Saturday , 15th March .

Observations on the [ May 15 , Dr. Richardson has published elsewhere* an account of the results of the general clinical observations , and it suffices to remark , that the pedestrian during the whole time enjoyed the most robust health , and at the termination of the walk was apparently in no way the worse for the continuous exertion of so many months .
My own part in the observations on Weston has been the analysis of the egesta and the calculation of the food equivalents .
The latter have been , for the most part , based upon analyses in my own work on " Food , " supplemented by the mean numbers given in Konig 's " Nahrungsmittel , " and in two instances by analyses of the actual foods consumed.f The Food taken .
Ingesta .
The bulk of the food was taken in three meals\#151 ; breakfast , dinner , and supper .
Carbohydrates were supplied chiefly through porridge , bread-stuffs , potatoes , and tapioca pudding ; albuminoids through eggs , fish , lean beef or mutton ; some fat was taken in the shape of butter , and there was a copious supply of liquids by means of mutton broth , tea , coffee , and aerated waters ; it is also noticeable that each day a certain number of figs were eaten .
Table 1 ( p. 47 ) gives the amounts of the various constituents in grams and cubic centimetres .
In Table II the somewhat complicated diet is reduced to " food equivalents .
" The last day , Saturday , was in some points not comparable with the others ; besides which , we have the results of an analysis of the solid excreta^ corresponding to the food of the five days , from Monday to Friday inclusive , so that it is best to take the average of the five days previous to Saturday , and this average may be compared with any standard diet which would keep a man of Weston 's weight in health during ordinary labour .

The TJrine .
The urine daily measured by Mr. Green , and forwarded to me , was always normal in colour , and contained neither albumin nor sugar .
Each sample was also tested for indigo by adding an equal bulk of strong hydrochloric acid and the proper quantity of bleaching powder , and then shaking up with chloroform ; but in no instance could any evidence of indigo be obtained .
By the time the urine reached me it had always undergone some ammoniacal decomposition , and any # The mineral matter is much too low , as is proved by the fact that the mineral substances excreted were in excess of the calculated ingested mineral substances ; the explanation of which is that I have had no weights given me of the salt taken at meals , nor have I sufficient data for the mineral constituents of the broth , tea , coffee , and liquids drank .

E Mr. A , W. Blithe .
Observations on the [ May 15 , ordinary estimation of urea would have given low results ; it therefore appeared better to estimate the total nitrogen , and with certain deductions described further on to calculate out the urea from the data thus obtained .
The total nitrogen was estimated by the moist process of combustion , first proposed , I believe , by Vijeldahl ( " Zeitsch .
fttr Analytische Chemie , " Heft 3 , 1883 ) , and recently submitted to a very exhaustive research as applied to urine by Dr. Petri and Th. Lehmann ( " Zeitsch .
fur Physiologische Chemie , " Band VIII , Heft 3 , 1884 ) .
It is a very accurate method of determining the total nitrogen in urine , in milk , and probably in most organic liquids , and will , without doubt , be much used .
Two grms. of the urine were placed in a flask , and 20 cub. centims. of pure sulphuric .acid added ; heat was applied by means of a s-mall flame for two or three hours , at the end of which time crystals of permanganate were added until the liquid was first decolorised , and then given a distinct dark pink or red tint .
On now alkalising with pure soda , all the nitrogen present was distilled over as ammonia ; the distillation being assisted by a current of hydrogen gas ; the ammoniacal distillate was received in a known quantity of standard decinormal acid , and titrated back by decinormal soda , using as an indicator phenolphthale in .
The uric acid was determined in the usual way , viz. , by concentrating half a litre of the filtered urine , strongly acidifying with hydrochloric acid , and , after twenty-four hours , collecting the crystals on a weighed filter .
The hippuric acid was estimated by adding some recently calcined magnesia to a litre of the urine , concentrating to a syrup , acidifying the syrup with hydrochloric acid , and extracting the acid liquid with ether .
The alkaloidsv ( mostly kreatinine ) were determined by acidifying with sulphuric acid , and then precipitating by phosphomolybdic acid ; the precipitate was decomposed by baryta at a boiling temperature ; the phosphomolybdate of baryta filtered off and well washed ; the filtrate containing the urine alkaloids and baryta was saturated by carbon dioxide , boiled , concentrated , and filtered , the filtrate being evaporated to dryness and weighed ; as there was still a trace of baryta , it was necessary to ignite , re-weigh , and to take the loss as representing the total alkaloids .
The urea , as before said , was not estimated directly , but was calculated from the total nitrogen after subtracting the nitrogen in the uric and hippuric acids and in the urine alkaloids ; it may be a trifle over-estimated .
For the total solids 5 grms. of the urine were evaporated at 100 ' C. in a platinum dish , until the weight was practically constant .
From a larger quantity concentrated to a syrup , the mineral matter was Table IV .

Observations on the [ May 15 , determined in the usual way .
The methods used for estimating the other constituents were ordinary methods , and need not be detailed .
Table IV gives the total excretion of the various substances mentioned , by the kidney , during each of the six days .
Excretion of Sulphates and Organic Sulphur .
As a subsidiary research , the sulphates were precipitated from a measured sample of the urine by barium chloride , and after the precipitate had been separated , the organic sulphur compound was broken up by saturating the liquid with chlorine .
By this means , a second precipitate of barium sulphate was thrown down , and in the following table is calculated into organic sulphur .

The days in the order of sulphur excretion are Friday , Wednesday , Saturday , Tuesday , Thursday , and Monday .
Since albumin constantly contains sulphur , the sulphates might be governed by the total albuminoids , but a glance at Table V will show that the albumin sequence is Thursday , Wednesday , Friday , Monday , Tuesday , and Saturday , which has no relationship with the sulphur sequence .
It may be similarly shown that for a like reason , the liquids , the cabbages , the oatmeal , and all other constituents save the bread-stuffs may be excluded .
The toast , the bread , and the muffins ( when taken ) for each day 1884 .

added together , and then the days arranged in order , show a very remarkable coincidence as follows , and renders it in the highest degree probable that the greater or less excretion of sulphates depended in Weston 's case on the amount of bread-stuffs consumed .

' Thursday Thursday Monday Note on the Urine Alkaloids .
The alkaloids of the urine , especially kreatinine , have been variously considered as derived from metabolism of the living muscle , or from nitrogenous food .
It is instructive to observe that the urine alkaloids in Weston 's case were in excess on Monday , a day which followed twenty-four hours of complete rest , while during the rest of the week save Saturday , the amounts were rather below normal , the days arranged in series of most alkaloid down to least alkaloid are Monday , Saturday , Friday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , and this series shows no agreement with either the meat ingested or the broth .
It would , therefore , seem that exertion , so far from increasing " the excretion of the flesh bases , oxidises them up probably to urea .
Faeces .
The solid excreta for the five days , Tuesday to Saturday inclusive , were mixed as thoroughly as possible , and analysed as follows:\#151 ; A weighed portion was digested with strong alcohol to remove as much of the water as possible , the dehydrated residue was then exhausted in a Soxhlet 's apparatus by ether ; the alcoholic and ethereal extracts were united , dried , and weighed ; the exhausted residue was also dried and weighed ; the difference between the sum of these weights and the original was taken as representing the water .
I may remark that I have always found the method detailed give more constant results than drying in the usual way .
The fat and cholesterin were extracted from a weighed portion by ether-alcohol , the volatile solvents being driven off , the extract was dried , redissolved by anhydrous ether-alcohol , and on evaporation weighed as fat and cholesterin ; subsequently the cholesterin was extracted by saponifying the fat , and treating the soap with ether .
Mr. A. W. Blithe .
Observations on the [ May 15 , The fatty acids were extracted from the faecal soaps by acidifying with hydrochloric acid a portion of the excreta already freed from fat by ether , and then extracting with the same solvent .
Combustions were made for nitrogen , carbon , and hydrogen .
Undigested starchy matters were determined by conversion into sugar by boiling with a dilute acid and then titrating with Pavy 's ammoniacal copper solution .
The whole analysis is as follows:\#151 ; The solid excreta ( five days ) .

-3885'2 The albuminoids in the food during the five days in which the total egesta were collected , amounted to 1179-2 grms. , representing 186*2 grms. of nitrogen ; the total nitrogen eliminated through the kidneys during the same period was 117"5 grms. , and through the bowels 48*8 grms. ; this subtracted from the nitrogen of the food gives a difference of 19*9 grms. ; hence although all the nitrogen excreted is accounted for as derived from the food , some seems to have been retained , and the nitrogenous equilibrium was not quite perfect .
K. Vierordt ( " Grundriss der Physiologie des Menschen , " 1877 ) calculated on the assumption that 1 grm. of carbon completely burnt is equal to 8080 heat-units , and 1 grm. of hydrogen to 34,460 heat1884 .
] Ingesta and Egesta of Mr. E. P. Weston .
units , that the diet of a certain man consisting of 120 grins , of albuminoids , 90 of fat , and 330 of carbohydrates was equal to 2,922,011 heat-units ; subtracting the carbon and hydrogen excreted in the faeces and urine , the heat-units of which were equivalent to 457,882 , there were left 2,464,129 heat-units as representing the carbon and hydrogen which may be considered to have undergone complete combustion .
A similar calculation gives the mean daily numbers of Weston 's heat-units as 4,690,183 , or just about twice the amount that Yierordt calculated for a man doing ordinary work on the standard diet given above .
Assuming the usual formula to be correct , that a person walking on a level surface raises of his weight through the distance walked , then the work done by Weston daily in the Victoria Hall was equal to 2,462,071 kilogram-metres ( 793 foot-tons ) .
It has usually been held that 1,552,795 kilogram-metres ( 500 foot-tons ) daily was excessive labour , most ordinary work being little more than one-third of this .
Although for a limited time Weston himself , as well as others , has undergone more exertion , his feat is , I believe , the greatest recorded labour , if its continuity be considered , that any human being has ever undertaken without injury .
The Society adjourned over Ascension Hay to Thursday , May 29th .
