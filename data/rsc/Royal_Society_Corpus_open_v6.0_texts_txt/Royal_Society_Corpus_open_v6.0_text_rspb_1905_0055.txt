) Introductory .
The following investigation deals with the changes in the amount of calcium carbonate , the chief substance in the soil acting as a base , which are brought about by natural agencies , by manuring , and particularly by the growth of plants .
Since Cavendish discovered that calcium carbonate dissolves in water charged with carbon dioxide , and ascertained the presence of calcium bicarbonate in many natural waters , it has been recognised that the calcium carbonate present in most soils must be subject to regular loss .
The air enclosed in the soil contains a considerable proportion of carbon dioxide derived from the roots of plants and decaying organic matter ( Wollny , for example , found amounts varying from 3 to 14 per cent , by volume ) , and the soil water , after attaining a state of equilibrium with the gas at this partial pressure , becomes an effective solvent of any calcium carbonate that may be present , removing it as bicarbonate into the drains or the general stock of underground water .
That such dissolution does take place in the upper layers.of the soil is evident from the analyses made by A. Voelcker* and * ' Journ. Chem. Soc. , ' 1871 , p. 276 .

[ Mar. 30 , Frankland* of the drainage waters from the Broadbalk wheatfield at Rothamsted.f Although the the drains , from the flow of which the waters in question are derived , rarely lie more than 2 feet 6 inches below the surface of the soil , yet the drainage water from the unmanured plot contained on the average 99 parts per million of CaO , of which 84 were in the state of bicarbonate , and the water from the plot receiving farmyard manure every year contained 147 parts of CaO per million , of which 72 may be regarded as in the state of bicarbonate .
Such concentrations , representing a hardness of about 17 and 26 degrees respectively , though by no means equal to those of truly calcareous waters , are above the average of natural waters in this country ; yet , as will be seen later , the calcium carbonate from which they are derived is practically confined to the uppermost 9 inches of soil .
While such losses may be regarded as natural , it has long been known that many of the substances applied to the soil under the general term of artificial manures react with the calcium carbonate there present and bring about its dissolution .
Liebig , for example , pointed out that the di-hydrogen calcium phosphate ( " superphosphate " ) contained in bones made soluble by treatment with sulphuric acid , reacts at once with the bases in the soil and becomes again insoluble .
The researches of Way !
and A. VoelckerS showed further that the retention of ammonium and potassium salts by cultivated soils is always preceded by a double decomposition with calcium carbonate , the bases being retained as carbonates while the acids appear in the drainage waters combined with calcium .
A. Yoelcker 's analyses of the Rothamsted drainage waters , || when dealing with the plots receiving salts of ammonium , potassium , etc. , as manures , show the same reactions taking place on a large scale .
Again , the process of nitrification , going on in all normal soils , requires some base to combine with the nitrous and nitric acids produced by the oxidation of the ammonia and other nitrogen compounds.^ !
In an ordinary way this base is supplied by calcium carbonate , hence a further source of loss to the calcium carbonate of cultivated soils .
The soils of the Rothamsted experimental plots afford peculiar facilities for the study of the rate at which these losses of calcium carbonate , both natural * ' Journ. Roy .

and induced by the application of saline manures , are taking place .
In most cases the plots have received the same manures , year after year , for more than fifty years , and though unfortunately samples of the soil were not taken at the starting of the experiments , yet in the case of the Broadbalk Field , on which wheat has been grown continuously since 1843 , a set of samples drawn in 1856 has been preserved , in addition to samples drawn in 1865 and in 1893 .
From the Hoos Field ( continuous barley since 1852 ) samples were drawn in 1868 , 1882 , and 1904\#151 ; 5 , and from Agdell Field ( under a four-course rotation since 1848 ) samples exist which were drawn in 1867 , 1874 , 1883 , and 1905 .
Furthermore , the calcium carbonate in the Rothamsted soil is of extraneous origin , and is entirely localised in the surface layer which is stirred by the plough .
The subsoil , from which the surface soil is undoubtedly derived , belongs to the drift formation of " clay-with-flints , " characteristic of the chalk plateau , and consists of the debris of the chalk formation largely mixed with sands and clays of the Reading series.* It normally contains little or no calcium carbonate , although it is partly derived from the chalk formation and rests upon the solid chalk at a varying depth of 8 to 12 or 20 feet .
In the eighteenth century , however , a characteristic feature of the agriculture of this district of Hertfordshire was to manure the land by sinking pits through the clay to the chalk , which was then lifted and spread in considerable quantities .
Arthur Youngf quotes from Walker 's Survey of 1795\#151 ; " the now prevailing practice of sinking pits for the purpose of chalking the surrounding land therefrom . . .
The most experienced Hertfordshire farmers agree that chalking of lands so circumstanced is the best mode of culture they are capable of receiving .
" Evidence of the former prevalence of this practice of chalking may be seen by the existence in each of the Rothamsted fields of a " dell , " a depression representing the fallen-in pit from which the chalk was extracted .
A certain rawness of the soil round the edges of these " dells " still bears witness to the disturbance created by the excavation , though it is known that nothing of the kind was done during the late Sir John Lawes ' possession of the estate , which dates back to 1834 .
Probably the pits were but little worked after the close of the eighteenth century , and certainly neither chalk nor lime has been applied to the plots since they were put under experiment .
At the present time the * See H. B. Woodward , " Report of the Soils and Subsoils of the Rothamsted Estate .

I.\#151 ; Calcium Carbonate in Bothamsted Soils .
A. Analytical .
The first section of this paper deals with the determinations of the amounts of calcium carbonate present in the soils and subsoils of certain of the plots in the Broadbalk , Hoos , Agdell , and Little Hoos Fields , the samples having been drawn at the dates specified above and again in 1904\#151 ; 5 .
As the calcium carbonate is of artificial origin , and was probably distributed with considerable irregularity , however much this may have been equalised by the subsequent working to which the soil has been subjected , it cannot be expected that the samples analysed will represent the whole soil of the plots with the same degree of accuracy as would be attained in the case of some original constituent of the soil .
Arable soils only are considered ; with soils in permanent grass the question is complicated by the well-known action of earthworms , which , as demonstrated by Darwin , bury the surface layer by constantly bringing fine subsoil to the top .
The determinations of calcium carbonate have been made by means of an apparatus described by one of us in conjunction with Dr. E. J. Bussell.* The results are calculated from the volume of carbon dioxide evolved on treating the fine soil with dilute sulphuric acid in , due provision being made to bring into account the carbon dioxide remaining dissolved in the reacting liquid .
In a few cases , where the percentage of calcium carbonate was very low , the carbon dioxide evolved by treating a considerable quantity of the soil with acid was absorbed by caustic soda and determined by double titration .
For these determinations we have to thank Mr. Arthur Amos , B.A. The amount of magnesium carbonate present is too small to affect the results , and in any case , as the real quantity sought is the amount of readily available base in the soil , it is desirable to express it always in the same terms .
The soil samples were all taken in the same way ' : a steel frame 6 inches or 1 foot square and 9 inches deep is driven into the ground , and its contents are carefully picked out ; this gives the soil proper .
The surrounding soil is then dug away and the frame is driven down another 9 inches .
The contents now represent the subsoil at the second depth of 10 to 18 inches .
The process is then repeated to as many holes as may be required .
In this way samples are taken from four , six , or eight holes on each plot , according to its size .

] The samples , after drying at a temperature not exceeding 60 ' C. , are roughly powdered and put through a woven wire sieve with a mesh of \ inch ( this sieve passes a little more than the 3 mm. round-hole sieve now commonly used ) .
From the fine earth thus obtained from each hole composite samples representing the whole plot at each depth are then made up , of which portions are finely ground for analysis .

Mr. A. D. Hall and Dr. N. H. J. Miller .
[ Mar. 30 , Certain difficulties are experienced in attempting to calculate from these figures the actual quantity of calcium carbonate per acre in the soil at different periods , owing to the impossibility of drawing samples that represent the same layer of soil on each occasion .
Since changes of texture are set up by the different treatment of the plots the consolidation of the surface layer varies , so that the 9-inch slice includes more or less soil from time to time .
On most plots the weights of the samples tend to get heavier , because the soil sets more closely together under the conditions of long-continued manuring Table II.\#151 ; Weights of Fine Soil Dried at 100 ' C. per Acre .

with saline manures and the gradual loss of organic matter .
On the contrary , the soil of the plot receiving farmyard manure grows lighter through the great accumulation of organic matter .
These changes of weight would be of little moment were the soil uniform , but as the calcium carbonate is almost wholly present in the surface soil down to about six or seven inches , small variations in the thickness of the slice taken by the tool cause a varying admixture of the poorer subsoil , and so may induce considerable change in the estimated Mr. A. D. Hall and Dr. N. H. J. Miller .

It is impossible to eliminate wholly the errors thus introduced , especially in the case of Broadbalk , where the average weights of the 1865 samples are exceptionally low and where the subsoil shows also a good deal of variation .

The two sets of figures lead to much the same comparative results , but the lower table is to be preferred as free from any speculative corrections , bearing in mind , however , that the rate of loss is probably over-estimated on most of the plots and under-estimated on the plot receiving farmyard manure .
Fig. 1 shows these percentages of calcium carbonate in the upper soil plotted against the time .

A cursory examination of the figures and curves shows that if it may be assumed that the calcium carbonate was equally distributed over the whole field initially , then the greatest losses have occurred on the plots manured with ammonium salts , the loss increasing with each addition of ammonium salts ; sodium nitrate , on the contrary , would seem to have exercised some preservative influence on the calcium carbonate , which is now at its maximum on the plot where that manure is used .
Table VI gives the weights of calcium carbonate per acre in soils from the Hoos field as calculated from the percentages in Table V and from the average weights of soil in Table II , without any attempt at correction ; the results being also thrown into a graphic form in fig. 2 .

B. Loss of Calcium Carbonate on Unmanured Land .
It will be convenient to consider the unmanured plots together , so as to get an idea of the initial loss of calcium carbonate to the soil when there are no disturbing influences introduced by the manure .
All the unmanured soils show the same general characteristics\#151 ; a comparatively large amount of calcium carbonate in the top 9 inches , varying from nearly 6 per cent , on Agdell Field down to little more than 2 per cent , on Hoos Field .
The second depth , however , contains as a rule between 0T and 02 per cent. , only in a few special cases does it rise above the latter figure ; in the third depth the proportion is OT per cent , or less .
As the Bothamsted fields are situated on almost the highest levels of the chalk plateau , it is difficult to suggest any reason for the restriction of the calcium carbonate to the surface soil other than its artificial origin , and this conclusion is confirmed both by the irregularity in the amount found in different fields and by its absence where the land has not been under cultivation .
Samples were taken from three places on the adjoining Harpenden Common , where the same class of land occurs at approximately the same level as the experimental fields , but which has never been in cultivation and now carries a growth of poor grass , gorse , and bracken .
The results:\#151 ; Soil of Harpenden Common , 1 to 9 inches deep ... 0210 p. c. CaC(\gt ; 3 .
" " 10 to 18 " ... 0*136 show that initially the soil of the Bothamsted Estate must have been practically devoid of calcium carbonate .
The successive determinations of the amounts present in the soil of the cultivated fields give the following rates of loss per acre per annum for the unmanured land : Broadbalk 800 lbs. ; Hoos , 1000 lbs. ; Agdell , 922 and 938 lbs. ; Little Hoos , 1046 lbs. , or an average loss of over 944 lbs. per acre per annum due to percolating water only .
These rates are all probably too high , because of the gradual exhaustion of the organic matter and the resultant consolidation of the soil which has affected the later samples .
But even after making all corrections that are possible for this source of error , the rate of loss would still amount to 800 lbs. per acre .
These estimates may be to some extent checked by certain determinations made in 1896\#151 ; 8 of the amount of calcium compounds present in the water percolating through the drain gauges at Bothamsted .

Two causes contribute to make this figure low .
In the first place the soil of the gauges is not very rich in calcium carbonate , determinations made on samples taken in 1870 from the land immediately adjoining gave 3'06 per cent. , while two small samples bored out from the actual gauges in 1905 gave 1-88 per cent , for the upper 9 inches .
Secondly , the air contained in the soil of this plot must be comparatively deficient in the carbon dioxide On the Retention of Bases by the Soil .
1905 .
] necessary to bring the chalk into solution ; as a rule the soil gases get richer in carbon dioxide the greater the depth , but the soil of the gauge is cut oh from the subsoil and open to the atmosphere at the 60-inch depth .
The long absence of any crop or manure will have reduced to very small limits the amount both of organic matter decaying to carbon dioxide , and the organic sulphur compounds which by bacterial action became sulphuric acid and leave the soil as calcium sulphate .
These causes will co-operate to lessen the removal of calcium carbonate from the soil in the gauge , and as a matter of fact the concentration of 53-5 parts of CaO per million observed in its drainage is only about half of the concentration of the water running from the the-drains beneath the unmanured plot in Broadbalk , which according to Voelcker 's and Frankland 's analyses ( Table X ) amounted in the mean to about 99 parts per million .
But assuming that this latter figure represents the average proportion of lime in the drainage water from the unmanured plot , and that the average annual percolation through the soil of this plot is 10 inches , * equal to that through the 60-inch gauge , the annual loss of calcium carbonate per acre should amount to 400 lbs. for the unmanured plot instead of the 800 lbs. found by analysis of the soil of the plot .
The number of analyses , however , upon which the former estimate is based , is too small for great accuracy .

Mr. A. D. Hall and Dr. N. H. J. Miller .
[ Mar. 30 , 53 inches , the annual loss of lime is estimated at 630 kilogrammes per hectare , almost exactly equivalent to 1000 lbs. of calcium carbonate per acre .
Unfortunately , the proportion of calcium carbonate in the soil is not given , but the agreement with our figures for the removal of calcium carbonate is very satisfactory .
Another consequence of some interest follows from these determinations of the loss of calcium carbonate from the unmanured plots .
The analyses already quoted of the drainage water from the unmanured plot of Broadbalk Field show about 100 parts of lime per million , equivalent to a loss of about 400 lbs. of calcium carbonate per acre in the surface soil instead of 800 lbs. estimated from the analysis of the soil .
But the deep-seated waters of the chalk contain on the average about 150 parts of lime per million , a deep well at Harpenden , for example , yielding 158 parts per million.* Assuming that the percolation through the unmanured plot on Broadbalk represents the average percolation over the chalk area , then the removal of chalk by solution would be in the ratio of the concentrations of the two waters in question , i.e. , the average annual denudation of the chalk by solution alone would amount on the one estimate to 600 lbs. , or on the other to 1200 lbs. per acre per annum .
As the specific gravity of the chalk is about 2*2 , and it contains from 95 to 99 per cent , of calcium carbonate , this would mean a lowering of the surface by solution alone at the rate of either 1/ 11000 or 1/ 5500 of a foot per annum .
These estimates depend upon the assumption that the percolation through this unmanured plot of arable land represents the percolation over the whole area of the chalk , whereas ordinary crops or even grass would cause increased transpiration and allow of less percolation .
But on the contrary , the figure adopted for the concentration of the lime in the drainage water from the unmanured plot is based on only a small number of analyses and would appear to be too low .
The concentration of the drainage waters would be increased by any use of organic manures , by heavy cropping or by permanent vegetation , all of which would increase the production of the carbon dioxide causing dissolution in the soil .
For example the analyses of the water from the plot receiving farmyard manure every year show an average of 123 parts of lime per million instead of 99 from the unmanured plot .
This increased proportion of lime in the water percolating through ordinary land may be set off to some extent against the lessened percolation due to crops , but on the whole the evidence is in favour of the lower rate , so that a denudation of about 1/ 10000 foot per annum is a more probable figure .
The accuracy of the sampling is not sufficient to enable any conclusion to be * Warington , 'Trans .

] drawn as to whether the loss of calcium carbonate fluctuates with the rainfall and percolation during each period .
But the magnitude of the annual loss is somewhat surprising ; assuming it to be only 800 lbs. per acre , then the Broadbalk Field must have contained at least 70 tons per acre of chalk at the beginning of the nineteenth century , and still contains so much that it will not be exhausted by the end of the present century .
As , also , the rate of loss will probably fall with each reduction in the quantity present , dissolution being proportional to the surface exposed , the period of complete exhaustion will be considerably postponed .
Since much of the value of the land agriculturally , both in its fertility and in its ease of working , depends on the presence of calcium carbonate , it is clear that for the last 100 years the agricultural community have in this respect been living upon the capital accumulated by their forefathers , and are taking no steps to replace the inevitable depletion of this capital .
C. Effect of Manures upon the loss of Calcium Carbonate .
Most of the manured plots under investigation receive a dressing of " mineral manures " in addition to the varying amounts and compounds of nitrogen .
This mineral manure consists of 3| cwt .
per acre of superphosphate containing 17 per cent , of soluble phosphoric acid ( equivalent to 37 per cent , of calcium phosphate " made soluble " ) , 200 lbs. of potassium sulphate , and 100 lbs. each of magnesium and sodium sulphates .
Of these substances the superphosphate reacts immediately with the calcium carbonate of the soil , the sparingly-soluble di-calcium hydrogen phosphate being precipitated wherever the superphosphate solution comes in contact with a particle of chalk in the soil in accordance with the equation CaH4P208 + CaC03 = Ca2H2P208 + C02 + H20 .
To complete this reaction , the 3| cwt .
of superphosphate would require about 47 lbs. of calcium carbonate , but so small an annual loss would hardly be perceptible in the analyses .
The neutral sulphates of potassium , sodium , and magnesium should occasion no loss , for though they react with calcium carbonate , the resultant alkaline carbonate is retained by the soil and would be estimated as calcium carbonate by the method of analysis adopted , which is based upon the carbon-dioxide evolved on treating the soil with acid .
The action of the plant also , discussed later in this paper , would probably result in the reconversion of the sodium and potassium carbonates into calcium carbonate .
The action of the mineral manures , as seen in the analyses of the soil , has not occasioned sufficient loss of calcium carbonate to be apparent within the limits of accuracy VOL. LXXVII.\#151 ; B. C Mr. A. D. Hall and Dr. N. H. J. Miller .
[ Mar. 30 , of the determinations .
In the Broadbalk Field , Plot 10 can be compared with Plot 7 ; both receive the same amount of ammonium salts , but Plot 7 receives the minerals in addition .
The rate of loss is practically identical , 1010 lbs. per acre per annum on Plot 7 and 1045 lbs. on Plot 10 .
Unfortunately Plot 5 , receiving minerals only without nitrogen , cannot be compared with the unmanured Plot 3 , because both Plots 5 and 6 show an entirely exceptional rate of loss , not to be accounted for unless it be that one of the dells , from which the field was originally chalked , lies in these two plots , and may have caused a very irregular distribution of the chalk .
But if the rate of loss on Plot 5 be calculated over the period 1881\#151 ; 1904 only , it amounts to 880 lbs. per acre against 800 lbs. per acre on the unmanured plot .
In the Hoos Field the results are too irregular to bear much discussion , for the plots which receive minerals\#151 ; 4o , 4a , 4n\#151 ; start with less than half the chalk contained by the corresponding lo , 1a , and In .
In the plots , however , which receive ammonium salts as a manure , the loss of calcium carbonate is much increased .
A reaction of the type ( NH4)2S04-f CaC03 = ( NH4)2C03 +CaS04 takes place as soon as the ammonium salts are dissolved , the ammonium carbonate is adsorbed by the surface action of the humus and the finer clay particles of the soil until it is nitrified , while the calcium sulphate passes forthwith into the drainage water .
When heavy rain follows the application of the ammonium salts to the Broadbalk wheatfield , only traces of ammonia find their way into the drains , whereas there is an immediate great increase in the calcium sulphate and chloride present in the drainage water .
At Bothamsted the manure termed ammonium salts consists of an equal mixture of ammonium sulphate and chloride , and is applied to the various plots at the rate of 200 , 400 , and 600 lbs. per acre , quantities which would react with 161 , 321 , and 482 lbs. respectively of calcium carbonate .
Before , however , the ammonium carbonate thus produced has been long in the soil a second molecule of calcium carbonate must be consumed to provide a base for the nitrous and nitric acids formed by its nitrification .
This would make the loss caused by the application of 200 lbs. of ammonium salts up to 321 lbs. of calcium carbonate , half of which is caused by the initial reaction producing ammonium carbonate , and half by the nitrification of the latter .
In order to determine the rate of loss in the field , it will be convenient , in the various cases where a comparison is possible , to subtract the average rate of loss on a plot without ammonium salts from the plots receiving ammonium salts , and divide by 2 or 3 , as need be , to find the effect in each case of 200 lbs. of ammonium salts .

117 " This mean value for the loss caused by 200 lbs. of ammonium salts is not very far from the 161 lbs. estimated above as necessary to convert them into ammonium carbonate , but neither the mean nor any of the individual analyses support the view that a second molecule of calcium carbonate is removed from the land by the nitrification of the ammonium carbonate .
However , this nitrification must take place ; indeed , there is every evidence that it takes place so rapidly and thoroughly in the Rothamsted soil that no ammonium salts are carried forward un-nitrified from one season to the next .
The analyses of the drainage waters ( Table X ) , while they show a progressive increase in the amount of lime for each addition of ammonium salts in the manure , do not permit any estimate to be formed of the rate of removal , so much is the extent of the percolation , as seen in the relative frequency with which the drains run , affected by the size of the crop , which becomes large on the heavily-manured plots .
It remains , therefore , to be explained why the loss of the soil should be at the rate of one rather than of two molecules of calcium carbonate for every two molecules of combined ammonia applied in the manure .
The plots receiving sodium nitrate in place of ammonium salts show not only no special loss of calcium carbonate due to the nitrogeneous manure , but a distinctly diminished loss as compared with the unmanured plot .
On Broadbalk the nitrate plot loses at the rate of 564 lbs. per acre against 800 lbs. on the unmanured plot ; on Hoos the loss is 465 lbs. , against 675 lbs. on the plot receiving the same minerals but no nitrate .
That the sodium nitrate exercises some conserving influence on the calcium carbonate in the soil is also apparent from a consideration of the analyses of the subsoil .
On Broadbalk , where the subsoil from 10 to 18 inches contains in most cases 0T or 0'15 per cent , of calcium carbonate , the same layer beneath the plot receiving sodium nitrate shows 0*31 , 0*26 , 04:8 , and 044 per cent , at the various dates , while the third depth of this plot is also richer than on the corresponding plots .
Further evidence maybe derived from the composition of the drainage waters ( Table X ) ; the water from the plot receiving mineral manures only c 2 Mr. A. D. Hall and Dr. N. H. J. Miller .
[ Mar. 30 , contains 132 parts of lime per million , the plot receiving the same minerals and sodium nitrate gives a drainage water containing 126 parts of lime per million .
Thus where the nitrate is used there is both a lower concentration of lime in the drainage water and a smaller total percolation , because of the much greater crop , and consequently increased transpiration on this plot .
The sodium nitrate then either saves the calcium carbonate of the soil from its normal loss or has some power to bring about the re-formation of calcium carbonate .
With this fact must be correlated the non-disappearance from the other plots of the calcium carbonate required to form calcium nitrate with the nitrified ammonia base .
Considering lastly the plots receiving farmyard manure , the Broadbalk Field shows a much lower rate of loss on the plot manured every year in this way than on the unmanured plot , 590 lbs. against 800 lbs. per acre per annum .
The corresponding plots in the Hoos Field hardly confirm this view , since both the plot receiving farmyard manure and that receiving rape cake , the only other organic manure employed , appear to be losing calcium carbonate at much the same rate as all the other plots .
However , as the Hoos Field results rest upon determinations made at two dates only instead of four as in the case of Broadbalk , it is much more probable that the result yielded by the latter is trustworthy .
The subsoil of the plots receiving farmyard manure also show amounts of calcium carbonate above the normal\#151 ; 0*28 , 0*31 , 042 , and 0'24 in Broadbalk , and 0'28 and 045 in Hoos Field .
The drain beneath the farmyard manure plot on the Broadbalk Field runs but rarely , because the humus derived from the long-continued organic manuring of this plot is capable of temporarily absorbing any ordinary rainfall and then passing it gradually down to the subsoil without causing the drain to run .
But the few analyses that have been made of the water draining from this plot indicate a lower concentration in calcium compounds than would be expected from the large amount of carbon dioxide produced by the decay of recent organic matter , and also from the considerable annual addition of calcium compounds in the manure itself .
The composition of farmyard manure is very variable , but the mean of a number of analyses gives 06 per cent , of CaO , or an annual application of 190 lbs. per acre , of which the greater part is in combination with organic acids .
There is , therefore , an addition of calcium compounds in the manure more than equivalent to their greater concentration in the drainage water , and the net result is a gain of calcium carbonate to the soil as shown by the diminished rate of loss on this as compared with the unmanured plot .
We thus obtain three lines of evidence that there is some agency saving or re-creating the calcium carbonate of the soil : ( 1 ) the loss of calcium carbonate On the Retention of Bases by the Soil .

] induced by the use of ammonium salts is less than half that required for the absorption and subsequent nitrification of the ammonia ; ( 2 ) where sodium nitrate or ( 3 ) where farmyard manure is applied , the rate of loss of calcium carbonate is below that of unmanured land .
Further evidence that there must be under normal conditions some action at work protecting or renewing the bases of the soil may be gathered from the continued fertility of many soils containing but a trace of calcium carbonate .
The following analyses may be quoted of soils that have fallen under the personal observation of one of us , soils which , despite their very low content of calcium carbonate , have continued to give crops under arable cultivation for a long period .

Table XI also shows a series of determinations of calcium carbonate in the soil of this field taken at the beginning of the experiments and in 1902 .
The amount of calcium carbonate present is exceedingly small , barely determinable in fact , yet the plots continue to yield normal crops , except those which have been manured with ammonium salts .
The latter in recent years have become almost sterile , showing an acid reaction to litmus paper and refusing to grow wheat or barley unless they first receive a dressing of lime* Now in all these cases , however low the proportion of calcium carbonate may be , the action of the percolating water must remove some of it , and the recurring process of nitrification also demands a base .
Yet the small quantity of base available does not disappear entirely so as to render the soil unfertile , unless some specially calcium carbonate consuming material , like the ammonium salts , is employed as a manure .

[ Mar. 30 , soils almost devoid of calcium carbonate has long been a problem , but it now seems probable that the calcium carbonate and other bases which are required for nitrification are in some way returned to the soil as bases , and that when a ready-formed nitrate like sodium nitrate is used as a manure there is an addition of available base to the soil or a corresponding diminution in the amount of calcium carbonate removed by the drainage water .
Furthermore these or other agencies conservative of calcium carbonate are sufficient to maintain the quantity in the soil at the level for comparatively healthy growth .
Of the possible conservative actions , two will be now considered and evidence be brought to show that ( 1 ) the normal growth of plants leaves behind a residue of base in the soil , ( 2 ) the decay of plant tissues results in the production of calcium carbonate .
II.\#151 ; Effect of Plant Geowth on the Reaction of the Soil .
The plant , it is well known , does not take up the salts of the soil water in the proportions in which they are present in the solution , but exercises a selective action in favour of substances necessary to the nutrition processes , such as potash and phosphoric acid .
And if the composition of the ashes of the plant be taken into account , it is clear that the selective action is exercised not merely on the salts with which the root is in contact but on their acids and bases considered separately .
For example , from a solution of calcium nitrate the plant would withdraw more nitric acid than its equivalent of lime and from a solution of potassium sulphate more potash than its equivalent of sulphuric acid .
When a plant is burnt the ash is usually alkaline , because the organic acids and any nitrogen present as nitrate in the plant are all driven off , leaving the bases as carbonates .
But when a balance is struck between the acids and bases in the ash and when the nitrogen present in the plant before burning is calculated as an acid , since it all entered the plant as nitrate , the acids are generally to be found in excess .
Warington , * indeed , has already pointed out with reference to the published analyses , that plants must retain more acids than bases .
It does not appear to have been noticed , however , that such a result , by leaving behind in the soil a corresponding excess of base , must have an appreciable effect upon the reaction of the soil , although Knop and other early investigators have observed that the solutions in which plants are grown as water cultures become alkaline after a time .
It is hardly possible to decide whether the excess of base is left behind in the soil water * ' Agricultural Students ' Gazette , ' 1899 , p. 133 ; see Laws and Gilbert , ' Journ. Roy .

] or excreted by the root cells .
The nutrient constituents pass through the cell wall of the root hairs by osmosis until the concentration is the same on either side ; such substances as are required by the plant are then withdrawn from action by the protoplasm , thus lowering the concentration on the inside and causing a fresh diffusion of that particular substance through the cell wall .
Looking at the question from the standpoint of the ionic hypothesis , the soil water would be a highly ionised solution , in which any given ion will pass by osmosis into the root-hairs as long as the plant maintains the tension of that ion lower on the inside of the cell than in the solution outside .
As the plant is always transforming the nitrogen , sulphur and phosphorous from the condition of inorganic acids in which they enter into neutral or even basic organic compounds , and since it also as a rule utilises more of these substances- than of the metallic bases , such acid ions will be withdrawn by the protoplasm in greater quantity , and so must pass through the cell wall from the external solution at a greater rate than the corresponding basic ions , the necessary equilibrium being maintained by the carbonic acid excreted by the root cells.* From this point of view , when the root is drawing nutriment from a solution of a neutral nitrate , the nitric acid ions would be travelling inwards to the protoplasm and the carbonic acid ions outwards , so that the carbonate of the base might be considered as forming outside the cell wall .
If , on the other hand , the salt be considered to move into the cell undissociated and there to lose its nitric acid to the protoplasm , the base must then be supposed to diffuse out again as carbonate .
The net result , however , is the same under either hypothesis , viz. , that after the plant has been growing for some time in a neutral solution it will have taken up an excess of acid and left a corresponding excess of base , now combined as carbonate , in the solution representing the water of the soil .
The following Table ( XII ) shows the composition of several crops as percentages and again recalculated as equivalents of hydrogen , phosphoric acid being reckoned as tribasic , since the soil solution will be mainly derived from tribasic phosphates in the soil .
It will be seen that there is a considerable excess of acid in the plant , from which it follows that an equivalent amount of base was left behind in the soil .
This base is in most cases nearly equivalent to the nitrogen taken in as nitrate , and calculated as calcium carbonate will amount to between 100 and 300 lbs. of calcium carbonate per acre .
In other words the normal growth of farm crops leaves behind from the salts in the soil used for its nutrition about as much base as would have been previously required for the nitrification of * For a discussion of the electrical disturbances such an interchange would involve , see Kohn , ' Landw .

Although the many ash-analyses which have been made of farm crops afford conclusive evidence of this restoration of base to the soil , it seemed desirable to submit the fact to experimental verification .

contained in cylinders of Jena glass holding about 3 litres ; it was found that after growth had gone on for some time the solutions had gained in alkalinity by an amount equivalent to the nitrogen taken up by the plant , less the alkalinity of the plant ash .
One example of these trials will suffice .
A cabbage plant made 7*525 grammes dry matter containing 2705 per cent , of nitrogen = 0*2035 gramme nitrogen , equivalent to 0*01454 gramme hydrogen .
The ash of the plant had an alkalinity equivalent to 0*01082 gramme hydrogen .
The culture solution gained alkalinity = 0*00558 gramme hydrogen , which with the 0*01082 gramme alkalinity of the ash makes 0*0164 gramme of alkaline hydrogen found in ash and solution , to correspond with the 0*01454 gramme of acid hydrogen equivalent to the nitrogen in the plant .
In 1904 six cultures were started with wheat in similar jars on March 3 , and growth was continued without changing the solutions until June 11 , when the grain was fully formed .
Three grains were sown in each jar and growth was extremely vigorous , but was continued a little too long , for at the close of the experiment no nitrate remained in the solution .
For purposes of analysis a mixture was made of Nos. 1 and 2 , and of 3 and 4 , the remaining two being kept in reserve .
Table XIII shows the results obtained .
In the initial solution there was a trifling excess of acid over base owing to the presence of a little ferric chloride , of which the acid alone is brought into the account .
At the end it will be seen that there is an apparent gain of nitrogen , due in the main to dust ( the greater part being present in the sediment which formed in each jar ) and the seed ( which contained Table XIII.\#151 ; Wheat Grown in Water Culture .

This excess of nitrogen accounts for the slight excess of acid over base in the final result when all the nitrogen is reckoned as acid .
It will be seen that the solution and sediment ( representing the soil ) gained in the one case base equivalent to 0*01878 gramme of hydrogen and in the other to 002332 gramme of hydrogen , quantities which would probably have been increased had the growth not been continued until all the nitrate was exhausted .

] root which aids in bringing about the solution of nutrient materials in the soil , * but no evidence could be found that anything except carbon dioxide passed from the roots into the culture solution .
After growth a considerable bulk of the culture solution was evaporated to dryness and gently heated , very slight signs of charring were observed , no more than could be attributed to the dust , and the residue showed the same alkalinity before and after ignition , as would not be the case had any organic acid excreted from the root been present .
On one occasion freshly precipitated ferric hydrate was introduced into the solution as a source of iron ; although this was distributed all over the young growing roots so that it could not be shaken off , the plants began to suffer from lack of iron , and continued to do so until a trace of ferric chloride was introduced .
Despite the well known acidity of the root-sap there seems no evidence that in normal cases it ever passes outside the cell wall , as long as the roots are unbroken .
These experiments then afford experimental justification for looking to the growth of the plant as an explanation of some of the difficulties raised by the rate of loss of calcium carbonate on the different plots .
The analyses of crops already quoted serve to show that the return of base to the soil may be large , quite sufficient to make up for the calcium carbonate required each year for nitrification .
Hence soils which start with very small proportions of calcium carbonate may yet preserve their healthy condition and permit of nitrification , the losses caused by which are thus repaired .
Again it becomes intelligible that the use of ammonium salts as a manure only occasions the loss of one molecule of calcium carbonate for each two molecules of ammonia , since the second molecule required for nitrification will be more or less restored during the growth of the plant .
It has already been shown that the actual loss of calcium carbonate to the soil caused by the use of 200 lbs. of ammonium salts approximates to 161 lbs. , and not the 322 lbs. which would be required if the calcium nitrate produced by nitrification were wholly removed from the soil .
Further , when nitrate of soda is used as a manure , from the neutral solution in the soil of calcium or sodium nitrate an excess of acid will be taken by the crop , leaving the soil richer in base .
Hence the conservative action of sodium nitrate on the calcium carbonate of the soil that is visible in the analyses of both Broadbalk and Hoos Fields .
It is possible to calculate the amount of base restored to the plots receiving nitrate of soda on the assumption that they possess the same average composition as the wheat and barley in Table XII , and that the amount of base returned * See Czapek , ' Pringslieim 's Jahr .

The results , as a whole , go to show that the action of plants , in leaving behind a basic residue from the neutral salts in the soil upon which they feed , is a very essential feature in the chemistry of the soil , explaining , amongst other things , the maintenance of healthy conditions on the many soils poor in calcium carbonate .
It also serves to explain one or two other points which have been observed in connection with the use of sodium nitrate as a manure .
It has long been noticed that the continued use of sodium nitrate is very destructive to the texture of a clay soil , intensifying all the clay properties , rendering the soil persistently unworkable when wet , and forming hard and intractable clods when dry .
The ultimate cause of such an effect is the " deflocculation " of the fine particles composing the soil ; they are no longer bound together in loose aggregates , but are separated so as to give the soil its most finely grained character .
Such deflocculation of the soil can be brought about by a trace of any soluble alkali , just as the opposite state of flocculation is induced by a slightly acid reaction .
The Kothamsted soils continuously manured with sodium nitrate show marked signs of deflocculation , the drainage water from the nitrated plots in the Broadbalk Field is always more turbid than that from the other plots , and as one of us has shown , * there results in time on the nitrated plots a perceptible washing * Hall , ' Trans. Chem. Soc. , ' 1904 , vol. 85 , p. 964 .
1905 .
] On the Retention of Bases by the Soil .
down of the finest particles set free by the deflocculation into the subsoil or the drains .
The bad texture of the soil following on the use of sodium nitrate is particularly to be seen on the mangel field , where it reaches its maximum on the plots receiving sodium nitrate and other neutral alkali salts like potassium sulphate and sodium chloride : it has been repeatedly observed to be at its worst in the winter and spring after a large crop has been grown on the sodium nitrate plots .
As the soil of this field contains but little calcium carbonate , some of the base left behind in the soil by the growth of the crop would consist of bicarbonate of sodium or potassium , especially where the other alkali salts are applied in the manure , and there would be quite enough free alkaline carbonate thus formed to cause a thorough deflocculation of the soil .
This explanation would agree with the observed fact that the deflocculation is much diminished where superphosphate only , an acid manure , is used in conjunction with the sodium nitrate .
III.\#151 ; Effect of Organic Manures on the Eeaction of the Soil .
Although the evidence is not so trustworthy as in the case of sodium nitrate , yet the use of farmyard manure and of rape cake seems also to result in a diminished rate of loss of calcium carbonate to the soil .
Some of this may be due to the lessened percolation consequent on the greater water-retaining power of the soil enriched in humus , but another cause may be sought in the bacterial decomposition of calcium salts in the organic debris .
Farmyard manure contains various calcium salts derived from the vegetable matter out of which it has been formed , sometimes in their original form , but partly broken down into the undefined carbon compounds known as " humates .
" Calcium humate , Wollny* has already shown , can be converted into calcium carbonate by bacteria present in the soil , while the following experiments show that the commonest of all calcium salts in the plant , the widely distributed calcium oxalate , is readily fermented to carbonate .

contains one or more organisms which are very effective in converting calcium oxalate into carbonate .
The mechanism of the reaction is being further studied ; in the present connection the experiments are sufficient to show the existence of other agencies of a bacterial nature engaged in restoring calcium carbonate to the soil .
The destruction of nitrates by bacterial action , with the evolution of the nitrogen as gas , the change commonly known as " denitrification , " is always attended by the production of a carbonate of the base with which the nitric acid was combined , but as any calcium carbonate formed in this way would only replace the calcium carbonate consumed in the previous nitrification there would be neither gain nor loss to the soil .
As also denitrification is most likely to take place in the lower subsoil where the oxygen of the soil On the Retention of Bases by the Soil .

] gases has been exhausted , any calcium carbonate re-formed in this way would not appear in the analyses set out , which only extend to the depth of 27 inches .
It is , however , clear that manuring with organic manures , the growth of clover and other leguminous plants which leave behind a considerable residue of roots and stubble particularly rich in calcium oxalate , the of plant tissues which accumulates in the soil of grass land , all go to maintain the stock of calcium carbonate , which in its turn is being as constantly drawn upon for nitrification and for the neutralisation of the other acids produced during the bacterial decay of the carbon compounds the soil receives .
Doubtless in all soils containing only a minimal amount of calcium carbonate under natural conditions these various actions have reached an equilibrium , since the increase of any one only tends to bring into play the factor which limits it ( the rate of nitrification , for example , will be slowed down as the available base in the soil becomes scarce ) , but also accelerates the operation of some action in the opposite sense ; even the one irrevocable loss by drainage and removal of crop will probably be balanced by the calcium salts coming into solution through the continued weathering of the soil particles .
In the main , however , the original stock of calcium carbonate in the soil circulates continually between plant and soil without suffering appreciable loss .
It is only under particular conditions , such as the use of ammoniacal manures , or the setting up of anaerobic conditions through lack of drainage , thus allowing the formation of organic decay acids but not their final oxidation to carbonates , that the soil will develop an acid reaction and become insertile .
Summary .
The chief points brought out in the course of the investigation are as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Arable soils which contain upwards of 1 per cent , of calcium carbonate are subject to a normal loss of that constituent in the drainage water amounting to about 800 lbs. to 1000 lbs. per acre per annum .
( 2 ) The loss is increased by the use of ammoniacal manures by an amount equivalent to the combined acid of the manure .
The loss is diminished by the use of sodium nitrate or organic debris like farmyard manure .
( 3 ) The growth of plants normally returns to the soil a large proportion of the bases in the neutral salts which the soil provides for the .nutrition of plants .

] The majority of the investigators of the subject consider that the cells of the germinal epithelium arise by differentiation of the peritoneum , and become embedded in the subjacent mesoblast , there being probably a dual process , namely , the downgrowth of the cells themselves and a simultaneous upgrowth of the subjacent mesoblast .
The fate of the cells thus embedded has given rise to much discussion .
All observers agree in stating that they give rise to the ova , and most observers consider that they give rise also to the follicle cells ; but de Foulis ( 8 ) , * Schron ( 16 ) , and Wendeler ( 20 ) , believe these cells to be derived from the connective tissue .
Pfliiger ( 15 ) and Waldeyer ( 18 ) , although differing in regard to the development of the ovary , both consider that the germinal cells give rise to the cells of the follicular epithelium , there being most probably a previous division of the original cells .
Nagel ( 14 ) also agrees that the follicle cells are derived from the germinal epithelium .
Balfour ( 4 ) believed that some of the cells of the egg-clusters became ova by differentiation , and he described besides a number of small cells , of which some formed the follicular epithelium and the others probably either served as foodstuff for the rest , or eventually themselves formed ova or follicle cells .
Buhler ( 7 ) describes the formation of the follicular epithelium by the * These numbers refer to the entries in the bibliography at end .
