A Comparison of Barometrical Measurement , with the Trigonometrical Determination of a Height at Spitzbergen .
By Captain Edward Sabine , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F.R.S. Read May 6 , 1824 .
[ Phil. Trans. 1824 , p. 290 .
] The hill selected for this comparative measurement was the highest within convenient distance , of which the ascent was practicable , on the western part of the north coast of Spitzbergen .
The summit was less than two miles from the observatory , in a direction nearly due south , the observatory being upon an island rather more than a mile from the main land .
In consequence of the extreme inaccuracy of the chart of Fair Haven , published in Captain Phipps 's voyage , the author has annexed to this paper a sketch of the harbour and adjacent coast , to show the positions of the hill and observatory .
The small bay formed by the shore of the main land , to the north-east end of the hill , being frozen over , afforded a perfectly level base , and corrections for inequality were thus rendered unnecessary .
A polished copper cone was fixed upon a staff at the summit of the hill , the apex of which was proposed as the height to be measured : it stood 44 inches above the highest pinnacle of the summit .
Captain Sabine then enters into the details of this trigonometrical measurement , from which the altitude of the cone is considered as equal to 1644 feet .
The author next proceeds to detail the particulars of the barometrical measurement , and the precautions taken to insure accuracy in the instruments , and in their employment ; and the height of the cone thus ascertained was 1640'07 feet .
Captain Sabine concludes this paper with some remarks upon the incorrectness with which the heights of the hills on this coast are set down in Captain Phipps 's voyage .
