We have next to consider the influence which variation ia the chemical nature of the drop-forming liquid may exercise upon the drop-size in the case SLG .
The liquids which were selected for this purpose were chosen as being , typical of extensive classes , rather than as being connected with one another in immediate chemical relation .
They wereWater .
Oil of turpentinie ( turpentol ) .
Alcohol .
Benzol .
Acetic acid .
Glycerine .
Acetic ether .
Mercury .
Butyric acid .
These several liquids were allowed to drop under the same conditions , from the bottom of a hemispherical platinum cuip .
The arrangement of the apparatus was quite similar to that described in Part I. , the ivory ball being replaced by the platinum cup , and the overflow of the cup being determined by strips of paper bent over its edge .
The case of merculry is the only one which requires somse explanation .
A few years ago I noticed the fact that mercury which holds even a very little sodium in solution has the power of " wetting " platinum in a very remarkable manner .
The appearance of the platinum is quite similar to that presented by amalgamable metals in contact with mercury .
But the platinium is in no wise attacked .
Further , the amalgam may be washed off by clean mercury , and the latter will also continue to adhere equally closely to the platinum .
All the phenomena of capillarity are presented between the two .
The surface of the mercury in a platinum cup so prepared is quite concave ; and a basin of mercury may be em-ptied if a few strips of similarly prepared platinum foil be laid over its edge-just as a basin of water may be emptied by strips of paper or cloth , and under the same condition , namely that the external limb of such capillary siphon be longer than the internal one .
I generally use this curious property of sodium-amalgam for cleaning platinum vessels .
It enables us now to examine the size of drops of mercury under conditions similar to those which obtain in the case of other liquids* .
After the cup had been used for the other liquids , its surface was rubbed with sodium-amalgam and washed with clean mercury .
A few strips of similarly prepared platinum foil being bent over the edge and pressed close to the sides of the cup , the mercury could be handled similarly to the other liquids .

I The experimenital numbers obtained are given without omission .
The liquiids are arranged in the order of magniitude of their drop-sizes .
It appears from column 5 ( of the specific gravities ) that some of the liquids employed were not perfectly puire .
This , however , is quite immateri'al in the present directionof eXaMiDation , provided that in all cases where the liquids named are in future employed and compared with those of Table VII .
, idenitically the saine liquids are meant .
The luinbers of columil 6 , with which we are now exclusively conicerned , present several paints of great interest .
In the first place , it appears that the specific gravity of a liquiid is not by any means the most powerfil determinant of the drop-size .
TIhius butyric acid , which has sensibly the same specific gravity as water , gives rise to a drop less than half the size of the water-drop ; while inercury , of singular specific gravity , has nlo exceptionial drop-size .
Lastly , it may be observed how tha , remarkable body water asserts here agaill its preeminence .
The first impressionl which these numbers m ake is , that there are three grouips of magnitude , a , 2 n , 3 a. But it is possible that chaneage in the niature of the solid might throw these drop-sizes into a diiffent order of magnitude ; and certainlly until a very muchl greater number of bodies is e-eamineld in this sense , it would be premature to attemipt to establish anything , like a laqw .
It is suaicient for the present to point out that the drop-size is not directly dependent upoln either the specific gravity or boiling-point ; nlor does it stand in any obvious relation to what is sometimes called the liquidity , mobility , or thinness of a liquid .
For we find that glyceriine and ( from former ex periments ) cocoa-nut oil both form smialler drops than water , the one being heavier and the other lighter than that body , and both being viscid or sluggish .
OCn the other hand , alcohol and acetic acid , both perfectly rnobile liqtuids , give rise to drops about half as large as those of glycerine* .
1-Ience it is clear that we are still ignorant of that property of a liquid upon which its drop-size mainily depenids .
VWe are not yet in a positioni to connect the drop-size with any of the knownl physical or chemical properties of liquids .
We approach the solution of the problem by studying the effects of change in some others of the variables .
The adhesion betweein the liquid which drops and the solid from which it drops is also affected by the curvature and general geometric distribution of the solid at and about its lowest point .
Anid the variation in the adlhesion between the solid and liquid , caused by the variation in the geometric distributioni of the solid , may and does in its turn affect the size of the drop .
Frolm this aspect , one of the simple3t kinds of variation is that offered by a system of spheres of various radii , but made of the same material .
And this case is an important one , because it undoubtedly offers.the key to all drop-size variation arisingo , from a similar cause .
To study this point we may make use of any one conivenient liquid , such as water , and cause it to drop at a fixed rate from spheres of various radii , including the extreme case of a horizoutal plane .
This extreme case , however , presents certain practical difficulties .
From a plane it is almost impossible to get a series of drops uniiform in growth-time and in position .
A ripe.drop hanging from a horizontal plane will seek the edge thereof .
Several drops may form upoli and fall from the same plate at the same time and independently of one another .
It is only by employing a plate not absolutely flat , that anl approximationl to the required conditions can be made .
Taking r for the radius of cnirvature , the first numbers for r=can therefore be considered only as an approximation .
The arranigemenits for the other cases were quite similar to that described in Part I. , fig. 3 .

{ 20 75 26760 }0 13356 IL 20~ 7-1 f257521 0-12877.11591 It appears , therefore , that the drop increases in size according as the radius of the sphere increases from which the drop falls , and , further , that the difference of drop-size brought about by this cauise alone may easily amount to half the largest drop-size .
For dispensers of medicine this fact is as important as that pointed out in Part I. , where it was shown that the growthtime so materially influenced the drop-size .
The lip of a bottle from which a drop falls is usually annuloid .
The amount of solid in contact with the dropping liquid is determined by the size of two diameters , one measuring the width of the rim of the neck , the other the thickness of that rim .
In most cases the curvature and massing of the solid at the point whence the liquid drops is so irregular as not to admit of any mathematical expression .
The reason why drops which fall from surfaces of greater curvature are larger than those which fall from surfaces of less curvature is surely this In the case of a surface of greater curvature the base of the drop has more nearly its maximum size ; the centre of gravity of the liquid filn from which the drop hangs is nearer to the centre of gravity of the hanging drop ; the contact between the two is more extensive and intimate ; so that the drop is held for a longer time and therefore grows more .
On comparing columns 3 and 5 of Table VIII .
, there does not appear to be any obvious law of connexion between the two ; nor inideed can the numbers of column 4 pretend to such a degree of accuracy as would justify us in attempting to establish one .
This is seen on comparing inter se the numbers of column 4 .
Especially with the spheres of longer radii , there is so much difficulty in getting a uniform wetting of the surface whence the drop falls , and this so materially influences the drop-size , that the numbers found are seen to vary considerably .
Greater accord is obtained with spheres of less radii .
As we might expect , the same absolute increase in length of radius takes less effect upon the drop-size in the case of longer than in that of shorter radii .
The infinite , or at least indefinitely great difference between the radii 1 and 2 produces about the same effect upon the drop-size as the difference of 43 millims. between the radii 2 and 3 , and so on .
The following Table of first differences shows this more strikingly n+r^ .
wa+l VJn oo 001854 43 0 02189 22-9 0 01362 29-7 0 03760 240 00732 3-6 0 01643 030 00226 1-2 0 00575 25 000965 040 00479 The relation exhibited in this Table supports the supposition that the size of the drop varies inverselv as the contents of a figure bounded below by a circular horizontal plane of constant diameter ( less than that of the sphere ) tangent to the sphere , laterally by a cylinder of vertical axis standing on the tangent plane and cutting the sphere , and above by the convex surface of the sphere itself ( Plate IV .
fig. 4 ) .
As the diameter of the sphere still further diminishes , the size of the drop is limited by the possible size of its base , until finally the sphere is completely included in the drop .
It would be interesting , but it would take us too far , to colnsider the various cases of liquids dropping from cones , edges , solid angles , cylinders , rings , &amp;c. We must content ourselves in this direction with the fact that the size of a drop is greater the more nearly plane is the surface from which the dropping takes place .
If it were possible for a drop to fall from a concave surface , we should anticipate a still further increase in its size .
The relation between drop-size and curvature may be more strikingly shown by arranging the spheres one above the other in the order of magnitude .
Plate IV .
fig. 5.-Each sphere receives the drops from the higher one .
The quantity of water which drops in a given time , from every sphere , is the same .
Hence in all cases the number of drops is inversely as the dropTABLE IX.-Water .

For several reasons , this plan of comparison is not sufficiently accurate to measure drop-sizes ; but it offers a method of making the difference of drop-size visible to any number of persons at once .
The only other variation in the geometrical relation between the solid and the liquid , which we shall conisicler , is the variation iuithe size of a circular horizontal plane from which drops fall .
Five disks of copper foil were cut of the radii 9509 432 -1th of an inch respectively .
These were fastened horizontally to vertical wires , and , having been thoroughly cleaned by momiientary imnlersion in nitric acid and washing , water was made to drop from them at the rate gt2 " .
Table IX .
slhows the influence of this kinid of variation uponl drop-size .
The waant of accord in the numbers of the larest ( lisk is owing to a peculiar tremor which the drops exhibit at the momenit of delivery .
The same phenomerLoni was noticed , but to a less extent , with the next smialler disk .
With the remainder it was not noticedl .
The curvature and shape of the solicl , and its consequent massing towards the liquid , is intimatelv connected with the next plhase of variationl which we shall coinsider , to wit , the varibation in the chemical compositioni of the solid from which the drop falls .
The inifluence of this kincl of variation is to be studied by examining the size of dr1ops formed under like circumstances , from spheres of the same size , but made of dit-rerent material .
Since in this case the liquid .
remainis the same , we must limit the solids examined to sucl as the iiquid completely wets .
In this case , variation in the dropsize implies a -nariation in the tblickness of the liquid film covering the solid .
The latter must be caused by variation in the adhesion betwxeeon the solid and liquid .
Finally , such adhesion can only vary through one or botl of two causes-naiimely , variation in the density of the solid , or in its specific adhesion dependent uponl its chemical nature .
The first qualitative experiment was made upon three equal spheres of brass , glass , and cork .
They were hung one above the other in the manner before described , so that the drop from onie sphere fell upon the lower one* .
It was fouind that , in whatever order the spheres were arranged , when the flow was uniform and not quicker than gt 2"t , the dropping from the cork took place with the greatest rapidity , that from the glass next , and that from the brass muost slowly-sholwing that the brass gives rise to the largest , the glass to the noext largest , and the cork to the least drops .
From this it would seem that the drops are in the -ame order as to size as are the solids as to density .
We shall find , howrever , that this is not always the case , and that some othei property as well as density is at work to influence the drop-size .
The quantitative experiment , the results of which are given in Table X. , eonfirms the result of the qualitative experiment given above , but shows , at the same time , that the joint influenices of den* In this kind of experiment there shotld be a considerable mass of cotton wool on , each sphere to receivy the drops from the higher one , and , by acting as a reservoir , to regulate the flow , sity and chemical diversity of the solid have only a small effect upon the drop-size .
The conditions of the experiment were similar to those previously described .

2-6260 0(13118 I2-62961 ~26116 ) When a liquid drops from a solid it is not always that the adhesion betweeni the solid and liquid is overcome .
The phenomenon of " wetting " implies a superiority of the adhesion between the solid and liquid over the cohesion of the liquid ; and in all cases where a liquid drops from a solid which it wets , the act of separation is a disruption of the liquid , and not a separation of the liquid from the solid ; that is , the separationi of the drop is a failure of cohesion and not of adhesioni .
We are not , however , justified on this account in anticipating that the size of a drop is unaffected by the chemiical nature of the solid from which it drops , even in those cases where the adhesion between the solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion of the liquid ( that is , where the liquid completely wets the solid ) , because , although it is the liquid which is broken , yet the size of the broken-off part , or drop , depends in great measure uponl the thickness of the residual film , as we have seen in examining the influence of the growth-time ( in Part I. ) and of the radius of curvature .
Adhesion may also exist between a solid and a liquid wh'ich does not wet it , as when a drop of mercury baings from a glass sphere , But the cohesion of the liquid in such a case , by its effort to bring the liquid to the spherical form , and the weight of the drop so modify the adhesion between the solid and liquid , by altering the size of the surface of contact between the two , that the size of the drop gives no direct clue to the cohesion of the liquid .
We may now examine a few cases in .
which , the size of the sphere remaining the same , and its denslty in some instances nearly so , the matter of the solid varies , but the liquid wets it in all cases .
This will show whether the differences of Table X. are due wholly to differences of density of the solid , or also or wholly to differences of chemical constitution .

The surfaces of the metals were roughened by momentary immersion in acid ; tin and antimony in hydrochloric , the rest in nitric acid .
Without this precaution a metallic surface is apt to be wetted only locally , the base edge of the drop is irregular and inconstant , and the dropweight varies .
Indeed with some metals , such as tin , a smooth arid bright surface is scarcelv wetted by water .
As the bodies examined have different coefficients of expansion by heat , and one of them expands on solidification , it was necessary to test the equality of their size and remedy any iniequality .
This was donle by arranging three of them , one at each angle of a small equilateral triangle drawn on a large piece of plate glass .
Another piece of plate glass was then placed upon the spheres so as to rest on them all three , and slightly loaded .
On passing a gauge between the plates , at their edges , the slightest inequality of the spheres could be detected , because the gauge lifted the plate off the smallest of the three balls , which could then be moved .
The larger spheres were then reduced in size by brisk agitation in acid .
The sulphur and phosphorus were , for the same purpose , washed in ether .
Although there is only a slight difference between the consecutive terms of column 3 , yet between the extremes of anitimony and tin a well-marked difference exists .
This Table shows that the drop-size stanids in no simple relation either to the equivalent density or chemical character of the solid , and establishes the existence of a specific adhesion independent of these .
Although the differences of Table IX .
may be partly owing to the differences of density of the solids cork , glass , and brass , yet we see from Table X. that there is about half as great a difference between the sizes of drops from antimony and tin as between those from -cork and brass , although the difference of density between the first two is small compared with that between the last .
Again , sulphur gives rise to drops intermediate between those of antimony and cadmium .
Without , therefore , venturing to assert that density is without influenice on drop-size , it is clearly proved that it does not exert the most powerful influience .
We have finally to examine the direction and extent of variation in dropsize caused by change of temperature .
By altering the density of the liquid , a change in its temperature may affect the drop-weight without altering the drop-size .
It may further alter the drop-size by altering the size and therefore the curvature of the solid .
Any error introduced by the first of these souirces is eliminated by dividing the observed weight by the specific gravity at the proper temperature , as in the case of different liquids at the same temperature .
Errors from the second source may be certainly safely neglected , being far within the errors of observation .
In the place where these experiments were made , the range of natural atmospheric temperature is very small .
From the coldest to the hottest season the difference scarcely exceeds 100 C. This circumstance made an extended and minute study of the inifluence of temnperature impossible , by preventing more than one observationi at each temperature being made .
The liquid taken was water , and the solid was glass .
The water was heated to the boiling-point and placed in the apparatus ( Part I. fig. 3 ) .
The sphere from which the water fell was the bulb of the thermometer which measiured the temperature .
Fully the upper half of the sphere was covered with cottoni-wool , so that the whole of the sphere was kept wet .
The considerable mass of mercury in .
the bulb of the dropping sphere or thermometer itself served to mialke more uniform the temperature of the drops ; while the actuial coltact betweeui the drops auid the spherical btulb enisured a tolerably close approximationi between the actual temuperature of the drops and that iudicated on the stem .
of the instrumenit .
Although , therefore , the temperatures observed cannot pretend to any even approximate positive accuracy , yet they are certainly in the actual order of magnitude .
The arrangement is seent in Plate IV .

C. *The single drop-weights are correspondingly grouped , and the mean of each group is then divided by the specific gravity of water ( 00= 1 ) at the mean temperature of the group .
It appears then that , for a range of 200 Centigrade , or 36 ?
F. , the difference in drop-size effected by change of temperature in the liquid is inappreciably small , not being more than 0 00277 , a quantity almost within the limits of experimental error ; for on referririg to Table X. we find that the greatest differenice between the numbers for glass , which should be equal , amounts to 0 00044 grm. , or a sixth of the greatest difference due to variation in temperature .
On the whole , then , we may conclude that the teimperature has very little influence on the drop-size in the case of water between the above limits .
No doubt , near the point of solidification , where liquiids have an incipienit structure , the drop-size would be subject to sudden changes of magnitude .
A few experiments with other liquids , namely turpeiitol , acetic acid , and alcohol , showed that with them the drop-size was almost equally insernsible to chalnge of temperature ; and in all cases , as with water , the lower the tenmperature , on the whole , the larger the drop .
We have now examined seriatim all the chief causes upon which the drop-size depends in the case SLG .
They are , 1 .
Rate of delivery ; 2 .
Solids held in solution ; 3 .
Chemical niature of liquid ; 4 .
Geometric relation between solid and liquid ; 5 .
Density and chemical nature of solid ; 6 .
Temperatu-re .
Our data , however , are still insufficient for us to predict , ulder all circumstances , the relative sizes of the drops of liquids under known external conditions .
Clearly the missing term is closely related to the specific cohesioni of the liquid .
But what is cohesioni ?
and how can it be measured ?
It lies perhaps in the niature of things-it seems at least inevitable-that the niomenclature of elementary properties snould be vague and unsatisftactory .
The properties of solids-hard , soft , brittle , tough , teniacious , elastic , malleable-do not stained in any definite relationto one another .
Even the hardness which resists abrasion , the hardness which resists penetratiol , the hardness which resists crushing are by no means ideentical ; so that onie body may possess more of the one sort of hardness than a second body does , while the second body exceeds the first in another sort of hardness .
Nor do any of the above-mentioned properties of solids stanid in any simple relation to that resistance to the separation of the contiguous parts which is called cohesion .
Thus , by no attribution of this single property of co*hesion could we define ice or shell-lac , bodies which are at the same time tough , brittle , elastic , and soft .
We are forced to the coniception of two distinct kinds of cohesion-stubborn and persistent .
These may coexist , but are not identical .
The one is strong to assert , the other pertinacious to maintain .
The four following substances may serve to illustrate the possession of these two cohesions in various quantity .
Talc has little stubborn and little persistent cohesion .
Glass has much stubborn and little persistent cohesion .
Gold has little stubborn and much persistent cohesion .
Iron has much stubborn and much persistent cohesion .
The necessity for such a discrimination exists in a yet higher degree in liquids .
If we conceive two liquids of different nature dropping , from the same substance which they both wet , and if there be only one kind of cohesion , the one which has the greatest cohesion will tend most strongly to assume the spherical form ; and this would tend to cause it to drop sooner , or have a smaller drop-size than the other .
On the other hand , the liquid of stronger colhesion will cling most strongly to the film of liquid adhering to the solid ; this will keep it longer from falling , and thereby increase its drop-size .
Hence an increase of cohesion tends to produce two contrary effects .
But if there be a similar distinction between the two kinds of cohesion of liquids , as above pointed out in the case of solids , we have the following consequence .
It is the persistent cohesion which causes the assumption of the spherical form , the stubborn which resists the separation of the drop .
The former tends to diminish , the latter to increase its size .
As onie or other predominates , the size of the drop varies .
Accordingly the drop-size is by no means a measure of what is generally called the cohesion of the liquid , but rather a measure of the difference between the two cohesions , stu-bborn and persistent ; and the law is , that the drop-size varies inversely as the persistent , and directly as the stubborn cohesion of the liquid .
In mercury , water , and glycerine the stubborn cohesion is greater in proportion to the persistent cohesion than in the other liqcuids examined but it by no means follows that persistenit cohesion is wanting in mercury or stubborn in alcohol .
When a drop is in the act of falling its stubborni cohesion is in equilibrium with the resultant of two forces the onie , the persistent cohesion , tending to produce a spherical form , the other the weight of the drop .
Since the former of these component forces is , for the same liquid , constant , it seems as though the weight of the drop might ue taken as a measure and expression of the stubborn colhesion .
But such is not the case , because we have no ground for supposing that the diameter of the drop where the separation occurs is of constant size ; on the contrary , it must be conceded that in larger drops this hypothetical surface of stubborn cohesion is larger than in smaller drops .
Further , unless we know the exact shape of a drop in all cases , we are not in a positionl to deduce the size of the surface of cohesion from the drop-size or drop.weight .
In the cases where it has been tried , it has not been found that the niature of the gaseous medium in the case of SLG exerts any appreciable or definiite influence upon.the drop-size .
Taking glass for the solid and water for the liquid , the medium was changed from air to nitrogen , hydrogen , and carbonic acid .
The exceedingly slight variation wrought in the drop-size by this change may probably have been due to the different solubility of the gases in water , and the consequenit alteration in the cohesion of that liquid .
Having , now traced the effect of variation in the conditions which determine the size of a drop in the general case SLG ( or where from a solid a liquid drops through a gas ) , we come to the case SLL ( that is , where from a solid a liquid drops through a liquid ) .
As in the cases of SLG , we must here also take the three terms of such hebmical nature as to be withouit action upon -one another .

A preliminary quantitative experimenit was made under the following conditions:-Water was made to drop from a glass sphere at the rate gt51f The drops were collected in a tube bearing an arbitrary mark .
The number of drops required to fill the tube up to this mark was nioted .
Then the sphere was surrounded by turpentol , and the rate havin , been brought again* to gt=511 , the number of drops of water necessary to fill the tube up to the same mark was counted .
The turpentol being replaced by benzol , the same operation was performed .
The entire arrangement of the Stalagmometert is seen in Plate V. fig. 7 .

flask , supported by the filter-stand K. Through the neck of C passes the tube D. C and D are joined liquidtight by the caoutchoue collar L. A few arbitrary marks are made at E. The lip of C is turned down to a beak at M above the vessel F. In adjusting the instrument , to get the required value of gt , the holder K is slipped along the table so that the drops from G fall between C and D , and not into D. Wheni the required rate is obtained , it is slipped back again .
When such liquids as turpentol are used as media , a little water is poured between D and C to protect the caoutchouc .
In all cases where a liqui-d medium is employed C is filled till it runs over .
In the first experiment , of which the results are given in the following Table XIII .
, the numbers are subject to two sources of error .
The volume filled is rather small , and no allowance is made for meniscus .
In this , as in all cases of SLL , great care must be taken not to shake the instrument .

ileice variation in the liquid medium , iindependent of variation in its deiisity , produces an enormous effect uponl drop-size .
We slhall have occasion to return to this case .
The influence which the liquid medium exerts on the drop-size , and the share of that influence due to the specific gravity of the medium , will be well seen on comparing the drop-sizes of mercury which falls through various liquid miedia .
The arrangement of the apparatus for this purpose is seen in Plate V. fig. 8 .
As far as A it is similar to fig. 7 .
The siphon A , fig. 8 , is a capillary tube ; its lower end , which is turned vertically downwards , rests upon a sphere of brass , JR , which has been washed with nitric acid and sodium-amalgam , and allowed to soak for some days under mercury .
Mercury adheres perfectly to such a sphere .
In every case the sphere was immnersed just halfway in the liquid .
A small capsule S is supported in the liquid on a stained T about half an inch lower than the bottom of the sphere .
As soon as gt becomes conistantly =.511 , the vessel V is moved so that S comes under IR .
Five drops of mercury having beeni caught , the cup is movedl horizontally as before , taken out and replaced by a fiesh one , and so on .
The batches of five drops are washed , dried , and weighed .
The results are given in Table XV .
We may , however , previouLsly notice here with advantage a phenomenon which attends the separation of drops under several circumstances , but which cani be watched most narrowly in the cases of SLL , because in .
a liquid the separation of a drop is less abrupt than in a gas .
When water falls from glass through air , imnmediately after the drop separates , a very minute drop is frequenitly projected upwards from the upper surface of the drop* .
I have not traced the cODnditions under which this supplementary drop is formed ; indeed it is sometimes formed , and sometimes not , under apparenitly similar circumstances .
No doubt the proximate cause is that the drop at the instant of separation is not spherical ; the persistent or retentive cohesion , which brings it almost immediately to its normal shape , does not allow time for its more excentric parts to collect to the main mass ; they are therefore by the motion of the main tdrop flung off and projected upwards .
The same phenomenoni is seen much more distinctly when water drops at this rate ( gt-5 " ) ugh beuzol or turpentol .
In these cases the persistenit cohesion of the liquid mediuian conmes also into play .
But the most striking example of supplementary drops is seen when glycerine forms the medium through which mercury drops .
In this case , when gt 5 , there are always two_supplementary drops of merculry formed .
It is impossible to determine whether they both have their origin at the same moment and from the same drop .
The probability , however , is that they have not , but that one is first separated from the main drop , and the second from the first ; for there is always a great disparity between the sizes of the two suppleriientary drops , whereas , if they were both formed at the same time and for the same reason , we should be justified in expecting greater equality .
The drops soon separate in falling , in consequence of the difference of their surfaces .
T4e relative sizes of the main and supplementary drops in the case of mercury falling from copper through glycerine were determined as follows:-A nunber of porcelain cups ( fig. 9 ) were arranged at the bottom of a shallow dish full of glycerine ; when the rate of dropping was uniform at gt=4 " ' , the dish was shifted horizontally so that every drop with its two supplements was caught in a separate cup .
The globules of mercury in each cup were removed by a little scoop of copper foil .
Ten of each kind were collected .
After washing and drying , they were weighed , with the following result : TABLED X1V , -Me1uCry .

They are not reckoned in taking the mean .

Mean weight of single drop , from column 3 .
Column 5 .
Specific gravity of medium .
Column 6 shows the weight of the drop of mercury in the tiquid .
Since the falling of the drop is determined in part by its weight , and since the weight depends not only upon the size of the drop , but also upon the density of the medium in which it is formed , it is interesting to see how the size of the drop is affected by the diminution in its weight caused by the denisity of the medium .
If W1=weight of drop of mercury in air , W2=required weight of drop of mercury in liquid , A=specific gravity of liquid , B=specific gravity of mercury ; then W2=W IB w1 .
The values of W2 form columii 6 .
The liquid media are arranged according to the order of magnlitude of the numbers of colurn 4 .
The salient points of Table XV .
are chiefly these : 1 .
The drop-size of a liquid which drops under like conditions through various media does ntot depend wholly upon the density of the medium and consequent variation in the weight , in the medium , of the dropping liquid .
Thus glycerine , whose density is above that of all the other liquids examined , does not , as a mediunm , cause the mercurial drop to assume either its minimum or maximum size .
2 .
The liquids in Table XV .
are in the same order as in Table VII .
In other words , if there be two liquids , A and B , which drop under like conditions through air , and the drop-size of the one , A , be greater than that of the other , B ; then if a third liquid , C , be made to drop through A and through B , the drop-size of C through A is greater than the drop-size of C through B. 3 .
Further , on comparing Tables XIII .
and XV .
it appears that , whether water or mercury drops through turpentol and benzol , the drop through benzol is greater than the drop through turpentol .
This we shall afterwards find confirmed in other instances into the law , If the drop-size of A through B be greater than the dr-op-size of A through C , then the dropsize of D through B is also greater than the drop-size of D through C. It is further observed that , while mercury exhibits its largest drop when falling through air , water assumes its smallest drop-size under this condition .
This method of the examination of liquids by drop-size in the case SLL , which brings so prominently forward a comparatively slight difference betweeni similar liquids , may be used , not only to detect commercial adulterations of one liquid by another , but perhaps to distinguish between those remarkably-related isomeric liquid bodies ( the number of which is quickly increasing ) between whose terms the difference has until lately escaped detection .
Of these bodies perhaps the first most remarkable inistance was furnished by the two amylic alcohols ; but the greatest number at present known is amongst the hydrocarbons .
We may take an example illustrating the use of the stalagmometer in approximatelv measuring the proportioni , in a mixture , of its two chemically and physically similar , but not isomeric constituents .
Suppose we had a liquid which we knew to consist wholly of a mixture of benzol and turpentol , and we wished to find the proportion in which TABLE XV .

We could scarcely approach to an answer by any of the means hitherto employed .
The specific gravities of the two liquids are so close ( -864 , 863 ) that the density of the mixture would give us no substantial aid .
Though there is a conisiderable difference ( 800 C. ) in their boiling-points , no one who is familiar with the difficulties of fractional distillation would place any relianice upoln a quantitative separation based upon volatility .
TIheir refractive indices are nearly the same Their vapour-densities , 2 77 , 4 76 , though comparatively different , are not absolutely v-ery wide apart .
They are active and passive towards most of the same chemical reagents , and interfere with one another 's reactions .
If we have r ecourse to chemnical analysis ( C12 , , C20 E1 a very small experimental error would point to a great difference in the proportion of the two .

In other words , the stalagmometer is sensitive to an alteration of about 6 per cenit .
By increasing the capacity of the recipient , it is clear that the drop-numbers , and therefore their differences , might be increased at pleasure .
Thus by counting the number of drops necessary to fill a volume six times the size , we could tell to within one per cent. how much tuirpenitol and how much benizol were present .
But it is perhaps in the cases of the still more proximate identity of isomeric bodies meentioned above that the stalagmometer may be used rather *1 The refractive index of turpentol is 1-476 ; that of benzol does not appear to have been measured ; but that it is almost identical with that of turpentol is seen on mixing the two .
In those cases in which I propose chiefly to use the stalagmnometer , namely with isomeric liquids , the method of refraction is useless , becepuse isomeric liquids seem always to have the same refractive indices .
as a stalagmoscope , to render evident rather than to measure a difference of drop-size .
From Table XVI .
we gather the general law concerning three liquids , two of which are insoluble in the third .
If a liquzid , A , drop downwards under like consditions in succession through two liquids , B and C , then its drop-size through any mixture of B and C is intermediate between its drop-size through B and its drop-size through C ; and the greater the B proportion of C in the mitlure , the more nearly does the drop-size of A through the mi ture approach to the dro.p-size of A through c alone .
We have already examined the influences on the drop-size in the case SLG of the density of the dropping liquid , and of its persistent and stubborn cohesions respectively .
Increase in the former two tends to diminish the drop-size ; increase in the last to increase it .
Let us examine in like manner the influence of the similar properties of the medium .
1 .
The density of the medium.-Increase in the density of the medium is equivalent to diminution in the density of the dropping liquid , and must therefore be followed by a tendency to increase in the drop-size .
2 .
Stubborn cohesion of viedium.-The resistance to displacement , or stubborn cohesion of the medium , tends to keep back the drop in its place , and makes it necessary for a larger quantity of the dropping liquid to accumiulate ; that is , it increases the drop-size .
3 .
Retentive cohesion of mediumn.-The same force of persistent or retentive cohesion which causes a drop of a liquicl to take the spherical form , would also cause the liquid to give or tend to give a spherical form to an irregularly-shaped volume of a solid , liquid , gas , or vacuuim in it .
Thus gas-bubbles in liquids have an approximately spherical form , not by reason of the cohesion of the parts of the gas , but by the persistent cohesion of the liquid medium which moulds the gas into that form by which the cohesioni of the liquid is most gratified .
1-Jence increase in the retentive or persistent cohesion of the mediumn tenids to diminish the drop-size of the dropping liquid .
In all cases of SLL we may represent the direction of the influelnce of the determuinants by the following scheme , in which the signl + denotes a tenidency to increase , the sign one to dinminish the drop-size SLL .
Dropping Liquid .
+ StuLbborn cohesion .

IlMedium Liquid .

This scheme ig verified by the experimental results obtained .
Of all liquids water forms the largest drops in falling through air , because in it the stubborn cohesion prevails to the greatest degree over the joint action of persistent cohesion and weight .
In water mercury forms drops greater than in all other liquids , because in water ( as a medium ) stubborn cohesion and weight prevail to the greatest degree over persistent cohesion .
The case SLL may be inverted if the drop-forming liquid be specifically lighter than the medium liquid .
Thus every case of SLL which we have examined in which a liquid , A , drops downwards through a liquid , B , has a counter case in which the liquid B drops upwards* through the liquid A. In order to measure the size of such ascending drops , the stalagmometer ( fig. 7 ) is modified in form .
It is not found possible to cause the dropping liquid to adhere with sufficient completeness and uniformity to a solid sphere immersed in the denser medium , in the cases experimented on .
The end of the siphon A was turned upwards , and served as the solid whence the liquid dropped , without the interposition of a sphere or other solid .
The measuring-tube D was removed from the neck of the cup C , a stopper being inserted in its place .
The cup C was filled with water , and the measuring-tube D , being also filled with water , was inverted into it and supported by the holder H. The modified stalagmometer is seen in Plate V. fig. 10 .
Care was taken that the end of the siphon A should always be at the same depth beneath the surface of the water in C. The drop-sizes of the liquids of Table XVI .
were first examined by this stalagmometer .
The following Table XVII .
shows the number of drops of the various liquids , dropping through water , reqniired to fill the measuring-tube up to the given mark .
The measuring-tube employed was different from that used in forming Table XVI .
On this account , and because the delivering solid was quite different in shape , and gt ornly 2 " , no immediate comparison can be made between Tables XVII .
and XVI .
In Table XVII .

It is as follows : The drop-size of any mixture of two liquids , A and B , drop ping up* SeeP art L Introduction .
wards through a third liquid C , is intermediate between the drop-size of A through C and that of B through C ; and the greater the proportion of A there is in the mixture , the more nearly does the drop-size of the mixBA ture approach to the drop-size of B alone .
It is remarkable that supplementary drops are found in the cases just considered , just as in the case of water dropping through the same liquids .
But the supplementary drops of benzol and turpentol through water bear a much smaller ratio to the main drops than do those of water through benzol and turpentol to their maini drops .
Judging only from the equality in their rate of ascent through the measuring-tube , all these supplementary drops are very exactly of the same size .
The supplementary drops were not further examined , but were always collected and measured with the main drops .
Viewed as a means of quantitative chemical analysis , the measurement of the drop-sizes of liquids which drop up through water is yet more sensitive than that of the drop-sizes of water falling downwards through the liquids .
Thus , from Table XVII .
, the least proportional difference of drop-number , caused by an alteration in the proportion of the liquids , is between T and BT , where a diminution of 33-33 per cent. in the turpentol and an addition of 33-33 per cent. of benzol causes a difference of 35 3 in the drop-number .

Further , if the mixture contain less than one-third of benzol , we could determine the proportion , on an average , to within 0 33 per cent. It may be noticed with regard to SLL that the value of gt is of much less influence upon the drop-size than in the case SLG .
It is generally sufficient in the former case that the average value of gt should be constant .
This is especially the case where the drops are formed from a tube ( as the end of a siphon ) , and not from a convex solid .
The reason is obviously that in the former case the thickness of the residual film , upon which we have found the size to depend , is at all rates indefinitely great , while in the latter case it depends upon the rate of supply. .
In order to compare the drop-size of A through B with that of B through A under quite similar conditions , the siphon A of fig. 10 was inverted and applied to the cup stalagmometer of fig. 7 .
The arrangement of the end is seen in fig. 11 .
In using this form of stalagmometer , the end of the delivery-siphon must be at first wiped dry , so that the water may not creep back along its outside , and so give rise to an irregular drop-base .
Water was made to drop through A , fig. 11 , at the same rate , gt=2"1 , and through the same liquids as before , namely T , BT2 , BT , B , T , B. The same measulring-tube was used as in fig. 10 , or Table XVII .

Again , If the drop-size of X be greater than the dr op-sive of Y , and the dr opsize of Y be greater thanz the drop-size of Z in air , then the 2ratio betweex the drop-sizes of X in any mixture of Y and Z , and the drop-size of that mnixture of Y and Z through X , is greatest when the ratio between Y and Z is unity .
From Tables XVII .

wre may gather an interesting fact , which illustrates other braniches of physics .

Mixture impairs cohesion .
Generally , whenl two solids are mixed , the melting-point of the two is lower than the mean of the melting-points of its components ; sometimes lower than that of either .
When two liquids are mixed , the boiling-point of the mixture ( the iniitial boiling-point ) is lower than that of either .
The drop-size , which is also a function of the cohesion , we find here in no case to be less than the drop-size of either of the constituents , but in all cases to be less than the theoretical mean .

The main results with regard to drops may be collected into the following laws : SLG .
Law 1.-The drop-size depends upon tne rate of dropping .
Generally , the quicker the succession of the drops , the greater is the drop ; the slower the rate , the more strictly is this the case .
This law depends upon the difference , at different rates , of the thickness of the film from which the drop falls .
Law 2.-The drop-size depends upon the nature and quantity of the solid which the dropping liquid holds in solution .
If the liquid stands in no chemical relationi to the solid , in general the drop-size diminishes as the quantity of solid contained in the liquid increases .
The cause of this seems to be that the stubborn cohesion of the liquid is diminished by the solid in solution .
Where one or more combinations between the liquid and solid are possible , the drop-size depends upon indeterminate data .
Law 3.-The drop-size depeinds upon the chemical nature of the dropping liquid , and little or nothing upon its denisity .
Of all liquids examined , water has the greatest , and acetic acid the least drop-size .
Law 4.-The drop-size depends upon the geometric relation between the solid and the liquid .
If the solid be spherical , the largest drops fall from the largest spheres .
Absolute difference in radii takes a greater effect upon drops formed from smaller than upon those formed from larger spheres .
Of circular horizontal planes , withini certain limrits , the size of the drop varies directly with the size of the plane .
Law 5.-The drop-size depends upon the chemical nature of the solid from which the drop falls , and little or nothing upon its density .
Of all the solids examined , antimony delivers the smallest , and tin the largest drops .
Law 6.--The drop-size depends upon temperature ; generally , the higher the temperature the smaller the drop .
With water , the effect of a change of temperature of 20 ?
C. about 300 C. is very small .
Law 7.-The nature or tension of the gaseous medium has little or no effect upon drop-size .
SLL .
Law 8.-The drop-size of a liquid which drops under like conditions through various media , does not depend wholly upon the density of the medium and consequent variation in the weight , in the medium , of the dropping liquid .
Law 9.-If there be two liquids , A and B , which drop under like conditions through air , and the drop-size of the one , A , be greater than the drop-size of the other , B , then if a third liquid , C , be made to drop through A and through B , the drop-size of C through A is greater than the dropsize of C through B. Law 10.-If the drop-size of A through B be greater than the dropsize of A through C , then the drop-size of a fourth liquid , D , through B is also greater than the drop-size of D through C. Law 11.-If a liquid , A , drop under like conditions in succession through two liquids , B and C , then its drop-size through any mixture of B and C is intermediate between its drop-size through B and its drop-size through C. Corr. And the greater the proportion of B in the mixture the more C nearly does the drop-size of A through the mixture approach to the dropsize of A through B alone .
Law 12.-The drop-size of any mixture of two liquids , A and B , dropping through a third liquid , C , is intermediate between the drop-size of A through C and that of B through C ; and the greater the proportion of A in the mixture , the more nearly does the drop-size of the mixture approach to the drop-size of A alone , whether the dropping liquid be heavier or lighter than the liquid medium .
Law 13.-If the liquid X has a larger drop-size than the liquid Y in the liquid Z , then the liquid Z has a larger drop-size in X than it has in Y. Law 14.-If a liquid , X , has a larger drop-size than a liquid , Y , in air , then the drop-size of X through Y is larger than the drop-size of Y through X. Law 15.-If the drop-size of X be greater than the drop-size of Y in air , and the drop-size of Y be greater than the drop-size of Z in air , then the ratio between the drop-sizes of X in any mixture of Y and Z , and the drop-size of that mixture of Y and Z through X , is greatest when the ratio between Y and Z is unity .
