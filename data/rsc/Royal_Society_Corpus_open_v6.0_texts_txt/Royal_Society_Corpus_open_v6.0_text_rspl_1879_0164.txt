The Electric Condition of the Terminals of a Vacuum-Tube after their connexion with the Source of Electricity has been brolcen .
The question has been mooted whether there is a polarisation of the terminals of a vacuum-tube after the discharge through it has been interrupted by breaking connexion between it and the source of electricity .
This question we understand in the sense\#151 ; does there exist a chemical polarisation as is the case for instance with the terminals of a voltameter under similar circumstances ?
It is evident that if a polarisation of this kind could he proved , the formula used for determining the tube potential ( " Phil. Trans. , " Part I , vol. clxxi , p. 65 ) would no longer hold good .
Fig. 1 .
The problem is by no means easy of solution , and it has engaged our attention for the last five months .
We believe , however , that the few VOL. XXX .

[ June 17 , experiments we are about to describe , and which we select from a long series , will show that there is really no such polarisation of the terminals .
We will first take the case of the voltameter ; the arrangement of the apparatus employed in our experiments is shown in fig. 1 , where K K ' represent a special key for breaking connexion between any piece of apparatus and the battery , B , and connecting it afterwards instantaneously with a galvanometer , G. The terminals of the battery are attached respectively to the screw-clamps , c and d , carried by an ebonite bar , supported on two ebonite columns , touch-points in metallic contact with c and d , pass through this bar , so that when the brass springs , ae and If , are allowed to rise and press against these touch-points , the battery is in metallic connexion with the screw-clamps , a and b , and any piece of apparatus attached to them , as , for example , the voltameter , V. The voltameter employed has a resistance of 20 ohms ; its platinum electrodes are 2*5 inches long and 0'025 inch in diameter , and are separated 0*25 inch ; it is charged with dilute pure sulphuric acid in the proportion of 1 volume of acid , sp. gr. 1'84 , to 8 volumes of water .
When the springs are suddenly pressed down by the fingers placed on the ebonite disks , e and/ , the connexion is broken between the voltameter and the battery , and it is connected instantaneously with the galvanometer , G. The galvanometer actually employed was not that shown in the figure , but a Thomson galvanometer , whose constant , C , = 1 V\#151 ; \#151 ; =1,874 scale divisions .
On connecting a 1 megohm battery of 10 chloride of silver cells with the voltameter for a minute or less , and then suddenly pressing down the springs e and / , there was a deflection to the left , say , of more than 1,000 scale divisions , although the ^ shunt was used to reduce the current through the galvanometer ; therefore , the deflection without the shunt would have been more than 1,000,000 divisions .
By comparing this deflection with that produced by a half microfarad condenser , charged with 240 cells , it was ascertained that the deviation produced by the voltameter was equivalent to that of 111 microfarads .
The small condenser shown at C , fig. 1 , was substituted for the voltameter ; it is made of a thin plate of glass 2 inches square and 0 0115 inch thick ; the tinfoil coatings being 1*5 inch square , - its capacity was found to be 0*00055 m.f. When charged with 3,600 cells , and afterwards connected with the Thomson galvanometer through the a shunt , by pressing down e and / , the deflection was 186-5 divisions to the left ; this multiplied by 9'92 , the value of the shunt was equivalent to 1,354 divisions .
, The apparatus , shown in fig. 2 , which was constructed for another object already described , * was connected with a and 6 ; it consists * t* Phil. Trans. , " vol. clxxi , p. 76 .

essentially of two disks , 31 inches diameter , placed 013 inch apart .
The capacity of this apparatus , when used as an air-condenser , was determined , and found to be 0000058 m.f. With 3,600 cells no discharge took place , and it merely charged up as a condenser .
The deflection produced , when the keys e and / were pressed down , was ( without shunt ) 150 divisions , still to the left .
It is evident , therefore , that the direction of the deviation throws no light on the question , for it is the same with the voltameter as with the condenser .
Fig. 2 .
Tube 73 , containing a residuum of acetylene , was now substituted for the air-condenser ; it is 26'5 inches long and 1'5 inch diameter , the distance between the terminals 23 inches ; this tube was connected with 3,600 cells , current 0*00681 W. The tube potential was found to be 2,980 cells , and its resistance 449,500 ohms .
On pressing down the springs e and f , so as to break connexion with the battery and connect the tube with the galvanometer , there was a deflection of 11 divisions to the left , the same as before .
The current was only 1874x1,000,000 170,000,000 2 r 2 Drs. De La Rue and H. W. Muller .

On another occasion with the same tube , No. 73 , with a discharge from 2,400 cells , the deviation to the left on passing down e and / was 20 divisions .
Tube 199 , with a hydrogen charge , was now substituted , fig. 4 ; pressure 2 millims. , 2,632 M , 5,100 cells , current 0*01639 W. This tube has already been described ; * it is 37 inches ( 94 centims. ) long , and 5i| inches ( 14*8 centims. ) in diameter .
The distance between the terminals , a ring and a straight wire , is 33*5 inches ( 85 centims. ) .
In the first place the battery was connected direct to the galvanometer , , the positive to e and the negative to f ( that is , in the same direction as if the positive were attached to c and the negative to -A .

[ June 17 , shunt was also used with the galvanometer , the direction of deviation was found to be to left , which it was desired to know .
On pressing down e and/ , the deviation was to the left and only amounted to 2 divisions .
On another occasion , at the same pressure , 3,900 cells , current 0-02925 W. , the deviation to the left on pressing down e and / was from 3 to 5 divisions .
The same tube , with a charge of coal-gas , pressure 3 millims. , 3,947 M , current 0'01705 W. , deflection , on pressing down e and / , 7 divisions to left .
The same tube , with air , pressure T5 millims. , 1,974 M , current 0-02728 W. , on pressing down e and / , deviation 20 divisions .
The deviation was , therefore , greatest with air ; but if due to a chemical polarisation , it would have been d priori expected to be greatest with coal-gas , which is a mixture of decomposable molecules .

Experiments were now made in air with the apparatus ( already described * ) shown in fig. 5 , in order to obtain a vacuum vessel with larger terminals .

[ June 17 , So that in every case when the discharge did not take place , the deflection , on connecting the terminals with the galvanometer , was the greatest .
If the fact which we have already pointed out be taken into account , that with a constant battery-potential , the difference of potential between the terminals of a vacuum-tube varies , in the same gas according to the degree of exhaustion , it follows that as soon as a discharge takes place , the potential of the terminals will be lowered .
We should therefore expect to find what the before-cited experiments indicated , namely , that the static charge of the terminals would be greater when no discharge takes place than after it has occurred , notwithstanding that a larger number of cells may have been employed in the latter case than in the former , for we have shown ( Phil. Trans. , vol. clxxi , p. 67 ) , that a tube-potential may be only 430 cells , although the battery connected with its terminals is 11,000 cells .
We believe , therefore , that the experiments point conclusively to the deduction that the current obtained from the terminals of a vacuum tube , after having been disconnected from the battery , is solely due to a static charge and not to a chemical polarisation .

In order to render evident the direction of the current of polarisation of the voltameter the apparatus was arranged as in fig. 7 , that is , the Thomson galvanometer , with shunt , was inserted in the circuit between the battery and the voltameter .
An adjustable shunt was fixed between a and b to permit the greater part of the current to pass through it .
A plate of metal , ss , was provided to slip under e and f to short circuit the return current through the galvanometer .
The shunt which was found just sufficient to carry the major part of the current , and yet permit sufficient to traverse the voltameter to produce a just visible evolution of gas , was 13 ohms .
On connecting the battery , the current was in the direction of the lower arrow , and the deviation 133 divisions say to the left ; on pressing down the keys on to the metal slip placed under them to short circuit the current , after the battery had been disconnected , the return current was in the reverse direction , as shown by the upper dotted arrow , the deviation being 425 divisions to the right .
Even without pressing down the keys on to the metal slip nearly the same deviation was obtained on disconnecting battery for the return current then traversed the shunt from a to b. * The value of the ylu shunt .

THOMSON SHUNT 5* : On substituting either the bell-jar , with disk terminals , or the tube 199 for the voltameter , the deflection of the return static charge was in the same direction as the return current from the voltameter , so that , as we before stated , no inference can be drawn from the direction of the current as to its being produced by polarisation or a static charge .
We think , however , that we have shown conclusively that the effect in the case of a vacuum-tube is due to a static charge , and not to a polarisation of the terminals .
We rest our opinion mainly on the fact that a greater deflection is produced , when the potential has not been lessened by a discharge through the tube , than that which occurs after the discharge has taken place , which , it had been surmised , might possibly produce a chemical polarisation .
