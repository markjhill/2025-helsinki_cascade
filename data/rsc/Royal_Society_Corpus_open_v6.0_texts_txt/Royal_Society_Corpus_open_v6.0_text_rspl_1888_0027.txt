" " Le Roux has shown that when a notch is filed into a wire and one side heated there is in general a thermo-electric current .
He found that when two wires of the same metal , with flat ends , 1888 .

Two pieces of platinum wire of mm. section , and of mm. length , were weights only just heavy cnough to keep them straight .
They were placed at right angles to each other , the centres being in contact , ( the ends bending down into mercury cups ( see fig. 1 ) .

After being dried it was tested with a small flame al distances of 1 cm .

The result was a current the free wire towards that part on which hydrogen had been produced , greatest at the junction of the free wire and the saturated wire .

When wires of palladium were used more powerfnl effects of the same kind were produced .
Thus when two wires were used as electrodes in decomposing acidulated water , dried and gently heated in contact , a current towards the hydrogen.was observed .
If heated by a Bunsen flame complications arose from the hydrogen in the wire taking fire .
The flame produced could easily be seen 4 or5 mm. away from the Bunsen flame .
Carbon rods were next tried .
Gas-carbon was first tried , but I was unable to get two rods sufficiently similar in composition to be of use , their own thermo-electric currents being large enough to cover all changes produced by gases .
I had , however , no difficulty in getting rods made for arc lamps to answer my purpose .
They were heated a red heat to expel gases , and the ends were filed flat .
It was found that when one of these rods was heated and placed against the other ( see fig. 3 ) , the current was always from cold to hot below C. They were then used as the electrodes in decomposing diluta sulphuric acid , dried carefully until no current was produced on 1888 .

When mcasured Carbon.\mdash ; Two thin rods about 2 mm. diameter were electroplatod at the ends and soldered to insulated copper wires .
After protecting bhe plated portion with marine glue , the whole was fixed to convenient frame , and placed in dilute sulphuric acid .
As was done in the case of the platinum wires , the rods were balanced against other in order to eliminate changes of temperature , \amp ; c. Whell used as the poles of a battery the change of resistance was , but greater on the rod that had been the positive pole By using a platinum electrode , hydrogen or oxygen was produce6 at will upon the same rod , the other rod remaining unchanged .
then appeared that oxygen increased the resistance much more hydrogen , rising in some cases as high as nine times ; that wheq oxygen was libel'ated twice or thrice in succession , the resistanoe increased each time .
This continued increase was probably due chemical changes produced by the active oxygen .
Hydrogen gave ar increase of resistance , not continuing beyond a certain point , and becoming greater on repeated charging with the gas .
Generally also the effect of the hydrogen was temporary , disappear , wholly in some cases , partially in others , when short circuited .
The following series of observations afford an example of this : .

Lastly , to avoid any possible effect from the coal-gas , the end to be heated was enclosed in an iron tube lined with asbestos .
The temperatures were measured in various ways .
In some experiments an ordinary thermometer was used for temperatures below 25 C. ; thermo-electric couples of atinum and copper , silver and copper , were tried , but , although much more tedious , I found the method of platinum wire much less hable to error .
The wire was given to me by Mr. H. F. Callendar , M.A. , and was frolll the same piece as that used by him in his experiments on " " The Practical Measurement of Temperature\ldquo ; ( see 'Phil .
Trans vol. 178 ( 1887 ) , p. 161 ) .
The following equations for this wire were used in determining the temperature , and are those obtained by Mr. Callendar in his experiments :\mdash ; resistance of the platinum wire at C. , , , , , C. vire was a anged as iu fig. 5 , by which means the resistance of OF alone could be btalned by observing those of , and AB ; also AB and CD were known if required , which indeed was the case of one of the later experiments .
In some the insulation was thin tubes of hard glass , in others the wire was wrapped up in thin sheet asbestos .
The arrangcment is shown in figs. 6 and , where A and are the carbon rods , an iron tube lined with sheet asbestos , packing of asbestos , a thermometer for moderate temperature and to test the calculations VOL. XLIV .

231 covered with clay .
The carbon rod was insulated from the platinum wires , and they from each other by thin sheet asbestos and mica , by which means it was insulated from the vessel in which it was placed , and lnted with clay to prevent access of air ( fig. 10 ) .
The numbers obtained in three series are\mdash ; Expt. 1 .
Expt. 2 .
Expt. S. E. The colder junction was at C. The resistance of the Pt-C couple was found to to , after which it decl.eased .
This result being caused by the increased resistance of the platinum being partly neutl'alised by tlJe ltion of the resistance of the carbon , to which must be added the improved contact obtained by the expansion of the platinum in the carbon , which is ater than the expa1lsion of the carbon , thence the pressure increases and the contact improves .
The numbers were at C. ohm , 34 to C. ohm , These experiments agree perfectly with the diagram given by Knott and Macgregor ( fig. 8 ) as far as hey carried it experimentally .
When , however , they commence deducing results for higher temperatures , our experiments are not in coord ; there being no indication of the carbon line crossing the platinum line , but only a very slight indication in one of the series of an approach above Assulning the atinum line our wire to be the same as that given in Tait 's diagram eeming Jenkin , we get a diagram for fig. , in which the line is fairly parallel to C. , after which it gradually increases its distance .
Other Changes in the Properties of the at the same This change in the thermo-electric power of carbon is accompa1Jied by other changes .
The resistance , the expansion , and the specific heat all appear to undergo a corresponding alteration .
Resistance.\mdash ; Accurate measurements of the resistance of carbon at high tenxperatures are very diffioult to obtain , owing to the changes that take place in the connexions .

This method cannot lay claim to absolute accuracy , as there is in some cases an increase of resistance by the change in the contact of copper with carbon , which appears when the rod cools as in iment 2 This , however , takes place at the higher temperatures , and tends to decrease the numbers obtained at those temperatures , and a correction , if one could be applied , wouId only increase the results obtained in the previous experiments .
