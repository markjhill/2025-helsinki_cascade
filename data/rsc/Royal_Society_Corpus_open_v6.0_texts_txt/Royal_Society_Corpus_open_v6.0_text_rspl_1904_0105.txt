] It has long been known that an alloy of silver and copper is not i satisfactory material for the trial plates which are used in testing thi fineness of the Imperial silver coin and of silver wares before they art hall-marked .
As long ago as the year 1580 the lack of homogeneity ) of silver-copper alloys was well known to the German metallurgists,1 and in 1852 Levol concluded f that the only uniform alloy of the series contained 718*93 parts of silver and 281*07 parts of copper a composition which corresponds to the formula AggCu2 .
In 1875 Roberts-Austen , as the result of very carefully conducted experi ments , J found that under the most favourable circumstances the difference in composition between the centre and corners of a small ingot amounted to 1*2 parts per 1000 , and was generally muck greater .
In 1899 when further attempts were made to prepare ingote \#166 ; of silver and copper of uniform composition , S similar results wen obtained , although many castings were made in accordance with tin method recommended by E. Matthey.|| A consideration of the cooling curve of the standard silver-coppei alloy , containing silver 92*5 , copper 7*5 by weight , which was obtained by Roberts-Austen , H and is reproduced in C fig. 1 , shows that such segregation must necessarily take place .
The initial freezing point d\ of this alloy , in which the percentage by atoms is silver 87*9 , copper 12*1 , is at about 900 ' .
At this temperature a solid solution rich in silver begins to crystallise out , but solidification is not complete untii the temperature has fallen to 778 ' ( 2 fig- 1 ) , when the mother liquor contains only 60 atoms of silver to 40 of copper , that is to say , the proportion found by Heycock and Neville to be present in the eutectfej alloy.** During the pasty stage ample time is allowed for tfl| segregation of the silver-rich constituent , with the result that the distribution of silver in the solidified metal is not uniform .
Tipi amount of segregation varies with the dimensions of the ingot , * See pp. 20 and 26 of ' Allerfurnemisten Mineralischen Eerzt und BergwerWw arten , ' by L. Ercker .

: The solidification of an alloy containing 91'66 per cent , of gold and **'33 per cent , of silver shows similar characteristics , * and remains uniform in composition under all conditions .
Having regard to these considerations and to the experience that has been gained of the difficulties attending the preparation of a homogeneous standard silver trial-plate , it seemed more likely that such a plate would be success-fully prepared by using a different alloy than by making fresh experi-'dents with silver and copper .
The first alloy to be tried consisted of silver 925 parts , gold 75 parts , but although the plates prepared were , doubtless , uniform in- composition , the difficulties connected with s the assay of the plates were insuperable .
It is obvious that the \gt ; fineness of the plate could not be compared with that of silver coin by the cupellation process , for the reason that the gold would not be j.1* separated from the silver in that case .
Nor were the wet processes * 'Roy .

On certain [ Feb. 9 of assay , which involve dissolution in nitric acid , found to be much more convenient .
When the alloy was digested with nitric acid in the ordinary way , at a moderate temperature , large and variable quantities of silver were retained by the gold .
When the alloy was boiled in moderately strong nitric acid for 30 minutes , the gold still retained about 0*2 per 1000 of the silver , and a further variable amount was carried off by the vapour rising from the boiling liquid and lost .
It was , therefore , necessary to discover some other alloy which !
would be at once uniform in composition and easy to use as a standard of comparison .
An examination of the cooling curves of a number of alloys con ) taining 92-5 per cent , of silver afforded evidence that the silver-cadmium alloy would prove to be the most suitable one for trial-plates .
Unlike the alloys containing gold , tin , or antimony , the cadmium alloy presents no difficulty in connection with the assay by the ordinary methods , and the cooling curve , B fig. 1 , bears a close resemblance to that of a pure metal , the fall in temperature during solidification not being great .
The completion of solidification , how-i ever , is marked by a slight momentary change of direction of the curve , pointing to the freezing of a small quantity of material of the nature of an eutectic alloy , and it seemed possible that this might correspond to a change in the distribution of the silver throughout the mass , resulting in a lack of homogeneity .
In order to test this , ingots of silver and cadmium of standard fineness were prepared and rolled out .
Some difficulties were at first encountered in the melting of the alloy .
If pieces of solid cadmium , even when warmed , are added to molten silver , the action is very violent , and varying losses of cadmium by oxidation and volatilisation take place , so that the resulting alloy is seldom of the exact composition required .
The method eventually adopted consists in pouring molten silver , heated only slightly above its melting point , into a large crucible containing melted cadmium at a black heat and covered with charcoal .
The crucible is then placed in the fire , raised to a j bright red heat as quickly as possible , and the alloy well stirred and poured into a closed mould .
Under these conditions , when operating with 4 or 5 kilos , of material , the mixing of the metals takes place with comparative quietness , and the loss of cadmium is reduced to about 0T5 per cent , by weight of the alloy .
In order to prepare a standard trial-plate , which consists of 925 parts of silver and 75 parts of base metal , it is accordingly necessary to melt 76*5 parts of i cadmium and to add 925 parts of silver to it .
A large part of the loss appears to take place on the addition of the silver to the cadmium , dense fumes of oxide of cadmium being given off , but on merely j melting and re-casting a standard ingot of 5 kilos .
, the proportion of silver present rises from 92'50 per cent , to about 92-58 per cent. U904.J Properties of the Alloys of Silver and Cadmium .

The badmium does not interfere with the ordinary methods of assay , no difference in results due to interference being observable when the Irial-plates were compared with pure silver by the Gay-Lussac and Volhard processes of assay .
In practice when the fineness of a silver-copper alloy is being compared with that of the trial-plate , by means of the Volhard process , the nitric acid solution of the copper alloy would be coloured blue , while that of the cadmium alloy would remain bolourless .
This would interfere with the correctness of the comparative final readings , but in order to avoid this difficulty , it is sufficient to add a piece of copper of the appropriate weight to the solution of the cadmium alloy .
When the silver-cadmium alloy is cupelled , the cadmium burns off and the loss of silver is about four parts in 10,000 more than if the alloying metal were copper .
In comparisons by the cupellation process , it is , therefore , essential that the assay pieces should be made of similar composition by suitable additions of base metals .
This course presents no difficulty and in no way detracts from the value of the trial .
The results of these experiments show that trustworthy and convenient trial-plates can be made of silver and cadmium , but it remained to be determined by further study of the properties of the series of alloys whether the uniformity in composition of the trial-plates was fortuitous , or whether it was the inevitable result of its constitution .
The silver-cadmium series has been investigated by Gautier , !
who stated that the freezing-point curve consisted of two parts meeting at a point corresponding to the alloy containing about 42 per cent , of silver and that the alloys appeared to consist of isomorphous mixtures of a compound of silver and cadmium with one or other of the pure metals .
In order to confirm these observations of Gautier a number of alloys , consisting of silver and cadmium , were prepared and analysed .
' The silver used for this purpose was purified with the precautions adopted in the preparation of fine " proof " silver in the Mint and was 11000 fine .
The cadmium was purchased as pure and was examined for impurities , but none were detected .

] Properties of the Alloys oj Silver Cadmium .
Allowed to cool at a moderate rate , the greater part of the mass solidifies at a definite temperature , leaving a very small part only to solidify at a lower temperature .
The final freezing point is marked iby a minute but distinct check in the rate of cooling .
It becomes less marked as the percentage of silver falls below 95 per cent. , and [ disappears altogether before the 80-per-cent , alloy is reached .
The 80-per-cent , alloy itself solidifies nearly as a whole , and its cooling 'curve resembles that of a compound , or a pure metal .

doubt that ingots 800 fine in silver would be uniform in composition .
As the percentage of .
silver falls from 80\#151 ; 65 per cent. , the initial freezing or liquidus point becomes of less importance , and the pasty stage more pronounced and of longer duration .
The alloys containing about 66 per cent , of silver and approximating in composition to that required by the formula Ag2Cd are somewhat less ductile than those members of the series which are richer in silver .
I They are more readily attacked by nitric acid than the alloys con* i taining either more or less silver .
This points to a lack of homogeneity , I a conclusion that is supported by the shape of the cooling curve 224 Dr. T. Kirk Rose .
On certain [ Feb. \amp ; 1 of the 64-64-per-cent , alloy .
There is here a long pasty stag , ?
between the initial freezing point at 795 ' , and a second point ail about 718 ' .
During this range of temperature the slowness of the rate of cooling shows that solidification proceeds continuously and that the part of the mass remaining liquid undergoes a continuous change in composition .
At the point when solidification is completed there is a more pronounced evolution of heat at about the same tem perature as that at which solidification begins in the alloys containing from 52\#151 ; 58 per cent , of silver. .
The liquidus curve appears to show !
a small cusp corresponding to the compound Ag2Cd , but it is probable:5 that the compound Ag2Cd , which was detected by Heycock and Neville in solution in other metals* is partly or entirely dissociated when ] melted by itself .
The alloy containing 58*62 per cent , of silver has two freezing points at 720 ' and 695 ' , separated by a pasty stage .
The alloys containing from 52\#151 ; 55 per cent , of silver have freezing points at 720 ' and 420 .
The eutectic solidifying at 695 ' was not observed in the cooling curves of these alloys , although there is little doubt that it must exist , particularly in view of the micro-structure .
The 50-per-cent .
1 alloy solidifies at 694 ' , and shows the eutectic point at 420 ' .
In the series containing from 50\#151 ; 60 per cent , of silver , the pasty stage succeeding the initial freezing point gradually diminishes as the percentage of silver is reduced , until in the 50-per-cent , alloy the fall of temperature during solidification is only about 20 ' , whereas in the 75-per-cent , it is nearly 100 ' .
Nevertheless the freezing point of the 50-per-cent , alloy is not so sharp as that of an undissociated compound , and after the temperature has fallen at a normal rate to about 420 ' another considerable evolution of heat takes place , during which the temperature remains stationary .
The point is also observable in the cooling of the 52- , 55- , and 58-per-cent , alloys , becoming successively smaller and dying away at about the 60-per-cent , alloy .
Prolonged heating at various temperatures between 420 ' and 695 had not any apparent effect on the specimens , which retained their shape when not subjected to stress .
When , however , a cast bar with .
composition corresponding to the formula AgCd was subjected to a bending stress equal to 10 grammes per square millimetre of cross section ( about 14 lbs. per square inch ) , it was found to become suddenly plastic and to bend almost double without cracking at a temperature Of 450 ' .
When chilled at temperatures somewhat above 420 ' the specimens assumed a red or lilac tint , especially after light polishing , which i is not so .
markedly observable in the specimens chilled from below j 420 ' .
The colour is observable in all the alloys containing from 40\#151 ; 50 per cent , of silver , and is always confined to the surface layer .

1 similar case of the silver-zinc alloy AgZn has been investigated by ] Heycock and Neville , * who also refer to the colour of the alloy AgCd .
I The cooling curves of some alloys containing about equal numbers j 0f atoms of silver and zinc were also prepared for comparison , and were found to be very similar to the cooling curve of AgCd .
The freezing j point of the alloy containing 51 atoms of zinc to 49 atoms of silver | is at 693 ' , and the evolution of heat by the alloy in the solid state is at 281 ' .
The corresponding temperatures in the case of the alloy containing equal numbers of atoms of silver and zinc were found to be 690 ' and 271 ' .
These results can be correlated with the facts observed by Heycock and Neville , who showed that the silver-zinc alloy could be made to assume a red tint if heated to a temperature near 300 ' , the lowest effective temperature being 285 ' , and suddenly chilled .
The disappearance of the red tint thus appears to coincide with an evolution of heat in both cases .
The red tint can also be obtained in either case by abrasion .
It is well shown in filings and sometimes in polished specimens .
The liquidus curve of the silver-cadmium alloys shows a well-marked cusp at about the 40-per-cent , alloy , pointing to the existence of the compound Ag2Cd3 .
This alloy is hard and excessively brittle , breaking with a conchoidal fracture , a proof of homogeneity of structure .
The remainder of the freezing point curve is of an ordinary type , consisting of two branches meeting at a minimum at about the alloy containing l-2 per cent , of silver , which solidifies at 315 ' or 8 ' below the freezing point of pure cadmium , t Further additions of silver raise the freezing point until a maximum of 676 ' is reached at the 40-per-cent , alloy .
A branch of the curve of equilibrium was observed containing about 10 per cent , of silver solidifying at 332 ' .
The liquidus curve is thus seen to consist of 7 parts , which are as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Between pure silver and the compound Ag4Cd , convex upwards .

Micro-structure of the Alloys .
The alloys containing upwards of 80 per cent of silver all present similar characteristics .
Their structure is well developed on polished surfaces by dipping them for a few seconds in hot nitric acid of a specific gravity 1 25 .
Slowly cooled specimens , in which the solidification occupies about 5 minutes and the subsequent cooling to a low red heat about half an hour , are seen to consist of crystallites of a silver-rich body set in a darker coloured matrix which has been more deeply etched by the acid than the crystallites ( see fig. 3 , Plate 10 ) .
The limiting case of pure silver shows no matrix and the crystallites are large , the crystal grains in small specimens being from 5\#151 ; 8 mm. in diameter .
Similarly no matrix was observed in the alloy containing 97'3 per cent , of silver but it was detected in the 95-per-cent , alloy , and showed some increase as the silver diminished to 80 per cent. At the same time the size of the crystallites diminished to a diameter of about 1 mm. When these alloys were re-heated for from 1\#151 ; 4 hours at temperatures intermediate between the initial freezing point and the " eutectic " point referred to above , the crystal grains broke up and a fine network of the dark-coloured matrix was formed .
When reheated at any temperature above a red heat but below the final solidification point , the matrix disappeared and crystals were formed occupying the whole area of the field .
The higher the temperature ( below this point ) and the longer the time during which it was maintained , the larger the crystals grew and the straighter and more regular became their bounding faces .
All the specimens were chilled after re-heating .
It appears , therefore , that at all temperatures below the solidus curve , these alloys are homogeneous , consisting of a single solid solution , doubtless consisting of varying proportions of silver , and the compound Ag4Cd* the existence of which has been referred to by Heycock and Neville.* These two substances , silver and Ag4Cd , must be regarded as isomorphous .
It follows that the more slowly these alloys are cooled , * " The Freezing-point of Triple Alloys , " 'Chem .
Soc. Trans. , ' vol. 65 ( 1894 ) , p. 65 .
1904.1 Properties of the Alloys of Silver Cadmium .
227 .the more uniform the composition should be .
It should be possible 110 prepare perfectly uniform alloys of any composition containing more Uhan 80 per cent , of silver by re-heating them to about 850 ' for a number of hours .
A practical difficulty in carrying this out would be that the cadmium would be partly volatilised , so that it would be necessary to remove the outer layers of the ingots after heating ; them .
On the other hand , Osmond has pointed out that it is by no means uncommon for crystallites to be developed by the attack of suitable re-agents in media which are chemically homogeneous .
He cites the bronzes and the gold-copper alloys as instances .
According to this view the specimens showing crystallites are already uniform in composition and do not require to be annealed in order to become so .
It is to be observed , however , that the gold-copper alloys have been shown to be non-homogeneous.* Osmond does not state to what bronzes he refers , but the copper-tin alloys are now well known to be heterogeneous also .
It may be repeated that in practice the 92'5-percent .
alloy is found , on casting , to be uniform in composition , so that it is unnecessary to anneal it .
In the alloys containing from 80\#151 ; 70 per cent , of silver , the crystallites in slowly cooled specimens are larger and more regularly cross- or fern-shaped than in those with more silver ( see fig. 4 , Plate 10 ) .
The matrix is readily dissolved out by nitric acid , leaving the crystallites in relief surrounded by a deep-sunk network .
The area occupied by the crystallites is reduced , and that occupied by the matrix increased as the percentage of silver falls .
The equilibrium of the systems at lower temperatures has not been examined in this part of the series .
The alloy corresponding to the formula Ag2Cd is much finer grained than either the 64- or the 70-per-cent , alloy .
Etching with nitric acid leaves an excessively fine network in relief with darker pittings between , but no regular structure is observable .
Other reagents are equally ineffective in developing the structure .
Re-heating at 750 ' for 1\#163 ; hours , and subsequent chilling , merely increases the size of the network without in any other way changing its appearance .
One curious effect of heating to 750 ' these specimens embedded in sand is that the cadmium on the surface is volatilised , leaving a layer of pure silver .
On removing this during the operation of polishing , a black layer is encountered coloured by oxide of cadmium , and underneath this the original alloy is found to exist .
The layers are not everywhere of the same thickness , so that in the course of polishing alternate rings of white and black are produced , resembling the well-known Japanese decorative metal-work known as Mokum4 , which is used in jewellery .
The cooling curves indicate that the compound AgsCd2 separates * Roberts-Austen and Rose , 'Roy .

9 from the alloys containing between 50 and 60 per cent , of silver , an\lt ; this is borne out by the micro-structure .
The alloys when rubber with potassium cyanide solution are seen to consist of white oblong crystals set in a red-coloured matrix ( see fig. 5 ) .
As the percentage o silver diminishes the area covered by the crystals is reduced , and thi amount of matrix increases !
The white crystals evidently consist ol the compound Ag3Cd2 , and the red matrix of AgCd .
The alloys containing between 50 and 40 per cent , of silver are remarkable for resisting the attack of the ordinary etching reagents , Nitric acid has little effect on them , but they are slowly dissolved by hot acid of a specific gravity of T3 without their structure being revealed .
A similar lack of success attended the use of sulphuric and !
hydrochloric acids , of soluble sulphides , of alkaline sulphides with the !
aid of a galvanic battery , and of heat with free exposure to the air .
The alloys are not affected by ammonium sulphide under conditions in which silver-copper alloys or pure silver are instantly tarnished .
The structure was developed by a^polish attack , which consisted in rubbing the polished specimens on parchment with fine alumina moistened with a solution of 0*5 per cent , of cyanide of potassium .
The action is partly abrasive , the red colour being strongly developed in some of the Crystals .
In the 50-per-cent , alloy , slowly cooled specimens are seen to consist of large crystals of 2\#151 ; 3 mm. in diameter .
There is no cementing material , and the crystals are distinguishable from one another under low powers only by their shades of colour .
Under high powers ( above 1000 diameters ) the most strongly coloured crystals are seen to be covered with a number of minute irregular pits and short trenches , which are bright red , the space between being colourless .
The difference between the crystals seems to be only that of the orientation of the particles forming them , so that the surface of some crystals is more readily abraded than that of others .
The structure , however , is not readily revealed without the aid of the cyanide solution .
The abrasions form an irregular network , which gives some of the crystals a minutely cellular appearance , visible at a , magnification of 50 diameters .
In quickly cooled cast specimens the crystals are much smaller , few being more than ' 0'3 mm. in diameter , and traces of a hard white cement are discernible between the crystals .
The same alloys when re-heated to 350 ' for 6 hours and chilled show an even more minute structure , the crystals being only about 0*02 mm. in diameter ( see fig. 6 ) .
A few hard white projecting grains , probably existing in the alloy after casting and before reheating , are visible under a magnification of 1800 diameters on a slightly pink ground consisting of a solid solution of AgCd and Ag2Cd3 .
When the 50-per-cent , alloy is heated for 6 hours above 420 ' and chilled , the separation of the two constituents is far more complete .
The alloy is now made up of large bright red hexagonal crystals about Kirk Rose .

The alloys can be etched with nitric acid , and the unattacked crystallites , at first forming almost the whole of the mass , become somewhat rare in the 30-per-cent , alloy , and disappear altogether before the 25-percent .
alloy is reached .
Specimens containing less than 25 per cent , of silver are much more rapidly attacked by nitric acid than those richer in silver , and when corrosion takes place it is a magma of cadmium with very little silver that is attacked and darkened , leaving the harder white crystallites of AgCd3 practically untouched ( see fig. 8 ) .
The structure is developed when sections are merely polished , the crystallites of AgCd3 standing out in relief .
They diminish in number as the percentage of silver is reduced .
The results of the investigation may be summarised as follows :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Evidence is afforded of the existence of the compounds AgCd3 , Ag2Cd3 , AgCd , Ag3Cd2 , Ag2Cd , and Ag4Cd .
( 2 ) The alloys containing from 0\#151 ; 25 per cent , of silver consist , when solid , of crystals of AgCd3 set in a matrix of cadmium .
Those containing between 25 and 40 per cent , of silver consist of the compound Ag2Cd3 set in a matrix consisting mainly of AgCd3 .
The alloy containing about 50 per cent , of silver consists of crystals of a silver-rich body set in a matrix consisting chiefly of AgCd3 .
The m itrix or eutectic solidifies at 420 ' , or nearly 300 ' below the freezing point of the crystals .
The alloys containing from 50\#151 ; 60 per cent , of silver consist , at temperatures above 420 ' , of mixtures of two different solid solutions , one of which is chiefly composed of the compound AgCd , and the other of Ag3Cd2 .
Traces of the eutectic freezing at 420 ' are still visible .
When more than 80 per cent , of silver is present , the alloys .consist of a mixture of two 'bodies at temperatures between the liquidus and 230 Dr. 0 .

Introduction .
If two thermometers , one of which has its bulb protected by a close covering of ordinary cotton wool , be simultaneously immersed in the same water , all being originally at the same temperature , the protected thermometer shows a marked rise , while the naked one undergoes no perceptible change .
Heat is , therefore , generated locally by the wetting of the cotton covering .
The maximum temperature is reached in 2 or 3 minutes , after which there is a fall , the rate of which steadily diminishes in a characteristic manner , so that , when all necessary precautions are taken , a difference of temperature between the cotton and the surrounding water is still distinctly perceptible after several hours .
Both the extent of the rise and the rate of the whole change depend on several conditions .
With a given thermometer the most important factors are the quantity of cotton wool , its initial condition with respect to hygroscopic moisture , and the temperature of the water .
Other things being equal , the effect is more marked with a large covering than with a small one and at a higher than at a lower bath temperature , but the previous condition of the cotton is a more important factor than either .
If taken in its ordinary state after exposure to the air of the laboratory , when it usually contains about 8 or 9 per cent , of moisture , it may show a rise of 2 ' or 3 ' C. , but if precautions be taken to insure that it is dry at the moment of immersion in water ( at its own temperature ) , the same sample will show a rise of from 8\#151 ; 12 ' or more .
The relatively large amount of air which is always entangled within the cotton wool does not escape during or after immersion , and the bundle presents a glistening appearance under water which suggests that it is not completely wetted .
That this fact is important in connection with the observed temperature change is shown by the behaviour of the so-called " medicated " or " absorbent " cotton wool , which differs from the ordinary ( nearly pure ) material in having been freed by solvents from traces of natural cotton wax .
