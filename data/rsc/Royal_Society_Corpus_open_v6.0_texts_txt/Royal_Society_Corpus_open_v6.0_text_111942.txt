It was observed in a former research * that the gold-tin alloys had a great tendency to crystallize , and it was deduced from results then obtained that some of them were chemical combinations .
With a view to ascertain whether these would crystallize out from the fused metals , the following experiments were undertaken .
The metalst were weighed out in the proper proportions , and fused together in a crucible over a 4-Bunsen burner , a jet of gas playing on the surface from above to prevent the oxidation of the tin .
When fused , the lamp was removed and the alloy allowed to cool ( the jet of gas still playing upon it ) until the surface began to solidify , when the liquid alloy was poured off from the crystals .
Of course the two metals were always stirred well , and cast several times before the alloy was crystallized and analysed .
When the metals were fused together in the proportion to form AuSn2 ( 62'9 per cent. Au ) and AuSn3 ( 53'1 per cent. Au ) , no crystals could be obtained in either case .
When , however , more tin was added , so as to make the alloy AuSn4 ( 45*9 per cent. Au ) , a separation took place into a non-crystalline mass with a glassy fracture and a very crystalline one : these may be easily separated from each other by fusion , for the former has a much higher fusing-point than the latter .
The alloy containing 43'5 per cent. gold behaved in the same manner .
The analyses of the different parts of these alloys are given in the following Table .
The gold was determined by dissolving the alloy in nitro-hydrochloric acid , and precipitating the gold from the strong hydrochloric acid solution with sulphite of soda:* Phil. Trans. 1860 .

, and the non-crystalline part weighed about 50 grms. The addition of more tin did not cause any further separation into two masses .

In the last alloy , crystals fit for analysis could only be obtained in the first crystallization .
The mother-liquor was , however , crystallized four times , and the last mother-liquor analysed .
We are indebted to the kindness of Professor Miller of Cambridge for the following determination of the crystalline form of the foregoing alloys : Description of the Crystals of Gold and Tin .

Observed forms : 001 , 102 , 1 04 , 34 , 20 , 11 2 , 11 4 , with very obscure traces of the forms 50 2 , 4 , 202 3 .
The combination most frequently observed was 00 1 , 20 1 , 11 2 .
The angles between normals to the faces , computed from a mean of the best observations , are0 0 1 , 104= 16 37 001 , 102 30 50 0 1 , 203= 38 31 00 1 , 304= 41 50 00 1 , 201 67 16 00 1 , 502= 71 28 00 1 , 401 =78 10 00 1 , 14= 22 53 00 1 , 112 =40 10 20 1 , 021= 81 25 1 2 , 112= 54 16 20 1 , 112 =44 17 The faces of the form 001 are large and bright ; those of all the other forms are extremely narrow , and are usually uneven .
Cleavage 00 1 , very perfect .
No other forms of crystals than those just described were observed in any of the alloys experimented with .
The largest and best-defined crystals were obtained from the alloys containing about 41 per cent. of gold .
The plates were sometimes , when crystallized from 300 grms. , about 30 millims. long and 15 millims. wide , being the height and depth of the alloy in the crucible ; they were generally of a bronze colour , proceeding from a slight oxidation of the tin : their true colour was that of tin .
All the alloys emit a grating sound when cut through , as tin does , and are all exceedingly brittle .
From the above experiments it appears , first , that the welldefined crystals are not limited to one definite proportion of the constituents of the alloy , but are common to all gold-tin alloys containing from 43 to 27'4 per cent. gold ; secondly , that crystals and mother-liquor are never of the same composition .
These facts coincide with those found by Cooke* in his research on tin and antimony alloys , who observed that zinc and antimony are capable of uniting and producing definite crystalline forms in other proportions than those of their chemical equivalents .
