Introduction .
The currents given by the frog 's skin and their variations after excitation both directly and through the nerves have already been studied by many authors , * but , as far as I can determine , no one has up to the present time observed the action of anaesthetics on the resting current , and as these phenomena form a fitting sequel to those occurring in nerve ( Part I of this series ) , f they form the subject of this paper .
It is to be observed that from the nature of the object one of the possible alternative hypotheses in the case of nerve is here excluded , and it is therefore now legitimate to take a further step in explanation of the action of chloroform on the tissues generally .
Experiments .
Series I. A chamber was constructed of vulcanite , through the bottom of which three non-polarisable electrodes projected .
A movable partition of modelling wax , luted with moist china-clay , divided one electrode , A , from the * Most.of the references to the numerous papers on the frog 's skin are to be found in the article by Waymouth Reid in Schafer 's 'Text-book of Physiology , ' vol. 1 , pp. 669\#151 ; 691 .

The skin was placed with the outer surface resting on A and 0 , the movable upper portion of the partition adjusted , and contact effected with the electrode B through a bundle of linen threads soaked in m/ 10 NaCl solution .
In this series the electrode C served merely as a support , and the potential differences between A and B were alone considered . .

To make a preparation the frog is first killed by pithing , and the skin of the back cut into two longitudinal strips 3 to 5 mm. wide , one on either side of the middle line .
These strips are very gently lifted up and the connections below severed , special care being taken to avoid stretching or other injury .
A preparation of this kind gives a " resting " potential difference of from 0'0200 to 0T100 volt , * sometimes exceeding this latter figure , the value varying according to the avoidance of injury and the condition of the frog , freshly caught frogs giving much higher values than those kept in captivity for some time .
Any injury diminishes the potential indefinitely , and it is desirable to test the preparations from time to time by examining the skin in situ .
If one electrode be placed very gently on the external surface of the skin and another on any portion of the subcutaneous tissue , one obtains the " resting " potential with the minimum of manipulation , and the value from the excised strip should not be much below this.f * Du Bois-Reymond ( ' Untersuchungen , ' vol. 2 , Abth .
2 , pp. 9\#151 ; 20 ) gives a maximum value of 0*0561 volt and a minimum of 0*0044 ; Bayliss and Bradford ( .
cit. ) , 0*25 and 0*03 volt .
+ There are many points still remaining to be determined with regard to the resting current in relation to variations in the conditions of observation : some of these are under consideration .

] The Action of Anaesthetics on Living Tissues .
161 In the Experiments 502 to 506 inclusive , moist air containing about 16 per cent , of CHCI3 vapour delivered from the apparatus previously described ( Part I)* was applied first to the part of the chamber containing electrode B , which touched the inner surface , and secondly to electrode A , which touched the outer surface , the electrode not receiving CHCI3 being ventilated with moist air .
The figures plotted out in fig. 2 are the successive readings of the potentiometer balancing the E.M.F. from the skin , as in the previous experiments on nerve.f It will be seen that CHCI3 to B produces a minimal effect , j while CHCI3 to A causes an immediate and very rapid fall to the zero line .
In Experiments 500 and 501 ( fig. 3 ) the order was reversed , CHCI3 to A produced a fall of potential exactly as in fig. 2 , CHCI3 to B having again but a very slight action .
The conclusion is therefore\#151 ; ( i ) CHCI3 to the outer surface of the skin abolishes the current .
( ii ) CHCI3 to the inner surface of the skin has no action ( neglecting the minimal effect noted above ) .
From these conclusions follows another\#151 ; ( iii ) The apparatus giving the current is placed at or very near the outer surface .
Further inferences can be drawn ; they are considered later .
Series In Experiments 507 and 508 advantage was taken of the third electrode C which touched the outer surface opposite the electrode B , and measurements were taken by means of the ABC key of the potential between A and B , B and C , and A + C ( in parallel ) and B. The intervals between successive observations of the same pair of electrodes were about one minute , and the readings were in the order given , so that the readings for BC and ( A+C ) B are in each case a little later than those of AB .
In both experiments all three readings showed the gradually lessening increase characteristic of a normal preparation under the conditions of experiment .
CHCI3 was then applied to the chamber containing electrodes BC .
* Loc .

t The figures have been corrected for electrode current ; the error of reading is about - 0 0001 volt .
The potentiometer error is rather more , but as this is constant for all the experiments , no correction has been applied .
X This is probably due in part to a slight escape of CHC13 vapour to A , in part also ecause , although the outer surface has a high resistance ( vide infra ) , this is not infinite .

Series Determinations were made of the electrical resistance of skin before and after chloroformisation , in the same manner as the parallel series in nerve , the skin resting by its external on two non-polarisable electrodes in a chamber to which moist CHC13 vapour of about 16 per cent , or moist air could be passed at will .

( ii ) A diminution of polarisation of about 10 per cent. The first of these conclusions contrasts markedly with the results of the experiments on nerve , where there was no alteration of the real resistance ( as opposed to polarisation ) within the limits of error of the method .

[ Apr. 9 , Observations and Deductions .
It is to be observed that in these experiments there is no ambiguity ( siich as is possible in the case of nerve ) as to the action of chloroform .
Neither an increase or decrease of potential occurs ( neglecting for the moment the very small residual effect noted above ) when the drug is applied to the electrode B , in contact with the inner surface of the skin ; this spot is therefore acting merely as a moist conductor .
When the CHCI3 is applied to the electrode A , which touches the external surface , the current is abolished .
It is a necessary consequence that the apparatus giving the current is located at this spot .
This conclusion is in accord with all the classical observations on the resting current ( see the authors quoted above ) ; the only other observation that it is necessary to mention here is that of Waller* on the " blaze " current .
Using the ABC method , he found that the seat of the electromotive effect was accurately localised at the spot on the external surface touched by the electrode , and that the opposite spot on the internal surface was quite inert .
Although one cannot at the present time define exactly the relations existing between these " blaze " currents and the " resting " currents , Outer surface Inner surface Fig. 4.\#151 ; Diagram of Electrical Mechanism in the Skin of the Frog .
It is possible to make further deductions from the present experiments .
If a diagram ( fig. 4 ) be constructed to reproduce the observed phenomena , it must present the following features:\#151 ; ( i ) A series of separate cells placed side by side .
( ii ) The positive elements ( e.g. , zincs ) lie towards the outer surface , the negative { e.g. , carbons ) lie towards the inner .
( iii ) The negative elements are connected with each other .
( iv ) The positive elements are insulated .
* Waller , loc. cit. there is no doubt that there is a close connection between them .
1906.1 The Action of Anaesthetics on Living Tissues .
167 From the experiments in Series I , the postulate ( ii ) follows immediately ; ( i ) and ( iv ) are necessary in this way .
CHCI3 abolishes the potential difference between the outer and inner surfaces , and renders that portion of the tissue isoelectric .
If the whole outer surface was in electrical connection , the rendering isoelectric of any one part would cause a short-circuit there , and so diminish the current between any other point A on the outer surface and any point B on the inner surface\#151 ; the experiments in Series I show that this is not the case .
Series II confirms this conclusion .
CHCI3 to BC abolishes the potential difference there ; it leaves unaffected AB , and the potential between A\#151 ; C ( in parallel ) and B is diminished by an amount dependent on the relative resistance between A , B , and C. For a little distance inwards , therefore , the outer surface of the skin has a very high longitudinal resistance .
The postulate ( iii ) follows in a similar manner .
Further , as the skin as a whole is a good conductor , and as the outer surface is a bad conductor , the inner surface must be a good conductor .
As the negative elements are in connection with this tract , they are in connection with each other .
It is not yet possible to say what elements in the skin act in the manner of the ( ZnC ) cells in the diagram ( fig. 4 ) , still less the exact nature of the action .
Certain parts of the frog 's skin give an alkaline reaction , others an acid , and the relations between the secretion and the resting current ( still more the variations on excitation ) are yet to be determined.* But if one regards ( for the sake of simplicity ) only the glands , one can make a tentative picture of the process ( fig. 5 ) .
The whole gland will resemble one cell in the Direction of current .

For simplicity , the membrane ( or part of the cell ) has been drawn as permeable to - ions .
In reality the conditions are more complex .
diagram .
As the carbons in fig. 5 are connected together and with the inner surface , so the lymph must bathe the inner surface of the gland and freely enter the cells of the gland .
Now if the outer part of these cells\#151 ; possibly * See Bayliss and Bradford , loc. cit. ; also Hermann , ' Pfltiger 's Archiv , ' 1878 , vol. 17 , Dr. N. H. Alcock .
[ Apr. 9 , the limiting membrane\#151 ; has a directive or semi-permeable action , letting through some ions more freely than others , the general behaviour of the apparatus would approximate to the scheme .
If , then , chloroform destroys the semi-permeable mechanism ( perhaps in the manner suggested by Meyer* and Overtonf ) every sort of ion could wander freely in any direction , and so the whole tissue would become isoelectric .
Further , this destruction would be equivalent to a diminution of viscosity , and so would account for the great increase in conductivity observed in Series III .
This must be regarded merely as a sketch of what is possible rather than a finished hypothesis ; still this view presents certain problems in a manner that will admit of a solution which will either prove or disprove the suggestions here advanced .
At any rate , the experiments show :\#151 ; ( 1 ) That there are certain structures acting as semi-permeable membranes .
( 2 ) That chloroform inhibits or destroys their functions .
Relations with Part I and Alternative Theories .
It will be remembered that in the consideration of the action of chloroform ( and anaesthetics generally ) on isolated nerve some phenomena were found which bear a relation to those now under consideration .
Summarised they are as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) CHCI3 acting on a nerve produces the same electrical effect as an injury .
( 2 ) CHCI3 produces less than 2 per cent , alteration in resistance .
If the hypothesis be adopted that there are in the axis cylinder of a nerve certain ions already present , it is plain that the action of the anaesthetic is the same on nerve as on skin , namely , that a semi-permeable apparatus is rendered completely permeable .
It is not perhaps clear from the experiments on nerve alone whether this hypothesis is to be adopted or the alternative , that fresh ions are split off from the proteid by the action of the anaesthetic , but as it has been shown above that in the case of skin it is necessary to suppose the existence of a semi-permeable membrane , there is reason to suppose that this is the case in nerve also , and in fact it is not possible to create such a potential difference as is found in the case of nerve without some such arrangement , whether fresh ions are formed or no. } * Meyer , ' Schm iedeberg 's Archiv , ' 1899 and 1901 .

] The Action of Anaesthetics on Living Tissues .
169 It would arppear therefore that this action of chloroform , namely , the breaking down of a semi-permeable apparatus , is the characteristic action of an anaesthetic on living tissue .
The additional possibility just mentioned remains to be considered .
The view of Moore and Roaf * is that CHClg combines with proteid , forming " unstable compounds or aggregates , " and in doing so splits off inorganic ions , further , that " anaesthesia is due to a paralysis of the chemical activities of the protoplasm as a result of the formation of such aggregates .
" The present experiments ( Parts I and II ) give no direct information on these subjects , all that can be deduced with certainty is the conclusion given above .
Moore and Roaf 's theory may be adopted as an addition to this , or it may not .
Whether or no this addition is justified by the experimental evidence adduced by these authors is a debatable point .
It is to be remarked that the observations ( Part I , Series Y and YI , Part II , Series III ) on the electrical resistance of the tissues cannot be taken as proving or disproving an ion formation\#151 ; they show that what is equivalent to a diminution of viscosity takes place ( much in skin , little in nerve ) and that in the latter case this diminution causes less than 2 per cent , alteration in conductivity , obviously a small production of ions would be masked by these other changes , f As the resistance and freezing-point determinations of Moore and Roaf were made with solutions , there were no membranes to cause this ambiguity , but from inspection of their figures it would appear that the mean differences , which they use in support of their argument , are less than the error of their experiments ; it is only a matter of accident what values are obtained in such a case .
The question is one that merits further study before a definite conclusion is arrived at .
I have again , much pleasure in acknowledging the assistance of Dr. Waller , and I also wish to thank Professor Ayrton for his kindness in examining the electrical data and conclusions .
Dr. Collingwood and Mr. Shapiro have again given me much help .

^ Ysing the apparatus mentioned in the text , it was found that*any alteration in the resistance of serum w^ not detectable after CHC13 , but that there was a diminution of approximately 15 per cent , in the case of blood ( laked or simply defibrinated ) ; it would seem that the effect of CHC13 on haemoglobin would be worth investigating .
