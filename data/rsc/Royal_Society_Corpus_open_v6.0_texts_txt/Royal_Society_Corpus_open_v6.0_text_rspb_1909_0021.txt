) This investigation was undertaken to test the action of acid-fast bacilli on the glucosides , and to see how far any fermentation reactions obtained would differ with the various strains of human and bovine tubercle bacilli tested , and also to obtain if possible a better medium on which to isolate and grow tubercle bacilli .
In all , 43 glucosides were tested with acid-fast bacilli , including human and bovine tubercle bacilli , but there was no evidence of fermentation with any of the glucosides .
One glucoside , ericolin , was found to kill off a large number of species of micro-organisms , especially bacilli of the colon group and various cocci , but had very little effect on the acid-fast group of bacilli .
By means of this glucoside the isolation of tubercle bacilli directly from human sputum contaminated with other organisms becomes quite easy .
The glucoside should be made up with distilled water in a 2-per-cent , solution : a lump of sputum is then placed into a test-tube containing the ericolin and placed at 38 ' C. for f hour to 1 hour ; sub-cultures are then made on to Dorset 's egg medium , and pure growths of tubercle bacilli will be obtained in 14\#151 ; 28 days ; the tubes are sometimes contaminated with a few other organisms , chiefly tiny colonies of streptococci and slow-growing colonies of organisms of the streptothrix group , but they are so few that they in no way interfere with the tubercle colonies , which can be easily sub-cultured .
