214 On the Differences in Lichtenberg 's Dust-Figures .
[ June 13 corresponds very closely with the results of excitation of the fibres in the living animal of the same species ( Beevor and Horsley ) .
In all the cases in which there was coarse degeneration in the internal capsule it was , with two exceptions ( both hallux cases ) grouped on the outer edge of the capsule .
Attention is called to the fact that a large proportion of the coarser fibres passing down through the capsule enter the substantia nigra , and these experiments show this tract to be nearly or quite as large as that passing down into the pyramid .
These are apparently fibres which have been looked upon as pyramidal , and , as the " pyramidal tract " has been shown to be even more extensive in the medulla and below the decussation than in the internal capsule , it follows that the fibres passing to the substantia nigra are probably replaced by others arising at lower levels .
These degenerations show that in the monkey the facial fibres are situated in the middle third of the eras , in which they are mingled with the fibres of the pyramid , and that they do not occupy a space by themselves mesial to the pyramid .

" On the Cause of the Differences in Lichtenberg 's Dust-Figures : Preliminary Note .

As ordinarily produced by dusting a mixture of red-lead and lycopodium upon a surface which has been charged by contact with the knob of a Leyden jar , the dust-figures present a remarkable and hitherto unexplained difference of form .
The positive figures consist of white lines branching in stellate or dendritic patterns , whilst the negative figures exhibit red patches of circular or ovate outline .
The differences , save in the matter of colour , are not due to the powders used nor to the nature of the dielectric surface chosen for the experiment .
They vary only slightly with the nature of the gas ; but are more considerably altered by the rarefaction of the air .
The author found that the dendritic patterns of the positive figures are correlated to the brush form of discharge , whilst the rounded patches of the negative figures are due to the silent discharge of electrified winds .
When polished metal surfaces are used in air for producing the discharges ( as in the usual case when the knob of a Leyden jar is employed ) , negative electrification more readily discharges itself in a wind , positive electrification less readily , disruptively , as a brush .
But where a smooth surface of a peroxide , such as the peroxide of lead , is substituted for a metal knob , positive electrification will discharge itself as- a wind , giving rise to white positive figures of rounded outline ; while negative electrification will under certain conditions produce a brush discharge from the peroxide surface , 1895 .

The author considers these differences to be analogous to the differences observed in the experiments of Oliver Lodge upon the photo-electric loss of charge first observed by Hertz .

" Theorems on the Attraction of Ellipsoids for certain Laws of Force other than the Inverse Square .
" By E. J. Routh , F.R.S. Received May 11 , 1895 .
( Abstract .
) The object of the author is to find finite expressions for the potentials of an ellipsoidal shell , and of a solid ellipsoid when th\amp ; law of force is the inverse / cth power of the distance , k being positive or negative .
It is shown in the beginning of the paper that the two cases in which k is an even integer and an odd integer require different treatment .
After discussing some special cases , we come to the first general theorem , Supposing that k is even and that the shell is a thin homogeneous homoeoid , the potential is found to assume very different forms according as kis greater or less than 3 , so that the law of the inverse square is just on one side of the boundary .
When 3 , the potential can be completely integrated , and an expression is found containing ^(k\#151 ; 2 ) terms , and involving only the differentiation of an integral rational function of of k\#151 ; 4 dimensions .
The general form at an internal point is v=______2-E ... / \#177 ; y-8/ i+\#177 ; jA i______________i** ?

This reduces to the ordinary well-known form when t = 0 , i.e. , when the law is the inverse square .
