" On the Application of a New Principle in the Construction of Voltaic Batteries , by means of which an equally powerful current may be sustained for any period required ; with a description of a sustaining battery recently exhibited at the Royal Institution .
" By Frederick W. Mullins , Esq. , M.P. , F.S.S. Communicated by N. A.Vigors , Esq. , F.R.S. The method resorted to by the Author for obtaining a continuous voltaic current of equal intensity , is the same in principle as the one employed by Professor Daniell , and described by him in his paper recently presented to the Royal Society , and published in the Philosophical Transactions ; namely , the interposition of a thin membrane between the two metals in the voltaic circuit , so as to allow of the separation of the different fluids applied respectively to each metal : the fluid in contact with the zinc being a mixture of diluted sulphuric and nitric acids ; and that in contact with the copper being a solution of sulphate of copper .
The author reserves for a future paper the details of the results he has obtained , with regard to the relations between the intensity of effect , and the extent and disposition of the metallic surfaces : but states that he has obtained powerful electric action by bringing the membrane into contact with the zinc ; the latter eaving no acid applied to it , and the only fluid employed being the solution of sulphate of cop ?
