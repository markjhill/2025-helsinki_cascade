MARINE ALGiE.\#151 ; G. DICKIE .
Y.\#151 ; Marine Algae ( exclusive of the By G. Dickie , A.M. , M.D. , F.L.S. , Professor of Botany in the University of Aberdeen .
The total number of marine species of Algae known to be indigenous to Kerguelen Island ( excluding Miatomacece ) is 71 .
The collections upon which this estimate is based are those made respectively by\#151 ; Dr. Hooker ( Antarctic Expedition ) in the winter of 1840 ( May\#151 ; July ) , chiefly at Christmas Harbour , comprising 39 species ; Mr. Moseley ( Challenger Expedition ) in the summer of 1874 ( January and February ) , chiefly at Christmas Harbour and the eastern coast as far as Betsy Cove , comprising 37 species ; Dr. Kidder ( American Transit of Venus Expedition ) in the spring and first part of the summer of 1874-5 ( Sept , to Jan. ) near Molloy Point , towards the entrance of Eoyal Sound , comprising 22 species ; And the Bev .
A. E. Eaton ( English Transit of Venus Expedition ) in the spring and summer of 1874-5 ( Oct. 11\#151 ; Eeb .
27 ) , in the interior of Boyal Sound ( Observatory Bay ) and in Swain 's Bay , comprising 53 species .
The botanical results of the German Transit of Venus and Surveying Expedition , which was stationed for about two months at Betsy Cove , are not yet made known .
Mr. Eaton was at Observatory Bay during October , November , most of December , and the whole of February , during which time he made frequent use of the grapple .
In Swain 's Bay he collected Algae on nine occasions between the 15th and the 30th of January inclusive .
Of the 53 species in his collection 44 were obtained in Swain 's Bay , and only 32 at Observatory Bay : 24 species ( probably 27 or 28 , vide infra ) are common to both of the areas , 21 occurred ( to Mr. Eaton ) only in Swain 's Bay , and 8 ( from which 3 or 4 should be deducted , and added to the species common to both ) were collected only in Observatory Bay .
The preponderance of the Swain 's Bay gatherings may partly be accounted for by the distance of Observatory Bay from the open sea .
For Mr. Eaton noticed that in some very retired parts of Swain 's Bay the components of the Alga flora and their state of growth were very similar to those prevailing at Observatory Bay .
In advancing from the more sheltered to more open waters he observed considerable regularity maintained in the rate of change proceeding in the composition of the Alga flora ; so that it was possible , while collecting in one place , to conjecture beforehand with tolerable accuracy the number of additional species that would be found in other positions more exposed to the slight.swell that enters the bay from the outer sea .
And he was of opinion that if it had been possible to have visited the coast external to the hay , 10 or 12 species would most likely have been added to the 53 in his collection !
Judging from the number of species apparently indigenous to unsheltered situations which go to form the 18 that are not represented in his collection , this conjecture may have been not far from the mark .
But the advantages of situation afforded in Swain 's Bay for the growth of various Algse absent from the almost waveless shores of Observation Bay would have availed nothing , had it not been for the liberality and kindness of Captain Fairfax , B.N. , in command of 1I.M.S .
" Volage .
" Having invited Mr. Eaton to he his guest for three weeks , he conveyed him in his gig to almost every part of the hay that was accessible by boat in Kerguelen Island weather , and surrendered his cabins without reservation to the reception of buckets and specimens of all descriptions , excluding only seals and cetacea accommodated elsewhere .
The local distribution of the species round the coast may he ascertained roughly from a comparison of the constituents of the collections above mentioned .
Of the 71 species , 14 are common to all of the collections , and 8 common to three out of the four , making together 22 species , which may he regarded as plants generally distributed round the island ; 14 are common to Mr. Eaton 's collection and one of the other three , and 1 species to Hr .
Hooker 's and Dr. Kidder 's , \#151 ; together making 15 local plants , mostly of frequent occurrence ; 5 are common to Dr. Hooker 's collection and Mr. Moseley 's ( gathered in Christmas Harbour ) , and 29 are in one of the collections only , making 34 scarce or rare species .
Of the 29 , there are in Dr. Hooker 's collection 7 species , in Mr. Moseley 's 4 , in Dr. Kidder 's 1 , and in Mr. Eaton 's 17 .
As to their general geographical range , 20 , or rather more than a quarter of them , are found in various parts of the shores of Europe , and some are cosmopolitan .
The following 8 , so far as is known , are peculiar to the island:\#151 ; Desmarestia chordalis , Sphacelaria corymbosa and S. , Melobesict , fusco-mbrum , Epymenia variolosa , JPtilota , and Callithamnion simile .

Mr. Eaton has an impression that this grows upon Ballia or Btilota , but I should rather be disposed to suspect that it was attached to rocks .
The description was taken from an almost complete specimen ; there are fragments of others whose contour is less regular , probably through interference of external objects .
All of them are in colour of a very pale buff or dull yellowish hue , varied with pale red tints .

Swain 's Bay , in 2 to 5 fathoms , on the side and end of a promontory and of an island about two miles from the entrance of the bay , exposed to the tide and a slight swell from the outer sea ; very local .
Usually parasitic upon sometimes attached to Mytilus ; Eaton .
This species resembles P. Harveyi in the character of the involucre , but differs from it in general habit , and in the structure of the larger and smaller pinnules .
It is also dissimilar in colour , being dull purple .

I can see no essential difference between Mr. Eaton 's specimens and the plant from the northern hemisphere .
They agree in habit , and in the arrangement of the tetraspores .
The articulations are a little longer than those of British examples .
