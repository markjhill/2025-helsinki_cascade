" On a simple Geometrical construction , giving a very approximate Quadrature of the Circle .
" By C. M. WILLICH , Esq. Communicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received April 17 , 1855 .
Let AB be a quadrant of a circle A , B , C. In the arc BC place a chord BD equal to the radius , so that the arc BD is one of 60 ? .
Bisect BD in E ; join AE , and produce the joining line to meet the circumference in F. Then AF differs from the side of a square equal in area to the circle by somewhat less than the one fourthousandth part of that side .
