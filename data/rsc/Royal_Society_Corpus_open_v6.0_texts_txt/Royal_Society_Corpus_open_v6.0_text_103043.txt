Rules for correcting the usual Methods of computing Amounts and present Values , by Compound as well as Simple Interest ; and of stating Interest Accounts .
Offered to Consideration , by Thomas Watkins , Gent .
F. R. S. I. Of Compound Interest .
THE Supposition whereon the Method of computing by Compound Interest is founded ; viz. That all Interest Money , Rents , &amp;c. are or may be constantly received , and put out again at Interest , the Moment they become due , without any Charge , or Trouble , being impracticable ; therefore all Computations by this Method ( except of Fee-Simples or other Perpetuities ) must needs be erroneous .
Thus for Instance , the Amount of a Sum of Money , or Annuity , for want of Deductions out of the Profits , for the unavoidable Trouble , Charge , and Delay in the Management , will be too great : and for the same reason , the present value of a Sum of Money payable in any time to come , will be too little ; also the present value of an Annuity ( being only the Amount of the difference between the Annuity , and Interest of the said present value ) will be too much .
But in long terms of Years , as that difference becomes less so does the Error , as the term is greater ; and in Fee Simples it vanishes ; the contrary to which happens in Amounts of Sums of Money , and Annuities .
All which is proposed to be rectified , only by a just reduction of the Rate , and Annuity ; ( which is done by deducting so much per Cent. thereout , as the whole Trouble , and Charge of Management is supposed to amount to , and reducing the Remainder , by a Discount equivalent to the supposed loss of time ) and then by working with the Rate so reduced , for Sums of Money , and with the Rate and Annuity reduced in the like proportion for Annuitys , according to the common Method of Compound Interest ; as follows .
Put r for the rate of Interest of 1 l.c for the Charge and Trouble of the Management of 1 l. Then is r cr = the Rate after deducting the said Charge , = ( putting d for 1 c ) dr .
And for the Discount put t for the time lost , that is for such part of the Period of time in which the Payments are made ( whether Yearly , 1/ 2 Yearly , Quarterly , or otherwise ) as is supposed to be spent in receiving and putting them out again at Interest .
Then , dtr , being = the Interest of 1 l. for that time ; say , as 1+ dtr : 1 : : dr : dr/ 1 x dtr = ( putting e for 1+ dtr ) dr/ e , which is equal to the reduced Rate , near enough for practice , for which put ~ .
But if the utmost accuracy be required , the Discount itself must be made with regard to the like loss of time , which is done by a Series of Discounts raised thus ; ~ ( = 1+ tdr ) : tdr : : dr : td2 r2/ e : : : t~ r3~/ e2~ &amp;c. Whence dr t d2 r2/ e + t2 d3 r3/ e2~ t3 d4 r4/ e3 &amp;c. = ( putting q for td r/ e ) 1q+ q2 q3 &amp;c. x dr .
=d r/ e ( =1-qxdr ) + q2 q3 &amp;c. x dr , is = ~ , = the true Rate reduced .
Put s=1+ ~ , n= the time , p= the present Sum or Value , m= the Amount .
Then will 1+d r/ e + q2 q3 &amp;c. xd r~n xp=1+ ~~n xp=p sn , be exactly = m : But 1+d r/ e~n xp=m is sufficient for practice .
And for the Amounts and present values of Annuitys .
Put A= Annuity per annum .
a= Annuity 1/ 2yearly , quarterly , &amp;c. R= Yearly rate of Interest of 1 l. r= Rate 1/ 2 yearly , quarterly , &amp;c. ~= Reduced rate yearly , 1/ 2 yearly , quarterly , &amp;c. n= Number of Years , 1/ 2 years , quarters , &amp;c. Then will A ~/ R =a ~/ r be = reduced Annuity taken yearly 1/ 2 yearly , quarterly , or otherwise ; and by Compound Interest twill be 1+ ~~n 1/ ~ xa ~/ r =1+ ~~n 1/ r a=1+ ~~n 1/ R A= sn 1/ R A= m , and sn 1/ R sn A ( = m/ sn ) = p. Whence the Theorems for solving all the other Cases are easily deduced .
And if the Rate be required , when it is for a Sum of Money , the Solution is obvious : when for the Amount or Value of an Annuity , since 1+ r~n =mr+ a/ a = a/ a pr are the Equations whence Theorems for the Rate are usually derived , which by this Correction become 1+ ~~n =mr+ a/ a = a/ a pr .
That the same ~ may be had on both sides the Equation , put u~ for r , and 'twill be 1+ ~~n =mu~+ a/ a = a/ a pu~ : then , by the Rate assumed as near the truth as may be , find the value of u ( = 1/ d +tr= 1/ d td~ ) and in any Theorem for the Rate , putting mu for m , and pu for p , the result will be the Rate reduced nearly : and by repeated Operations correcting ~ and thereby u , the true ~ , and thence R the whole Rate , may be found .
The only difficulty that remains , is the right assuming the Quantities c and t , the impossibility of doing which with perfect Exactness , I suppose to be the reason why neither this , nor any Method of Correction to the like purpose , has yet been taken notice of by the Writers on this Subject ; and what may therefore be very likely to be objected to this .
But the same Objection I take to be of equal force against the Estimates of any other Uncertainties whatsoever , as Estates for Lives , Insurances &amp;c. First then , for the Quantity c , which is put for the Trouble and Charge of Management , viz. of collecting and placing out the Money on good Security , together with all Contingencies attending the same , as travelling Charges , Expenses , Attorney 's Bills , &amp;c. of all which , the principal Article is the Charge of Collection or Receiver 's Fees , which is commonly a fixed Rate , customarily allow 'd in the Place , or upon the Estate it self out of which the Purchase is made , if it be a Rent ; and for Interest Money , or any other Annuity , the like Estimate is to be made , whether the Proprietor acts for himself , or by another .
Then for the Charge of placing out the Money at Interest when received ; though this be for the most part defrayed by the Borrower , yet because it highly concerns the Lender to see it be securely done , there are usual Allowances made to Agents and Scriveners , to encourage their Care and Fidelity therein ; besides the Time , Expense and Trouble of the Proprietor himself , in finishing Contracts , inspecting Securities &amp;c. and whatever is saved in this Article , we must suppose to be fully made up by an Equivalent Degree of Risque in the Security .
In the next place , for the loss of time ; though it is also impossible for this to be exactly ascertained , nor perhaps so nearly as the former , since it depends very much on the Diligence of the Manager : Yet if the usual times of Payment of the particular Rent or Annuity to be purchased , with a moderate degree of deligence in the Manager , and the usual indulgence practised by Men of Business in this Case towards one another be observed , a reasonable Estimate may be also made of the loss of time ; In which it is to be noted , that Interest Money being usually paid in small Sums , when any Sum of Money to be made up of several such Payments , is intended to be put out at Interest , the whole must lie dead till the last Payment be made ; also that the Principal lies dead sometimes as well as the Interest ; and that on the other hand , to save time , Borrowers may be found out , and treated with during the time of Collection ; but this Advantage is in a great Measure lost by the difficulty of fixing the time or Quantum of a Loan , till the whole be paid in .
Note also , that if the Charge of Collection , or Loss of time , on the Rent , or Annuity , of any particular Estate or Place , be found to differ from that of the Interest of the Purchase Money , and so much exactness be required , as that the Computation be made with regard to such difference : It must be done , either by assuming a proper Medium for both , or more accurately thus : For the reduced ~ Annuity ~~~~ Rate of the put Then r : ~ : : a : a ~/ r , Interest-Mony ~ and ~ : 1+ ~~n 1 : : a ~/ r : 1+ ~~n 1/ r ax ~/ ~ =m= 1+ ~~n x p. To give a Specimen of this Method in Numbers , first the Quantities c and t are to be assumed , which are not here to be accomodated to any particular Place or Estate , but to be taken in general : And first for c the Charge of Management ; the usual Rates of Collectors Fees in these Kingdoms , as I am informed , are 6d .
12d .
and 18d .
per Pound , but the most usual 12d .
which is 5 per Cent. However to be withinc ompass , I shall take 4 per Cent. for the Medium , including what further trouble and charge may attend the Receipt of the Money , besides Receivers Fees ; and 2 per Cent. for all the other Charges before mentioned , in placing it out at Interest , both which make 6 per Cent. so that c is =0 , 06 , and d ( = 1 c ) =0 , 94 .
Next for t the Loss of Time ; since few Annuities are paid yearly , and a Discount being given for the Loss of Time , we are to lose no more than is discounted for ; therefore I choose Half-yearly Payments for the Examples , being the most usual , which with little Alteration may serve for quarterly ; and considering the before-mention 'd Circumstances relating to the Time , I look upon two Months the least , and seven or eight Months the most , that can well be supposed to be spent , one Time with another , in receiving and putting out the Money , upon a moderate Management ; between which the Medium is about four Months and half , which being 3/ 4 of 1/ 2 a Year , gives 3/ 4 = t : and if dr/ e be = ~ , the yearly Rates of 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 and 10 per Cent. will produce for Half-yearly Rates reduced of 1 l. 0.018539 , 0.023093 , 0.027616 , 0.036569 and 0.0454 each= ~ .
But if ~ be =d r/ e + q2 q3 &amp; c xd r , 'twill be , 0.01854219 , 0.0230999155 , 0.027627775 , 0.036596289 and 0.04545235 , each = ~ , ( so that each Rate loses by this Estimate about 1/ 12 Part .
) Whence the following Amounts , and present values of 1 l. per Annum computed Half-yearly , are produced , and compared with those of the usual Method computed yearly , to agree with the common Tables .

II .
Of Simple-Interest .
The absurdity of the Supposition , on which the usual Method of computing present Values by Simple-Interest , is founded , viz. That the Rent or Annuity is constantly received , and put out again at Interest , as it becomes due ; but that the Interest of the Purchase Money lies dead during the whole Term , is so apparent , and the Errors arising from it so gross , that the Writers who have laid down this Method , have at the same time cautioned against the Use of it for any more than 6 or 7 Years , the Error for that time being not considerable .
The same Supposition does also occasion the miscomputation of Amounts , or rather the misapplication of them to their proper Cases .
Wherefore , since the Simple-Interest of Money is of equal Value pro rata , and of the same regard with Rents or Annuitys , being each the Original Profits issuing alike from a principal Stock , Estate or Value , and equally improveable ; This general Rule may serve for a just Correction of this Method , viz. That supposing in any Case an Interest ought to be , or not to be allowed to either of those Profits , the same be done in the like Case to the other .
Thus , in the Case of Debts , or Amounts of Sums of Money , Rents , or Annuitys for the time past , its usual in practise to allow no Interest to either : For though the Law , to curb the exorbitant Avarice of Usurers , and for other Reasons , does more expressly disallow Interest upon Interest for a Debt ; our Courts both of Law and Equity , as I am informed , will be as far from allowing the Charge of Interest against a Tenant for Rent in Arrear ; except on a nomine paenae ( which is now become almost obsolete ) so that in this Case ( putting a and r for the Annuity and Rate yearly , Half-yearly , or otherwise ) as prn+p is the Amount of a Sum of Money , so is an the Amount of an Annuity or Rent in Arrear , and not n1/ 2 r+1x an as Arithmeticians commonly make it .
But in the Computation of present Values , or Amounts for the time to come , the same being made on the Expectation of a constant regular Income of the Profits , without any extraordinary Interruption , an Interest ought to be allow 'd to both , especially in present Values , which are found by setting the Amounts of both against each other : so that in these Cases , putting x= n 1 , if 1/ 2 xr+1xa n , be made the Amount of a Rent or An nuity ; then 1/ 2 xr+1xprn+ p , will be the proper Amount of a Sum of Money , and not prn+ p : and consequently 1/ 2 xr+1xa n/ 1/ 2 xr+1xrn+1=p will be the present Value of a Rent or Annuity , the subsequent Interest being remitted on both sides in lieu of the Loss of Time and Charge of Management ; which such as are apt to depreciate long Futurities , may think the properest Method of approaching the true Value ; but I rather look upon the former Method of Compound Interest corrected as more exact , as well as more general , the Interest remitted in this , being in short Terms less , and in long Terms more than an Equivalent for the Trouble , Charge and Delay in the Management .
But it is however the most exact of any of the Methods , that have yet been deduced from Simple-Interest .
The reduced Rate may also in some Cases be properly made use of for Amounts , but not for present Values , except for short Terms ; and then , since r : a : : 1/ 2 x~+1x~ n : 1/ 2 x~+ 1x an ~/ r , 'twill be 1/ 2 x~+ 1x an ~/ r =m= 1/ 2 x~+~ xp~n+ p , and 1/ 2 x~+1xa n/ 1/ 2 x~+1x~n+~~x ~/ r = p. Examples of this Method compared with those of the former , will stand as follows ; in which all is computed Halfyearly , except the last Column of Compound Interest .

The first Column contains the Amounts of such Debts , or Sums of Money as carry a simple Interest till the Principal be paid .
2 .
The second Column answers the common Case of Debts due by Bond , that by Law are allow 'd not to exceed the Penalty , which is generally double the principal Debt .
3 .
The third Column answers the Case of a Security or joint Obligor , that has duly and constantly paid the Interest , and at last the principal Sum of a Debt , from which he has a Counter-Bond from the principal Debtor to save him harmless , against whom he may make his Charge from this Column .
4 .
In case the Parties shall agree that the Debt shall lie for any time certain , or uncertain ; and for the much greater ease , advantage and satisfaction of both of them , no Interest to be called for , till the Principal it self is paid ; but to carry Interest as it becomes due , the Lender allowing for the time and charge he must have been at , in receiving and putting out his Interest , the fourth Column will fit this Case , or else the fifth as a greater or less degree of Lenity is agreed upon in favour of the Borrower .
5 .
The fifth Column is also proper in the following Case , viz if it be demanded , what Estate in reversion , after a certain number of Years , any Sum in Hand will Purchase ; the first step being to find the Amount of that Sum to the time the Reversion commences , its had in this Column .
6 .
The last Column gives the Amount of a Sum of Money , according to the common Method of Compound Interest , but being computed with that extraordinary rigor as has been said , ( except some small allowance for the loss of time , by being done Yearly ) it is hardly suitable to any Case .
Other Cases might be enumerated , to which the foregoing Theorems might be equitably applied ; besides such extraordinary ones , wherein it may appear to Arbitrators , or a Court of Equity , that either Party deserves Favour , either by way of Compensation for Injuries suffered from the other , by means of any fraudulent or oppressive Practices , or otherwise , for which no other redress is provided .
III .
Of Interest Accounts .
The Inequality of the usual Method of stating Interest Accounts , as practised in our Courts of Equity , will best appear by an Example , for which I shall take the common general Case of an Interest Account to be stated on a Mortgage , viz. suppose 1000 l. to be let out at 6 per Cent. on a Mortgage of 120 l. per annum , payable Half Yearly , and the Mortgagee after five Years end , to have Possession till the Arrear of Interest , accruing Interest and Principal be discharged : Quaere , How long that will be ?
supposing also , for the sake of brevity in the Account , the Payments to be equally , and punctually made as they become due .
By the Chancery Method , the Rent is first applied to discharge the Arrear of Interest ; and then the remainder of every Half-Year 's Rent , after deducting the same Half-Years Interest .
is applied towards the Discharge of the Principal , and thereby the Principal and Interest continually lessens , till the whole be paid off .
Now by this means the Mortgagee , after the Arrear is discharged , pays Comp. Interest , with the utmost rigour , for so much per annum of the Rent , as exceeds the Interest of the whole Principal Money , and receives but Simple Interest for his Debt ; which , however strange it may seem , is easily proved , by applying the proper Theorems of Simple and Compound Interest to this Case , in which the Annuity , Principal Money , Rate and Arrear of Interest are given , and the time required ; the result being the same with that of the Chancery Method , except a very small difference only when any part of the time is expressed by a Fraction : viz. putting L for Logarithm , ~ =ap~= 30 , s=1+r= 1,03 , t= time of contracting the Arrear = 10 Half-years , n= any number of 1/ 2 Years spent in discharging the whole or any part , N= number of Years required ; the Equation for the Arrear will be prt+prn=a n ; and for the Principal and accrueing Interest prn+p=prn+ sn 1/ r x ~ .
Whence pr t/ 2 ~+LaL ~/ 2 Ls =N=16,7249 Years=the time demanded ; i. e. pr t/ 2 ~=5 Years=the time of discharging the Arrear , and LaL ~/ 2 Ls= 11,7249 years , =the time in which the Principal and accrueing Interest is discharged ; during which its evident , the Mortgagee pays full Compound Interest for 60 l. per annum of the Rent .
For the Correction of which inequality , in the first Place , to the end that neither Branch may exceed , or be deprived of its due Profits ; This general Rule is proposed as necessary to be always observed , viz. That Amounts of the Produce on each side be stated separately , and set against each other in the Account , in order to a Balance , And in the common Cases of Mortgages , Government , and Stock Securities , &amp;c. where the Debt is paid off by a Rent , Annuity , Pension , Dividend , or other Payments issueing in the same manner , and with the like trouble , charge , &amp;c. as Interest Money does ; I presume this Rule will also be easily admitted , viz. That the same equitable Advantage be impartially allow 'd on both sides ; for which the Method of Simple Interest , as corrected under the foregoing Head , seems truly adapted ; whereby the Original Profits on each side are supposed to be deemed , either as Interest , or else as Principal Money ; and since the Amounts both of an Annuity and Sum of Money , for the time past , as there stated , on the first of these Suppositions ( t being there = 0 ) are likewise vouched by our Laws , and the practice of our Courts , to be good when separately used ; I think its very evident , that the Account ought to be stated by setting those Amounts against each other thus , p rt +prn+p=a n , ( whence 1+t r/ 2 ~p= N , = 21,6666 Years ) and that this Method is most proper for general Use , in the Cases mentioned : Unless it should be thought fit , in consideration of the various Ways found out for the ready improvement of Money , to allow a further Advantage on both sides , by charging the Original Profits as Principal Money , and giving a Simple Interest there to , which still falls short of the Advantage allow 'd to Rents by the Chancery Method .
And this is to be done two ways , viz. either by applying an Amount of Rent to pay off the Arrear first , and afterwards another Amount of Rent to discharge the Principal , and accrueing Interest ; or else by letting the Profits with all Arrears and other Charges run on at Simple Interest on each side , till the end of the Term : viz. putting x=n 1 , y= t 1 , ~=ap r , f=2rx ~ , g=f2pt r2 , ~= 1/ 2yr +1 xprt= Arrear of Interest ; by the first of these 'twill be , for the Arrear , ~+pt r2n = 1/ 2 xr+~~ n , and for the Principal and accruing Interest , 1/ 2 xr+1x~n= p ; Whence ~8~~r+ g2 ~8p~r+ f2 f+ g/ 4 ~r=N= 18,7653 Years .
By the other 'twill be , for the whole , ~+ ptr2n + p= 1/ 2 xr+1x~ n , Whence ~~ +px8~r+ g2 g/ 4 ~r=N= 18,1648 Years .
The Lender will have to allege for the first of these two Ways , that as the Rent is not hindred by any other parallel Charge from making the utmost produce it can , so for that reason ought his Principal Money to have the Advantage of the Arrears being first discharged , which also agrees with the Chancery Method in this particular .
Lastly , another way of stating this Account , may be taken from that Notion of Simple-Interest , whereby the Annuity only is charged as Principal Money : and then 'twill be , for the Arrear , prt+prn=a n , and for the Principal and accruing Interest , 1/ 2 xr+1x~n =p ; Whence ~8p~r+ f2 g/ 4 ~r ( = pr t/ 2 ~+~8p~r+ f2 f/ 4 ~ r ) =N= 17,3072 Years ; which appears to be same with the ~ ~ , only that the Compound Interest in that , is turned into Simple in this ; and as it still retains part of the same inequality , to the ~vantage of the Borrower , it seems only fit to be observed in such Cases wherein the Borrower may be thought to merit favour , as when ~ Debt is paid out of the Profits of Trade , arising by extraordinary Risque or Industry .
But since such a ~ of distinction is hardly possible to be reduced to general practice , the use of this Theorem seems restrained to such Cases only , wherein the Parties themselves , or a~ os Equity shall think it reasonable .
For a further illustration of these Rules , the following Specimen is added , which shows at sight , how the Results of the several Methods differ , as the Rent , Arrear , or Rate of Interest , is greater or less , and consequently of how much more or less concern it is to the Parties , as well as to the due Administration of Justice , to have regard thereto .

25,0000 31,6666 43,7500 63,3333 I must also observe for the sake of such as are unacquainted with specious Arithmetic , that though for brevitys sake , the foregoing Theoremsand Examples are laid down , and wrought in Algebraic Terms : Yet the same Accounts may be stated after the Chancery manner it self , according to the several Principles before delivered , and with the same Results , with this only caution , that ( instead of a continual deduction of the Rent or Annuity out of the Principal and Interest of the Debt , which occasions the Error before mentioned ) the preceding General Rule of stating separate Amounts be observed , which may be done by continually adding the profits together on each side , in the same manner , as if the Parties were to make a separate Charge against each other , which is the rather to be noted , as being the only Course that can be taken , in case the Sums or Times of payment should differ , but the respective Results will notwithstanding be analogous to the above Examples .
All which is submitted to the consideration of more discerning Judgments , especially the Applications of the Rules to particular Cases , for exemplifying the Theorems .
But if any of those Rules or Theorems should be objected against , meerly because they tend to introduce some Alterations in the present practice ; I shall for answer only add , with submission , to what is before said , that in former Ages , when our Laws relating to these matters had their rise , ( the Profits of England arising chiefly from Husbandry and Tillage , and little from Trade , ) the Cash of the Kingdom was but low , the Rates of Interest very high to the Advantage of Usurers , and those ways for the ready Improvement of Money accomodated to all Peoples use , not known ; ( much like to which we are told was the State of the Jewish Affairs , when they were forbidden to take Usury of any but Strangers .
) But latter Ages have produced vast Alterations in all these Respects , which having happened by insensible degrees , may be one reason why neither our Legislature , nor Courts of Judicature have yet taken such notice thereof , as time and leisure , with the Tender of proper and practical Methods of Computation , may hereafter induce them to do .
