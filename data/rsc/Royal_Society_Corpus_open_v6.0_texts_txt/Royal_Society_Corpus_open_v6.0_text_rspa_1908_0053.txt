The fifth satellite discovered by Barnard is so near to the primary that the node of its orbit revolves through about 912 ' per annum , and second order terms begin to make themselves felt .
A careful measurement of this motion would be of much value , for a comparison of the compression of Jupiter , deduced from the motion of the node of Y with that deduced from the motion of the node of II , might provide information concerning the distribution of mass in Jupiter .

Introduction .
The original discovery of helium in cleveite and other minerals by Ptamsay , and the subsequent explanation of its presence as due to production in situ by radio-active change , are of fundamental importance , and are too well known to need anything more than mention here .
No exception has been known hitherto to the rule that helium is found in radio-active minerals exclusively\#151 ; minerals , that is , in which either uranium , or thorium , or both , are present in appreciable quantity .
It seemed , however , that valuable information might be gleaned from a fuller examination of the subject than has yet been made .
In the first place , Kutherford has suggested with great plausibility that subatomic changes might be going on in some of the ordinary elements with emission of a particles of somewhat lower velocity than those of the radio-active elements .
In such cases , owing to the abrupt disappearance of ionising and photographic action below the critical velocity , the activity 1908 .

573 would not make itself apparent by ordinary experimental tests .
If , however , helium were a product of such a change , we might expect to find it stored up in minerals containing the element in question .
Again , as many observers have found , ionising radiation is given off by the ordinary elements .
It has been supposed ( and I was myself one of the first to urge that view ) that this ionising radiation indicated a feeble radioactivity .
The progress of knowledge has made this more doubtful than it seemed at first .
One strong objection is derived from a consideration of the internal heat of the earth.* Another is derived from the want of satisfactory constancy in the amount of this ionising radiation from different samples of a metal.t It seemed that the investigation proposed might give evidence as to whether or not this ionising radiation resembled genuine radio-activity in being associated with a production of helium .
The further object was proposed of looking for argon and the other inert gases in minerals .
In view of the well-known experiments of Ramsay and Cameron , J it is unnecessary to emphasise the interest of this question .
The result of the experiments has been that helium is found to be a nearly universal constituent of minerals , when sufficiently refined methods of isolating it are adopted .
With regard to argon it is much more difficult to pronounce .
The spectrum , it is true , was in nearly all cases observed .
Where the total inert residue ( argon with helium ) was small , the argon found was not infrequently the greater part .
However , in these cases the actual quantity of argon did not usually much exceed a cubic millimetre , a quantity which would be accounted for by contamination with 1/ 10 c.c. of air .
It is not easy to carry out the complicated manipulations involved with complete certainty of excluding this amount of leakage .
However , in the case of a few minerals , much less argon than this was observed , so that such leakage is not inevitable .
I do not doubt that by careful working and with many repetitions the question of whether argon is commonly present in minerals to the extent of 1 cubic millimetre per kilogramme could be settled .
In the case of igneous rocks it certainly is present in larger quantities than this , and I believe that the same is true of certain other siliceous materials , but further examination is required .
In the case of helium , no uncertainty of this kind is encountered .
For it is only present in the air in infinitesimal proportions .
* In determining whether or not the helium present in a mineral can be attributed to traces of the radio-active elements , I apply , in the first place , the * 4 Nature , ' December 21 , 1905 .

Helium and [ Apr. 23 , crude test of comparison with the strongly radio-active minerals , in which helium is certainly derived from that source .
If the quantity of helium should not he greater relatively to the radium than in such minerals , there is no primd facie reason to look further for its origin .
The radium in a mineral is proportional to the uranium contained in it , and , when known , allows the latter to he calculated .
Both , in all probability , contribute to the helium present , and a more convenient unit is obtained by computing the volume of helium per gramme of uranium oxide than by expressing it relatively to the radium content .
I shall call this , for brevity , the helium ratio .
Many of the strongly active minerals contain thorium , which also contributes to the helium contained.* In such cases , the ratio of helium to uranium may be much higher than in those where the uranium series is of chief importance .
In establishing the normal helium ratio I shall ignore the former class .
It would scarcely be feasible to determine the probably very minute amount of thorium in the common minerals and ores ; but it will appear in the sequel that the results of the present paper are not , as it happens , rendered difficult of interpretation by this circumstance . .
The amount of helium found in the minerals will , of course , depend on the time which has elapsed since their formation , and is accordingly limited by the geological age of the strata in which they occur .
It is unfortunate that geological evidence as to the age of metalliferous veins is usually vague ; nor can it even be regarded as certain that all the minerals in the same vein are approximately contemporary .
Further , we cannot be sure that all the helium which has been generated in the minerals still remains there .
A part may have escaped .
For these reasons the present investigation has no claim to be regarded as strictly quantitative .
Nearly all the minerals examined occur in palaeozoic rocks , and , except in a few extreme cases , I shall not attempt to distinguish the geologically older minerals from the geologically younger ones .
The object of the investigation is to test materials of widely diverse chemical nature .
To attain this it is necessary to be content with but vague information as to their geological age .
Nevertheless , the general result will , I think , bo regarded as fairly clear when the data given in this paper are examined .
The very interesting problem of tracing the effect of geological age on the helium ratio must be left for future treatment .
Such materials as limestones , suggest themselves as suitable for this investigation .

Experimental Methods .
To extract helium from a mineral , we have the choice of two methods .
The gas may be extracted by chemical disintegration of the material , or by heat .
In the present case it was desired to look for helium present in very minute proportions , and to do this adequately it was necessary to extract the gas from large quantities of material , in some cases as much as 1 kilogramme or even more .
It is scarcely feasible to decompose chemically such quantities of refractory minerals , when the onerous condition of working in a perfectly air-tight apparatus has to be observed .
I have , therefore , contented myself with the summary method of heating the minerals to redness .
It is true that the whole of the helium is not liberated in this way , but , for a pioneering investigation like the present , it was considered sufficient to assume that the quantity extracted by heat was half the total , as in the case of cleveite and kindred minerals.* When less than 200 grammes of the mineral was to be heated , tubes of hard glass were used .
For larger quantities it was found convenient to use weldless steel tubing , such as is used for building the frames of bicycles and motor cars .
The tube was closed at one end with a cap turned out of rolled brass and soldered on to the steel with silver solder , f The steel tube was heated either in a gas furnace or , what is better , by electrical means .
In the latter case the tube was wrapped in asbestos paper , and over this was wound a helix of nickel wire , through which the heating current could be passed* Over this was a thick layer of asbestos for heat insulation .
A glass exit tube was connected to the steel tube by means of a rubber cork , which was jacketed externally with water .
This jacket served the double purpose of preventing any inward leakage of air under exhaustion and of protecting the rubber from injury by heat conducted along the hot metal .
The powdered mineral was placed in the steel tube , which was exhausted by a mercury pump .
After it had stood exhausted all night , a little oxygen was added , and removed by the pump , so as to wash out all traces of air .
Heat was then applied to drive off the gases contained .
These gases passed over potash , then hot copper oxide , then over potash again , finally over phosphoric anhydride .
These reagents absorbed most of the hydrogen and oxides of carbon evolved .
The gas which passed them was collected through * Travers , 'Roy .

t It is found much easier in practice to close the tube air-tight with a cap than with a plug .

577 the pump .
When the tube had been kept at a full red heat for two hours , * practically nothing more could be extracted .
The gas thus collected consisted chiefly of ^nitrogen .
which exists in nearly all the minerals examined .
To remove this nitrogen , sparking with oxygen was resorted to .
The operation was carried out over mercury , in a eudiometer with wires sealed in at the top , which very nearly touched one another .
A fragment of solid potash , partially hydrated , floated on the top of the mercury .
The spark , or rather arc , was produced by a Ruhmkorff coil with an alternating current in the primary .
The electrodes being fixed , the arc cannot be conveniently started by approximating them .
The starting w^as effected by allowing the hammer of the coil to vibrate in synchronism with the supply , which it readily did , producing a spark , as when a battery is in use .
The spark soon degenerated into an arc , and the hammer then ceased to vibrate .
The primary current was promptly diminished by resistance , so that the arc should not be large enough to risk melting the electrodes or cracking the glass .
Oxidation and removal of nitrogen then proceeded without attention .
It is much better not to hurry the process by increasing the current .
With a small arc there is little danger of any accident involving loss of the gas .
After contraction was over the excess of oxygen was removed by melted phosphorus , after the method of Ramsay and Travers .
In the majority of cases , where the quantity of inert gas was inconsiderable , the residue left after absorption by phosphorus amounted to something like 10 to 30 cubic millimetres , which was still a considerable multiple of the volume of the inert gases .
It seems scarcely feasible to isolate minute quantities of these gases perfectly by the method of sparking , though I have not* paid particular attention to the causes of failure .
The final purification was effected in the vacuum tube in which the gas was to be spectroscopically examined .
This tube was provided with electrodes of the liquid alloy of sodium and potassium , which , under the influence of the discharge , absorbs all traces of nitrogen , hydrogen , and carbon compounds .
I am indebted for the knowledge of this invaluable method to Sir James Dewar .
It has also been described by Mey.f After the gas in the vacuum tube had been sparked for a few minutes , the spectrum showed nothing but the inert gases .
Helium was usually conspicuous at this stage .
Argon , however , was rarely , if ever , completely absent from the spectrum .
To isolate helium , Sir James Dewar 's admirable method of absorption with * The closed end must not be raised to more than a dull red heat , for the sake of the soldered joint .

Helium and [ Apr. 23 , cooled charcoal was employed .
I have found that cooling to \#151 ; 80 ' , with carbonic acid snow in alcohol , suffices for the purpose when the quantity of gas to be absorbed is small .
Xhis is a great convenience in a laboratory which is not provided with the means of producing liquid air .
Connection was opened between the vacuum tube and a small vessel containing cocoanut charcoal at \#151 ; 80 ' C. , which had been freed from occluded gases by preliminary heating and exhaustion .
In a few minutes the spectrum of argon became practically invisible .
In most cases a brilliant helium spectrum remained.* In order to measure the volume of the inert gases , either before or after the charcoal separation , a modified McLeod gauge was used , so arranged that the gas could be drawn into it from the rest of the apparatus , or replaced .
The bulb of the McLeod gauge had a volume very large compared with the vacuum tube and charcoal reservoir .
Thus nearly all the gas could be drawn into it when the mercury was lowered .
The construction and method of manipulation will be apparent from fig. 2 , with the explanation appended .
Until we know how much of the known radio-active bodies are present in a mineral , it is obviously impossible to say how far the helium in it may be derived from any other source .
For this reason it formed an essential part of the present investigation to determine the quantity of radium in each of the minerals examined .
The nearly universal presence of this element in rock-forming minerals^ justified a suspicion that it would also be found in metalliferous ores , as well as in other siliceous minerals .
This anticipation has been confirmed .
The methods used for determining radium were those described in a former paper .

Statement of Experimental Results4 .
This first set of results refers to minerals which are quite strongly radioactive and ( for the most part ) quite rich in helium .
These results are-taken from a former paperS and are given here for convenience only .
They seem to establish a kind of scale which shows roughly what ratio is to be expected between helium in a mineral and the uranium it contains .
Many radio-active minerals contain considerable quantities of thorium , and in these cases the ratio is higher than usual .
In this list only those minerals , in which the uranium series contributes the greater part of the activity * When the quantity of argon was appreciable , as in igneous rocks , the charcoal treatment had to be repeated more than once .

The low value for pitchblende has long seemed anomalous , and will not appear less so in comparison with the results of the present paper , showing normal values for most of the other Cornish vein-minerals .
Table II gives a list of results for minerals containing the rare earths and some other rare elements .
It will be noticed that the helium content is in several cases in excess of what the uranium present can account for , and in one case ( fluor from Ivitgut , Greenland ) enormously in excess.* I regard this excess of helium as due to the radio-activity of thorium contained in the mineral .
In all the cases marked thus f thorium was looked for and detected by its emanation .
Although no strictly quantitative experiments were made , the amount of thorium emanation appeared amply sufficient to account for the helium present .
I have failed to find minerals containing the rare earths which are reasonably free from both uranium and thorium .
Accordingly a good deal of helium is always present , and it is impossible to be sure that a part of it is not contributed by other constituents such as cerium .
But the determinations afford no positive support for such a view , and any such contribution must be very small compared with the contribution made by an equal mass of uranium or thorium .
In none of these cases was evidence obtained of the presence of rare gases other than helium .
If any argon or neon was present , its quantity must have been quite insignificant in comparison .
The inert residue always gave the brilliant yellow glow of pure helium .

Helium and [ Apr. 23 Tables III , IY , Y include a selection of minerals of varied composition for the most part containing only traces of uranium .
The helium is never distinctly in excess of what uranium and its products will account for .
It should be explained that a good many of the experiments were made before any adequate apparatus had been set up for quantitative measurement .
Helium , qualitatively observed , is entered as He .
In such cases the quantity was not at most in excess of 2 cubic millimetres , judging by the appearance of the discharge .
Usually it was very much less .
With regard to argon , the spectrum was generally seen , but the quantity was never more than 2 cubic millimetres , and never in excess of probable contamination from air .
Where the quantity of helium was insignificant , the argon spectrum was comparable with it in intensity .
In such cases a query is entered under argon , to show that it may possibly occur in quantity comparable with helium .
Where helium was more abundant , the argon spectrum was always inconspicuous .
To distinguish these cases argon is entered as 0 .
But it must be repeated that there is no evidence of its presence in either of these cases .
It would seem probable that the minerals in these tables are very free from thorium .
They occur for the most part in mineral veins and ore deposits , being contrasted in this respect with many of those in Tables I and II , which are primary constituents of igneous rocks .
Thorium was specially looked for in wolfram , but was not found .
The next set of experiments refers to igneous rocks .
It will be observed that the helium ratio is of the same order as usual .
The Irish basalt was erupted in tertiary times , and solidified long after the formation of the majority of minerals examined .
However , as pointed out in a previous paper , a part of the helium now present was in all probability dissolved or entangled in the original magma .
It is worthy of remark that the Cornish granite shows a considerably smaller ratio than some of the minerals of the veins which traverse it , and which are clearly younger .
This may , perhaps , be partly due to the fact that a great part of the radio-active material in this granite is contained in the mica , which from its structure may be unable to retain helium .
However , in view of the imperfect extraction of helium from some minerals by heat , anomalies of this kind must be expected in any case .
As already mentioned , it is hoped to study the subject in this aspect later .
The quantities of argon found in these rocks are considerably smaller than those given formerly.* This is to be explained by the imperfection of the experimental method then adopted .
It was assumed that after sparking * 'Boy .

587 and removal of oxygen the residue might be measured as argon -f helium .
Further experiment has shown that the volume measured after the spectroscopic purification in the vacuum tube itself is much smaller .
This , of course , only applies to very small volumes of gas .
Large volumes can readily be purified by sparking .
Table YII gives results for siliceous minerals other than igneous rocks .
In no case is the quantity of helium considerable , and in no case is there reason to regard it as proceeding from any other source than the uranium series .
In view of the small quantity of uranium and radium in quartz , this mineral affords a severe test case for the possible production of helium from common elements .
It will be noted that flint from the upper chalk , which is geologically recent compared with most of the materials examined , shows , in accordance with anticipation , a very much lower helium ratio .
In the several samples of quartz examined , there seems to be evidence of the presence of argon in excess of what can be explained by atmospheric contamination , though the margin is not large .
In garnierite , the presence of argon seems certain .
The determination quoted is only one of several , all of which were believed to be unexceptionable , and all of which pointed to about the same quantity .
I am inclined to suspect that the presence of traces of argon in siliceous material is general , though certainty could only be achieved with great labour .
Something more will be said on this subject in a later paragraph .
The first four sets of determinations in Table YII , which are only samples of many similar ones , refer to the mineral beryl .
This mineral has proved altogether exceptional .
It will be observed that the helium present is , as a rule , enormously in excess of what can be attributed to uranium and its series .
This raises the question of whether thorium is present .
For this , as for further investigations on the subject , I used the beryl richest in helium , that found at Acworth , New Hampshire.* Thorium emanation could , indeed , be just detected by careful experiments in a considerable quantity ( 50 grammes ) of Acworth beryl in solution .
But the thorium series does not appear to contribute more , if so much , to the total radio-activity of the mineral as does the uranium series , and affords no explanation of the quantity of helium present .
With the idea that some unknown radio-active constituent might be present which did not yield an emanation , the powdered beryl was carefully tested with an electroscope for radio-activity .
Nothing could be detected , * Another sample of beryl from the same place , somewhat more transparent than the foregoing , contained much less helium .

The following results illustrate this .

It was next attempted to see if helium in comparatively large quantities could be connected with any recognised constituent of beryl , without regard to radio-activity .
Beryllium seemed the most promising constituent .
Several other beryllium minerals such as phenacite and chrysoberyl , were tried , as recorded above .
But only those traces of helium were found which are almost universal , and which I attribute to traces of the radio-active elements .
Caesium has been found in some beryls , but the absence of helium from the caesium mineral , pollux ( see Table VII ) , makes it unlikely that this element is concerned .
Moreover , the caesium lines were not visible in the flame spectrum of my beryl .
The remaining important constituents of beryl are comparatively common , and are amply represented in the tables of minerals given above , so that they , too , must be excluded .
Examination of the flame spectrum of Acworth beryl revealed the presence of indium , but in less quantity than in Freiberg blende ; and Freiberg blende yields little helium .
The above paragraphs summarise the experimental evidence which I have been able to obtain on this question , without affording any positive answer to it .
It is difficult to find any advantageous ground from which to attack it further .
A few words may be said on some possible explanations:\#151 ; ( 1 ) It may be suggested that these beryls have formerly contained radioactive elements , but that these have now decayed , their transformations being completed .
The objection to this view is that nearly all the evidence we have points to an unalterable rate of radio-active transformation .

] Radio-activity in Rare and Common Minerals .
591 mentioned would require the assumption that beryls generally were much older than other minerals of the earth 's crust .
The circumstances of their occurrence , geologically considered , are not consistent with this assumption .
( 2 ) It may be supposed that the helium found in beryls was not generated in situ at all , but was chemically absorbed or occluded by the material in the course of solidification .
I cannot think this in any way probable .
Other siliceous minerals do not absorb helium in this way , for they contain none that may not be otherwise accounted for .
Nor does anything we know of the properties of helium suggest that it is likely to have a violent preference for beryl .
( 3 ) There may be an unknown element present in beryl which has escaped detection , for want of well marked chemical peculiarities ; and this unknown element may emit a-particles with less than the critical velocity , as suggested in the introduction ( p. 572 ) .
On this double hypothesis the facts would be explained .
But naturally an explanation so speculative has in itself little scientific value .
S 4.\#151 ; Helium and Radio-activity of Ordinary Elements .
The results above recorded are not in favour of the theory that the common elements are perceptibly radio-active .
This seems clear from the following considerations .
It is known that radium , actinium , and thorium* give rise to helium .
There is no evidence which to me , at least , appears convincing that any one of the undoubtedly radio-active bodies does not give rise to it .
Accordingly , we may provisionally regard the formation of helium as a criterion of radio-activity .
It is well known that there is an ionising radiation from the walls of any vessel which ionises the contained air .
The question to be faced is whether any important part of this radiation is of the same nature as the a-rays of radium .
In determining the radium content of galena ( see Table III ) , 200 grammes of the mineral were stored in solution , so as to allow the emanation to accumulate .
The emanation was boiled out and introduced into an electroscope and allowed to form the active deposit .
After this the leak of the electroscope was increased by about one-quarter of its normal amount .
Now this increased leak is of the same order as the total ionising power of the uranium series of bodies present in 200 grammes of the mineral , when exercised freely , without enfeeblement , owing to unproductive absorption of the rays by solids .
The electroscope case was a glass bulb 10 cm .
in diameter , or about 314 sq .
cm .
in area .
As the a-rays are not able to penetrate from a depth of more than * ' Roy .

Helium and [ Apr. 23 , .about 0*004 cm .
, it follows that the total quantity of glass which can come into action in ionising the enclosed air cannot be much more than 314 x 0*004 c.c. , or about 3*5 grammes .
The ionisation produced by this quantity of glass is greater than that produced by the radio-active impurities in 200 grammes of galena .
The normal ionisation in vessels of other common materials is not very different .
It may be concluded that in a mineral like this galena the apparent activity contributed by the common elements ( lead and sulphur ) is at least a hundred times that due to the radio-active impurities .
As these impurities are present in sufficient quantity to account for the helium found , it follows that enormously larger quantities of helium would be expected if the ionising properties of the common elements were really of radio-active origin .
The lists of results which have been given afford many other cases of minerals free enough from radium to emphasise the same conclusion .
There is no indication that the helium ratio increases as the radio-active impurities diminish in amount.* It is evidently of great interest to push the enquiry into possible helium production by common elements as far as possible ; for although their radioactivity seems to be much smaller than might be expected from the ionising power , it is not , for that reason , necessarily non-existent .
I have found that gypsum , rock salt , and the various saline minerals of Stassfurt are for the most part much less contaminated with radium than minerals of any other class .
In most cases helium can scarcely be detected in them ; but in one or two instances results have been obtained which call for further investigation .
It is hoped to complete these experiments shortly .
S 5 .
Presence of Argon and Neon in Minerals .
The interest of this subject has already been referred to .
It has been recorded that siliceous materials in general appear to contain a little argon , and that igneous rocks certainly always do so .
The question now arises of whether the argon is due to radio-active changes , as might appear not improbable from Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Cameron 's results .
It might perhaps be supposed that the conditions of radio-active change were so modified in these materials as to result in the partial substitution of argon for helium .
Upon the whole I do not regard this supposition * It seems likely from the results of MacLennan ( c Phil. Mag./ [ 6 ] , vol. 14 , p. 760,1907 ) and Elster and Geitel , that other samples of galena will be found much less free from radio-active impurities than that which I examined .
For their results point to great variety in the quantities of polonium in various samples of commercial sheet lead .
1908 .
] Radio-activity in Rare and Common Minerals .
593 favourably .
In siliceous minerals like zircon , which are fairly active , the argon content is infinitesimal in comparison with the helium content .
This appears from the experiments already quoted .
Some other experiments , specially directed to this point , which were made before the systematic investigations here recorded , bring it out more clearly : 12*8 c.c. of helium w^as extracted by heating a large quantity of zircon .
The argon contained in this was separated by charcoal cooled in liquid air , and was certainly less than 0*03 c.c. Again , 37*6 c.c. of helium from cyrtolite , another radioactive silicate , contained at most 0*02 c.c. argon .
In these cases , therefore , the argon does not greatly exceed a thousandth part of the helium and may be much less , for the experiments were made before very much experience had been gained , and considerable atmospheric contamination is not improbable .
The quantity of argon in active silicates is not large , * and it may be concluded that it is not connected with their activity .
Similar experiments made with large quantities of helium from monazite , samarskite , and thorianite proved that the argon in these cases did not at most exceed a thousandth part of the helium .
The small quantities of argon in question may , I think , be very well regarded as derived from the atmosphere during the formation of the various minerals .
With regard to neon , the available data are very scanty .
Its presence was , as a rule , masked by helium which , when present in excess , altogether extinguishes the yellow neon line .
The difficulty can be overcome by separation with charcoal in liquid air .
This has not usually been available to me , and carbonic acid cooling does not suffice for the absorption of neon .
In a few cases of igneous rocks , neon has been observed as recorded in a former paper.f I separated spectroscopic traces of neon from the small quantity of argon from zircon and cyrtolite mentioned above .
A letter to 'Nature ' was published to this effect , but in the light of subsequent experience no importance can be attached to the observation .
A very small quantity of air Suffices to bring in the neon spectrum quite distinctly : * It is necessary to refer to a very perplexing case .
The mineral malacone , which is a hydrous silicate of zirconium of considerable activity , was found by Ramsay and Travers ( ' Roy .
Soc. Proc./ vol. 60 , 1897 , p. 444 ) , and subsequently by Kitchen and Winterson ( 'Chem .
Soc. Trans./ vol. 89 , 1906 , p. 1570 ) to contain much argon along with helium .
I have failed altogether to confirm this result .
Several specimens of the mineral ( which came from Hitteroe , Norway ) were examined , they gave nothing but a brilliant yellow helium glow , argon being practically invisible .
I cannot doubt the genuineness of the specimens , for they correspond closely to those from the same locality in the Natural History Museum , South Kensington . .

1 c.c. is ample , and with care 1/ 10 c.c. is enough .
In some other cases I have suspected neon , but can make no positive statement .

Summary of Conclusions .
1 .
Helium can be detected in almost all the minerals of the earth 's crust .
2 .
The quantity is in most cases about what might be anticipated from the traces of uranium and radium which the minerals contain .
This is illustrated by the following selected results , which are given in round numbers only .

Where much higher helium ratios than the above have been observed , the excess of helium can always be connected with the presence of thorium , except in one outstanding case .
Thus the experiments afford no evidence in favour of helium production by radio-activity of ordinary elements .
4 .
The outstanding case is beryl , which contains abundance of helium , without anything approaching a sufficient radio-activity to explain its presence .
This helium cannot be connected with any known constituent of beryl .
5 .
Igneous rocks , and probably siliceous minerals generally , contain small quantities of argon .
In other minerals its quantity is negligible , at all events in comparison with the helium present .
Nor is there any indication that it increases with the amount of radio-active material .
