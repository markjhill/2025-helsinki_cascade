) Introduction .
The cause or causes conditioning arrested development in moist seeds and the nature of the impetus which results in germination are still in most respects obscure .
The problem of the non-germination of maturing seeds while still upon the parent plant and the large range of cases of delayed or non-germination of shed seeds which to all appearances are in good conditions for germination form the basis of this research .
It is to be emphasised that the problem of seed dormancy is not limited to the case of the dry seed .
The more important , but less obvious , conditions of dormancy are those found in moist maturing seeds , and in cases of \#166 ; delayed germination in the presence of sufficient conditions of moisture and temperature .
It is these which have the most interesting analogies in other fields , and an analysis of which may be more fruitful from the point of view of physiology in general .
It is useful at the outset to examine certain conclusions that are being reached by workers who have set themselves to elucidate the processes of similar phenomena in other departments of physiology .
In certain aspects , the latency of the unfertilised ovum offers an analogy with the latency of moist seeds .
In each case the latency is only ended by the onset of definite causes ; in each ease in the absence of these causes the period of latency is sooner or later terminated by death ; and in each case also the sequence of changes that follow the onset of the stimulus is , in a broad sense , physiologically comparable .
The interest of this analogy , moreover , is increased by the prominence which has recently been given to a simple interpretation of the nature of the fertilisation stimulus .
Loeb(l ) has attempted to outline its essential features as follows .
These appear to be , firstly , an acceleration of oxidations which follows destruction by cytolytic agents of a cortical layer in the egg which has .
hitherto prevented oxygen from reaching the surface of the egg and from penetrating into the latter sufficiently rapidly .
Secondly , Loeb believes that an internal change takes place which renders innocuous the toxic products of oxidation .
He shows that the unfertilised matured egg dies soon , and he attributes this to the Influence of Carbon Dioxide in Metc .
, of Seeds .
409 toxic action of products of oxidation , as its life can be prolonged in the absence of oxygen .
Again , it has been a feature of recent work under many aspects to emphasise the action of the ordinary metabolic products of cell life in producing deep functional changes , both normal and abnormal .
The nature of the action of these products is being studied in detail , and it has become clear in certain cases that what appears to be an act of excitatory stimulus producing a certain forward change is in reality the removal of a depressant stimulus normally present which acts as an inhibitant .
Thus , for example , it has been recently shown* that the growth of the mammary glands in a pregnant female is due to a product of foetal growth which acts by overcoming the inhibitory action of a substance which is normally present and prevents the development of these parts .
The case of antithrombin normally present in the blood in sufficient quantities to inhibit the action of any thrombin ferment formed , and so preventing any intervascular clotting , is well known .
The study of immunity affords a very large number of instances of antibodies whose function is the inhibition of the harmful stimulation of poisons .
Czapek ( 3 ) in his work on the anti-ferment reaction in tropistic movements of plants has added another interesting example in this line of discovery .
He \#166 ; demonstrates geotropic stimulation to be accompanied by an accumulation of .
homogentisinic acid due to the action of an antiferment inhibiting its breakdown by oxydase normally present .
In this paper the indicated problem of the dormancy of moist seeds has been attacked from the point of view that dormancy must be conditioned by the absence of an essential stimulus or by the presence of an inhibitory agent .
The two-sided question therefore which is presented at the outset is as follows : What is the nature of the positive stimulus to germination or what is the nature of the inhibition which must be overcome to initiate this process ?
Influence of Carbon Dioxide in Inhibiting the Germination of Moist Seeds .
( a ) Carbon Dioxide Inhibits the Germination of Seeds without Producing Injury.\#151 ; It will be useful to begin with a brief examination of the group of phenomena classed under the term " delayed germination .
" In one class of cases it is known that many seeds do not immediately germinate in nature even when to all appearance placed in optimum germinating conditions .
This is true of a number of native species which remain in the ground during the winter , although freely germinating in the following spring .
In another * By Prof. Starling and Miss E. Lane-Claypon ( 2 ) .
410 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of considerable class of cases the seeds appear to be capable of remaining indefinitely in the ground without germinating , while preserving latent their power of growth under certain conditions , the nature of which does not appear to be clearly understood .
We find the embryos of these latent seeds to be apparently in good germinating conditions , that is , supplied with sufficient water , in an atmosphere containing the normal percentage of oxygen , and at a temperature sufficient for germination .
In a large number of cases of this phenomenon quoted by Nobbe and Hanlein(6 ) , sporadic germination over periods of months , and even years , is a marked feature .
In natural conditions nigra is an example of these cases of delayed germination .
In Sussex it is locally called Kelke , and every farmer and labourer along the northern slope of the South Downs will give examples from his experience of the seeds sprouting in newly ploughed land after they have lain dormant for years , while the land has been under pasture or hay .
In certain of these cases of delayed germination in germinating conditions , non-germination has been shown by Ewart to be accompanied by a lack of water in the embryo due to the impermeability of the testa to water .
These cases do not bear upon our problem .
It is with the range of cases in which a full water supply is demonstrated that interest lies .
So far as explanations .
based on experiment have hitherto been forthcoming for non-germination in these seeds , they have been mainly directed to elucidate this somewhat striking phenomenon from the point of view that the testa is shielding the embryo from a sufficient supply of oxygen .
Crocker ( 5 ) has reached this conclusion from his work upon the upper seeds of Xanthium burrs , which normally do not germinate till after they have lain over one year in the soil .
He found that while at a temperature of 19 ' C. these seeds would not germinate\#151 ; though containing a sufficient supply of H20 and though lying in a normal atmosphere ( .
with a partial pressure of oxygen equal to 150 mm.)\#151 ; germination could nevertheless be immediately induced by removal of the testas .
Recently Shull ( 4 ) , working upon these same seeds , has given us the actual minimum values of oxygen necessary for the germination of the naked embryos .
At a temperature of 21 ' C. the minimum partial oxygen pressure required by them is not more than 12 mm. If we are to adopt Crocker 's view , therefore , that the nongermination of these seeds with the testa intact is due simply to the fact that only a subminimal quantity of oxygen can reach the embryo , we shall have to say that the wet testa is able to reduce the pressure of oxygen in its passage through it from 150 mm. pressure to less than 12 mm. It is conceivable that in the maturation of the seed and in delayed Carbon Dioxide in Matura , etc. , of Seeds .
411 germination under ordinary and special circumstances we may be dealing not with an insufficient oxygen stimulus but with an inhibitory cause or group of causes .
Such a condition might result in the case of the seed if the testa acts in any way as limiting the aeration of the embryo , for we might expect then two results:\#151 ; ( 1 ) A reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo , and ( 2 ) A relative rise in the actual C02 pressure in the embryo tissues .
The crucial question first arises , therefore , as to the actual effect of increased pressures of C02 in the tissues of the embryo .
The experiments which follow have been immediately directed to ascertain in the first place the actual effect of increased pressures of C02 upon the germination of quickly germinating seeds .
Technique of Experiments made to Ascertain the Effect of Increased Partial Pressures of C02 on Germination.\#151 ; In setting these experiments a known quantity of pure silica sand was first introduced into large flasks and saturated with water .
This was done by adding an excess of water and then drawing it off by tipping the flasks .
If this was carefully done the sand was left saturated with water in a layer adhering to the bottom of the flasks .
The seeds were carefully dropped on to this surface by means of a glass tube , and , where necessary , as in the case of larger seeds , a further measured quantity of H20 was added .
The flasks were then stoppered with new rubber corks fitted with one glass tube closed by means of pressure tubing and a pinchcock .
Gases in any proportion desired were now quickly introduced by first withdrawing a quantity of air by an air pump , the amount being read by a pressure gauge .
Where small quantities of C02 were desired up to 6 per cent , of an atmosphere , the operation was performed by means of a specially made apparatus on the model of Hempel 's gas burette , using mercury .
By means of this apparatus very accurately measured amounts of air can be withdrawn and equal lots of C02 introduced .
Bor higher percentages of C02 the air pump was employed .
The artificial atmospheres were for the most part checked by analysis after setting .
The carbon dioxide , oxygen , and nitrogen employed were in all cases from cylinders as supplied by the Carbonic Acid Company and British Oxygen Company .

( b ) The Peculiar Case of White Mustard ( Brassica alba).\#151 ; Brassica alba was peculiar among the seeds experimented on , in that inhibition was continued indefinitely after the removal of the seeds from increased partial pressures of C02 to normal air , and was then only terminated by the treatments described in Tables IV and V. White mustard seeds that have been inhibited by the action of 002 while germinating will lie indefinitely in germinating conditions without sprouting or with sporadic sprouting over long intervals .
They have all the appearance of continued vitality , and they do not become attacked by moulds .
The part played by the testa in securing the continuance of the inhibitory effect of carbon dioxide after the removal of the inhibitory agent is of great interest .
In the following table it will be seen that dormancy produced by C02 was continued for two to three months after removal of the seeds to air , suitable conditions for germination being maintained throughout .
Finally the seeds returned to normal activity and germinated 100 per cent , in every case following the treatments described .

The Controlling Influence of From the above tables of results it is clear that the case of alba seeds is peculiar in that the inhibition extends after the removal of the inhibiting C02 pressures from the atmospheres over the seeds .
This afterinhibition may extend for months accompanied by a sporadic germination .
The presence and condition of the testa seem to be the controlling factors in this after-inhibition .
Germination is at once induced by the removal of the testa or usually by the complete drying of the seed .
( c ) Delayed , Germination in Nature.\#151 ; From these experiments it is clear that a condition is produced in the seeds of white mustard after treatment with increased partial pressures of C02 which very closely parallels that of seeds showing delayed germination in natural conditions .
This fact is brought out more clearly when the results obtained in the laboratory with Brassica alba seeds are compared with the results recorded by Nobbe and Hanlein ( 6 ) as occurring in nature .
These authors give a large number of cases in which they observed indefinitely delayed germination in natural conditions accompanied by the sporadic sprouting of some of the seeds extending over long periods .
A few examples may be given .

A similar result was obtained by these authors with a large number of species .
The following may be mentioned:\#151 ; minimus , Plantago media , Potentilla argentea , Veronica beccabunga , Chenopodium album , Campanula rotundifolia , Campanula The similarity shown in the results obtained wdth the seeds of Brassica alba inhibited under the influence of C02 in artificial conditions to those demonstrated by Nobbe and Hanlein ( 6 ) as occurring in natural conditions is thus very marked .
Again , Crocker ( 5 ) , working on a special case of delayed germination in the upper seed of the burr of Xanthium , which , in contradistinction from the lower seed of the burr , does not germinate in the first year after ripening but in the second , found that by removing the testa he could induce immediate Carbon Dioxide in Maturation , etc. , of Seeds .
417 germination at any time after ripening .
The case of the inhibited seeds of Brassicaalba offers an exact parallel to this case also .
( d ) Experiments Reproducing in Nature , with CO2 Naturally the Results obtained in the Laboratory with Brassica alba Seeds.\#151 ; In drawing the foregoing parallels , a reflection which is suggested is that the inhibition of the Brassica alba seeds has been produced in the laboratory under conditions remote from those found in nature .
The following series of experiments were therefore directed to ascertain whether this objection is valid .
The outcome of these experiments , it will be seen , is to indicate that the results of inhibition under the influence of CO2 obtained in the laboratory with Brassica alba can be readily reproduced in the soil in conditions such as may occur widely in nature .
The method of procedure was as follows:\#151 ; Pits of various depths were dug in a garden soil consisting of sandy loam with very few stones .
Short , fresh-cut grass was spread at the bottom in some cases .
In others , green garden rubbish took the place of grass .
The earth was then returned to the pits , and seeds , enclosed in small cotton-net bags , were inserted in it at various depths .
The CO2 content of the atmosphere of this soil at various depths was taken constantly during the experiments .
The following was a typical experiment:\#151 ; On August 16 , 1912 , a pit 18 inches deep and 2 feet square was dug , a layer of packed green grass about 3 inches deep inserted , and the pit then filled up by the return of the earth removed .
Seven days later , on August 23 , three lots of 25 seeds each were buried at depths of 3 , 6 , and 9 inches in the earth in this pit over the grass .
At the same time three control lots of seeds were placed at corresponding depths in a control pit close by , out of which the earth had been dug , and similarly returned seven days previously , but in which no grass had been placed .
The following are examples of the percentages of CO2 found in samples of soil air taken during the experiment at depths of 6 and 12 inches in the pit containing grass:\#151 ; Per cent. Per cent. August 23 at depth of 6 inches 12*4 C02 ; at depth of 12 inches 18'8 C02 .
" 29 " " 16-5 C02 ; " " 20-0 C02 .
In the earth in the control pit , without grass , the CO2 content of the soil continued steadily at about 1 per cent , at depth of 12 inches .
After seven days in the soil the seeds were removed and examined .
jSTone of those over the pit containing decaying grass had germinated at depths of 6 and 9 inches , while at a depth of 3 inches only 3 out of the 25 seeds had sprouted .
All the seeds of the control lots at each depth in the pit 418 Mr. F. Kidd .

These seeds * The case of heavily dunged land would also suggest itself .
Boussingault and Lewy , in a large series of analyses of soil air , found 10 per cent , of C02 in manured soil 10 days Carbon Dioxide in Matura , etc. , of Seeds .
419 germinated sporadically afterwards , but systematic observations were not made in this first series of experiments as regards the after-behaviour of the inhibited seeds .
A further series was , however , set in which the subsequent behaviour was noted .
In this it was found that the results obtained with seeds inhibited in the soil closely conformed in all respects to the results obtained with those inhibited in laboratory conditions .
In this experiment , which was conducted at a temperature of 5-7 ' C. , and in which the seeds were left in the ground for 16 days , the C02 content in the soil over the buried grass rose from 10 per cent , on the 3rd day to 22 per cent , on the 16th .
No germinations occurred with the Brassica alba seeds placed in the soil over the pit in which grass had been placed .
All the seeds placed in the soil in the control pit without grass vigorously germinated within 10 days .
When the inhibited seeds were removed to normal conditions of germination , 20 per cent , germinated sporadically within the first 10 days .
The remainder were apparently living at the end of two months .
None had been attacked by moulds .
At this stage the testa was removed from a number of the seeds , with the result that germination was immediately induced , as in the laboratory experiments recorded above .
It would appear , therefore , that it is possible to reproduce in natural conditions , which may occur widely in the soil , the results obtained in the laboratory with inhibited Brassica alba seeds .
( e ) Action of the Testa .
Bare Embryos inhibited by Carbon Dioxide.\#151 ; It is desirable now to return to the problem in its original form , in which it was indicated that germination may be due ( 1 ) to the action of a definite stimulus such as would be supplied by the access of oxygen under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature ; or ( 2 ) to the removal of some inhibitory agent which has so far restrained the seed from entering upon the cycle of changes which begins with germination ; or ( 3 ) to an inter-relation of both these causes .
In the experiments with carbon dioxide acting on the seed in germinating conditions so far related , it will be seen that certain partial pressures of C02 have the effect of retarding and inhibiting germination , the seed being capable of resuming growth without any apparent injury on the removal of the depressant .
In the cases dealt with we seem to have two classes of results which must be separated .
In the cases of all the seeds excepting after treatment .
It appears from these results that caution is necessary in placing seed in the ground into which green crops have been ploughed or which has been recently heavily manured .
In some of the experiments with pits described above the partial pressure of C02 in the soil atmosphere over buried grass was found to be as much as 8 per cent , seven months after the green grass had been buried .
420 Mr. F. Kidd .
The Controlling Influence of Brassica alba it seems clear that the C02 has acted directly upon the tissues of the embryo .
On the removal of the C02 the seeds readily germinate .
In the case of Brassica alba the action of the carbon dioxide may have been the same , but on the removal of the C02 from the atmosphere the seeds do not germinate but continue dormant .
A direct action of C02 on the testa , rendering it less permeable to the passage of gases , is suggested .
Such a change in the testa produced by C02 would have two consequences : ( 1 ) a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo , and ( 2 ) a relative rise in the C02 pressure in the embryo tissues .
The possibility thus arises that lack of oxygen produced by a change in the permeability of the testa due to the action of C02 has been the cause of inhibition in all the experiments described .
The following experiment was therefore made with Brassica alba seeds from which the testas had been removed .

The phenomenon of prolonged after-inhibition did not occur in these cases in the absence of the testa .
Further experiments were made with peas and white mustard with similar results .
A conclusion , therefore , which appears to be justified is that , while the inhibiting effect produced on the embryo is the result of the direct action of C02 thereon , in the case of Brassica alba an accompanying change in the testa plays an important part in sealing the seed under the influence of C02 in a special dormant phase of life .
Summary .
Experiments were conducted showing that the germination of seeds is retarded or inhibited by high partial pressures of C02 in the atmosphere .
Carbon Dioxide in Matura , etc. , of Seeds .
421 This retardation or inhibition produced by C02 was shown to be unaccompanied by injury .
The seeds used in these experiments fall into two classes .
In the first class the seeds germinated at once after removal from the inhibitory C02 pressures ( beans , cabbage , barley , peas , onions ) .
In the second class the inhibition continued indefinitely after the removal of the inhibitory C02 pressures , and was terminated only by complete drying and re-wetting , or by the removal of the testa .
In this class a lowering of the degree of permeability of the testa to gases by the action of C02 is indicated , a change which would have two results : ( 1 ) a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo , and ( 2 ) a relative rise in the actual C02 pressure in the embryo tissues .
The condition of prolonged inhibition after removal to air produced in Brassica alba is strikingly suggestive of the condition of seeds often met with in nature , the germination of which is delayed in spite of suitable conditions of temperature and water .
The results obtained in the laboratory with Brassica alba seeds were reproduced in the soil in natural conditions by C02 arising from decaying vegetable matter .
The high C02 content of the soil air in these experiments was found to continue for a considerable period .
Attention was called to the importance of these facts in agriculture .
