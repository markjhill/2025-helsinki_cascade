270 Measurements of Electrical Constants .
[ Mar. 28 , In most insects the field of vision has a small region common to the two eyes in the vicinity of the mouth ; it is chiefly developed in the predatory species , and probably serves in determining the distance of their prey from their mandibles .

First Series .
Communicated by Professor J. Clerk Maxwell , F.R.S. Keceived March 9 , 1878 .
( Abstract .
) The author has , under Professor Clerk Maxwell 's directions , carried out some measurements of specific inductive capacities by a new method .
The essential features of it are :\#151 ; ( 1 .
) It is a zero method .
( 2 .
) The electrified metal plates never touch the dielectrics .
( 8 .
) No permanent strain is produced or charge communicated , as the electrification is reversed some 12,000 times per second .
The potentials of the electrified plates were about equal to that of 2,000 cells .
The following are the results obtained:\#151 ; The solid dielectrics were plates 7 inches square , and from f inch to 1 inch thick .

He discusses this question at some length in his ' paper.f An expression of thanks to Professor Maxwell , for his close superintendence of the work , concludes the paper .

" On the Placentation of the Apes , with a Comparison of the Structure of their Placenta with that of the Human Female .
" By William Turner , M.B. Lond. , F.R.S. , Professor of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh .
Received March 11 , 1878 .
( Abstract .
) The introductory chapter of this memoir consists of a summary of the observations of John Hunter , Rudolphi , Breschet , Owen , Huxley , Rolleston , Ercolani , and Kondratowicz , on the form and structure of the placenta in the apes .
The author then gives a detailed description of his dissection of the gravid uterus and placenta of a Macacus cyno-molgus well advanced in pregnancy .
He then enters into a detailed comparison between the form and structure of the placenta in the ape and that of the human female , in the course of which he records a number of original observations on the structure of the human placenta .
Attention is more especially drawn to .
the comparative structure of the decidua vera and serotina ; to the prolongations of the decidua serotina into the interior of the placenta ; to the arrangement , structure , and mode of origin of the intra-chorionic and sub-chorionic cells ; to the arrangement of the arteries and veins of the placenta ; * I cannot vouch , for the exact accuracy of this determination , as the method of experimenting on liquids is not yet quite perfected .
