Abstract Qf a Register of the Baromeler Thermowzeter , and Rain ?
at Lylldon , in Rutland .
By Thomas Barker , Esq. ; with the Rain in Surrey and Hampshirefor the Cear 179I .
Comnlunicated by Thonlas White ?
Esq ; F. R S. Read June 14 , ty92 .
THE year began , as the last ended , with frost , but in a week 's timethe stormy wet uteather returned , and , in some places , with thutlder ; but it gradually grew better , and by the middle Of February there was a good deal of filae and pleasant weather , and , except a few frosty days and north svinds the end of that month and beginning of Marcll , the forluer part of spring was finer than usual ; few NW winds , and tho , se not so cold as they often are : chiefly dry in March ; a good seed time , and a showery , warm , or almost hot , greater part of April , brougilt things on a great pace ; and there was more grass at the end of that month than there sometimes is at the end of May .
But the two last days of April were colder ; frequent frosty mornitags , and cold NO winds in Mays which being chiefly dry , the grass began to burn at the end of it ; but there had been so much early grass that there was no want .
The summer was a very uncertain one , sometimes very hot , at other times remarkably cold ; and sharp frosty mornings the middle of June , with a little hailX and some sai(l snow ; killed , or near it , many tender sutumer plants ; and there were very fiew natural ground cucumbers this year , but it was dry and burning at the end of the month .
tlnhe weather was also very different in different countries : in the east and south-east parts of England they compIained of a five-months drought ; in this country , though the ground burned sometimes , as at the end of Mays and the begillning and end of June , yet the grass had got so forsrard itl-Apri ] tIlat with some raill at times , our groud-was never bare ; and fits of showery weather , and some great rains , made plenty of latter grass and turnips .
At Selbournn April , May , and June , were rather dry , but there was so much rain at the beginning and exld of the year , and al : the middle of it , in July , that there was a lrery great quantity up-on the whole .
: The crop of hay was small , but well got ; the wheat remarkably goodS and barley proved better than was expected ; other sorts of graln were moderaten and , in general hararest wras well got .
The latter part of sururner and the auturnn were very fine and pleasant , and sometinzes hot ; generally dry , so as rather terlding to burn , the lbeginning of October ; lbut before the middle it began to ke wetter , and after the middle more stormy , and grew colder , with frosty mornings , cutting oflF the latfe flowers ; and it continued wet the rest of October , and all Nvvembers and stormy in November and December ; which last month was a very disagreeable one , for storns , snow- , and frost , and sometimes all at once ; and that almost the whole nlonth , for a snow and se+7ere frost , which beg ; all the third though with several thawing days , was hardly quite gone by the end of the year : there was but little of this frost and snow in the south of England .
Of vtiiking Ewes .
We fiXld itl the Greek and Roman writers , and also by some passages in the Bible , that it was the custom , in former timesy to milk ewbes as well as cows ; and , perhaps , -it may better be flone in those hotter climates tlulan in England ; yet I find it spoken of as having been practised in this island many years ago TUSSER , when li:ved in Suffolk , and was a young maU in EDWARD the VIth 's time -(see his life at the elld of his work ) , mentions it as used ln his time , and he approved of doing so , as appears by the following quotations from his bookS en titled , Five hundred Poirlts of good Husbandry Mayvs ilbslract.\#162 ; Put lamb from enTe ; To milk a fewB s ; Be not too bold &lt; ; To milk and to fold .
C ; Five ewes allow g ' To every cowo May 's Husbandry .
sc At PHILIP and JACOB away with the lambss " That thinkest to have any milk of their dams .
s ; At I : &gt; arrzbas leave milking , for fear of a thingp &lt; Lest requiem gternam in winter they Sing .
" To milk and to fold them is uluch to requires " Except ye have pasture to fill their desire , sc Yet many by milkingj such heed they do taket sc Not hurting their bodies , much profit do makes cs Five ewes to a cow , make proof by a scoret c ; Shall double thy dairyn else trust me no more .
eC Yet 1nay a good huswife , t}at knoweththe skillt - &lt; ; Have mixed or urlmixt at her pleasure and will*'9 lIe says iive ewes will give as mu-ch milk as one cow ; and they used the milk sometimes mixed with cowws milk , and sometimes separate .
Ewes sllc &gt; uld llot be milked too freely , unless they have good pasture ; but with prudent lnanagements a profit sn--ay be made of milking them ; and he is for doing MDGCXCIIV $ B it from May-day till Lammas , but not longer } for fear of killv ing them .
As he seembs to halre been bred a singing boy at Wallingford , the requiem ternam probably refers to some hymn he there sang .
BuL , I suppose , this method of milking ewes was not found to answer UpOll the whole , for it -is left off itl England llosr .
I never was in any part of it where it is practised at prsesent ; thougltl by the increase of enclosure , and sowing of seeds , we have better pasture for otlr ewes than TUSSER had .
I thirlk it must be very bad for the latubs to be weaned at May-day , , which is often before the grass ; s fully come , though his lambs were earlier than ours ; for it appears in -his January\#171 ; s Husbandry , that the ewes were about Iatnbing then , whereas ours do not come till Lady-day .
We do not vean our cade-lanhs till June , in the height of summer , and then they are not so g ; ood as those which go with ewes till the latter end of August .
Not ; e. The foregoing Register contained also some account of the earthquake of Bebruary 25 ; but as an account of it is already given by Mr , BARKBR , in Mr. Tutt NOR'S paper on the E ; arthquakes it is itted here\#162 ;
