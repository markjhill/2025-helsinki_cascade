( Abstract .
) The paper contains an application of the analysis used by M , Poincare , in his memoir " Sir l'equilibre d'une mass fluide animee dun mouvement de rotation , " * to the determination of the free I oscillations of a system consisting of a fluid mass contained within a rigid ellipsoidal envelope , rotating about one of its principal axes , t ia found that , when such a system is oscillating in one of its undamental modes , the disturbances of the fluid are all expressible I means of Lame functions , the functions involved being all of the j order ; and a method of obtaining the frequencies of these ijj OScblations , similar to that used by M " Poincare for a fluid ellipsoid with a free surface , is given .
he oscillations , however , which involve Lame functions of the ^econd order , demand exceptional treatment in consequence of the p'.C t at these alone imply any disturbance of the containing shell .

300 Oscillations of a Rotating Shell containing fluid .
[ pe^ problem in hand , enables ns to determine an expression for the | pressure at all points on the boundary in terms of the disturbance communicated to the shell .
From this , the couples on the shellj cl^g k to the fluid pressure , are estimated and introduced into the dynamical j equations of motion of the shell .
A frequency equation of the 6th degree is derived , apparently involving three fundamental modes 1 of oscillation .
The equation , however , is found to be satisfied by the I frequency of rotation of the system , and the corresponding oscillation I is shown not to be real but to arise ( analytically ) only in consequence I of the motion of the axes of reference .
We are left with two fundamental modes .
The case where the inertia of the shell is negligible , compared with that of the fluid , is of analytical interest , and can be approxi-mately realised physically by means of a liquid gyrostat ( 'Nature , ' vol. 15 , p. 297 ) mounted in such a way that its centre of gravity is j held at rest .
When the axis of rotation is an axis of symmetry , the roots of the frequency equation will be real , and the motion therefore stable , either when this axis is the least axis , or when it exceeds three times the equatorial radius .
When , however , the figure is not one of revolution , the analytical conditions of stability are not so simply expressible , but they will always be satisfied when the axis of rotation is the least axis , or when it exceeds three times either of the other axes .
On taking into account the inertia of the shell , the discussion is confined to the case where the ellipsoid is approximately spherical , and the solutions of the frequency equation then assume a simple form .
Of the two modes of oscillations , the motion of the shell in one is analogous to the motion of a rigid body when slightly disturbed from a motion of rotation about a principal axis , but the period is found to be shorter than it would be were the fluid solidified ; the other exists only in consequence of the contained fluid .
The former of these presents the greater interest .
It has been supposed that if the axis of rotation of the earth were displaced from its axis of figure , an oscillatory motion would ensue which would give rise to a variation in the latitude of places on the earths surface in a period of 305 days .
Recent observations ( vide Chandler , ' Astronomical Journal , ' vols .
11 , 12 ) have proved that such an oscillation is taking place , but that the theoretical estimate of the period is considerably too short .
This paper was undertaken with the object of investigating whether the extension of the period could be explained by supposing that the earth possessed a fluid interior , accordance with a suggestion made by M. Folie ( ' Acta Mathematics , vol. 16 ) .
It is shown that the hypothesis of a fluid interior lea\lt ; ^ to a result directly opposite to that which observation requires , aI1 that , therefore , the discovery of the variations of latitude so far from 1895 .

301 establishing the existence of a fluid interior , as supposed by M. Folly , rather affords an additional reason for discarding this hypothesis . .

( Abstract .
) Before entering on the discussion of the Abelian system of differential equations , I treat of some general algebraic theorems haring reference to the differences of various sets of " facients , " and give a wider definition to the term " source , " hitherto used to signify the source of a covariant , and treat of two operators , and A. I then show how , by forming what I call a " square-matrix , " all the conditions can be obtained which are fulfilled when a polynomial f(2 ) of the degree 2 nin zis a perfect square .
With regard to these conditions , I remark that any one of them being given all the others can be found by successive operations of the operator 8 .
I next treat of the system of differential equations termed 'Abelian , " in which there are m quantities and m\#151 ; 1 equations , comprehended in the typical form S where 2 relates to the m quantities zu ... .
