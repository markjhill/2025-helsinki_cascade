The fact that lead and zinc , and bismuth and zinc do not alloy together in every proportion is well known , but there have been , we believe , no determinations made as to the extent in which these metals alloy with each other .
The following experiments were made to ascertain quantitatively what amount of zinc will dissolve in lead and bismuth , and , on the other hand , the amount of bismuth and lead in zinc .
The metals* were fused in a Hessian crucible over a 4-Bunsen burner , stirred with a tobacco-pipe stem for a quarter of an hour , and then allowed to remain quiet for half an hour in a fused state : during the whole time a jet of gas was directed on the surface of the melted metals .
They were after this cast in a porous cell , which had been previously heated to redness in a large crucible filled with sand .
It was generally about two hours before the metals became solid : in some cases the crucible was placed in a furnace with a low fire so as to cool much slower , but the separation of the metals did not appear to be more perfect than when cooled in the usual manner .
When cold the cell was broken , and the top of the alloy separated from the lower part by a blow of the hammer .
The weight of each casting was about 300 grms. , its height about 100 millims. , and its diameter about 25 millims. Lead Zinc Alloys .
The Zinc-end.-About 12 grins .
were taken from the middle of the end , avoiding the outside .
The greater part of the zinc was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid , the residue dissolved in nitric acid and precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen ; the washed sulphide oxidized by fuming nitric acid , and the lead weighed as sulphate .
Or , instead of precipitating by sulphuretted hydrogen , the mixed nitrates were precipitated by ammonia and carbonate of ammonia , and the lead weighed as oxide .
The Lead-end.--8 grms. were dissolved in nitric acid , precipita ted by sulphuretted hydrogen , the filtrate evaporated almost to dryness , and again treated with sulphuretted hydrogen ; the zinc then thrown down by carbonate of soda and weighed as oxide .

The Bismuth-end.-About 3 grms. were dissolved in nitric acid , evaporated with hydrochloric acid to destroy the nitric acid , precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen , evaporated almost to dryness , and again treated with sulphuretted hydrogen ; the zinc was lastly precipitated by carbonate of soda and weighed as oxide .
The analyses marked ( * ) were made in the following manner:-The alloy was dissolved in nitric acid , diluted with water , and the bismuth precipitated by ammonia and carbonate of ammonia .
The bismuth was filtered off and washed with a mixture of 10 parts water , 2 of ammonia , and 1 of carbonate of ammonia .
The filtrate was mixed with carbonate of soda in excess , and evaporated down on a water-bath in a platinum dish ; when dry , it was moistened with water and again evaporated to dryness in order to drive off the last traces of ammoniacal salts .
The dry mass was then washed into a beaker , made slightly acid , boiled , and whilst boiling precipitated by carbonate of soda : the zinc was weighed as oxide .
The Zinc-end.-About 12 grms. were taken , the zinc partly dissolved out by dilute hydrochloric acid , the residue dissolved in nitric acid , and precipitated by ammonia and carbonate of ammonia : the bismuth was weighed as oxide .

16050 , 0-430 , , 240 , , From the foregoing analyses , it appears that lead will , under the conditions detailed above , dissolve only 1*6 per cent. zinc , and zinc 1*2 per cent. lead ; that zinc will only dissolve 2'4 per cent. , bismuth 8-6-14-3 per cent. If we now take equal parts of lead and zinc , fuse them together , stir them well , and cool the alloy rapidly , we may regard such an alloy as a mechanical mixture of solutions of 1-2 per cent , lead in zinc , and 1'6 per cent. zinc in lead .
And the same may be said of the bismuth-zinc alloys when fused together in proportions greater than those in which these metals dissolve in one another .
