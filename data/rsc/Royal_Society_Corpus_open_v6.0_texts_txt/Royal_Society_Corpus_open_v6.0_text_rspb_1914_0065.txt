) In the previous communication on this subject , in which the behaviour of Lipase towards ethereal salts generally was discussed , it has been argued that the enzyme is specially fitted to determine the hydrolysis of the insoluble , oily , glyceric salts of the higher fatty acids but is not suited to act in aqueous solutions : we expressed the opinion that interaction must be supposed to take place at and between surfaces separated only by a thin film of water at most\#151 ; in other words , that water in excess is inimical to the occurrence of change .
The results we advanced , in conjunction with those deduced from the study of other enzymes , notably urease , also led us to conclude that it is impossible to apply the laws of mass action directly to the interpretation of the changes effected by Lipase .
Previously we have directed our attention only to the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme : numerous observations are on record which prove that , whether of animal or vegetable origin , it can act reversibly but no comparative study of the two processes has been made hitherto in the case of fats.* * ( 1 ) Kastle and Lowenhardt , 'Amer .

In view of present ignorance of the manner in which fats are formed in the organism and the desirability of determining the extent to which their synthesis can be effected , under various conditions , we have carried out a series of parallel experiments to ascertain the limits within which the two opposing changes take place in presence of different proportions of the interacting substances and of water .
In the first series of synthetic experiments , 4*84 grm. of the fatty acids from olive oil ( the amount equivalent to 5 grm. of the oil ) was used , in each case , together with the quantity ( 053 grm. ) of anhydrous glycerol that would be required if the whole of the fatty acid were to be converted into triglyceride .
The acid and glycerol were weighed into a 50-c.c .
Jena glass flask together with 05 grm. of the enzyme preparation and 0'5 c.c. of toluene .
The flasks were closed with rubber stoppers and kept slowly rotating in an incubatorf maintained at 30 ' C. during the times stated .
Alcohol was then added and the residual acid titrated with a normal solution of caustic soda .
Each determination was made in duplicate and control experiments were carried out simultaneously with a preparation that had been boiled with water to destroy the activity of the enzymes .
The results are given in the following table:\#151 ; Table I.\#151 ; Synthesis of Fat from three Molecular Proportions of Acid to one of Glycerol .

To discover whether a true equilibrium had been reached or whether the action had ceased owing to the destruction of the enzyme , 05 grm. ot enzyme was added to the system after the expiration of 24 hours and the mixture was titrated at the end of a second period of 24 hours .
Experiments were also made in which 05 and 1 grm. of the enzyme were allowed to act during 48 hours before titrating the residual acid .

Further evidence that a true equilibrium had been reached was obtained on hydrolysing olive oil by the theoretical minimum amount of water , i.e. three molecular proportions to each molecular proportion of triglyceride or 5 grm. of oil and 0'53 grm. of water , quantities equivalent to those used in the synthetic experiments .
As in the reverse case , the equilibrium was quickly reached and the acidity of the system was approximately the same as that observed in the experiments in the reverse direction .

The effect of glycerol on the synthetic action is similar to that of water on the hydrolytic change , the equilibrium point being so shifted that more acid is removed from the system .
Excess of glycerol retards the rate of change in a very noticeable manner .
The amounts of acid which entered into combination in a mixture of 4'82 grm. of fatty acid and T06 grm. of glycerol , i.e. three molecular proportions of acid to two of glycerol , are shown in the following table .

2 29 '8 30 -9 4 11 -o 12-6 The results of the experiments described are summarised in Graphs 1 , 2 and 3 , the synthetic observations in Graph 1 , the hydrolytic in Graph 2 , the parallel series of observations in the two opposite directions in Graph 3 .
The manner in which water affects both the rate of the change and the extent to which this takes place in one or the other direction is brought out in a very striking manner in these diagrams : it will be noticed especially how much less rapid is the approach , both from the hydrolytic and the synthetic side , to an equilibrium as the amount of water present is increased .
Whilst the retardation of the hydrolytic change must be ascribed to a direct interference of the water , which presumably prevents the enzyme and the oil from coming into effective contact , the retardation of change in the opposite direction , especially the diminution of the extent to which synthesis takes place , must be ascribed rather to the withdrawal of glycerol from the system through its dissolution in the water : in this connexion , it is remarkable that synthesis is not entirely prevented even by the presence of thirty molecular proportions of water to one of glycerol , whilst in absence of an excess of water , an excess of glycerol beyond two molecular proportions has but little effect in increasing the proportion of fat synthesised .

In so far as our results can be brought into comparison with those of previous workers , they appear to be in harmony with their observations : but the activity of the enzyme we have had at our disposal , thanks to Tanaka 's important discovery , appears to have been in excess of that used by others .
As it was obvious that if the limit reached in our synthetic experiments ( about 40 per cent , when equivalents are used ) were to be exceeded , the water produced in the interaction must be removed as it is formed , we endeavoured to secure this end by carrying out the synthesis vacuo in a flask connected with drying apparatus .
The results obtained have been uniformly unsatisfactory , inferior , in fact , to those obtained under ordinary conditions .
Apparently , as pointed out by us previously , the intervention of a film of water is necessary at the interface of the system , where interaction takes place ; if this be removed , action comes to an end .
In working with the Tanaka preparation , it is noticeable that the activity varies considerably , in a manner which is difficult to understand at first .
On more than one occasion we have found that an enzyme which was quite active hydrolytically was inert when used as a synthetic agent with a mixture of acid and glycerol free from water : ultimately , this behaviour was traced to " overdrying , " as on the addition of a very small amount of water the enzyme became active .
Enzyme which has been used and then recovered , by washing it free from oily matter by means of light petroleum , is found , as a rule , to be still active but usually less active than it was originally : the variable behaviour of such preparations is not surprising , however , in view of the colloid nature of the material and the effect which alterations in the state of aggregation and of surface conditions must have .
It is noteworthy that the hydrolytic activity\#151 ; in presence of a relatively large excess of water\#151 ; of the enzyme is much more reduced by such treatment than the synthetic activity .
Nature of the Products of Change.\#151 ; In order to ascertain whether the product of the synthetic action of Lipase is a nearly pure triglyceride like the natural fats and oils , the amount of glycerol uncombined in each experiment of the first series was determined , following the directions given by Lewkowitsch .
After titration , the contents of each flask was washed into an evaporating basin , boiled to expel most of the alcohol and then just acidified by sulphuric acid .
After heating the liquid to the boiling point , the solution of glycerol was filtered off and the fatty acids and enzyme on the filter were then well washed with hot water : the filtrate was purified by addition of a solution of basic lead acetate and the glycerol estimated in the clear filtrate by Hehner 's method ( oxidation by an acid solution of potassium bichromate ) .

The method is probably one which is affected with a considerable error , so that the results have only qualitative significance .

In the same manner , estimations were made of the amount of glycerol liberated on hydrolysing olive oil by the enzyme in presence of 24 molecular proportions of water .
It was found that , at first , the acids liberated were slightly in excess of the glycerol , an indication that a small quantity of a lower glyceride was formed : but as the action continued , the whole molecule was hydrolysed .

Some of the product of the interaction of the acids from olive oil with an excess of glycerol was isolated by evaporating off the alcohol after neutralising the unchanged acid and extracting the soap solution with ether .
About Studies on Enzyme Action .
18 grm. of a pale yellow oil was thus obtained , which became turbid on standing , slowly clearing again on heating to 30 ' C. The saponification value of this oil was 183*5 , that of the olive oil used being 191*7 ; on acetylation the saponification number was increased to 248*7 , the " acetyl value " being 78*6 .
These data favour the assumption that the oil contained a high proportion of diolein .
It is obvious , however , that no final conclusion is possible until experiments have been made with definite acids and the products have been isolated and characterised .
In view of our results , we venture to call attention to several directions in which the fats now deserve renewed attention .
Our knowledge of the manner in which they are absorbed and utilised under vital conditions is at present very vague in character and much of the evidence on which reliance is placed appears to be open to question .
It is generally believed that , when ingested , fat is rapidly hydrolysed , under the influence of the pancreatic secretion and that derived from certain tracts of the intestine , this change being regarded as a necessary preliminary to its passage through the walls of the villi prior to entry into the circulatory system .
Lipase appears to be widely distributed throughout the organism .
Apparently , whenever fat is to be transferred across cell membranes , it is hydrolysed : assisted by the emulsifying influence of the biliary fluid , the fatty acid that is liberated during digestion of fatty food can penetrate tissues that are impermeable to the fat but it is held that on entry into the villi the fatty acids are rapidly re-associated with glycerol and pass into the lacteals as fat .
In fact , all fat that is stored is supposed to be fat that has been reconstituted from fatty acids .
In the normal heart and other tissues , however , the fatty acids are not present as glycerides but apparently are combined in such a way that their histological behaviour is different from that of fats\#151 ; the discriminative staining agents being without effect in such cases .
If the vital mechanism be such that only fatty acids can pass through , it is clear that in presence of lipase fats would undergo complete hydrolysis readily , under natural conditions , if the acids were removed as they were liberated , as reversal would be prevented .
Our observations appear to show that hydrolysis would be most rapid in presence of a minimum amount of water ; they therefore favour the conclusion that conditions which would tend to reduce the concentration of the cell fluid would promote the conservation of fat \#151 ; a conclusion which is perhaps applicable in explanation of the obesity which apparently is a frequent consequence of the indulgence in large quantities of weak alcoholic fluids such as Lager beer .
VOL. lxxxviii.\#151 ; b. p 188 Prof. H. E. Armstrong and Mr. H. W. Gosney .
But in view of our observation that under 40 per cent , of fatty acid is convertible into fat , even when no water is present , it is difficult to understand how the fatty acids are completely reconverted unless there he some mechanism whereby the fat is separated from the fatty acid as it is formed_ or some means by which the acid is held in abeyance until it is required .
May it not be that the clue is afforded by the observations above referred to with reference to the presence of fat in the tissues in a cryptic form ?
Lipase apparently is a " carboxylase " which has the power of determining the hydrolysis of the ethereal salts of all the very weak carboxylic acids and , within limits , is more effective the less soluble the acid and the alcohol from which the salt is derived ; presumably , the argument applies equally to the synthetic activity of the enzyme .
It is therefore probable that , under the influence of lipase , fatty acid may become associated with hydroxylic centres in the protoplasmic complex and that such withdrawal may be the cause of its cryptic existence in muscular tissue .
The effect on health of an absence of fat from the diet , to which Arctic travellers have called attention , is noteworthy from this point of view .
Stefansson , in his recent book ' My Life with the Eskimo , ' * states that the symptoms that result from a diet of lean meat are practically those of starvation ; during the winter period , even when gorged with caribou meat free from fat , he and his party felt continually hungry ; the dogs , though they got more meat than dogs usually get , were nothing but skin and bones .
Previously , when they had lived practically on oil alone , taking a teacupful of oil a day , there were no symptoms of hunger ; they grew each day sleepier and more slovenly , he says , but at the end of their meal of long-haired caribou skin ( to give bulk ) and oil felt satisfied and at ease .
On the assumption that fat is not always laid down as such but frequently reconstructed in situ , the presence of glycerol in the necessary amount at the seats of synthesis has to be accounted for .
Owing to the solubility of this substance , it cannot well be supposed that , when fat is hydrolysed , the fatty acid and glycerol always remain together in the required proportions : it is more probable that the glycerol becomes separated from the acid to a greater or less extent and that the deficit is derived from carbohydrate : it is on this account , at least in part , perhaps , that it is desirable that a certain minimum ratio should be preserved between fat and carbohydrate in our food .

Studies on Enzyme Action .
[ Note added June 18.\#151 ; In a communication which came to our notice only when the work we have described was completed Bournot ( 15 ) has called attention to the activity'of the lipase present in the seeds of the common Celandine , a papaveraceous plant .
Having been able , through the courtesy of Messrs. Parke , Davis and Co. , to obtain a sample of the seed , we have contrasted its activity with that of our lipase and have confirmed Bournot 's statement that it is not necessary to treat the seed with acid to render it active .
According to Bournot , Chelidonium lipase differs from Ricinus lipase in being most active in a neutral medium , even 1ST/ 50 acid having an inhibitory effect .
But as is shown in Part II , when once liberated from its zymogen Ricinus lipase is also sensitive to acid : in our experience , it has maximum activity when the acidity does not exceed that of oleic acid .
The enzymes from the two sources both hydrolyse and synthesise glyceric oleate with about the same ease and give rise to mixtures similar in composition at the equilibrium point .
But weight for weight , the Tanaka Ricinus preparation is less active than Chelidonium seed ( free from oil ) in effecting the synthesis of isoprimary butylic oleate .
Thus in an experiment in which 41 per cent , of the acid was combined by the agency of the Ricinus enzyme , about 80 per cent was etherified by seed .
Apparently , the alcohol has a specially marked effect on the Ricinus preparation , as olive oil is hydrolysed only to a small extent in presence of a molecular proportion of isobutylic alcohol to one of the oleate .
Similarly , on hydrolysing isobutylic oleate , whereas , in presence of a single molecular proportion of water , 9-3 per cent , of change was effected in 17 hours by the Chelidonium enzyme , the Ricinus preparation caused only 2'4 per cent , of change .
The difference was less marked on using 10 times as much water , as 167 per cent , was hydrolysed by the one and 13D per cent , by the other " enzyme " : in this case , the effect of the alcohol was reduced apparently by the presence of the excess of water .
In our opinion , such differences as are observed are to be regarded , provisionally at all events , as consequences of differences in the " condition " of the enzyme in the different seeds .
At present , as it is impossible to arrive at any estimate of the " concentration " of an enzyme or to allow for differences in its distribution , we cannot well make any valid comparison of the enzymes of like function derived from different sources .
