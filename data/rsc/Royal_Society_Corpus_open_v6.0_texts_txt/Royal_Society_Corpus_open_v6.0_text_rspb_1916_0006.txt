) Although the conception that , under conditions favouring heat loss , the warm-blooded animal endeavours to maintain its body temperature by increasing the quantity of material oxidised dates back to Crawford and Lavoisier , it received but little attention until examined by Liebermeister ( 1 , 2 ) in the sixties .
Liebermeister 's experiments did not carry conviction to his contemporaries , and even when confirmed by Sanders Ezn ( 3 ) , and by Rohrig and Zuntz ( 4 ) , were not met with universal acceptance ( 5 ) .
Further experiments by Pfliiger ( 6 ) and his pupils tended to put the matter beyond doubt , and not alone the existence but the normal activity of such a mechanism was finally established by Herzog Carl Theodor in a careful and prolonged series of observations on a single animal .
Yoit ( 8 ) , in whose laboratory these last experiments were conducted , gives an account of the early literature .
Since then Rubner ( 9 ) especially has devoted attention to this increased combustion , especially studying the manner in which it is influenced by food , growth of fur , and the like .
Though the chemical heat regulation , as Rubner names it , has from this point of view been thoroughly investigated , the mechanism by which its activity is excited has attracted but little attention .
Liebermeister ( 2 ) , it is true , formulated clearly a theory , according to which the increased production of CO2 in a cold bath is proportional to the extent to which the skin has been cooled below a certain normal point and since his time it has been customary to attribute chemical heat regulation to a temperature reflex from the skin to the muscles ( for example , Rubner ) .
The rapid onset of chemical regulation on exposure to cold ( Pembrey , 10 ) makes some such peripheral mechanism probable , but the theory has never been experimentally tested , and is not altogether without opposition .
Some would attribute chemical temperature regulation in part ( 11 ) or exclusively to a cooling of the brain , a view which has received recent prominent support from the experiments of Barbour ( 12 , 13 ) .
This lack of adequate investigation is perhaps to some extent due to the belief unnecessarily placed on the experiments of Rumpf(14)\#151 ; for example , Krehl ( 15)\#151 ; that in the anaesthetised animal regulation is distorted beyond recognition , thus considerably reducing the possibilities of experiment .
VOL. lxxxix.\#151 ; b. s Mr. J. M. O'Connor .
Having found ( 16 ) that , in the cat anaesthetised with urethane , the physical heat regulation was in part under the control of the skin temperature , I have endeavoured to find if , under similar conditions , the existence of the mechanism suggested by Liebermeister could be experimentally demonstrated .
The animal , cat or rabbit , was anaesthetised with l\#163 ; -2 grm. per kilogramme urethane , and , as a routine , a thermometer or thermocouple introduced deep into the rectum , and two others pushed under the skin at either side .
A tracheal cannula was inserted , the thorax opened , and the cannula connected up with an apparatus for artificial respiration , permitting measurement of the Og consumption in short periods after the fashion of Kegnault and Reiset .
This apparatus ( fig. 1 ) consisted of a mercury pump A , driving and sucking air round in a circuit of rubber tubing under the control of mercury valves , so that , on the down stroke of the pump , the air , having passed through the first valve B , distended the lungs directly connected with the circuit by the tracheal cannula at C , and then forced its way through a wash bottle D , filled with strong potash solution , where the excreted carbon dioxide was absorbed .
Beyond this and before the .
second valve L the circuit communicated through a two-way tap with either of two graduated gas burettes ( 200 c.c. ) , F and G , counterpoised by the arrangement H over acidulated water .
A small trap M was introduced between the trachea and the circuit to catch any secreted mucus or condensed water , and by means of two tubes O and P across the circuit , furnished with simple taps , the valves could be thrown out of action , equalising the gas pressure throughout the apparatus .
Observations were started as follows : Oxygen was run through the apparatus , and the two-way tap E turned so that one burette was in communication with the air circuit , the tracheal cannula of the animal , on which the preliminary operations had been performed , connected up with the apparatus , and the motor driving the pump put in action .
The second burette was filled with O2 from the gasometer and the quantity read off .
After a few minutes the pump was held at the top of its stroke by an assistant , and a stop-watch started .
The taps on the bye-passes O and P were opened , throwing all the valves out of action , the burette in connection with the circuit drawn up so as to cause complete collapse of the lungs , and then brought back so that atmospheric pressure prevailed within the apparatus .
The two-way tap was turned to bring the other burette inta connection , the bye-passes closed , and pump restarted .
The whole occupied about 10 seconds , and , normally , did not produce the slightest sign of asphyxia .
When the burette was nearly exhausted , the other having been On the Mechanism of Chemical Temperature Regulation .
203 refilled with oxygen , the same process was again gone through with the modifications of noting the time to the nearest second when the pump was stopped and the reading of the burette .
The differences between the two I readings of the burette give the oxygen consumed in the time .
After each observation the temperatures of the rectum , the skin , and the water of the bath in which the animal was placed , were entered in the protocol .
As owing to the changing temperature of the animal the temperature of I To Excentric To Gasometer Fig. 1 .
the air in the lungs necessarily varied , no effort was made to keep the temperature of the air in the apparatus under control .
But as the volume of the apparatus was reduced to a miminum\#151 ; about 300 c.c. at the middle stand Of the burette\#151 ; the error due to changing temperature or pressure was very small in proportion to quantities of gas ( oxygen ) consumed .
The pump gave a circuit of about 65 c.c. for each downstroke of the pump\#151 ; thirteen to the minute\#151 ; which proved an efficient ventilation for rabbits up to 2*5 kgrm .
Th'e oxygen in the apparatus was never found below 35 per cent. S 2 Mr. J. M. O'Connor .
and the carbon dioxide never rose above 1 per cent. The airtightness of the apparatus without disconnecting the animal was tested after each experiment .
If in an experiment the beginning of which I have described the animal be left exposed to the room temperature or put in a bath of say 25 ' G. it shivers violently .
This shivering can he seen in the animal without any artificial respiration , but under the conditions of the experiment , provided the ventilation be efficient , is much more pronounced .
It is especially marked during the down strokes of the pump .
If the temperature of the bath be now gradually raised , the temperatures of the subcutaneous tissue and rectum gradually follow and the shivering becomes noticeably less .
The oxygen consumption plotted against the average rectal temperature for these periods gives no constant relation .
When , however , the temperatures have risen above a certain point\#151 ; always less than the normal temperature of the animal \#151 ; shivering stops completely , and from this point on the oxgyen consumption is within limits directly proportional to the rectal temperature , just as it is in the cold-blooded animal ( Schultz , 17 ) .
If now this line be extrapolated into the region in which the animal was shivering and the figures obtained be deducted\#151 ; they are always less\#151 ; from the observed consumption of oxygen .at various rectal temperatures , the difference plotted against the corresponding average skin temperatures gives approximately a straight line .
In other words the " extra O2 " consumed during shivering is proportional to the extent ito which the subcutaneous temperature has fallen below a fixed point .
The gradient of this extrapolated line varies in different animals .
It tends to cut the abscissa at a point between about 19 ' and 29 ' , resembling the steep portion of Schultz 's curve ( see C. S. Martin , 18 ) .
Fig. 2 gives as an example one of many experiments done .
Considering the necessary inaccuracies of the observations all accumulating in the final result , the regularity\#151 ; apart from three outstanding figures\#151 ; is sufficiently striking .
The lowering of the skin temperature therefore produces an activity of the muscles which is accompanied by , or we may say without prejudice results from , muscular activity .
This muscular activity as indicated usually takes the form of a fine incoordinate shiver ; but it is not always so .
Occasionally in the rabbit the shivering is interrupted by periods of running movements similar to those seen in chloroform narcosis without an obvious alteration in the O2 consumption .
In extreme cold convulsive movements may occur , and frequently there is in addition to the shiver a tonic cramp-like rigidity , easily noticeable on palpation .
The fall of skin temperature appears consequently to result in a demand for a certain amount of activity from the muscles , which presumably in the absence of other directive impulses takes the form of a On the Mechanism of Chemical Temperature Regulation .
205 shiver .
The importance of shivering has been especially insisted on by Loewy ( 19 ) , by Richet ( 20 ) , and by Johansson ( 21 ) , who gives a complete sketch * * x Fig. 2.\#151 ; Rabbit , 950 grm. A. Abscissa , rectal temperature .

Rubner ( 22 ) believes the significance of shivering to be much exaggerated .
Having found that the anaesthetised animal produced extra O2 in proportion to the extent to which its skin temperature had fallen below a certain fixed standard , it had to.be determined how the animal was aware of the standard to which it should aim .
The mechanism was in part revealed by the following experiment .
A cat was warmed in the water bath in the usual manner , the O2 consumption being continuously determined and the heating continued as usual beyond the shivering point .
It was then removed from the bath , with the result that the skin cooled rapidly below the shivering point without any muscular activity appearing .
The body temperature followed the skin temperature slowly , and when this had fallen below the point at which regulation previously ceased , violent shivering set in , and extra oxygen was consumed in proportion to the extent to which the , skin temperature was below that point .
The appearance of chemical regulation is conditioned by the body temperature being below a fixed point , its amount is determined by the extent to which the subcutaneous temperature is below that point .
Though among a number of experiments of this type I have ' met none in contradiction with this view , the results are not always so satisfactory as in that from which fig. 3 is taken .
It frequently happens that the animal cooling regulates for a different temperature , generally lower , than that to which it regulated on Mr. J. M. O'Connor .

\#166 ; + , shivering after having been warmed .
In both these experiments the 02 consumption on cooling rose distinctly during the period just before shivering commenced .
This is not an invariable occurrence , and is omitted from the graphs .
The correctness of the theory based on these experiments is supported by the fact that it occasionally happens at the beginning of an experiment an animal does not shiver until its rectal temperature has fallen to the point to which it is later found to regulate .
This can be seen in the illustrative protocol at the end of the paper .

20 being warmed , or that the vigour of the regulation was different , i.e. the amount of extra oxygen resulting from a given lowering of the skin temperature had altered .
As a result the first and second half of the experiment are not in agreement .
The first of these cases is illustrated by fig. 4 .
This significance of the body temperature having been recognised , an effort was made to determine if this influence could be localised .
Probability pointed to the temperature of the brain being of special importance , and in fact it was found possible to completely stop shivering and lower the oxygen consumption by heating the blood going through the carotids ( by Kahn 's tubes ) ( 23 ) .

A number of such attempts failed on technical grounds .
It was found very difficult to get a complete experiment of this type , especially when as was the case the brain temperature was also determined by a thermocouple introduced through the skull .
In one experiment I was , however , able to show that shivering ceased at the same brain temperature whether this was reached by locally heating the head blood or warming the body of the animal in the bath .

3.56 37 T 32 -5 99 On the same grounds of technical disappointments the effort to obtain the important experiment in which the skin was kept above the shivering point while the brain was cooled below it was abandoned .
This and similar experiments require essential alteration of technique .
The importance of this experiment lies in the fact that it would effectually clear up any contradictions which might exist between these results and the experiments of Barbour .
Barbour and Prince ( 13 ) have shown that when the brain is heated there is a fall in the 02 consumption .
This is , of course , explicable by the temperature of the centres rising above the " shivering point .
" They have , however , also shown that when the temperature of the brain is lowered there is an increase in 02 consumption .
This may constitute a discrepancy .
Barbour states that when the brain is cooled there is also a vaso-constriction in the skin .
In this way , provided that the temperature of the air is at its usual figure , the skin would become cooler and result in this secondary fashion in an increase in 02 consumption .
The results obtained point clearly to the theory that while shivering is initiated by a low brain temperature it is quantitatively controlled by the skin temperature .
The more accurate localisation of these two significant regions does not come within the scope of this paper .
The experiments of Eisenschmid and Schnitzler ( 22 ) would point to the tuber cinereum as the essential portion of the brain .
With regard to the skin it would be too great a coincidence if the temperature of the subcutaneous region into which the thermometer naturally slips were accurately the governing factor .
Liebermeister ( 2 ) , influenced by the fact that the COa production of fat individuals was less affected by a cold bath than that of the thin , made approximate calculations which led him to believe that the end organs lay beneath the layer of fat on the surface of the muscles .
This view is On the Mechanism of Chemical Temperature Regulation .
209 obviously improbable , and is vitiated by the fact that in his calculations he neglected the latent heat of the fluid subcutaneous fat .
This fat , on solidification , would give out large quantities of heat , while , owing to the lack in definition of its melting point , it falls but slowly in temperature .
A layer of warmer material is thus retained next the deep surface of the skin in which the end organs for cold lie .
Rubner ( 25 ) states that at the " cooler places " a fat rich in olein is deposited .
I have been unable to find any determination of the latent heat of fusion of fat ; beeswax is given as 22 .
It may be asked why , if such a complete system of chemical heat regulation exist in the anaesthetised animal , the temperature falls so continuously in an animal exposed even to room temperature .
The answer must lie in the fact that though the mechanism is in order the response of the heat-producing organs is not efficient .
That this is so is borne out by the fact that the extra Oa consumption produced by a fall of the skin temperature of 1 ' C. varies from about 6 to 30 per cent , of the ( calculated ) basal * Fig. 5.'\#151 ; Cat , 1650 grm. As fig. 2 .

metabolism at 39 ' .
That at times the regulation is capable of maintaining the temperature is shown by the experiment illustrated by fig. 5 .
A further point to be considered is the temperature to which the animals chemically regulate/ This is always below the normal body temperature ( 30-39 ' ) .
I have the impression that the smaller the animal the lower it is , but neither the results nor the conditions are sufficiently uniform to justify a conclusion on this point .
The fact that the anaesthetised animal regulates for a temperature lower than the normal may be due to a direct action on the central nervous system not accessible to further analysis .
It may , however , be capable of another explanation .
If we conceive the animal unable to regulate and surrounded by certain fixed thermal conditions there will be only one body temperature at which the animal will be in equilibrium , and towards this point it will regulate .
If the basal metabolism be lowered the animal will be in equilibrium with the same outside conditions at a lower body temperature and will , according to the hypothesis , now regulate for this lower point .
We know that as a matter of fact narcotics acting , for example , on isolated organs ( 26 ) do produce a lowering of the metabolism ; and the fact that in myxcedema and in starved rabbits ( 27 ) a low basal metabolism is associated with a subnormal temperature lends support to the explanation suggested .
In fever , too , though the point has scarcely been adequately investigated , the increase of temperature appears to be always accompanied by an increased energy exchange ( 28 ) .
That alterations in the circulation could equally affect the equilibrium point is clear .
The experiments are in consistent agreement with the theory formulated .
As an analysis of the normal mechanism of temperature regulation they are not without objection .
The periods of observation were very short .
It is , of course , true that long periods are more convincing , but , apart- from this , Rubner ( 29 ) is inclined to question absolutely the value of observations for short periods .
Passing the fact that long observations on animals in uniform anaesthesia are scarcely feasible , it must be observed the Rubner objections are arbitrary .
It may , of course , be also true that the anaesthesia completely perverts the mechanism in normal activity .
The fact that through anaesthesia we are able to reveal aspects of the question otherwise inaccessible must compensate us for this slight suspicion .
Without endeavouring to extend too widely the application of the results , it may be noted that they lend support to Hering 's theory of temperature perception , and , if we assume the sensation of cold to be proportional to the amount of oxygen resulting from shivering , do not agree with the Fechner law .

Summary , 1 .
Ansesthefcised cat or rabbits when not shivering consume 02 in proportion to their body temperature .
2 .
When shivering more oxygen is consumed than would otherwise be consumed at that body temperature .
3 .
The onset of shivering is dependent on the brain temperature being below a point more or less fixed in a given animal .
4 .
The amount of " extra oxygen " consumed during shivering is proportional to the extent to which the average skin temperature is below this point .
5 .
This point , towards which the animals regulate chemically , varies in different anaesthetised animals between 30 ' and 39 ' C. LITERATURE .
