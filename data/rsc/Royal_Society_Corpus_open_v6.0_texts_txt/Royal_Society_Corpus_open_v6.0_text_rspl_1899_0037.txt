tive ions is , say , twice as great as that carried by the positive ions , for equal numbers of positive and negative ions are produced by the ionisation of the neutral gas .
Attempts were now made to find an answer to the first question suggested above\#151 ; Is there any evidence that ions are likely to be present under normal conditions in the atmosphere ?
Former experiments furnished a certain amount of evidence in favour of an affirmative answer .
When moist dust-free air is allowed to expand suddenly a rain-like condensation always take place if the maximum supersaturation exceeds a certain limit .
This limit is identical with that required to make water condense on ions ; the identity is in fact so exact as to furnish what is at first sight almost convincing evidence that ordinary moist air is always to a very slight extent ionised .
The number of these nuclei is too small to make the absence of sensible electrical conductivity in air under ordinary conditions inconsistent with the view that they are ions .
All attempts , however , to remove these nuclei , by applying a strong electric field such as would have removed ordinary ions almost as fast as they were produced , have failed , even when a differential apparatus was used , such as would have made manifest even a slight diminution in the number of the nuclei by the action of the field .
The same is true of the similar nuclei produced by the action of weak ultra-violet light on moist air .
Such nuclei , therefore , in spite of their identity as condensation nuclei with the ions , cannot be regarded as free ions , unless we suppose the ionisation to be developed by the process of producing the supersaturation .
This question requires further investigation .

According to Wallace and Weismann* the duration of life in any organism is determined by natural selection .
An organism lives so long as it is advantageous , not to itself , but to its species , that it should live .
But it would be impossible for natural selection to determine the fit duration of life , as it would be impossible for it to fix any other character , unless that character were inherited .
Accordingly the hypothesis above referred to supposes that duration of life is an * See Weismann , ' On Heredity , ' Essays I and II , and especially Professor Poulton 's note as to Wallace , p. 23 , of fii*st English edition .

291 inherited character .
So far as we are aware , however , neither the above-mentioned naturalists nor any other investigators have published researches bearing on the problem of whether duration of life is or is not inherited .
We are accustomed to hear of a particular man that " he comes of a long-lived family , " but the quantitative measure of the inheritance of life 's duration does not yet seem to have been determined .
This absence of investigation appears the more remarkable as a knowledge of the magnitude of inheritance in this respect would , we should conceive , be of primary commercial importance in the consideration of life insurance and of annuities .
The biological interest of the problem , as we have already noticed , is very great .
2 .
It will be well in the first place to point out that the problem is by no means an easy or a straightforward one .
The ages at death of even close relatives must be found from records of some kind , or else collected ah initio .
Now if we take records like the Peerage , Baronetage , Landed Gentry , family histories , and private pedigrees , we find various serious omissions .
In the first place the ages of the women are rarely given , pages of the Peerage or Landed Gentry may be examined before a single record is found of the ages of two sisters at death , or even of a mother and a daughter .
Further , the census and other returns show how liable we are to find women 's ages given erroneously .
Family histories and pedigrees suffer in the same way , the pedigrees are mostly taken through the male line , and the women 's ages can only be found in rare cases .
An exception must be made in the case of the Quaker family histories , such as those of the Backhouse , Whitney , and other families .
Here the data are as full for the women as for the men , but naturally the history of a single , even much-branched family , does not provide anything like the material that the Peerage and Landed Gentry do in the case of men .
For this reason our first study is confined to inheritance of longevity in the male line .
We hope eventually to collect enough data for inheritance in the female line , but it will take a longer time to amass , and we fear will scarcely be as homogeneous .
In the second place , the sources to which we have referred omit more or less completely all record of the ages at death of infants and children .
The Quaker records give better results than the Peerage , but even here the great bulk of child deaths appears to remain unrecorded .
Out of 1000 males born in this country more than 300 die before they are 20 years of age .
But when 1000 cases of ages of father and son were taken out of the Landed Gentry , only 31 cases showed the death of a son before 20 years of age .
Of 2000 brothers from the Peerage in 1000 pairs , only 21 individuals died before 20 years of age .
In the Quaker histories we found about 16 per cent , of deaths before 20 years of age .
Clearly such early deaths are not represented in anything like their proper proportions .
They will have to be found from other sources ; possibly by direct inquiry , and Miss M. Beetoii and Prof. Karl Pearson .
the issue of data cards .
We were thus compelled to limit this first study to the case when both relatives die at a greater age than 20 .
In the case of fathers , when we are dealing with the correlation between father 's and son 's ages at death , this is practically no limitation at all , as no father dying under 20 years of age was met with .
In the case of the offspring , however , the limitation cuts off the distribution somewhat abruptly with a finite ordinate at 20\#151 ; 25 , five years being our unit of grouping .
3 .
Now duration of life is a very different character to eye-colour , or to some extent to the size of organs in adult life .
Eye-colour is fairly well determined , it may change with old age slightly , but it cannot transform itself from light blue to brown .
Again , nourishment and use undoubtedly affect the size of organs , but they are likely to influence father and son , or , at any rate , brother and brother , in much the same way , for they are members of the same family and the same class .
On the other hand , death depends not only ' on inherited constitution but on innumerable chance elements of environment and circumstance .
The environment both of home and period is much more alike for two brothers than for a father and son ; food , sanitation , habits of life , change considerably in a generation , and two brothers have more equal chances of life than a father and son .
But even with two brothers , one may live on the family estates and the other ruin his health in Africa or India .
Hence , while the non-differential death-rate will not materially alter the correlations between most characters in relatives , it must seriously affect the correlation between the durations of life in father and son , and to a lesser extent between brother and brother .
A good stock may be better protected against death than a weak one , but no stock at all can resist certain attacks .
Hence if we look upon death as a marksman , p per cent , of his shots are , we may say , sure to be effective whatever they hit , this is the non-differential death-rate , the remaining 100 \#151 ; p per cent , of his attacks will only be successful on the weaker stocks .
Now the effect of this conception of death 's action is that the correlation table for ages at death of any pair of relatives must be looked upon as a mixture of uncorrelated material-deaths due to the non-differential death-rate , and correlated material\#151 ; deaths due to the differential or selective death-rate .
At different periods of life also one of these death-rates may give more material to the table than at another .
In the case of fathers and sons we should expect the non-differential death-rate to be more numerous in its contributions than in the case of brother and brother .
Now it has been shown by one of us that when correlated material is mixed with uncorrelated material , the result is approximately to reduce the coefficient of correlation in the ratio of the amount of correlated to the total amount of material.* Hence , if we assume that the * * Phil.

293 actual correlation between constitutional strengths to resist death would be given , at any rate approximately , by the values determined for other characters in a memoir on the Law of Ancestral Heredity , * we have clearly a method of to some extent ascertaining the proportion of the selective and non-selective death-rates in man .
In the sequel it will be shown that from the age of 20 to the end of life our tables give a correlation between the duration of life of father and son of about 0'12 to 0-14 , and between brother and brother of about 0'26 .
According to the Law of Ancestral Heredity we should expect these quantities to be about 03 and 0-4 .
Hence we conclude that the amounts of correlated material in the two cases are 40 to 50 per cent , and 65 per cent. But if y\#187 ; N be the number of cases in which the death-rate is selective for N individuals , will be the number of cases for which it is selective when we take pairs of individuals .
In other words the selective death-rate in the first caset is about 63 to 70 per cent , and in the second about 80 per cent , of the total death-rate .
Without laying great stress on the actual numbers just stated , we think that they are sufficiently close to demonstrate that a substantial selective death-rate actually exists at work on mankind , and that with like environment it may amount to as much as four times the non-selective death-rate .
] : In other words , having demonstrated that duration of life is really inherited , we have thereby demonstrated that natural selection is very sensibly effective among mankind .
The natural selection we are here dealing with is not in the first place , of course , a result of any struggle of individual with individual , but of individual with environment and with the defects of personal physique .
4 .
In order to show the biological importance of investigating the inheritance of duration of life , we have cited the results obtained for correlation between the ages at death of father and son and brother and brother .
But the method by which these results were obtained requires further discussion .
We have already seen the need to exclude deaths under 20 years , but even then we have not got in the case of father and son two like groups of material .
The father has been more severely selected than the son .
He has lived to become a father , and he is strong enough to be the father of a son who lives to be # ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 62 , pp. 397 and 400 .
t This selective death-rate from the data for father and son must be interpreted in the sense indicated above .
The drop from 80 to 65 , say , per cent , is in itself a measure of the change of environment of the two generations .
t The correlation on which this determination is based might be illusory , if families were reared under very individual environments ; the correlation in duration of life of brothers , for example , might then be a result of their individual family environment .
But the environment when wre take comparatively homogeneous classes like the Peerage or Landed Gentry must be very similar , and we think this source of error , suggested to us by Professor Weldon , while very real has been sufficiently provided against .

20 years of age .
Evidence of this selection is to he found in the facts that ( 1 ) fathers have a mean age 5 to 7 years greater than that of their sons ; ( 2 ) the variability of their age at death is very sensibly less than the variability of their sons ' age , i.e. , as 2-9 to 3'5 , or ( 3 ) by noticing for example that in our first table 82 sons as against 20 fathers die before 32'5 years of age , and that in our second table some 100 sons as against 20 fathers die before 35 years of age .
Clearly the group " son " is a much weaker type than the group " father .
" As will be shown in a memoir on the effect of selection on correlation , this want of likeness in fathers and sons itself tends to modify the correlation between them.* While this selection occurs only in the case of fathers and sons and not in the case of brethren , still the general character of the correlation surface is alike in both .
It is known that the curve of frequency of death at different agesf is by no means normal .
It is probably compound , and only approximates to normality round three score years and ten .
It would hardly , however , fulfil a useful purpose to deal only with the correlation of ages of death of relatives both dying under the old age mortality group , even if on the sunny side of 70 we could distinguish old age from middle age mortality .
But in dealing with correlation and regression in such cases as this , we must throw entirely on one side any notion of normal surface and curves of error , and go simply to the kernel of the affair .
What we want is the law connecting the mean age at death of one relative when another relative has died at a given age .
When the given age of the latter and the mean age of the former are plotted to form a curve , this curve is the regression curve whatever be the form of the frequency surface .
The line of closest fit to this curve is the regression line , and Yule 's theorem !
tells us that the slope of this line is found in exactly the same way as if the frequency surface were a normal distribution .
The slope of this line has nothing whatever to do with the particular form of surface , and may be found even if we cut off a portion of the surface parallel to one axis , e.g. , if we take the regression line for fathers or sons we get the best fitting lines in precisely the same manner whether we take all sons dying from infancy to old age , or only those from 20 years onwards .
If , of course , the regression curve is sensibly linear , then the regression line is the true curve of regression .
Everything proved in the memoir , " On the Law of Ancestral Heredity " S holds for such linear regression equally well ; we need not suppose normal correlation .
Now the reader has * Not of course very largely , still with the values given in the first series of fathers and sons , the correlation would be reduced about 0'86 to 0'9 of its value by the selection of fathers .

295 only to look at our regression diagrams , in particular at that for brethren , to assure himself that no curve will serve for practical purposes substantially better than a straight line .
Now , if \lt ; tx be the standard deviation of the relative whose mean age at death is taken } and a-y of the relative of a given age at death , and r be the correlation defined by r = \#166 ; S { z(x- mx ) { y - my)}/ ( Ncrx\lt ; ry ) , where z is the frequency of deviations x-mx and y-my from the means mx and my in the total observations N , then the line of closest fit , the regression line , passes through mx and my , and has ra-^a-y for its slope .
All this is independent of any theory of frequency distribution , and the vanishing of r with the correlation simply flows from the fundamental problem that the chance of a combined event is the product of two independent probabilities .
Our conclusions in this paper are deduced from the above value of r and from the slope of the regression line , and they involve no further assumption than the approximate linearity of the regression curves .
Our appeal to the memoir , " On the Law of Ancestral Heredity " makes also no greater demands^ 5 .
We now turn to the material itself .
Our data consist of three series , from which all deaths recorded as accidents , an exceedingly small proportion of the whole , were excluded .
In excluding these we of course slightly , but very slightly , reduced the non-selective death-rate .
In the first series , 1000 cases of the ages of fathers and sons at death , the latter being over 22-5 years of age , were taken from 'Foster 's Peerage ' ; in the second series a 1000 pairs of fathers and sons , the latter dying beyond the age of 20 , were taken from ' Burke 's Landed Gentry ' ; and in the third series the ages at death of 1000 pairs of brothers dying beyond the age of 20 were taken from the Peerage .
The first series was obtained by grouping all fathers dying between 22-5 and 27*5 , 27*5 and 32*5 , \amp ; c. We started at 22-5 because this was the earliest recorded death of a father among those extracted from the Peerage , and to have sons dying in the same range they were alSo started at 22-5 years .
In extracting the ages at death , they were taken to the nearest whole year , and consequently in the subsequent grouping we were spared decimals .
In the second and third series we originally took all deaths from birth onwards also to the nearest whole year , and then grouped in five-year periods ; thus fractions were introduced when a death fell on a five-year division .
Subsequently we eliminated the few deaths occurring before 20 years of age .
The aggregate material for the three series is given in Tables I , II , a**d \gt ; and the means of the arrays of fathers ' ages at death for sons dying a^ a given age , i.e. , the regression polygons of fathers ' on sons ' age at death in figs. 1 and 2 ; the regression polygon for brethren is given in fig. 3 .
In the case of brothers , we have rendered the original distribution , 29G Miss M. Beeton and Prof. Karl Pearson .
which was nearly symmetrical , absolutely symmetrical , by entering into the table each pair of brothers twice , an individual first appearing as a first brother and then as a second brother .
Thus the mean age at death and variability of age at death of both sets of brothers appears the same , and we have a nominal 2000 instead of a 1000 entries .
Of course in calculating the probable errors of the constants , 1000 has been taken as the number of observations .
We shall now consider these diagrams and tables a little at length .

The point a for the group of sons dying between 17'5 and 22*5 years was put in from a few observations not afterwards included in the table .
Beyond the group 82*5 to 87'5 years , there were not sufficient observations to form a reliable mean at all : yy gives the mean age of all the 1000 fathers observed , and represents 65*835 years , gives the mean age of the 1000 sons , and represents 58*775 years .
The former may be taken as the mean age at death of all fathers , the latter was only the mean age at the death of sons who live more than 22*5 years .
The regression curve is a somewhat broken polygon , but one or two points may be deduced at once from it .
( a ) It is entirely to the left of yy above xx and entirely to the right of yy below xx .
Thus there is certainly correlation between the ages at death of father and son .
A son dying below the mean age will have on the average a father dying below the mean age , and a son dying above the mean age will have on the average a father dying above the mean age .
Graphically we see that correlation must exist .
The straight line which best fits the regression polygon is given on the diagram by hi .
The Law of Ancestral Heredity would give Im with a slope of 0*3 .
It is clear that with a quite sensible regression there is a quite sensible divergence from the law of inheritance , in other words , the death-rate is only in part selective .
Quite similar results are to be observed in fig. 2 ; there is again a very sensible correlation , but it is sensibly less than that required by the Law of Ancestral Heredity .

times the magnitudes of their probable errors , and they agree within the probable error of their differences .
The only significant difference is the mean age of deaths of sons in the Landed Gentry , which is some two years higher than in the Peerage .
This is the more noteworthy in that we have begun our peerage record at 25 and not 20 .
Clearly the sons of the Landed Gentry are longer lived .
We have undoubtedly correlation , say somewhere about 0*12 , sensible and definite in amount , but clearly considerably below the 0*3 required by the law of inheritance .
( b ) A second point may be noticed by looking at the diagrams ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , namely , that from about the age of 32*5 to 52*5 the regression line is sensibly vertical , or when the son dies in middle life , the mean age of death of the father is sensibly uncorrelated with it .
In other words , we have the remarkable result that the mortality which in a paper on skew variation by one of us , * has been termed that of middle life is largely uninherited .
It is during this period of life that the non-selective death-rate is chiefly predominant .
After this period the regression curve becomes sensibly steeper , although not fully up to the steepness of the line given by Gallon 's Law .
This is more properly the inheritance of longevity .
The inheritance of duration of life may not be continuous .

The regression line for this old age mortality is marked as jk in diagrams ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and we see the advance towards the Galtonian value .

299 nately our records do not give enough data to determine its form in a reliable manner .
Fig. 1 seems to indicate a great approach to the Galtonian value towards youth , and we should not be surprised to find the selective death-rate in youth and infancy even more predominant than in old age .
This would be the inheritance of the reverse of longevity , of " brachy-bioty .
" The regression curve for this portion of life cannot be determined from our present statistics , but we hope to return to it in a second study when more data have been collected.* So far as we are able to judge at present the inheritance of the duration of life breaks up into two parts , an inheritance telling its tale in youth and another after middle life .
It is the former part which seems to us to have most bearing on the fertility and survival of stocks , most individuals having-reproduced themselves by 50 years of age .
It is the latter part only , the true inheritance of longevity , to which it would appear that Weismann and Wallace 's arguments apply :\#151 ; t " For it is evident than when one or more individuals have provided a sufficient number of successors , they themselves , as consumers of nourishment in a constantly increasing degree , are an injury to those successors .
Natural selection therefore weeds them out , and in many cases favours such races as die almost immediately after they have left successors .
" 7 .
We now turn to the third series , giving the correlation between the ages of death of brothers .
The data give the following numerical results :\#151 ; Mb = 60-971 years .
o-b = 16-8354 " rBB = 0-2602 \#177 ; 0-0199 .
Ebb = 0-2602 \#177 ; 0-0216 .
The results here are in good agreement with those for sons in the Landed Gentry , i.e. , in the second series .
The mean age of one of a pair of brothers is slightly greater and the variability of one who has a brother slightly less than in the case of sons .
But this is exactly what we might expect , considering that " brothers " are a selection from " sons , " and a brother is likely to have greater vitality than a son .
The group sons covers sons of fathers who did not live to have more than one son , and who therefore came of any early dying stock , while brothers denotes at least two sons , and therefore on the average some years more life than is necessary for one son .
The values of the coefficients of correlation and regression are some 13 times their probable errors , and we have a substantial correlation , * this collection has already commenced , and we hope shortly to give more definite information on this point .

approaching much closer than in the case of sons to the \alue demanded ( OA ) by the Law of Ancestral Heredity .
The diagram shows ( i ) how substantial is the correlation ; ( ii ) how much more nearly the regression line kk given by observation approaches the theoretical line Im .
and ( iii ) how very nearly the regression curve is truly linear .
The reason of this closer approach to the theoretical value of heredity is owing to the diminution in the non-selective death-rate , the envii on Data for the Problem Man .
meant of brothers during their lives being as a rule much more alike than that of father and son .
It must be noted that the predominance of the non-selective death-rate in middle life , so marked in the latter case , no longer appears in the case of brothers .
This would suggest that the environments of father and son differ most in middle life and are then much more unlike than those of brothers .

We conclude this first study by putting on record formulae for estimating the age at death of a man , using the theory of multiple correlation as developed in a memoir* by one of the present writers , and taking as basis the second and third series , which seem to us to present the best results .
Let P be the probable age in years at death of a man , F be the age at death of his father , Si of his first son , S2 of his second son , Bi of his first brother , B2 of his second brother .

Thus the correlation of ages of a mam and his grandfather and of a man and his uncle at death , being at present unknown , were taken to be half the correlation of father and son .

Based on a wider mass of data and a larger series of relationships we cannot hut believe they would be of much help to variability of grandfathers , which must be less than that of fathers , or theii mean age at death , which must be greater than that of fathers , in order to determine the probable age at death of a man from that , say , of his grandfather and father , which would be of much interest .

( ii ) A man has two brothers , who die young at 25 and .
29 .
How much will this shorten his probable duration of life ?
Answer : 14 years .
( iii ) A man 's father died at 40 , and his brother , his senior by one year , died at 50 , twenty-two years ago .
A life estate now accrues to the man , whose whereabouts are unknown .
What is the probability that he is still alive , and should he return and claim the estate , how long is he likely to enjoy it .
Answer : The man belongs to an array of men of mean age 54*99 years at death , and standard deviation 16*41 years .
Hence the odds against his living beyond 71 years are 835 to 165 , and , accordingly , the odds against the possibility of his return are about 21 to 4 .
Should he be alive and return , he is as likely as not to hold it for 6*8 years , and 8*7 years is his expectancy of life , so that the contingency of his being alive and enjoying the estate is worth only about 1*4 years ' income of the estate .
Clearly such problems can be extended in a great variety of ways , which might be serviceable in actuarial practice .
