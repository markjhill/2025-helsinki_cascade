] Apart from what can be learned from the study of their density , little is known as to the constitution in the state of vapour of those elements which are solid or liquid at ordinary temperatures .
In a paper read before the Society early last year* we showed that interesting information on this subject can be obtained from the examination of the absorption spectra of sulphur .
In the present paper we propose to give an account of the application of the method to other elements .
Unfortunately , the number of elements which lend themselves to the purpose is small , being limited to those which do not attack silica at a high temperature and volatilise below 1300'-1400 ' C. , the temperature at which silica begins to soften .
Those most suitable for examination , besides the members of the sulphur group , are the mercury group , comprising mercury , zinc , and cadmium , in which the molecules are known to be mainly monatomic at all temperatures above their boiling points , and the phosphorus group , comprising phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony , in which the molecules are tetratomic .
The apparatus and arrangements employed in the investigation were similar to those described in the paper on sulphur , except that the tubes were exhausted as completely as possible by the Sprengel pump .
Selenium and Tellurium .
The general character of the absorption exercised by selenium is shown in tig .
1 .
From an examination of this figure , it will be seen that there is an increase in the amount of the absorption from 510 ' C. up to about 650 ' C. , from which point it diminishes up to 850 ' C. Above 850 ' C. , no further change is observed even at the highest temperature reached in our experiments , viz. , 1350 ' C. These changes in the absorption spectrum can be followed readily by the changes of colour observed when the light , after passing through the vapour , is allowed to fall upon a white screen .
The vapour is seen to become pale yellow almost suddenly at 600 ' C. ; between 600 ' C. and 700 ' C. it is deep orange , and at this temperature it is almost * ' Roy .

opaque to the rays of the Nernst lamp .
About 850 ' C. the colour has again become pale yellow , and no further change takes place at higher temperatures .
A remarkable feature of these changes is the narrow range of temperature within which they occur .
The spectrum of selenium shows many narrow and sharp absorption bands , and presents generally the same channelled character as the spectrum of sulphur .
From the boiling point up to 900 ' C. the density of selenium vapour diminishes .
At this temperature it corresponds closely with the formula Se2 , and , according to Biltz , * this is still the molecular constitution at 1800 ' C. This agrees with our observation that there is no change in the absorption between 850 ' C. and 1350 ' C. According to Preuner and Brockmoller , + who deduced the molecular complexity from measurements of the vapour pressure carried out with a spiral quartz manometer , the selenium molecule approaches See at the lowest temperature of their observations , and Se2 at the highest .
At intermediate temperatures , intermediate values were obtained , the larger molecules , Se6 , appearing to break down gradually into the smaller molecules , Se2 .
The vapour densities , which have been observed below 900 ' C. , are all greater than are required by the formula Se2 .
Determinations have been made by SzarvasyJ at 918 ' C. , 898 ' C. , 815 ' C. , and 774 ' C. , at which the densities referred to air were found to be 5'60 , 5-83 , 6 63 , and 7'01 respectively .
When these results are plotted out , they are seen to lie on a straight line , which , when produced ( see fig. 2 ) , gives at 700 ' 0 .
a density of 7*7 , and at 650 ' C. a density of 8-2 , the latter corresponding exactly with Se3 .

i Absorption of Light by Elements the State of Vapour .
149 650 ' C. to 700 ' C. There is thus close correspondence between the absorption curve and the vapour density curve so far as the data allow of the comparison being made .
The point of maximum absorption of selenium lies very near that of sulphur , viz. , 650 ' C. , and strangely enough , as in the case of sulphur , the vapour density at that temperature corresponds with an average value of 3 atoms per molecule .
It is also remarkable that both elements become wholly diatomic about 900 ' C. The behaviour of tellurium is very similar to that of selenium , but owing to its much higher point of volatilisation , observations could be made only over a comparatively short range of temperature .
From fig. 3 it will be seen that the general absorption increases with rise of temperature up to about 1250 ' C. , after which it diminishes up to 1350 ' C. The light transmitted , which is pale yellow at the lower temperatures at which observations were made , becomes deep red at 1250 ' C. , and again pale yellow at 1350 ' C. The spectrum is channelled like that of selenium .
The only recorded vapour densities of tellurium were made at high temperatures .
According to Biltz* the density at 1750'-1800 ' C. is 9T3 , a value which corresponds nearly with the formula Te2 .
At high temperatures , therefore , the vapour of tellurium is undoubtedly composed mainly , if not entirely , of diatomic molecules , but in view of its similarity in behaviour to sulphur and selenium as regards the absorption of light , it may with great probability be inferred that , as in the case of these elements , its molecules are more complex at 1250 ' C. and lower temperatures than at 1750 ' C. At 1250 ' C. the constitution of its vapour would appear to be analogous to that of sulphur and selenium at 650 ' C. On examining the photographs showing the absorption phenomena of the three elements of the sulphur group , it is seen that in order to obtain comparable results , the greater the atomic weight , the smaller is the quantity of the element that must be employed .
In other words , the power of absorption increases with the atomic weight , and this we shall show in a future paper holds good also for the chlorine group.f With 8 mgrm .
of tellurium the whole of the visible spectrum is cut out under the conditions of our experiments , whereas in the case of sulphur this is a very convenient quantity to employ in studying the absorption spectrum .

The band at X 4006 is the widest of this series of tellurium bands .

Mercury , Zinc , Cadmium .
With a tube 100 mm. long and 12'5 mm. internal diameter containing 25*6 mgrm .
of the metal , mercury showed no absorption at any temperature* the whole of the spectrum of the Nernst filament , which reaches to about X 3100 , being transmitted unaltered ; with 46'6 mgrm .
there was a slight , absorption extending to about X 3200 , but very little further increase in absorption was observed when a tube 200 mm. long containing 105-8 mgrm .
I Absorption of Light by Elements in the State of Vapour .
151 was employed .
The results were the same at all temperatures between 370 ' C. and 1300 ' C. Cadmium ( tigs .
5 and 6 ) , like mercury , shows no general absorption at any temperature , even with so large a quantity as 22'2 mgrm .
, but a small number of sharply defined absorption bands occur in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum in the following positions ( a ) A very fine sharp band at X3793 , which shows at a temperature of 900 ' C. ( b ) A fine band at X 3260 or \ 3261 , showing first about 600 ' C. , which widens as the temperature is raised ; the widened band is sharp towards the red end , but shades off towards the ultra-violet .
It coincides in position with the strong line of the cadmium arc at X 326T1 .
( c ) A diffuse band at X 3186 , showing first at 900 ' C. ( \lt ; d)* Two sharp bands at X 3654 and X3699 , showing first about 1200 ' C. ( e)* X 3061 , appearing at 1000 ' C. , and X 3382 , appearing at 1100 ' C. As it seemed possible that some of these bands might be due to impurities , great pains were taken to obtain the metal in the highest state of purity .
Samples from American and German sources and samples prepared in the Government Laboratory by electrolytic deposition from acid solutions were all found to give identical results , and we conclude , therefore , that the bands are those of cadmium and are not due to impurities .
Zinc behaves generally in the same way as mercury ; with 17'8 mgrm .
no general absorption was observed at any temperature between that of volatilisation and 1300 ' C. At 1100 ' C. four very sharp faint bands make their appearance at X 3699 , X 3654 , X 3384 , and X 3284 .
The zinc employed was the purest that could be obtained , and was free , so far as chemical tests showed , from all other metals except traces of lead and cadmium amounting to 0016 per cent , and 0'005 per cent , respectively .
Such minute quantities are , so far as our experience goes , without effect on the absorption spectra .
Considered as a group , these elements differ widely from sulphur and resemble each other in that : ( 1 ) they are transparent to light as far as the spectrum of the Nernst filament extends , that is , to about X 3100 ; ( 2 ) increase of temperature is not accompanied by the peculiar behaviour exhibited by sulphur , viz. , increase of absorption followed by decrease as the temperature is raised ; ( 3 ) increase in the quantity of the element within the limits of our experiments has little influence upon the spectrum .
The results obtained with 46'6 mgrm .
of mercury are much the same as with more than double that quantity ; with 104 mgrm .
of cadmium the same as with 22*2 mgrm .
, and with 17'8 mgrm .
of zinc the same as with 28'4 mgrm .
These lines are not shown in the reproduction , although clearly marked on the original negatives .

Phosphorus , Arsenic , .
Phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony , which are ' known from their vapour densities to be tetratomic , behave differently from the elements of the other groups already examined .
With 9'4 mgrm .
of phosphorus heated from 420 ' C. to 1310 ' C. the spectrum , which extends to X 3300 at the lower temperature , gradually contracts as the temperature is raised , until at the highest temperature reached it only extends to X3730 .
With 13'6 mgrm .
the result is similar , the only difference being that the amount of absorption is greater , the spectrum only reaching to X 3400 at 420 ' C. and to X 3950 at 1310 ' C. The phosphorus , it maybe mentioned , was introduced into the tube in the red or amorphous form .
Arsenic shows similar phenomena to phosphorus .
Between 400 ' C. and 1320 ' C. ( fig. 7 ) there is a regular increase in the general absorption , the spectrum being transmitted to X3250 at 400 ' C. and to X4440 at 1320 ' C. When the amount of arsenic is increased , the only effect is to increase the amount of absorption at corresponding temperatures .
The absorption extends in this case into the visible region of the spectrum and the colour of the arsenic vapour becomes faintly yellow at 700 ' C. , deepening as the temperature is raised .
On account of the higher temperature required to volatilise antimony , this element could only be examined over a comparatively short range of temperature , viz. , 800 ' 0.-1300 ' C. , but it will be seen from fig. 8 that between these temperatures it behaves in the same way as phosphorus and arsenic .
With 3T6 mgrm .
the spectrum is transmitted to X3150 at 800 ' 0 .
and to X4000 at 1300 ' C. The antimony used was prepared from tartar emetic .
It may here be mentioned that in dealing with elements which require a high temperature for volatilisation it is found most convenient to heat the tube to the highest temperature to begin with , and take the photographs as the temperature falls , so as to ensure that the whole of the contents of the tube are in the state of vapour during examination .
The deposition of any of the elements in the solid state is at once indicated by the light being partially or entirely cut off by obscuration of the end plates .
It is well known that the density of the vapour of phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony diminishes with increase of temperature .
It may , therefore , be assumed that , as in the case of sulphur , the increase of absorption which takes place when the temperature is raised is closely associated with the breaking down of the more complex molecules .
No absorption bands or indications of any kind of selective absorption were observed in the elements of this group .

Absorption of Light by Elements the State of Vapour .
153 Where the absorption of light increases with increase of temperature there is evidence of the resolution of more complex into simpler molecules ; where there is no increase of absorption there is evidence that the element is monatomic in the gaseous state .
In the case of mercury the evidence , based on several distinct methods of investigation , points to the conclusion that the vapour consists entirely of molecules composed of single atoms .
The vapours of zinc and cadmium have densities which indicate that their molecules also for the most part consist of single atoms .
The discrepancy , however , between the vapour density , calculated on the assumption that these two elements are monatomic , and that actually observed even at high temperature shows that the molecules in the gaseous state do not wholly consist of single atoms .
The fine bands described above may well be connected with the presence of the more complicated molecules .
Bearing in mind the results previously obtained with sulphur , it would appear that the elements which lend themselves to examination by the method described in this paper may be divided into three groups:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Elements whose vapours exercise no absorption or show only a few well-defined absorption bands : these are monatomic .
( 2 ) Elements in which the absorption gradually increases as the temperature is raised , but which show no other effect within the limits of temperature imposed by our method : these are tetratomic .
( 3 ) Elements in which the absorption increases with increase of temperature to a maximum and afterwards diminishes .
The sulphur and halogen elements belong to this group .
The explanation of the different behaviour as regards absorption of light , as exhibited by elements of groups ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) compared with those of group ( 1 ) , is probably to be found in the rearrangement of the valencies accompanying the breaking down of the complex molecules under the action of heat .
The tetratomic molecules would appear to break down simply into diatomic molecules , although possibly more complicated changes may take place at higher temperatures than can be employed with silica tubes .
With the sulphur and halogen elements , the changes are obviously much more complex .
The molecules near the temperature of volatilisation are probably already broken down , partially to the atomic condition , the liberated atoms forming new combinations with one another or with the undissociated molecules , in other words , polymerising .
This subject will be more fully discussed in a future communication on the elements of the halogen group , which we are at present investigating .
