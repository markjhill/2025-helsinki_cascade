459 killed and pitted immediately after taken from the net , may pass into rigor in 30 minutes and be again quite limp 6 hours after death .
Sometimes , however , the rigor may not set in for 2 hours after the fish are landed , and it may continue for 17 hours , the difference doubtless resulting partly from the difference in the time the fish were in the trawl net , and partly from the energy expended in attempting to escape , or in endeavouring to maintain the respiratory movements under somewhat difficult circumstances .
It may therefore be affirmed that though the rigor may persist as long or nearly as long in some trawled fish as in fish caught with a line , in most cases the rigor disappears sooner from trawled than from line-caught fish ; in other words , putrefaction sets in sooner as a rule in fish taken by the trawl than in fish taken by the line , granting , of course , that the line fish are pithed and gutted as soon as they leave the water .
I have , in conclusion , to express my gratitude to Professor Burdon Sanderson and Mr. Gotch for valuable assistance rendered with the experiments made in the Oxford Physiological Laboratory .
I am also indebted to Professor Tait for kindly allowing Mr. Lindsay , of the Natural Philosophy Laboratory in the University of Edinburgh , to assist with the electrical experiments .

" Electrochemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
" By Thomas Andrews , F.R.S.E. , F.C.S. Communicated by Professor G. G. Stokes , P.R.S. Beceived June 2 , 1887 .
Having for many years past been engaged in researches relating to the various aspects of the corrosion and oxidation of metals , nearly two years ago it occurred to me to investigate the probable effect of magnetisation on the relative electrochemical position of a pair of bright iron bars , one magnetised by a coil , the other unmagnetised , when thus simultaneously exposed in circuit , in a suitable apparatus , to the action of various powerful oxidising agents and saline solutions .
I accordingly specially prepared numerous long polished rods of soft wrought scrap iron 0261 inch diameter , for use in the investigation .
I was not able to commence the preliminary observations until towards the end of 1885 , and , after much consideration and various trials then made , decided to adopt the following method of experimentation as perhaps calculated to yield the most delicate and accurate results ; pressure of other work has , however , delayed the earlier completion of the work .
The general Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 16 arrangement and methods of experimentation pursued are described below , and the apparatus is delineated on fig. 1 and fig. 2 .
Two pieces were adjacently cut from a long finely polished iron rod , so that the pieces might as near as practicable be of identical chemical composition and molecular constitution .
After being firmly placed and adjusted as to equal length , \amp ; c. , in the wooden supporting frame W , they were immersed to an exactly equal depth in the solution contained in the U-tube , which latter was also rigidly supported by a stand .
In the duplex experiments made with apparatus fig. 2 , the U-tube was immersed in a large volume , four pints , of cold water to ensure equal temperature conditions during experimentation for the respective solutions in each limb , the cold water being maintained in steady circulation around the tubes .
The rods were connected in circuit with a sensitive galvanometer , having a resistance of 521 ohms , and of known calibration , the galvanometer being under constant telescopic observation during the experiments , and the normal galvanic action between the two bars previously observed in every experiment .
Considerable care was requisite to obtain this accurately , so as not practically to interfere with the subsequent results seemingly due to magnetic influences .
A removable coil C , of stout silk-covered copper wire ( Ho. 16 gauge ) mounted on a large wooden bobbin 6 inches long enclosed the limb A of the U-tube , or when using apparatus fig. 2 , 1887 .
] Electrochemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
the coil surrounding the upper portion of the long bar requiring magnetisation .
The coil used in the experiments with apparatus fig. 1 consisted of sii depths or wraps of the insulated copper wire , each wrap having 81 turns , making in the whole a coil of 486 convolutions .
The other coil employed in the experiments with apparatus fig. 2 was of similar construction , but had ten depths of insulated copper wire of the same thickness , constituting a coil with a total of about 750 convolutions .
A single cell bichromate battery , easily put in or out of operation , was attached to the coil , and the battery was recharged with the same strength of solution for each observation .
After a suitable time had been allowed in each experiment for steady galvanic equilibrium to be established between the two iron rods , in the solution in the tubes , which took place at periods varying with the nature of the solution , the coil was put into operation .
In the experiments with fig. 2 the end of the bar in the solution was the S seeking pole .
It was most interesting to observe the result .
The rod A thus magnetised in most of the solutions became the metal positive , the galvanometer indicating its steadily increasing electrochemical positive position compared with that of the unmagnetised bar B. Repeated careful experimentation appeared to indicate that the increased positivity of the rod A observed under these conditions was due to the increased action of the acid or saline solution on the iron rod which was under magnetic influence , owing to which it became surrounded by a slightly stronger saline solution than the other unmagnetised rod B , which was apparently less acted upon .
In some cases in the more powerfully acid solutions , Table A , columns 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , a kind of maximum point seemed to be generally reached , and after the more violent action of the acid had expended itself , a reduction of the E.M.F. between the rods was generally noticed as the solution in the B-tube gradually approached an equilibrium of composition compared with the solution in the A limb of the U-tube , and subsequently a reverse action in some cases was observed .
The unmagnetised rod B appeared to be less rapidly acted upon than the one under magnetic influence .
On magnetisation of the bar the above full effect on the galvanometer was not always of an instantaneous character , though a short time only appeared requisite for its development .
The solutions employed are given in Table A , and the results therein recorded were derived from a series of constant observations , a comparison in some instances being afforded between the respective effects obtained by the two forms of apparatus employed .
It may be noticed that a fresh pair of the iron rods , cut adjacently from a long polished rod , were used for each experiment , and 123 pairs were used in course of this part of the investigation , th whole of the experiments being many times repeated to ensure Mr. T. Andrews .
[ June 16 , accuracy , the results recorded being the average of many observations .
In some instances somewhat higher results were noticed .
It is almost impossible to obtain two pieces of iron ( even when forming adjacent parts of one polished rod ) which when in solution are devoid of some slight galvanic action between themselves ; but the greatest care was exercised in the special preparation of the iron used , so that this variation might be reduced to a minimum .
To ensure success in the experiments it was found essential that the iron bars should possess an excellent polished surface , free from magnetic or other oxide or impurities ; the solutions were also concentrated , and both discrimination and manipulative skill were requisite in obtaining the practical galvanic equilibrium of the bars at commencement .
The time needed to ensure this seemed to vary considerably with different solutions according to circumstances .
A sensitive galvanometer was also a requisite of success in these observations , and telescopic readings were necessary , as in some cases the effects were small .
It seems desirable here to add a few remarks on the possible influence of temperature on the reactions , and to state the means used in the endeavour to minimise errors from this source .
In conducting the experiments , I should have preferred using greater battery power , but employed only one bichromate cell ; the wire of the coil was also of considerable thickness to prevent undue heating from resistance .
The centre of the wooden coil bobbin was also about | inch in thickness , so as to act as a central non-conductor .
Moreover , an air space was allowed of ^ inch between the wooden centre of the coil and the enclosed limb of the U-tube .
The other limb for the unmagnetised bar was enclosed by another coil , which , when not in use , acted as an external protective jacket .
Notwithstanding these precautions , there was a slight increase of temperature in the interior of the coil C. Thermometers inserted in test solutions , one in each limb , gave an average difference of about 1 ' Fahrenheit at the end of an hour , this increase of temperature in the solution in the coil tube being , however , very gradual .
It would be untenable to state that this difference of temperature , arising from the action of the coil , did not to some slight extent influence the results of the experiments with apparatus fig. 1 ; but the results obtained therewith could certainly not be regarded as due only to differences of temperature conditions between the two tubes .
Most of the experiments with that apparatus afford within themselves evident proof to the contrary ; thus , it will be seen , that the magnetised bar assumed a prominent positive position almost immediately after magnetisation , in the case of nitric acid , before any perceptible difference of temperature could obtain between the respective tubes ( see Table A , columns 6 and 7 ) .
1887 .
] Electrochemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
463 Moreover , the exceptional negative position of the magnetised bar under the same temperature conditions , in the case of sulphuric acid , affords evidence that the effect was not due to these temperature causes .
To more clearly demonstrate , however , that the results were mainly due to the influence of magnetisation , and acting on the kind suggestion of Professor G. G. Stokes , it was decided to make a duplex series of observations .
I accordingly devised the modified form of apparatus fig. 2 , which was intended to eliminate possible sources of error from temperature difference , by keeping the U-tube surrounded by a large volume of cold water during the experiments ; the solution in the respective tubes being thus maintained under equal conditions .
In comparing the results obtained with the two forms of apparatus , it should be borne in mind that , when using the apparatus fig. 2 , the cold water surrounding the U-tube would have a tendency to retard the increase of the temperature of the solutions naturally arising from chemical combination .
Further , the coil in fig. 2 being at one end of the long bar would be calculated to modify the magnetisation of the other end of the metal in the solution , compared with its action in fig. 1 , where the coil almost entirely surrounded the bar : hence in fig. 2 , the coil was made somewhat larger to overcome this to some extent , and the end of the bar B was shortened in experiments with fig. 2 , so that this bar would be less liable to be affected magnetically by the external influence of the larger coil .
I hope that the confirmatory results obtained in the two sets of observations may be considered as fairly satisfactory .

] Electrochemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
467 The records in the above table under divisions I were experiments made with apparatus , fig. 1 , the records entered under divisions II , relate to observations made with apparatus , fig. 2 .
The records of the effects in the stronger solutions do not indicate the full extent of the electric action compared with that of the weaker solutions ; because in the former case the tubes could only be partially filled , so as to ' prevent boiling over .
General Remarks .
Potassium Chlorate and Nitric Acid , Columns 1 and 2.\#151 ; At the termination of some of these experiments , the depth of colour of the solution surrounding the magnetised iron was perceptibly of a darker shade than the colour in the tube surrounding the unmagnetised bar , this was confirmed by Eggertz 's carbon coloration test .
Ferric Chloride and Nitric Acid , Column 5.-\lt ; \#151 ; At forty minutes from the commencement of one experiment in apparatus fig. 1 , the record was an E.M.F. of 0023 volt , the magnetised bar being positive ; the battery was then attached to a smaller coil surrounding the other bar B , which was then magnetised instead of the bar A , and in course of five minutes a reduction in the positive position of bar A to an extent of 0'021 volt occurred .
At forty-five minutes the battery was reconnected to the coil surrounding the bar A , producing a steady increase of positive position in that bar as recorded in Table A , column 5 .
Aqua Regia , undiluted.\#151 ; With this reagent in fig. 1 no very decided galvanic reaction took place until the bar had remained magnetised for some ten minutes , when violent effervescence occurred accompanied by evolution of dense reddish-brown fumes , the magnetised bar then becoming rapidly electropositive to an extent yielding an E.M.E. of about 0T10 volt .
This position was subsequently more or less maintained for some ten minutes , the galvanometer , however , gradually falling to zero as the ebullition in both tubes subsided .
This was a difficult experiment to make , owing to the very violent effervescence .
Aqua Regia , diluted , Column 8.\#151 ; Up to the commencement of the effervescence no perceptible difference in the colour of the solution in the respective limbs of the U-tube was noticed ; but immediately on the violent ebullition occurring , which took place generally about ten minutes from commencement , the solution surrounding the mage-tised bar frequently became of a very much darker tint .
This marked difference between the colour of the respective solutions in the two tubes was maintained for gome time , afterwards the two solutions became apparently nearly chromatically equal .
The electro468 Electrochemical Effects on Magnetising Iron .
[ June 16 chemical effect appeared to be less marked when using aqua regia containing excess of HC1 .
The relative electrochemical position of the two bars in such case being less divergent , the HC1 appearing to act somewhat as a strong diluent .
Hydrochloric Acid and Sulphuric A , Columns 9 and 10.\#151 ; Singular to say , the previously described magnetochemical effects were comparatively small when using such a powerful reagent as hydrochloric acid alone , either concentrated ( sp. gr. T16 ) or diluted .
When this acid was employed in conjunction with concentrated solution of potassium chlorate ( Table A , column 3 ) , the effects there recorded appeared due rather to the oxidising agency of the evolved chloric compounds ; in the presence of magnetism , the reactions with this electrolyte were occasionally irregular , the excess of HC1 appearing sometimes to interfere .
Sulphuric acid , cone .
, also seemed to behave abnormally , though this acid does not ordinarily act strongly on iron .
The experiments with both the above acids in course of a large number of observations , proved exceptions to the general rule .
The magnetised bar in the sulphuric acid , cone .
, and also in the hydrochloric acid , diluted , became the electronegative metal , not only in the case of H2SO4 , when using the apparatus fig. 1 , but also when experimenting with the modified form , fig. 2 .
Occasionally , with sulphuric acid , cone .
, the magnetised bar was , on first magnetising it , slightly electropositive for a few minutes only ; but afterwards became steadily negative .
Under the conditions of experimentation , the magnetised bars in the powerful oxidising reagents used almost invariably assumed the electropositive position , the presence of H.N03 appearing essential to the full development of the positive position of the bar under the influence of magnetism .
On the contrary , the magnetised bai seemed to be the electronegative metal in H2S04 , cone .
, and also in the HC1 ( diluted ) , as electrolytes .
The two latter reagents by their action on the metal generate gases of a reducing character .
These exceptions are not , however , averse to the principle that magnetisation exerts an influence on the relative electrochemical position of a pair of iron bars , varying according to the nature of the solution and the extent to which one of them is magnetised .
In the above exceptions , it is possible that the magnetised bar assumed the negative position consequent on its being the one more attacked , under magnetic influences , by the reagent ; thus producing a greater evolution of reducing gases in the tube A containing the magnetised bar than in the other tube ; this may perhaps explain the negative effect .
The observations of this memoir therefore indicate that , under the powerful and rapidly oxidising conditions described , a magnetised bar becomes metal positive to an unmagnetised one , whereas in the exceptional instances above alluded to , the electronegative effect 1887 .

469 occurs , possibly owing to the presence in the solution of such reducing agents as nascent hydrogen , \amp ; c. In the present incomplete stage of the enquiry these remarks are only offered tentatively .
The effects could not be expected to be large ; I anticipate , however , generally more marked results in a more powerful magnetic field , exerting its influence , perhaps , for longer periods ; but I think the experiments now submitted appear sufficient at least to afford an indication that , under the conditions recorded , magnetisation exerts on iron , in some solutions , an appreciable effect .
The results already obtained in this direction are so far interesting as to encourage further research into the nature of this novel and subtle phenomenon .

" Note on the Functions of the Sinuses of Valsalva and Auricular Appendices , with some Remarks on the Mechanism of the Heart and Pulse .
" By M. Collier* Communicated by Victor Horsley , F.R.S. , Professor Superintendent of the Brown Institution .
Received June 9 , 1887(Abstract .
) The object of the paper is to disprove the present apparently accepted idea , that the sinuses of Valsalva are mere bulgings of the arterial walls , formed by a reflex current induced by the sudden closure of the semilunar valves .
The existence of a reflex current is shown to be impossible , - and the theory of the sudden opening and closure of the semilunar valves is strongly opposed .
The presence of the sinuses of Valsalva is urged as an absolute essential to the mechanism of the heart 's action .
The paper then treats of the action of the auricle and the part played by the auricular appendix , the latter being considered as the only part of the auricle that sensibly and vigorously contracts .
The causes of the first sound of the heart are next alluded to , and the theory that the closure and vibration of the tricuspid and mitral valves assist in its production is refuted .
The action of the ventricle and the mode of the injection of its contents into the aorta is dwelt upon at some length .
The latter part of the paper is devoted to the mechanism of the pulse , and an explanation is given of the so-called dicrotism .
The paper terminates with a summary of the chief points of the conclusions arrived at .
