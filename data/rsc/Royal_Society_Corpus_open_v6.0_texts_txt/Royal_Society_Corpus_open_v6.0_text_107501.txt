Reasons for giving the name Proteo-Saurus to the fossil skeleton which has been described .
By Sir EvrRARD HOME , Bart. V. P. R. S. Read April i , 1819 .
wN the three Papers which I laid before the Society upon the subject of this fossil skeleton , I never ventured to hazard a conjecture upon the place in the chain of created beings , to which the animal belonged .
There were many circumstances which proved its to be unlike any animal at present in existence ; some again making it an approach to the bird ; others that connected it withi fishes ; so that I determined to prosecute the investigation till I had attained more satisfactory information respecting the skeleton ; before I attempted to give the animal a name .
This I think I have now done , the bones of the pelvis being the only ones not yet brought to light , and these are not necessary to enable us to make out the peculiar characteristics of the skeleton .
The discovery of the animal having four feet , established by the annexed drawings , removed it almost entirely from the finny tribe , in which there is no instance of such a mode of progressive motion .
It appears also distinct from the lacertia , in which there is no instance of cupped vertebra .
All that tribe , as well as snakes and frogs , have the vertebre united by regularly formed ball and socket joints .
These facts made it evident that the skeleton belonged to an animal , somewhere intermediate between fishes and lizards , although belonging to neither ; and the name Icthyo-saurus has been suggested by those who saw it in that point of view .
Finding the farther I advanced in my investigation , that the approaches to the lizard were greater and greater , and the only association with fishes was in the cupped vertebrae , I was led to examine the vertebrae of the Proteus , three specimens of which Sir HUMPHRY DAVY had just sent me from Germany , and found them all deeply cupped at both extremities , and the intervertebral cavity filled with a fluid .
I found the same structure in the vertebrae of the siren from Carolina , and in those of the axolotl from Mexico , Dr. LEACH having placed at my disposal a specimen of the axolotl , in all respects similar to that brought to Europe by IIHUMBOLDT , and so well described by CUVIER .
In both of these last species the cavity was filled with elastic ligament , and in the axolotl , the septum between the two cups was not completely closed .
Mons. CUVIER , who has proved in so satisfactory a manner that the proteus and siren are completely formed animals , has expressed his doubts respecting the axolotl ; and hints at its resembling the larva of the salamander ; but leaves the matter open for future enquiry .
When it is mentioned that the salamander has ball and socket joints to its vertebrae , and those of the axolotl are cupped , that celebrated anatomist will agree that these animals belong to different genera ; and admit that , if the axolotl is a larva , the complete animal must have cupped vertebre , which structure , I believe , is only met with in the proteus , 2si the siren , and the axolotl ; and these three when compared together appear to be equally complete aninals .
This opinion is strengthened by the observation , that the parts of the rana paradoxa which are removed when it becomes a frog , contain no bone , all the tail beyond the pelvis being soft cartilage .
The-same remark holds good with respect to the larva of the salamander , and I should believe with all other larvae .
From this statenent it appears , that the proteus fromGermany , the siren from Carolina , and the axolotl from Mexico , not only agree in having lungs and gills , and there .
fore capable of breathing both in air and water ; but in having feet , and cupped vertebrae , and therefore capable of employing both the mode of progressive motion of land animals and of fishes ; and whatever variations there may be among themselves , yet as they all possess these two great distinguishing characters , which no other animals have , they must be allowed to form a distinct tribe , or more properly a distinct class , which , not to multiply terms , I shall call Proteus , till a more appropriate name is given .
The fossil skeleton resembles the Proteus tribe in having feet and cupped vertebra , but differs from it in having long ribs attached to a regularly formed sternum , admitting of the chest being very capacious , and also in having no arches fitted for gills ; it cannot therefore be called a Proteus , although allied to it , in having two modes of progressive motion .
It resembles the lacerta in its mode of breathing , but differs from it in the mode of setting on the ribs on the spine , the form of the legs and feet , and the bony plates of the eye balls ; it cannot therefore be called a lizard .
Its place in the chain of animal creation is clearly pointed out to be between the proteus and lizard , and will be sufficiently marked out by calling it Proteo-saurus .
EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES .
PLATE XIII .
The representation of a portion of the skull of the Proteo-saurus , half the natural size , showing the forni of the nasal bones immediately before the orbit .
This is the only specimen in which these bones have been met with entire .
PLATE XIV .
The representation of the sternum in an entire state , in its natural situation , confirming every thing shown in a Plate in a former paper , and determining its extent , which was not before so exactly known .
The appearance of the ribs , shows that they come forwards towards the sternum in a bony form , as in the camelion , from which however they differ in having no joint , each rib being made up of one piece through its whole length , and at that part which forms the curve there is an increase of substance , making it stronger than the rest .
There is something similar to this in the ribs of the chatodon of Sumatra , a descriptionof which , by Mr. BELL , has a place in the 8Srd volume of the Philosophical Transactions .
The figure is of the natural size , which is the smallest that has come under my observation ; the drawing is made by Mr. DE LA BECHE .
PLATE XV .
Fig. 1 .
The representation of the skeleton of the Proteo-saurus , more entire than any hitherto met with ; it is of the natural size , The different bones of which its composed are sufciently erfeict , and suicientvin'their 915 places , to make any verbal explanation unnecessary .
The drawing is made by Mr. CLIFT .

A vertebra of the proteus from Germany , represented by Mr. BAUER , magnified ten times , to show the cupformed extremities .
Fig. 2 .
A vertebra of the proteus from South Carolina , magnified four times , by Mr. BAUrR , to show the same part .
