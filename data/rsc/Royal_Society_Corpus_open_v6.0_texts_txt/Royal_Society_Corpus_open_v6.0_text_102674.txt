A Letter from Dr John Harwood , LL. D. and F. R. S. to Dr Hans Sloane , R. S. Sect. concerning the forementioned Hypocaustum. .
With Part of two Letters from Mr William Baxter to Dr Harwood , relating to Wroxeter , and the Hypocausta of the Ancients .
SIR , The first notice I had of the Hypocaust discovered at Wroxeter , was from a Letter Mr Baxter communicated to me , which he received from the Reverend Mr Markham , the present worthy Incumbent of that Place ; which gave me occasion of making farther enquiry , by writing to the Reverend Mr Richard Lloyd of Salop ; who , at my request , was so obliging as to take a Journey and view it : The Remarks he then sent me , being mislaid , I must refer you to Mr Lyster 's accurate Model and Description , which I am glad to hear you are about publishing in the Phil. Transactions .
I have for some years cherished an Acquaintance with Mr Lyster , whose Assistance in the late Edition of Camden ought not to have been past over in Silence , but deserved a more public Acknowledgement ; sure I am , had it not been for this Worthy Person , the Memory of so remarkable a Piece of Antiquity wou 'd in all probability have been lost to Posterity .
I think it not impertinent , upon this occasion , that some Account shou 'd be given of the Place where it was discovered , as likewise of the nature or kind of the Antiquity itself : And certainly Wroxeter was one of the most Considerable Military Stations or Colonies the Romans had in this Island ; the City Wall , as appears from a Survey taken by Mr Lyster , was not much less than three Miles in Circumference ; it is not improbable , but that it was founded by Suetonius Paulinus , or after by Agricola , in their March to subdue Mona , now Anglesey : But not to trouble you with my own Conjectures , I send you along with this an Extract out of a Learned Work ( which I hope will ever long see the Light , ) I mean A Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum , which was transmitted to me , by the obliging Author , my worthy Countryman , Mr Baxter , whose Skill and Knowledge in our British , Roman and Saxon Antiquities , as well as in all other useful Literature , is sufficiently known to you , and the rest of the Learned World .
The other Paper I send you , is A Letter I received some time since from the same Worthy Person , in Answer to some Enquiries relating to the Hypocausta of the Ancients .
Since I did my self the Honour of presenting Mr Lyster 's Module to the Society , I have been informed by the justlyadmir 'd Vitruvius of our Age and Nation , Sir Christ .
Wern , that he discovered the remains of such another Hypocaust , when they were laying the Foundation of the Kings House at Winchester .
Mr Christ .
Hunter , in a Letter to Dr Lyster , dated May the 15th , 1702 .
since published in the Transactions , gives an Account of an Antiquity of this kind dug up in Yorkshire , as appears from the Description he gives of it , in the Phil. Trans. for the Months of March and April , An. Dom .
1702 .
Numb. 278 .
p. 1131 .
The Ingenious Mr Edward Lhwyd in his useful Additions to Camden , takes notice of another discovered at Kaer hyn in Caernarvonshire ; one of the Hollow Bricks or Tun13 S nels nels whereof be there describes , and gives a Figure of it , in the Table of the Curiosities added at the end of the Welsh Counties ; it occurs Numb. 8 .
to which I refer you .
Mr Camden himself mentions an Hypocaust discovered at Hope in Flintshire , an Account of which is to be met with in his Britannia , Page .
688 , of the English Edition .
You see , Sir , how ready I am to comply with your Commands , and shou 'd be glad of any other occasion , of farther approving my self Your Obliged Humble Servant .

A second Letter from Mr Baxter to Dr Harwood , concerning the Hypocausta of the Ancients .
SIR ; THe Ancients had two sorts of Hypocausta ; the one called by Cicero , Vaporarium , and by others , Laconicum , or Sudatio , which was a large Sweating Bath .
In which were Triavasaria ahena , called Caldarium , Tepidarium , andFrigidarium , from the Water contained in them .
The other sort of Hypocaustum is not so distinctly handled by Antiquaries , and it was a sort of a Fornax , or Kill to heat their Winter Parlours , or Coenatiunculoe Hybernae .
Erat &amp; Diaeta , sive Coenatiunculoe ( Saith Argol upon Panvinius ) sub qu~a ignis accendebatur : Unde &amp; Caenatio Hypocaustum .
Coenatienes AEstive &amp; Hybernae , are mentioned by Cicero in Epistolis .
The Terrace Floor is called by Vitruvius , Testudo .
Testudines Alveorum in Coumum Hypocausi calefacientur , saith the same Author .
This Hypocausis was called Alveus , and Fornax : And the Man that tended the Fire Fornacator .
The Tubuli seems to have been contrived to convey away the smother , that otherwise would choke the Fornacator .
Thie kind of Stove seems to be graphi .
cally described by P. Statius in Balveo Hetrusci .
~Ubi Languidus igms inerrat AEdibus , &amp; tenuem volvunt Hypocansta vaporem .
Of the Terrace Argol has these words : Testudines sunt pavimenta sub quibus Fornax ardet .
P. S. By the way , I take the word Stove to be derived from AEstus , quasi AEstuvium : there wanting hitherto a
