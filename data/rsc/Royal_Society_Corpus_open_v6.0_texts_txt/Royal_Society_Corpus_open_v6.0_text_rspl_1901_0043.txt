On the Heat dissipated surface as the perpendicular on the tangent plane .
In particular , if , in accordance with Mr. Allen 's experiments * there he possible forms of final uniform motion for a sphere in which the resistance varies as wf or xfi ( ubeing the velocity ) , it was shown that the solution would still be of the form of ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) , provided the distribution of the viscous resistance happens to remain unchanged .
It was pointed out that in an isotropic solid , free of cavities , at rest in a liquid , the stresses are everywhere the same as if each element were separately subjected to the pressure answering to its depth ; but that when cavities exist in the solid the state of matters is altered .
As an example , a complete solution was given for a hollow spherical shell fully immersed .
It was shown that , in a completely solid body , the greatest strain and maximum stress-difference theories agreed in indicating no tendency to rupture , but that when cavities existed , it was otherwise ; in particular , that in the spherical shell there is on either theory a tendency to rupture , greatest at the lowest point , which approximately in a thin shell varies directly as the depth and inversely as the thickness of the shell .

( Abstract .
) The rate of cooling of a hot body in gases at pressures up to one atmosphere has received considerable attention , but with regard to gases at high pressures practically no data were up to the present available .
It was thought therefore that an experimental investigation of the subject might prove of some interest . .
, The experiments were carried out with a horizontal cylmdrica radiator contained in a strong steel enclosure , the enclosure being maintained at about 18 ' C. by a water circulation .
It is shown that the rate at which heat is dissipated by the radiator may be expressed by the following formula E = apa + bp ?

35 The question as to what proportion of the total loss of heat is due respectively to convection , conduction , and radiation is treated at some length .
The influence of experimental conditions , such as the temperature of the gas and the dimensions of the radiator and enclosure , is also studied .
All gases show a rapid increase of the effective conductivity with the pressure .
In air , for instance , the rate of cooling is six times gi eater at 100 atmospheres than it is at atmospheric pressure .
The effect of the high rate at which heat is transmitted through compressed gases is discussed , both from a theoretical and a practical point of view , and the bearing of the results on some problems of modern engineering is considered .
