) The manner in which the hydrolytic activity of an acid is affected by the presence of a neutral salt of the acid has been under consideration thoughout this series of Studies .
In most of the experiments , to limit the number of factors as far as possible and in order that the results might be directly comparable , the salt has been made the only variable .
The salts used have been either halides or nitrates .
The sulphonates are specially suited for such an inquiry on account of the strength of the acids from which they are derived and their rigid neutrality : moreover , as a rule , they are sufficiently soluble .
The present communication has reference to the influence on the activity of tolueneparasulphonic acid of potassium , calcium , strontium , barium , zinc and cadmium tolueneparasulphonate : the magnesium salt was not sufficiently L soluble to permit of its use at the degree of concentration adopted in the 7 case of other salts .
The activity of the acid was determined at 25 ' \#177 ; 0*01 by means of cane sugar .
It is unnecessary to give the results in detail , as they are in every respect .
similar to those quoted in the previous communications and the course of change was in all cases regular .
The final results are given in Tables I-III and in Diagrams B , C , which show ( a ) the effect produced by the potassium salt when used in different proportions : ( b ) the effect produced by the potassium salt in presence of different proportions of acid : ( c ) the effects produced by a variety of salts .
On reference to Table I , it will be noticed that the effect produced by the salt is reduced practically to a third by halving the concentration of the solution : at present , we have no explanation to offer of this remarkable result .
It may be peculiar to the potassium salt or to tolueneparasulphonic acid .
From Table II it will be apparent that the salt has the greater influence the smaller the proportion of acid present .
Table III shows that the effects produced by equivalent amounts of the various salts examined are not very different : it will be noticed that the volumes of the solutions are also not very different .

The Arrhenius hypothesis involves the conclusion that when a neutral salt is added to a solution of the corresponding acid the degree of dissociation of each compound is diminished , so that the concentration of the hydrogen ion , which is assumed to be the effective agent in the solution , should be diminished .
As a matter of fact , the " molecular conductivity " of the mixture is less than the sum of the individual molecular conductivities of the two constituents : nevertheless , the hydrolytic activity of the acid in presence of the salt is greater , as a rule , than that of the acid alone .
This has always been a stumbling block to those who advocate the electrolytic dissociation hypothesis as an explanation of chemical action .
Latterly , the view has been put forward that both the undissociated ( unionized ) and the dissociated molecules are active and not only so but that the former are the more active .
That this hypothesis is being treated seriously is evident from the fact that one of the most recent communications from the laboratory of the Nobel Institute , under the charge of Arrhenius , is entitled\#151 ; " The catalytic activity of the undissociated molecule " ( by Hugh Stott Taylor).* No definite conclusion is arrived at , however .
But it is noteworthy that in an earlier communication by the c same authorf it is pointed out that three hypotheses have been put forward in elucidation of the phenomena under consideration\#151 ; " the hydrate theory of Armstrong and his co-workers : the theory of Arrhenius in which the ions are regarded as exerting an accelerating influence on each other : and lastly , the recent suggestion by Snethlage whereby neutral salt action is explained on the assumption of catalytic activity of the undissociated molecules .
" Then follows the remark , " the first hypothesis has on frequent occasions been shown to be untenable .
" With regard to this last statement , we wish to be informed where and when .
We are not aware that more than the most perfunctory consideration has ever been given to our evidence and arguments\#151 ; Lunden , J indeed , has referred to some of our work but only in a most superficial manner .
Whatever be the ultimate decision with regard to the hypothesis that not only the ions but also the undissociated molecule of the acid possesses specific hydrolytic activity , the admission of such a possibility by the chief advocates of the dissociation hypothesis is of deep significance .

loses its one distinctive feature when thus shorn of its pristine simplicity and , therefore , ceases to be of any particular value as a direct and in itself sufficient explanation of the phenomena of chemical change in solution , the claims put forward on its behalf must be abated.* Our work has involved the careful study of the hydrolytic activity of a number of strong acids as tested by means of cane sugar and of the influence of a variety of salts on the process : it has also included an equally careful study of the hydrolytic activity of chlorhydric and of nitric acid towards methylic acetate and of the influence of salts of these acids .
Moreover , we have sought to determine the influence of non-electrolytes such as acetic ether and various alcohols on hydrolytic changes.f We can , therefore , claim wide personal experience of the phenomena under consideration and that we have a large number of data at our disposal which have been collected with as much care as it is in our power to bestow upon the inquiry : and the data are strictly comparable , as we have always used " weight normal " solutions .
We may here again direct attention to the impossibility , in the case of solutions which are at all concentrated , of basing conclusions on observations made with solutions of " volume-normal strength .
The preliminary experiments made with methylic acetatej were inconclusive : however , together with the earlier observations made by Arrhenius , they afforded proof that the behaviour of this substance as a hydrolyte is altogether different from that of cane sugar .
This was shown to be the case when the investigation was subsequently carried out by one of us , with all possible care , in 1912 ( No. XXIII ) .
Totally different values were obtained by the two methods ; the results obtained with hydrogen chloride at different dilutions are shown in the table on p. 107 .
It was then pointed out that\#151 ; " There is much to show that there is an actual difference due to the character and influence of the hydrolytes .
The effect of substances such as methylic acetate on other substances in solution is very different from the effect of cane sugar .
The large effect that substances which have no great affinity for water , such , for instance , as propylic alcohol , with which methylic acetate may well be compared , have in reducing the solubility of salts in water would tend to show that such substances have a large effect on the condition * F.

Cane sugar has an entirely different effect and it is highly probable that the actual condition of the salts and acids is different in the presence of even small amounts of methylic acetate from what it is in the presence of cane sugar .

It is clear that no attempt has been made by our critics to understand our " theory " \#151 ; which , be it remarked , is not a " hydrate theory " in the ordinary , sense of the term but an attempt , such as no one else has made , to provide a definite and complete explanation of the nature of the changes which attend dissolution and of the interactions which underlie the phenomena of hydrolysis in solutions generally , especially concentrated solutions .
The " theory " of Arrhenius , in which the ions ( of the acid and of the salt ) are regarded as exerting an accelerating influence on each other , is not only\#151 ; when thus barely stated\#151 ; in obvious contradiction to the terms of his own primary hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation but also one which does not appear to be in harmony with the facts .
By themselves , neutral salts generally are entirely without action as hydrolytic agents and no direct interaction of an acid and its neutral salt can be imagined that will either give rise to an agent which is more active than the acid itself or confer specific hydrolytic activity upon the salt .
As a matter of fact , the suggestion made by Arrhenius , in the publication cited by Taylor , * is of far wider import than Taylor indicates\#151 ; it is that foreign substances , in general , increase the osmotic pressure and , therefore , accelerate change in a solution .
But after all , this is no explanation and little more than a paraphrase of patent facts : one * ' Zeit .

unknown ( the cause of the acceleration ) is not to be accounted for and explained by another unknown ( osmotic pressure ) , as two unknown causes do not constitute a known cause .
But the views put forward by Arrhenius in 1889 and subsequently on the influence of salts are full of feeling and clear proof of his appreciation of the situation : divested of their ionic garb , his views probably do not differ very materially from ours .
Over and over again , this acute observer has called attention to variations in the amount of the active as distinct from the inactive part of the bydrolyte\#151 ; but he has assumed that this varies concomitantly with and is conditioned by a variation in the concentration of the hydrogen ions .
Taylor , however , in his recent communication dealing with various ethereal salts , comes to the conclusion that the action of neutral salts is probably independent of the hydrolyte and most followers of Arrhenius appear to have entertained this view and to have overlooked his early statements .
Lunden , it may be added , quotes the fact that a salt may accelerate one set of changes ( the hydrolysis of sugar and of ethereal salts by acid ) whilst it may .
retard another set ( the hydrolysis of ethereal salts by an alkali ) as proof that the action of salts is not to be explained by regarding them as dehydrating agents .
Our view of the matter involves the assumption that the components of a solution act reciprocally and that the interactions which take place in a solution\#151 ; changes such as attend the hydrolysis of sugar or of an ethereal salt , for example\#151 ; are effected within complex systems the components of which are produced by the reciprocal interaction of solvent and solute or solutes .
We consider , moreover , that it is necessary also to take into account the changes which are produced in the solvent itself\#151 ; more particularly when this is water .
In discussing the nature of hydrolytic processes ( XXIV)* we have given the scheme on p. 109 as representing the hydrolysis of a sugar or of an ethereal salt .
The dotted lines indicate the directions in which cleavage takes place , the double arrows those in which the affinities may be supposed to operate within the complex system .
Two of the components of the system are the two substances formed by the reciprocal interaction of the potential electrolytes , hydrogen chloride and water , which thus become activated ( " ionized " ) ; but the hydrolyte is also activated by hydrolation and converted into a substance which though not an electrolyte as a whole behaves " locally " as an electrolyte and is eventually hydrolysed\#151 ; because it is electrolysed locally .

Some of these can interact more or less at a distance\#151 ; in conveying an electric current , for example .
But perhaps the hydrolyte must always be brought into close conjunction with the hydrolyst ; and even if effective in some degree at all concentrations , it is to be supposed that the hydrolyst is more effective at some particular stage of " hydrolation " of the hydrolyte .
From such a point of view , it is not difficult to understand the effect produced by a salt in altering the rate at which hydrolysis is effected .
Salts cannot fail to act as " dehydrolating " agents ( cp .
No. VI ) , both by directly withdrawing water from the solution and by altering the state of the solvent water ; the necessary consequence must be that when a salt is added to a solution the degree of hydrolation of every hydrolated constituent of the solution is lowered ; and up to a certain point this change must involve an increase in the rate at which hydrolysis proceeds .
In the case of strong hydrolytes , such as cane sugar , it will not be easy to pass this point ; but in the case of weak hydrolytes such as the ethereal salts , probably the concentration is soon reached at which the hydrolyte has maximum efficiency and if the salt carjry dehydrolation beyond this point , it will diminish instead of increasing the apparent activity of the acid .
The great difference in behaviour of the two classes of hydrolyte is , doubtless in part , if not in large part , determined by the different effects they themselves produce upon the " condition " of the solution ; it is to be supposed that the ethereal salts determine dissociative changes of a far reaching character in the solvent water w^hich render this a more active dehydrolating agent ; hence it is apparently that the " hydration values " deduced by using ethereal salts are * The oxygen junction of an etheric compound is represented in this scheme .

so low and even negative in some cases .
The apparent inertness of salts in presence of alkalies and the negative effect of a trichloracetate on the hydrolysis of acetic ether by trichloracetic acid observed by Taylor both meet with an explanation from this point of view .
But we have also to take into account the fact that the sugars are hydrolysed only by acids whilst the ethereal salts are more catholic in their behaviour and are equally readily hydrolysed by acids and by alkalies .
In the case of the latter , the immediate neutralisation , as the action proceeds , of acid by base must be the cause of far reaching changes in the constitution of the solution , as not only is the amount of the hydrolyst and of the hydrolyte as well as of the non-electrolyte subject to constant diminution but , at the same time , a second metallic salt is introduced into the system , in place of the base , which probably affects the solution less than the base does ; it may well be that these changes balance and outweigh the effect produced by a salt added purposely , so that this salt is either apparently without influence or even has a negative influence .
It need scarcely be pointed out that , in making these suggestions , we are merely calling attention to the possibilities ; the complexities of the problem are such that it appears to us to be impossible to place any absolute interpretation upon the facts .
The activity of the acid will probably increase up to a point beyond that at which the hydrolyte loses in activity\#151 ; but being the more sensitive , the hydrolyte will suffer more than the acid .
When only a small proportion of acid is present relatively to the salt , the latter will have a still greater opportunity to influence the hydrolyte ; on this account , it is to be expected that salts will have a relatively greater influence in presence of a minor proportion of acid\#151 ; as indeed appears to be the case .
There is every reason to believe that the progressive addition of small equal amounts of acid would involve , in the case of each addition , less change in the solution , whatever the nature of the general effect on the solution may be .
Our experiments show , in fact , that each successive addition of salt to a dilute acid solution has less effect than its predecessor and that salt and acid act alike in exercising an apparent " concentrating effect .
As this " salt effect " is greater per molecular proportion added the less salt is present , it follows that the salt effect should be greatest when least acid is present .
# In fine , if we attempt to explain the phenomena of hydrolysis in terms of the doctrine of " electrolytic dissociation/ ' we plunge into a maze of difficulties and contradictions ; if , however , it be admitted that " hydrolation " ( and the correlative change ) is the effective cause of the activation Morphological Studies of Benzene Derivatives .
Ill of potential electrolytes which attends their dissolution in water , there is no particular difficulty in placing a rational interpretation upon the facts , though the complexities of the problem are such that it is impossible to offer a complete solution .
The compounds formed by the " distribution " of the two components of the electrolyte ( " salt " and solute ) against one another which are postulated by our association hypothesis are the ions postulated by the dissociationists ; but , in addition , our view takes into account the activation of nonelectrolytes and changes in the solvent : indeed , we regard both of these as necessary parts of the process of chemical change in solution and as equal in importance to and strictly correlative with the changes which are involved in the passage of the salt from the state of potential into that of actual activity as an electrolyte .

) The systematic crystallographic inquiry discussed in the present communication was commenced , about fifteen years ago , in the hope that it would be possible , by determining the morphological characters of a considerable number of benzene derivatives of simple constitution , to discover relationships from which definite deductions could be drawn as to the precise manner in which crystalline form is affected by particular alterations in molecular configuration\#151 ; the ultimate object in view being to correlate internal structure with external form .
In planning the work , in order to determine the effect of all the possible variations of the position in the molecule of chlorine and bromine , it was decided to study , in the first instance , as many as could be procured of the di-substituted compounds of the form C6H3R1R2.SO2X containing either chlorine or bromine in place of Ri , R2 and X.
