28 non-granular zone , the oxyntic glands* of Triton form normally a less developed , though distinct , outer zone , this-being less in the posterior than in the anterior oxyntic glands .
In^the glands of Triton cristatus , the outer zone is reduced to a minimum , or is represented only by a greater thinning out of granules in the peripheral part of the cells ; the scanty oesophageal ' glands of the toad show a bare trace of a similar difference in the two'parts of the cell .
In the greater number of the oxyntic glands of the snake , and in the anterior oxyntic glands of the stomach of the toad , neither an outer nor an inner zone'is formed , but in passing backwards to the posterior oxyntic glands in both of these animals , an non-granular zone gradually becomes obvious .

In this brief account the general conclusions which can , I think , be drawn from the study of the pepsin-forming glands are only given , I have made no reference to the important papers of Heidenhain , Griitzner , Swie^cki , Nussbaum , Partsch , and others on the same subject .
I have discussed their work in the fuller paper , which contains the details on which the conclusions here given are based .

( Abstract .
) The author having referred to his pi-evious papers on the coefficients of the iodides of silver and mercury , and of certain chloro* I propose to use the term " oxyntic " ( o^weiv , to make sour , to acidulate ) for those glands which are called by different observers by the inappropriate names " fundus , " " peptic , " or " rennet " glands .
On the Coefficients of Expansion , [ Mar. 31 , bromic]ides of silver , continues the same methods of determining the coefficients of the iodide of lead , and of an alloy of the iodides of lead and silver .
Various alterations in the apparatus , which by the diminution of friction and other means have rendered it much more delicate than before , are described .
The iodide of lead was found to possess three coefficients of expansion ; the first for temperatures between 0 ' and 205'C.\#151 ; '00008317 cubical expansion for 1'C .
; the second , a very high coefficient , between 205 ' C. and 253 ' C.\#151 ; .0006378 ; and the third , for temperatures between 253'C .
and the fusing point\#151 ; .000180 .
The volumes at the different temperatures are given and tabulated , and the curve of expansion is plotted .
The lead silver iodide , PbI2.AgI , is next examined .
It contains in 100 parts :\#151 ; Iodide of lead ... ... .
66*206 Lead ... ... . .
29 '7449 Iodide of silver ... .
33 *794 Silver ... .
15 '5642 Iodine ... .
54 '6909 100 -000 100 -oooo Between 0 ' and 118 ' C. , it slowly expands when heated , with a cubical coefficient for 1 ' C. of .0000306 .
Then for a few degrees ( 118\#151 ; 124 ' C. ) , it simply absorbs heat without contracting or expanding .
On reaching a temperature of 124 ' C. , the mass commences to contract on further heating , and this continues until a temperature of 139 ' C. is attained .
Details of the contraction are given , and the curve of contraction is compared with that of the iodide of silver .
Between 139 and 144 ' C. , heat is again absorbed without change of volume ; and above 144 ' C. the alloy expands somewhat rapidly , with a coefficient of .0001150 .
The volumes at various temperatures between 0 ' and the fusing point are given , and are shown in a curve .
The following points are noted in regard to the alloy:\#151 ; 1 .
It possesses a similar density at three different temperatures , as at 0 ' C. , 130 ' C. , and 282 ' C. 2 .
Although it contains only 33-794 per cent , of iodide of silver , it contracts as considerably during heating as the iodide of silver itself .

While the iodide of silver commences its contraction at 142 ' C. , and finishes it at 145''5 C. , the alloy commences to contract 18 ' C. lower ( viz. , at 124 ' C. ) and finishes 60,5 C. lower ( viz. , at 139 ' F. ) .

The chlorobromiodides of silver ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 25 , p. 292 ) also began to contract on heating ( an effect which , of course , we must attribute solely to the presence of iodide of silver ) , at 124 ' C. , but they finished at 133 ' C5 .
The harsh sounds emitted by the alloy during cooling , and the tremors simultaneously propagated through the mass , prove that violent molecular agitation is going on at such time as the iodide of silver is passing from the amorphous plastic condition to the brittle crystalline condition , within the mass of the iodide of lead .

The fusing point of the alloy is 125 ' C. lower than that of the iodide of silver , which constitutes one-third of its weight , while it is only 19 ' C. higher than that of the iodide of lead , which constitutes two-thirds of its weight .
7 .
If the lowering of the fusing point ( also markedly apparent in the case of the chlorobromiodides of silver ) is due to the fact that similar particles of matter attract each other more powerfully than dissimilar , and hence when the particles of two bodies are mutually diffused , the attraction becomes less , and the molecular motion is consequently more readily assimilated , the same cause may serve to explain the commencement of the phase of contraction on heating the alloy at a temperature of 18 ' C. lower than the substance to which it owes this property .
The lead silver iodide alloy is finally compared with a chlorobrom-iodide of silver , which latter , although it contains 8 per cent , more of iodide of silver than the lead silver iodide alloy , undergoes a contraction on heating , which is more than twenty times less , although in both cases we must regard the effect as solely due to the iodide of silver .

" Permanent Molecular Torsion of Conducting Wires produced by the Passage of an Electric Current .
" By Professor D. E. Hughes , F.R.S. Received March 17 , 1881 .
In a paper on " Molecular Electro-Magnetic Induction , " presented to the Royal Society March 7 , 1881 ( p. 524 ) , I gave a description of the induction currents produced by the torsion of an iron wire , and the method by which they are rendered evident .
The electro-magnetic induction balance there described is so remarkably sensitive to the slightest internal strain in anywise submitted to it , that I at once perceived that the instrument could not only determine any mechanical strain such as torsion or longitudinal stress , but that it might indicate the nature and cause of internal strains .
