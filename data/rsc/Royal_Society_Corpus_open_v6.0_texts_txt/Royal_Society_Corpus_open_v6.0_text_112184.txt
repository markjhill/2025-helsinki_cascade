No cleavage observable .
From the observed minimum deviation of the brightest part of the solar spectrum formed by refraction through the faces 1 00 , 1I 0 , it appears that the index of refraction of a ray in the plane 001 , and polarized in that plane , is about 1-817 .
The refrangibility of the other ray is greater , its minimum deviation through the same faces being 93 ?

The crystals are remarkable for the very unequal extension of the faces of the same simple form , and at first sight look as if they belonged to the oblique system .
The breadth and thickness of one of the largest crystals were 1'l and 0'055 millimetre respectively ; and of two adjacent faces of the form 10 1 , one was about eleven times the breadth of the other .
The distribution of the large and small faces did not appear to be subject to any law ; so that these crystals cannot be regarded as combinations of large and small hemihedral forms .
Twins .

An attempt was made to determine the optical constants of the crystal by observing the minimum deviation of light refracted through a face of the form 10 and one of the opposite faces of the form 10 0 ; the latter were , however , so small that the observation could not be made with much accuracy .
It appeared that for the ordinary ray polarized in a plane parallel to the line 00 1 , the indices of refraction of red light , of the brightest part of the spectrum , and of violet light were about 2 115 , 2 159 , and 2'314 respectively , and that , for the extraordinary ray polarized in the plane 00 1 , the indices of refraction of red light , the brightest part of the spectrum , and of violet light were about 1*890 , 1'973 , and 2-143 respectively .
Carbonate of Thallium .
The faces which have been observed are all in one zone , and exhibit a symmetry which is compatible with either the prismatic or the oblique system .
The crystals probably belong to the prismatic system .
They are aggregated in such a manner as to render it very difficult to isolate a single crystal , or to determine the faces which belong to the different individuals of a group of crystals .
Observed forms:-1 0 0 , 1I 0 , 21 0 , 12 0 .

Twin face 11 0 .
One individual is generally united to each of two others , in this respect resembling the twins of cerussite , aragonite , glaserite , and chrysoberyl .
A cleavage has been observed probably parallel to the faces of the form 1 0 ; it may , however , be parallel to the faces of the form 10 0 , the complexity of the twin crystals being such that it could not be ascertained whether the cleavages observed belonged to one crystal or to two different crystals .
I am indebted to Mr. Crookes , the discoverer of thallium , for the crystals of nitrate , sulphocyanide , and carbonate of thallium , above described .
