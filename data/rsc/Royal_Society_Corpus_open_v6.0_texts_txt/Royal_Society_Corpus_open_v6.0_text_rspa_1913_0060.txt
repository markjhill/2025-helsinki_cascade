( Received May 24 , \#151 ; Read June 26 , 1913 .
) In a recent paper communicated to the Society , the author gave the results of a long series of measurements which indicate that the luminosity curves of colour-blind persons can be deduced from the curve obtained by a person who has normal colour vision , by making the necessary allowance for their colour defect .
In the discussion on this paper , Dr. Edridge-Green mentioned that he had made measurements by a flicker method of the luminosity for a colourblind observer , and that he had found it to agree exactly with the normal.* This result being entirely opposed to the results obtained by the author , it seemed of great interest to investigate the matter further .
This , owing to the kindness of Dr. Edridge-Green and the gentleman ( Mr. C. ) , has been possible , as luminosity curves for Mr. C. and Dr. Edridge-Green have been obtained with the author 's apparatus , and in this note are given the results .
The measurements obtained in the bright part of the spectrum , extending from the red to the bluish-green , are given in the following table:\#151 ; Wave-length of coloured light .

S. Mr. C. Dr. Edridge-Green .

The only difference in his case is that his numbers in the blue and violet are somewhat higher than the normal .
This , as shown in the previous paper , is probably due to the macular pigmentation being rather less than the normal , which also accounts for his luminosity at wave-length 5800 A.U. being a little low .
Mr. C. 's luminosity , on the other hand , is decidedly different from the * Dr. Edridge-Green has been good enough to supply the particulars of the results he has obtained , and these are given in Appendix I. On the Luminosity Curve of a Colour-blind Observer .
37 normal , the luminosity being high on the red side of 5800 and low on the blue side of this point .
This is what one would expect if Mr. C. is partly green-blind , and in the last column of the table are given the values of the luminosity of a person who has only 04 of the normal green sensation obtained by the method described in the aforementioned paper .
It will be observed that these calculated values agree very fairly with Mr. C. 's observed numbers ; in only one case , namely , at 5560 A.U. , is the difference at all marked .
This difference is probably entirely due to errors of observation , Mr. C. never having used the apparatus before and only one series of measurements being taken .
It thus appears that Mr. C. is not an exception and that his case really supports the results given in the previous paper .
When Dr. Edridge-Green examined him red and green lights were compared , these lights being obtained by means of coloured glasses .
No doubt in this way a fairly pure red was obtained .
The green , on the other hand , would contain a considerable proportion of blue light .
It is quite possible that this blue light affected the results , as in the case of most observers the results obtained with blue or violet light by the flicker method are very variable and depend enormously on the brightness of the light employed .
Further , the experimental error when a red is compared directly with a green , as in Dr. Edridge-Green 's measurements , is very much greater than when either is compared with a white .
Further it is to be remembered that in the case of persons having a deficiency in the green sensation the effect produced on the luminosity can only be small , as is shown in the curves given in the previous paper .
Hence 1 think it quite possible that Dr. Edridge-Green 's apparatus may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect the difference between Mr. C. 's luminosity and the normal , particularly when , owing to the mixture of blue with the green , the effect to be observed was probably partly masked by this blue .

Lantern Test.\#151 ; Tested with large aperture , S inch in diameter , from a distance of 20 feet .
Called neutral , green ; red , yellow and green ; green , yellow , orange and red ; and yellow , red and green .
Recognised small points of coloured light on convex mirror from the same distance as I did , but could not tell their colours .
Bead Test.\#151 ; Put red , orange , pink and brown in red division ; orange , pink , and white in yellow division ; green , coral , pink , brown and grey in green division ; and blue and purple in blue division .
Rayleigh Equation ( 0 being full red , 25 full green).\#151 ; Made a match at 17*7 and 18 .
Said my match 15 was not correct , the mixed colour appearing to him darker and greener .
A Comparison of Red and Green by Flicker Method.\#151 ; The luminosities of a red and a green glass were compared with the Simmanee-Abady photometer .
The red glass transmitted rays 780-627 and feebly from 627 to 617 .
The green transmitted rays very imperfectly 605-575 and better the remainder of the spectrum 575-424 .
The filament of an osram incandescent light cannot be seen through both glasses combined .
His ratio was 4-1 R/ G for two consecutive observations , my ratio was 41 R/ G.
