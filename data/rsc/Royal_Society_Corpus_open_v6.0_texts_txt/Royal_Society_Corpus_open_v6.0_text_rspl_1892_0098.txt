On the Leucocytes of Peptone [ Feb. 9 , experiments .
Anatomical evidence is at present so scanty regarding afferent nerve fibres from muscle that investigation of their anatomical relation seems absolutely requisite for examining the problem further .
[ Just as the lumbo-sacral region of the cord may be split along the median plane without interference to the jerk of either side , * so the same may be done without hindering the above ascending reflex abolition of the jerk .
Extinction of the jerk by exciting the central end of the 8th root ( from hamstrings ) affects the jerk four segments higher without in that distance spreading over to the opposite side .
But the excitation affects the jerk of the opposite side if the scope of a considerable length of cord be allowed it .
If in the Cat the cord be transversely divided at the 11th thoracic segment , excitation of the afferent fibres from a hamstring muscle of one side ( right ) applies chiefly to the jerk on the same side ( right ) , but also to the jerk on the opposite .
If , however , in the Cat ( in which jerk belongs to the 6th and 5th lumbar segments ) the cord be transversely cut at or below the 3rd , the extinction from the hamstring nerve is confined to the same side only .
In other words , the presence of additional higher segments seems requisite before the passage of the impulses in question across the median plane of the cord , a fact in curious harmony with an observation by Hallstenf regarding the elicitation of " crossed reflexes " in the frog .
The median posterior column between the 8th and 4th lumbar levels can be removed in toto without impairing the influence of the hamstring nerve on the jerk .
It is clear also that those fibres of the posterior root which pass to Clarke 's column cannot be the requisite afferents , either from the extensor or flexor thigh muscles , because the jerk and the above-described extinction of it are unaffected in the Cat by transverse section of the cord just below the 4th lumbar segment , i.e. , the segment where Clarke 's column stops short.\#151 ; February 8 , 1893 .

565 results of these enumerations here , and to direct attention to the bearing of the results obtained in the case of peptone blood .
I may premise with respect to the methods employed that the enumerations were made by diluting the blood 200 limes with an 8 per cent , solution of magnesium sulphate , which had received a sufficient addition of gentian-violet to stain the cells darkly in the course of a few minutes .
The enumerations were invariably made in duplicate samples of each blood , and in each sample the absolute number of leucocytes was counted on 250 squares of the Gowers haemocytometer .
An agreement within 10 per cent , was exacted between the counts of the duplicate samples .
When this was obtained the counts were added together , and their sum multiplied by 200 to obtain the total number of leucocytes in the cubic millimetre .
The following are the results of my enumerations in oxalated , leech-extract , and peptone blood .

] and other Varieties of Liquid Extravasc The figures in column 2 have not been corrected for the dilution effected by the injection of the peptone solution .
Taking the blood a8 1/ 13 of the body weight the amount of peptone solution introduced would effect a dilution of from 3 9 to 6'5 per cent. The figures in column 2 ought therefore to be increased by this fraction in order to be strictly comparable with the figures in column 1 .
The above tables show that Dog 's peptone blood differs from oxa-lated , leech-extract , and 8 per cent. MgS04 blood ( this last blood was employed throughout as the standard of comparison ) in containing a mere tithe of the normal number of leucocytes .
These missing leucocytes have either remained behind in the tissues or in the internal vessels , or they have disintegrated and have passed into solution in the plasma .
I have ' endeavoured to decide between these alternatives by making comparative estimations of the leucocytes in the mesenteric veins , and in the carotid blood , and further by making a series of careful histological examinations of the various organs which might be expected to harbour the leucocytes ( I selected the liver , the kidney , and the heart muscle for this purpose ) .
In no case was I able to find any trace of stasis or of emigration of leucocytes either in the Dog or in the Rabbit after peptone injections .
I , therefore , feel justified in concluding that in all probability the leucocytes have dissolved in the plasma .
I believe that this view is borne out also by a consideration of the chemical properties of peptone plasma , notably by the fact that it deposits on cooling a heavy precipitate of a nucleo-albumen , which is probably identical* with Wooldridge 's tissue or cell-fibrinogen , in other words , identical with the characteristic albuminous constituent of the white blood coi'puscle .
This " cold precipitate " is not obtained from any other plasma except from oxalate plasma , where I have obtained it , after allowing it to stand for 24 hours before separating it from the white blood corpuscles .
Under these circumstances a certain disintegration of white blood corpuscles takes place in this plasma .
The non-occur-rencef of a " cold precipitate " in leech-extract plasma is in accordance with the fact that this plasma contains no disintegrated leucocytes .
The non-occurrence of the precipitate in salted plasmas ( Halliburton ) probably similarly depends on the fact that the white blood corpuscles do not disintegrate readily in these plasmas , but it may be noted that Wooldridge showed that the addition of neutral salts prevented the precipitation of his " cold precipitate .
" We have thus reason to believe that the occurrence of a precipitate on cooling peptone plasma is due to the fact that the plasma contains * Vide Pekelharing 's identification of Wooldridge 's " cold precipitate , " or " A-fibrinogen , " with the nucleo-albumen of the cell ( ' V erliandl .

2 r 2 On the Leucocytes Peptone Blood .
[ Feb. 9 , leucocytes in solution .
If this is so , we have a ready explanation of some of the other characteristics of peptone plasma , notably of the fact that the C02 in this blood is remarkably diminished as compared with the normal blood , and also of the fact that peptone plasma clots when a stream of C02 is passed through it .
With regard to the diminution of the C02 in peptone blood , Lahousse ( Du Bois-Reymond 's ' Archiv , ' 1889 ) surmised that it was due to a driving out of gas from the blood .
He based this view on the extreme rapidity with which this diminution occurred in the blood after peptone injection .
Blachstein ( Du Bois-Reymond 's 'Archiv , ' 1891 ) , who followed up Lahousse 's work , contributed the following to our knowledge of the question .
A diminution of C02 is found in the Rabbit 's blood as wrell as in the Dog 's blood after the injection of peptone .
In the three experiments reported by Blachstein the C02 of the normal Rabbit 's blood stood to the C02 of the peptonised Rabbit 's blood approximately in the relation of 4 : 3 , 4 : 3 , and 3:2 .
In his three experiments on Dog 's blood the ratios were approximately 3 : 1 , 3 : 1 , and 2:1 .
It will be noticed that the C02 undergoes a greater diminution in Dog 's peptone blood than it does in Rabbit 's peptone blood .
Grandis ( Du Bois-Reymond 's ' Archiv , ' 1891 ) pursued the subject further , and demonstrated that the tension of C02 in peptone blood is approximately double that of the C02 in normal blood .
He indicates that the phenomena point clearly to the liberation of some substance with acid properties in the blood .
In view of these facts I would suggest that this substance with acid properties is in all probability the nucleo-albumen of the white blood corpuscles which have become dissolved in the plasma under the influence of the peptone injection .
The liberation of this substance in the blood would result in a driving out of C02 from its combination with the bases of the blood plasma , and would thus account for the great diminution of the C02 in peptone blood .
The differences in this respect between Dog 's and Rabbit 's peptone blood are in perfect agreement with the results of the enumerations given above for those bloods .
The hypothesis of the driving out of CO-2 by a liberation of nucleo-albumen in the blood wTould further harmonise with the increase of the tension of the C02 in peptone blood , and also with the diminished excretion of C02 after peptone injections ( Bohr , ' Centralblatt f. Physiol. , ' 1888 ) .
The fact that casein ( better , perhaps , called " caseinogen , " Halliburton ) will drive out C02 from CaC03 constitutes an almost perfect analogy with the property of driving out C02 which is here surmised to characterise Wooldridge 's cell-fibrinogen .
In both cases we are dealing with nucleo-albumens .
With respect to the coagulation which is produced in peptone Presents .
1893 .
] plasma by passing a stream of C02* through it , it appears to me that this might be very naturally explained by assuming that we are dealing with a direct reversal of the process which occurs when peptone is injected into the blood .
The C02 coagnlation in peptone blood would upon this hypothesis be due to a precipitation of cell-fibrinogen in the plasma under the influence of an excess of weak acid .
Such a precipitation of cell-fibrinogen in the plasma would be in some sort an equivalent of an addition of cell-fibrinogen to peptone plasma , and would , therefore , naturally inaugurate coagulation .
The coagulation of peptone plasma vitro by C02 would be closely paralleled by the fact that intravascular coagulation after injection of cell-fibrinogen occurs , as I have pointed out ( 'Journ .
of Physiol. , ' 1890 ) , only in the vascular areas where C02 is present in excess .
The precipitation of cell-fibrinogen in peptone plasma under the influence of C02 would further have a close analogy in the precipitation of its congener caseinogen from diluted milk by the addition of excess of dilute acids .

* This coagulation does not occur in any other plasma ; neither does it occur in blood which has been kept liquid by an addition of peptone vitio .
It , may e noted that the addition of even 8 per cent , of peptone to blood vitro does not entail any destruction of leucocytes .
