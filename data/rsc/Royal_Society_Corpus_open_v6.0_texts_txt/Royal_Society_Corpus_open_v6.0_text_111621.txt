( Abstract .
) The surface of which the equation is f ( X , Y , z A , k ) = O,..* ( 1 ) is called for convenience " 1 the surface ( h , k ) .
" The space , or solid , included between the surfaces ( hK , k ) , ( 2 , k ) , is called " I the shell ( 2 , k ) ; ' and that included between the surfaces ( h , k2 ) , ( h , k2 ) iS called " ' the shell ( A , k [ This notation is borrowed , with a slight alteration , from Mr. Cayley .
] It is assumed that the equationl ( 1 ) represents closed surfaces for all values of the parameters h , ke , within certain limits , and that ( within these limits ) the surface ( h , k ) is not cut by either of the surfaces ( h+dh , k ) , ( h , k+dlk ) .
It is also supposed that there exists a value A. of h , for which the surface ( It , , k ) extends to infinity in every direction .
Lastly , it is supposed that if k be considered a function of x , y , z , h , by virtue of ( 1 ) , the two following partial differential equations are satisfied : d2k +d kC + dh'= ( ) die d'yt____ X ) +(+(+ = ?
; dx dy2 dzd in which s(h ) is any function of I ( not involving k ) , and n is any constant independent of I and k. The following propositions are then demonstrated : The potential , on a giveni external point , of a homogeneous solid bounded by the surface ( h , k ) , varies as the mass of the solid , if It vary while k remains constant .
The potentials , on a given external point , of the homogeneous shells ( Ah2 , / s ) , ( hI Are ) are proportional to the masses of the shells .
o The homogeneous shell ( h , k2 ) exercises no attraction on an interior mass .
The external equipotential surfaces of the homogeneous infinitesimal shell ( h k+ dk ) , are the suirfaces ( h , k ) , in which h is arbitrary and k invariable * .
The potential of the homogeneous infinitesimnal shell +2 k+dk ) upon an exterior point , is 47r ck ( h2 d nl i iP_M(h ) and upon an interior point , is !

J dh n0 ( 2 ) , h ( In these expressions ; I(h ) is fi f8( )d , and h at the lower limit in the first , is the parameter of the surface ( h , k ) which passes through the attracted point .
The density of the shell is supposed to be unity .
) The potential of the finite homogeneous shell ( h2k $t ) ( density 1 ) upon any exterior point ( , q 4 ) , is 4-p h7 X dh h , dh +ph " kdh nL h2 / lh)Jh ' +(h)JI 4 4 ) in this expression it has been assumed ( for simplicity ) that hA , is indepenident of k. Also A " , Al are the values of A corresponding to kll , A ' , when h and k vary subject to the relation f ( 4 &gt; , , h , h ) 0 ; and h , in the last integral , is the function of h , 4 , 4 determined by this relation .
The differential equiations ( 2 ) are satisfied in the case of the ellipsoid .
For if we put its equationi in the form x w2 y2 2 7 , a , +2 + -62k+h ++A it is evidenit on inispection that d2k d2k d21c / 111 da2 dy2 dz2 ( a2+h b2+A c2+h and ( dk ) 2+ ( dk ) 2+ dk 2 +4 dk_O In this case we find 4(h ) = ( ( a2 + h)(b2 + k)(c2+ h))4 , and the above general expressions lead to the known results .
