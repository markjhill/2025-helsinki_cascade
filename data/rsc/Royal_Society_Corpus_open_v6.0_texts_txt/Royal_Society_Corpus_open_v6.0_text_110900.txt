" On the Compounds of Tin and Iodine .
" By Thomas H. Henry , Esq. Communicated by Richard Phillips , Esq. , F.R.S. Different properties have been assigned by different authors ( as Sir HIumphry Davy , Gay-Lussac , Boullay and Rammelsberg ) to a combination of tin with iodine .
With a view to explain these discordances , the author instituted the series of experiments detailed in this paper , and which have led him to the conclusion that the substance obtained by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine is a mixture of two salts , differing from each other in their composition , One of these is soluble in water to a slight extent without suffering decomposition , while the other is immediately decomposed on coming into contact with water ; the former being the real proto-iodide described by Boullay , and the latter being a biniodide , a salt of which no particular description had hitherto been given , but which was probably the compound noticed by Sir Humphry Davy as being of a brilliant orange colour .
The author found that this biniodide sublimes at a temperature of 356 ?
F. , while the proto-iodide , if protected from the contact of air , may be heated to redness without subliming .
The author did not succeed in obtaining a combination of tin and iodine corresponding to the sesquioxide , although Boullay supposes that such was the composition of some yellow crystals which were formed by the mixture of solutions of proto-chloride of tin and of iodide of potassium .
A more detailed account of the properties of the iodides of tin is reserved for a future communication .
