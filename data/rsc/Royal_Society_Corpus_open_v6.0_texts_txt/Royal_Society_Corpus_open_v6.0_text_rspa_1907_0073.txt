] In connection with a particular study of the green region of stellar spectra , photographs of the spectra of several of the brighter stars have recently been obtained at Kensington , using the two 6-inch Henry prisms .
An excellent photograph of the spectrum of Rigel is amongst those secured , and the increased dispersion available has afforded evidence which abundantly verified my previous conclusions as to the presence of sulphur in the hotter stars .
With regard to the occurrence of sulphur , I stated in ' Inorganic Evolution/ p. 169 , " The evidence also suggests sulphur , and this is all the more probable because of the simplicity of its spectrum series/ ' In the course of the reduction to wave-lengths of the lines in this recent Rigel photograph , an isolated clearly defined line was found at about X 4815*7 , which had not been observed in any previously studied stellar spectra .
Reference to Watts ' ' Index of Spectra ' showed that there was a strong line of sulphur close to that position recorded by Hasselberg .
On referring to Eder and Valenta 's record* of the sulphur spectrum , a strong line was found of wave-length 4811*967 .
This was so large a discrepancy from Hasselberg 's wave-length that a Kensington photograph of the spark spectrum of sulphur was examined , and a very strong and isolated sulphur line was found at X 4815*3 as nearly as could be estimated .
It thus became fairly obvious that the wave-length 4811*967 given by Eder and Yalenta was , for some reason or other , in error .
Dr. Eder was communicated with in reference to this line , with the result that he explained the discrepancy as being due to a clerical error in publishing the wave-lengths .
It should have been 4814*967 .
To test further whether there was a real identity between the stellar and the laboratory lines , the new Rigel spectrum was carefully examined in the region covered by the characteristic group of sulphur lines extending from X4142 to X4175 .
It was found that there were stellar lines\#151 ; none of them very strong , but undoubtedly genuine\#151 ; agreeing , as nearly as could be estimated , with each of the members of that group .
Other parts of the spectrum also showed lines in the position of other strong sulphur lines .
In fact , there are only about three of the strongest sulphur lines , in the region * f Beitrage sir Photochemie und Spectralanalyse/ p. 282 , Vienna , 1904 .

51 where a comparison is possible , which appear to be lacking in the stellar spectrum .
These exceptions will be discussed later .
The following table gives the wave-lengths of the strongest sulphur lines as measured from the Kensington photographs of the vacuum-tube and spark spectra , the vacuum-tube wave-lengths of the corresponding lines as recorded by Eder and Yalenta , and the wave-lengths and intensities of the Eigel lines which closely agree in position with the sulphur lines .
For the sulphur lines beyond X 4553 , Eder and Yalenta 's wave-lengths of the vacuum-tube lines are used in the tables , as the existing Kensington photographs of the sulphur spectrum in that region are not of sufficient dispersion to furnish accurate reductions to wave-length .
In the region 4100\#151 ; 4553 the Kensington reductions of the wave-lengths of the sulphur lines are given in the table for both vacuum-tube and spark spectra .
The former were reduced by means of Hartmann 's formula from a photograph taken with the 3-inch Cooke spectrograph , the latter by a direct comparison of the Rowland grating spectra of the sulphur spark and the sun .
The wave-lengths of the stellar lines were obtained in most cases by interpolation between lines whose wave-lengths are well known .
Foi several of the fainter lines which would not stand magnification under the micrometer the wave-lengths were obtained as accurately as possible by direct comparison with a solar spectrum photographed with the same instrument .
The stellar wave-lengths must be accepted as only provisional , but they are probably accurate within 0'3 tenth-metres .
A comparison of the wave-lengths of the sulphur lines , as reduced from the spark spectrum and vacuum-tube spectrum respectively , shows that in nearly all cases the vacuum-tube wave-lengths are about 0'5 tenth-metres less than the spark wave-lengths .
This has been pointed out before by Eder and Yalenta , * who give a photographic comparison of some of the stronger sulphur lines as they respectively occur in the vacuum-tube spectrum and the spark spectrum , and show that the sharply defined lines of the former occupy positions near the more refrangible edges of the diffuse lines of the latter .
Notable exceptions to this , as was also pointed out by Eder and Yalenta , are the two strong lines at XX 4253'8 , 4285-1 which show practically no shift in passing from one spectrum to the other .
These two lines occur quite prominently in all the Kensington spectra of sulphur , under whatever conditions they have been obtained , but they are of a different nature to the other strong sulphur lines , being far more compact and sharply defined .
In Hagenbach and Konen 's record of the sulphur spectrum , the reproductions of their photographs show these lines as having far inferior intensity to those * ' Beitrage sir Photochemie und Spectralanalyse , ' Plate 15 , Vienna , 1904 .

53 of the same lines in the Kensington and Eder and Yalenta 's photographs .
It seems fairly probable , then , that under certain conditions these sulphur lines disappear from the laboratory spectra , and that similar conditions pertain in the absorbing atmosphere of the star , in the spectrum of which the lines in question cannot be traced .
Another line which is doubtfully present in the star is that at X 4295 .
There are several weak lines in Rigel from about 4290 to 4303 , most of them probably due to proto-iron or proto-titanium , but the nearest to the wavelength of the sulphur line appears to be about 4294*3 .
With the possible exception of line 4163*0 , none of the Rigel lines given in the preceding list is given by Pickering* in his record of lines in the stellar spectrum .
He gives a line at 4163*9 and makes it identical with 4163*9 in \#171 ; Cygni .
Comparison of the Kensington two-prism photographs of these two stellar spectra , however , shows most distinctly that they are not identical .
The Rigel line is probably 4163*0 ( sulphur ) , that in \#171 ; Cygni undoubtedly 4163*9 ( proto-titanium ) .
The following table contains the lines recorded by Keelerj* in the spectrum of Rigel in the region between Hp and D. He did not give any origins for the majority of the lines .
The probable origins added to the table are suggested as a result of the Kensington investigations of the relation of the stellar lines to lines in terrestrial spectra .

54 Sir Norman Lockyer .
On the Presence of [ May 8 , found to be represented in the star are the two lines 5033 and 5454 .
As there are , according to Eder and Yalenta , two strong sulphur lines at W 5032*66 and 5454*00 respectively , it would appear that this is genuine confirmatory evidence that sulphur is really represented in the Bigel spectrum .
The line 5033 is well marked in the Kensington stellar spectrum , but Keeler 's line 5454 is beyond the region over which the Kensington photograph extends .
There are several other strongly marked sulphur lines in the region 5400 to 5500 , and it is quite probable that if stellar photographs are obtained extending more into the yellow than the existing one , these lines will also be found to occur in the stellar spectrum .
The best-marked Eigel lines which are probably due to sulphur have been looked for in the spectra of a Cygni and Sirius , which represent the next lower stage on the temperature classification .
The lines cannot , however , be traced .
If they do really exist in these spectra , they are so exceedingly faint \amp ; s to defy detection in the existing stellar photographs .
In Bellatrix , however , representing a higher stage than Eigel , some of the stronger Eigel-sulphur lines , of which may be mentioned 4715*9 and 4815*7 , are certainly present , but not so well marked as in Eigel .
A really successful photograph of the Bellatrix spectrum has not , however , been yet obtained with the two prisms , and it is expected that when one is obtained other sulphur lines will be traced .
It has not yet been possible to investigate whether the lines occur at the Alnitamian stage , as no satisfactory spectrum of a star of this type has yet been photographed with two prisms .
The excellent photograph of the Eigel spectrum in which the sulphur lines were traced was obtained by Mr. W. E. Eolston .
The stellar lines were found , and their identity with the sulphur lines established , by Mr. F. E. Baxandall , who , with the assistance of Mr. H. E. Goodson , reduced the wave-lengths of the stellar and terrestrial lines .
The photographs of the sulphur spectrum used in the discussion were taken by Mr. C. P. Butler .
Mr. Baxandall has also taken part in the preparation of the paper .

] Sulphur in some of the Hotter Stars .
55 [ Addendum , October 17 , 1907 .
] Since the foregoing paper was written , further facts have been obtained regarding the occurrence of sulphur lines in the hotter stars .
In the paper it was mentioned that two strong sulphur lines of special behaviour , 4253*8 , 4285*1 , are lacking in the Rigel spectrum , in which the strongest ordinary spark lines occur .
These two lines have since been found to exist in spectra representing higher stages of temperature than that of Rigel , such as 7 Orionis ( Crucian ) and e and k Orionis ( Alnitamian ) .
Reference to Pickering's* records of stellar spectra shows that he also gives the lines in the stars named below , thus :\#151 ; Star ( Pickering ) .

\#151 ; .
It will be noticed that the relative intensity of the two lines is , in general , the same in the different stars , 4254*1 being the stronger .
This agrees with their relative intensity in the sulphur spectrum itself .
In a paper on " The Spectra of Silicon , Fluorine , and Oxygen/ ' Luntf records an oxygen line at 4254*22 , and associates it with a stellar line at the same wave-length .
In the light of the other oxygen lines occurring in the Crucian and Alnitamian stars , the stellar line in question is too strong to be accounted for solely by the oxygen line , which is relatively weak .
The true origin is far more likely to be sulphur , especially as the line is generally accompanied by 4285*1 , which cannot be attributed to oxygen .
In fact , the two stellar lines under discussion cannot be satisfactorily explained by reference to the lines of any of the other elements already shown to be represented in Crucian and Alnitamian stars .
These are helium , hydrogen , silicium , calcium , magnesium , oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon .
As these sharply-defined lines in the sulphur spectrum decrease in intensity , relatively to the diffuse lines , when self-induction is introduced , we should expect them to appear at a higher level of stellar temperature than the set of sulphur lines which appears in Rigel ( in which star , it must be remembered , the sharp lines are missing ) .
The fact , therefore , that there are * ' Annals Harv .

corresponding lines in the Crucian and Alnitamian stars , which come higher up the temperature curve than the Eigelian , seems to leave no doubt as to the genuineness of the identification .
The Eigelian group of sulphur lines has not been detected in e Orionis , though one or two of the strongest lines have been traced in the best Kensington spectrum of Bellatrix ( Crucian ) .
The following represents the relative and inverse behaviour of the two sets of lines in stellar spectra .

) The question has been often raised of whether or not helium is a product of thorium radio-activity .
My own view throughout has been that it is.* * * S Mr. Boltwood has recently argued that the helium in radio-active minerals may always be attributed to the action of the uranium-radium series of transformations.*)- I wish in the present note to draw attention to a case where that view is clearly untenable .
Prof. Julius Thomsen , of Copenhagen , described , in 1898 , j a helium mineral from Ivitgut , Greenland , similar in some respects to fluor spar , but containing rare earths .
Eecently he has determined the quantity of helium liberated on heating as 27 c.c. per kilogramme .
S Prof. Thomsen kindly sent me a supply of this mineral .
I have carefully tested it for radium , and find that it contains no more than the traces which are ubiquitous in rocks and minerals .
The quantity found was , in fact , about * 'Boy .
