164 Deferred Papers .
[ June 16 found in all other Mammals concern the rhinencephalon , the hippo-campus , and the cerebral commissures .
The olfactory bulb is quite free from the frontal portion of the hemisphere .
Its stalk is exceedingly thin , and connected with the under surface of the hemisphere near the median line .
The portion of the mantle which receives it is separated from the general surface by a deep incision ( ectorhinal fissure ) , which extends in depth almost to the mesial surface .
The pyriform lobe thus formed merges with the general surface far back on the mesial aspect of the hemisphere , at the spot at which the hippocampal fold commences .
The hippocampus is very extensive ; it lies entirely dorsal to the velum interpositum , and is continued forwards to the extreme anterior end of the brain .
With the rhinencephalon it forms therefore a loop , open in front .
No commissural fibres cross the incisura pallii longitudinalis dorsally to the hippocampus .
For reasons stated in his paper , the writer considers that fibres which cross from one hemisphere to the other on the peduncular ( portal ) side of the fascia dentata cannot be homologous with the corpus callosum , and he therefore concludes that this structure is completely absent from the brain of Ornithorhynchus .
A strong commissure or decussation lies within the concavity of the rhinencephalic loop , but its fibres are restricted in their distribution to the hippocampal fold , as shown in sections stained after Weigert 's method .
The convex portions of the mantle are entirely dependent upon the anterior commissure for mutual connexion .
Exception being made to the incisura rhinalis and dentary fossa as not belonging to the category of fissures , the cortex is completely destitute of convolution .
Each hemisphere of the brain was cut into a series of sections , the anatomical features of which were described in detail .
