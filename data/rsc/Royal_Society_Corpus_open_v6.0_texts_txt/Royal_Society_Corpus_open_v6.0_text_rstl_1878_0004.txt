In my first paper on this subject I have shown that by the action of chlorine on a normal paraffin a primary chloride and a secondary one of the general formula Hc'h1}CHC1 are formed simultaneously."* I subsequently pointed out that other secondary chlorides , which are indicated by theory , are also probably produced at the same time.t I am still engaged with an investigation of this subject .
It appeared of interest also to examine the action of bromine on the paraffins .
The present paper contains the first results of this research .
Cahours and Pelouze state in their well-known paper on Caproyl Hydride ( Hexane ) that , while chlorine converts it into caproyl ( hexyl ) chloride C6 H13 Cl , bromine at once replaces two atoms of hydrogen , the dibromide C6 H12 Br2 being formed ; if , therefore , an equal number of molecules of the two bodies act on each other , one half of the hydrocarbon is not attacked . !
Soon after I examined the action of bromine on heptane , and found that when a mixture of the two substances is exposed to the sunlight , or heated in sealed tubes to 100 ' , hydrobromic acid is slowly evolved , but the substitution products thus formed began to decompose at 110 ' , hydrobromic acid being given off and carbonaceous matter left behind.^ The satisfactory results which I obtained by acting with chlorine on the vapour of the boiling hydrocarbons , which were thus almost entirely converted into monochlorides , induced me to try the action of bromine under similar conditions .
The apparatus which I employed was very similar to that described in my former paper .
It consisted of a flask holding about one litre , which was closed with a doubly-perforated cork , provided with a bulb-funnel , with glass stop-cock , the tube of which reached half-way down the neck of the flask , which was connected with the lower end of * Pliil .

H a reversed Liebig 's condenser .
As the hydrobromic acid which is evolved during the reaction carries off some of the volatile hydrocarbons , the upper end of the condenser was bent downwards and connected with a flask containing a solution of caustic potash , in which , however , the tube did not dip , as if that had been the case , the liquid would have been sucked back into the hydrocarbon when the reaction slackened ; one absorption flask was found sufficient to condense the hydrobromic acid completely .
To ascertain , in the beginning of each experiment , whether all parts of the apparatus were tight , the cork of the flasks containing the soda solution was provided with a bent tube dipping into a little water .
I. Normal Hexane .
About 300 cub. centims. were heated in the large flask , and when briskly boiling , the stop-cock of the funnel-tube containing the bromine was so far turned that the liquid running down the tube was completely converted into vapour .
On a bright day the colour of the bromine disappeared at once ; on a dull day , however , the action was much slower and ceased altogether in gas-light .
It was very curious to observe how , on a clear day , when the sun was suddenly obscured by dark clouds , the flask became filled with brown vapours , which disappeared again as quickly as the clouds before the sun .
The action was stopped before one-half of the hydrocarbon was attacked , and the product shaken with solid caustic potash , to free it from hydrobromic acid .
On distilling , the excess of hexane came over first ; the thermometer then began to rise , but even below 100 ' decomposition commenced , hydrobromic acid being evolved and a brominated liquid distilling over , while a black mass was left behind .
In order to prevent this decomposition another portion was distilled with steam , but with no better success ; a tarry or carbonaceous matter was left behind , and the distillate contained besides hexane , brominated hexane , hexene , and hydrobromic acid .
On submitting the brominated product to fractional distillation some of it began to decompose again , with the evolution of hydrobromic acid and blackening .
But on continuing the distillations this decomposition gradually ceased , and a large quantity of a colourless liquid , boiling at 143\#151 ; 145 ' , and having a pungent and aromatic smell , could be isolated without difficulty .
The low boiling point shows that this body was not primary hexyl bromide , which boils at 155'5'.* Besides it , a small quantity of a higher boiling liquid was obtained , which , however , by further distillations yielded some more of the bromide boiling at 143\#151 ; 145 ' , while the highest boiling portion completely decomposed .
The fractions distilling between 68 ' ( the boiling point of hexane ) and 143 ' were very small , and consisted of mixtures of the hydrocarbon and the bromide , of which some more could be isolated by carrying on the distillation .
The hexyl bromide was decomposed by heating it in sealed tubes with potassium * Lichen and Janecek , Liebig 's Ann. , 187 , p* 126 , MR. C. SCHORLEMMER ON THE NORMAL PARAFFINS .
acetate and glacial acetic acid ; the reaction commenced at 100 ' , proceeded rapidly at 120 ' , but to ensure a complete decomposition it was found necessary to heat to 150 ' .
The product consisted of a hexyl acetate and a little hexene , which were readily separated by distillation .
The acetate possesses the characteristic smell of the acetic ethers , and boils at 146\#151 ; 1,50 ' ; it was converted into the alcohol by heating it with caustic potash and a little water ; the hexyl alcohol thus formed boiled , after drying it over potassium carbonate and removing a little hexene by distillation , at 136\#151 ; 140 ' , and smelled like methylbutyl carbinol .
It was oxidised in the cold by chromic acid solution in the manner described in my last paper .
A neutral liquid was thus obtained possessing the odour of methylbutyl ketone ; it began to boil at 127 ' , and the greater portion distilled between this temperature and 130 ' ; the thermometer then rose rapidly , and the residue had the odour of a compound ether , and consisted , as the following experiments show , undoubtedly , of hexyl butyrate .
Besides these compounds a very small quantity of acids had also been formed which , judging by the smell , consisted of acetic acid and butyric acid ; a few drops of dilute soda were sufficient to neutralise them .
The ketone and ether were again mixed and heated with the oxidising mixture , which contained twice as much water as in my previous experiments , nearly to the boiling point , and the acids converted in the sodium salts , as described in my former paper .
Two series of experiments were made to ascertain their composition .
As it appeared very probable that only acetic acid and butyric acid were formed , the sodium salts were distilled with sulphuric acid and a little water , and the distillate after diluting with much water repeatedly distilled , the first distillates and the residues being kept separately .
The first distillate and the last residue were then converted into the silver-salts by boiling them with silver carbonate , and the silver determined by ignition .

From these experiments it follows that by the action of bromine on normal hexane , the secondary hexyl bromide , ch : }chb'or methyl-butyl-carbyl bromide is formed .
II .
Normal Heptane .
This hydrocarbon is more readily attacked by bromine than hexane , and the reaction goes on , but of course very slowly , in artificial light .
This is probably due to the higher temperature at which the substitution takes place .
The phenomena are however in both cases quite similar .
A portion of the product is decomposed by distillation , carbonaceous matter , hydrobromic acid , and heptene being formed , and a heptyl bromide distilling between 165\#151 ; 167 ' is obtained , having a pungent and aromatic odour .
It was analysed with the following result:\#151 ; 0*326 gave 0*3414 silver bromide .

The products are converted by further oxidation into normal pentylic acid and acetic acid , as the following analyses of the silver salts show :\#151 ; MR. C. SCHORLEMMER ON THE NORMAL PARAFFINS .

64-67 The analysis of the first fraction differs from the calculated percentage 1 *5 per cent. This is easily explained .
I have already shown that the petroleum from which the heptane was obtained contains also an isoctane C8 H18 boiling only 15 ' higher than normal heptane .
The latter undoubtedly contains some of the former , and its presence gives rise to the formation of a fatty acid containing more carbon than pentylic acid .
That the latter acid is the normal compound was proved by converting it into calcium pentylate ; a cold saturated solution of this salt deposits on heating small glistening plates , which , after cooling , gradually dissolve again .
As result of this investigation it appears that by the action of bromine on normal paraffins only secondary bromides of the general formula , C"HCH*}CHBr are produced , but not a trace of primary bromide , or that the methyl groups which are present in these hydrocarbons , and which are readily attacked by chlorine , are not touched by bromine at all .
In addition to the secondary bromides other products are formed , which on distillation either decompose completely , or are resolved into hydrobromic acid and non-saturated hydrocarbons , which are'probably olefines .
The formation of these may be explained by assuming that besides the secondary bromides which I have described , others , which the theory indicates , are also formed , and that the latter , by the action of heat , split up into an olefine and hydrobromic acid .
I have endeavoured to isolate these olefines , which I obtained mixed with paraffins , by adding bromine very carefully to the well-cooled mixture as long as its colour disappeared .
The liquid , after being shaken with solid potash to remove free bromine and a little hydrobromic acid , was distilled by itself and with steam , but in both cases the bromides underwent complete decomposition , with the formation of a black mass and hydrobromic acid .
I hope , however , by continuing this research , to ascertain the nature of the products which are formed together with the volatile bromides .
