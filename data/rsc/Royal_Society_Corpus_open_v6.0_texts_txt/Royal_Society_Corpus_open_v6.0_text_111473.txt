" On the Tangential of a Cubic .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received February 11 , 1858 .
( Abstract .
) In my " Memoir on Curves of the Third Order , " Phil. Trans. vol. cxlvii .
( 1857 ) , I had occasion to consider a derivative which may be termed the " tangential " of a cubic , viz. the tangent at the point ( x , y , z ) of the cubic curve ( , Xx , y , z)3=0 meets the curve in a point ( 4 , , ) , which is the tangential of the first-mentioned point ; and I showed that when the cubic is represented in the canonical form x3+y3 +z3+ 6lxyz= 0 , the coordinates of the tangential may be taken to be x(y3-3 ) : y(z3-x3 ) : z(x3-y3 ) .
The method given for obtaining the tangential may be applied to the general form ( a , b , c , f , g , h , i , j , k , lsx , y , z)3 : it seems desirable , in reference to the theory of cubic forms , to give the expression of the tangential for the general form ; and this is what I propose to do , merely indicating the steps of the calculation , which was performed for me by Mr. Creedy .
V. " On the Constitution of the Essential Oil of Rue .
" By C. GREVILLE WILLIAMS , Esq. , Lecturer on Chemistry in the Normal College , Swansea .
Communicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received February 15 , 1858 .
( Abstract .
) The essential oil of rue and its products of decomposition have been examined by several chemists .
Will analysed it many years ago , and deduced the formula C28 I28 03 as the result of his analyses .
The principal investigation of it was made by Gerhardt , who regarded it as the aldehyde of capric acid .
The production of capric acid from it by the action of nitric acid , as observed by Gerhardt and also by Cabours , has been considered as corroborative of the 20 carbon formula .
It is evident , however , that the formation of capric acid merely indicates the aldehyde to contain not less than 20 equivalents of carbon .
Some experiments made with a view to the production of certain new derivatives of capric aldehyde , led the author to believe the ideas generally entertained regarding the formula of the oil to be erroneous .
Before continuing his experiments , he has therefore reinvestigated the nature of the oil itself .
In order to obtain the aldehyde in a state of purity , advantage was taken of the tendency of the aldehydes to combine with the alkaline bisulphites .
The oil obtained from the ammoniacal bisulphite of the aldehyde was carefully analysed .
The mean of eight very coincident analyses gave , Mean .

Recent researches having demonstrated that no acid of the series C " H " 04 with 22 equivalents of carbon has yet been isolated , and no other derivative with a 22 carbon formula being known , the author has given the name enodyle to the radical homologous with acetyle contained in this substance .
Enodic aldehyde is a colourless fluid of a fruity odour , quite different to that of the rue plant .
Its density is 0'8497 at 15 ? .
Agitation will cause it to solidify at 7 ?
into a snow-white mass resembling camphor .
Its boiling-point is 213 ? .
Rue oil yields a small portion of fluid boiling at 232 ?
, containing the aldehyde of lauric acid .
It was not obtained absolutely free from the first fluid .

The more volatile are composed chiefly of an isomer of oil of turpentine ; the less volatile are hydrates apparently homologous with an isomer of borneol .
