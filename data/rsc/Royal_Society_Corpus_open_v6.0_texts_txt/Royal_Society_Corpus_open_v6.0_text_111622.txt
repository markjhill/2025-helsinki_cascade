) This supplement gives the dimensions , tonnage , indicated horsepower , speed , and consumption of fuel , of the steam-ships whose eniginies were the subjects of the experiments referred to in the original paper .
Results are arrived at respecting the available heat of combustion of the coal employed , and the efficiency of the furnaces and boilers , of which the following is a sumrmary Available beat of Total heat of comcombustion of 1 lb. Available bustion of 1 lb. of of coal in ft.-lbs .
