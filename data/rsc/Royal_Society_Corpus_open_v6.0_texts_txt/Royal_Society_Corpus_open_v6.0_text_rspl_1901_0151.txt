( Abstract ) This paper gives an account of experiments on the relative conductivities of gases under the action of Becquerel radiation from various radio-active bodies .
It is first explained that in order to determine the constants fundamentally involved , the following conditions must be complied with:\#151 ; , ( 1 .
) The E.M.F. applied to the conducting gas must be great enough to consume all the ions produced by the rays .
( 2 .
) The pressure of the gas must be low enough to prevent any appreciable fraction of the radiation being absorbed by it .
If this is not so , then the layers of gas nearer the radio-active surface are exposed to stronger radiation than those further ' from it .
The effective strength of the radiation will thus depend on the absorbing power of the gas at the particular pressure , and the observed ratio of the conductivities of two gases at the same pressure will no represent the ratio of their conductivities under radiation of a given St Thfcriterion applied to test whether the absorption was appreciable , was to examine the conductivity at different pressures .
The range was ascertained within which the law of approximate Pr0PJtl0n^ to the pressure held good .
In the experiments , care was taken to ke p the pressure well within that range .
