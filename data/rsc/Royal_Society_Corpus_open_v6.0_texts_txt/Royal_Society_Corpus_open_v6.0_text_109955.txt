] The sudden alterations in the rates of chronometers , when taken &gt; on board ships , are generally ascribed to the motion of the vessel ; but l 31 from circumstances connected with the chronometers of theDorothea and 'lrent , during the late voyage to the North Pole , the author is induced to refer these alterations to other causes : he found that in all cases the gaining rates were increased and their losing ones diminished on ship-board .
That this acceleration does not arise from the ship 's motion , was shown by its occurrence when the Dorothea and Trent were beset with ice , and when they were at anchor close in shore without any perceptible motion ; nor does it appear that change of temperature was at any time the cause of this change of rates .
That the iron in ships becomes magnetic is shown by its polarity , the whole forming , as it were , a large magnet , having its south pole on deck and its north pole below .
The inner rim of the balance of chronometers , which is made of steel , will , therefore , be liable to magnetic action , which will be , sufficient to cause a very sensible alteration in their rate of going .
Mr. Fisher concludes this communication with some account of experiments on the action of magnets upon chronometers placed in various positions with respect to their balances , by which it appears that an acceleration in these cases always ensues .
It also appears probable , he observes , that the force of the bala.nce spring is affected by the same cause , since chronometers in which they are made of gold , though more difficult to adjust , keep better rates at sea than others .
An appendix , containing tables of rates furnished by Mr. Colem-an , is annexed to this paper .
