A Paper was read , entitled , " An Account of certain new Facts and Observations on the Production of Steam , " byjacob Perkins , Esq. Communicated by Ralph Watson , Esq. F.R.S. Having observed that water on the surface of melted iron was very slowly affected by the heat , although it exploded violently when the same fused metal was dropped into it , the author made a series of experiments on the time required for the evaporation of the same quantity of water successively poured into a massive iron cup , at first raised to a white heat , and then gradually cooled by the addition and evaporation of the water .
The first measures of water were longer in being evaporated than those subsequently added , in consequence of the reduction in the temperature of the iron , until this temperature reached what the author calls the evaporating point , when the water was suddenly thrown off in a dense cloud of steam .
Below this temperature , the time required for the complete evaporation of the same measure of water became longer in proportion as the iron was cooler , until it fell below the boiling point .
The author accounts for these results from the circumstance that when the metal is at the higher temperatures , the water placed on its surface is removed from contact with it by a stratum of interposed steam .
From these and other experiments , he is led to infer the necessity of keeping water in close and constant contact with the heated metal in which it is contained , in order to obtain from it , in the shortest time , the greatest quantity of steam .
The reading of a Paper , entitled , " On certain Irregularities in the Magnetic Needle , produced by partial warmth , and the relations which appear to subsist between terrestrial Magnetism and the geological Structure and thermo-electrical Currents of the Earth , " by Robert Were Fox , Esq.
