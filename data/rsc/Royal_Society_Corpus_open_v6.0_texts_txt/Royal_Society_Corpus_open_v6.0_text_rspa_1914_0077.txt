Introduction .
Mey* has shown that when the liquid alloy of sodium and potassium is made the cathode in a discharge tube , then , on passage of a current , if the gases nitrogen and hydrogen are present they are absorbed .
The inactive gases , such as helium , are not affected , however , so he concludes that this would form a very convenient method for the preparation of helium where hydrogen and nitrogen are present as impurities .
He mentions the rate of absorption compared with the quantity of electricity passing , and it is much larger than the absorption of gases by the walls of the discharge tube during the passage of a discharge .
It is thought that the gases form chemical compounds with the sodium and potassium\#151 ; the nitrogen giving the nitride and hydrogen the hydride .
The following experiments were made to see if there were any relation between the amount of gas absorbed and the quantity of electricity passing during discharge\#151 ; the measurements being made with varying pressures of the gas .
In order to measure the electricity a small voltameter containing sulphuric acid was employed , and the quantity of hydrogen evolved in it was .
compared with the amount of gas absorbed .
The current employed had to be a uni-directional high-tension one .
For this , an induction coil with an Oliver Lodge valve in the secondary was used .
Provided the current was not too large this arrangement gave satisfactory results .

Preliminary Experiment .
Fig. 1 shows the apparatus used at first .
The nitrogen was prepared in a vessel , A , by allowing air to stand over phosphorus for several hours .
The gas then passed over phosphorus pentoxide and so into a calibrated reservoir B , from which it entered the discharge tube , being fed in by manipulation of the head of mercury .
C was an oil gauge which gave the absolute pressure of the gas .
Castor oil was originally used in the manometer , but later Fleuss oil was substituted , as it did not contain much air , and moreover was more sensitive .
The alloy , when placed in the apparatus , became coated with the oxide , but it was found that if a discharge was passed in rarefied nitrogen the * 'Deutsch .

scum at the surface of the alloy disappeared with a little shaking , leaving a bright layer .
In making a determination with the metal as cathode , the apparatus having been exhausted by means of a Toepler pump , a small quantity of nitrogen passed into the apparatus .
By altering the level of the mercury in B the pressure was kept constant during absorption , and from the initial and final readings of the volume of gas in B the amount of nitrogen which had been absorbed at the indicated pressure was noted .
This was ALLOY NITROGEN Fig. i. then compared with the volume of hydrogen which had been liberated in the voltameter .
This method of feeding in the nitrogen gave unsatisfactory results owing to the lack of sensitiveness of the oil in the manometer , for it was found impossible to supply the nitrogen at such a rate that the pressure remained constant throughout .
Hence the amount of gas indicated by B was not the true quantity which had been absorbed .
The following method of feeding in the nitrogen was then substituted .

Absorption of Nitrogen and Hydrogen .
In this method the apparatus shown in fig. 2 was employed .
The reservoir was removed and in its place a known small volume between two taps Ti and and T2 was used .
By opening and then closing it a known volume of gas Absorption of Gases in the Discharge Tube .
501 practically at atmospheric pressure is enclosed between Ti and T2 .
On opening T2 the gas will fill the apparatus and the alteration in pressure which it produces can be read from the manometer .
By allowing several volumes to enter in this way , and noting the pressure before and after , the amount of gas which causes a recorded difference of pressure \#151 ; read from the gauge\#151 ; is found .
Thus , when absorption takes place , from the initial and final readings of the manometer , the amount of gas at atmospheric pressure which has disappeared is obtained immediately .
In this way several determinations of the quantity of nitrogen absorbed using the alloy as cathode were made over a wide range of pressures .
Mey only states there is absorption when the alloy is made the cathode , but it was found that such was the case when it formed the anode , although the amount of gas absorbed relative to the quantity of electricity passing in the circuit was not as great as when used as the cathode .
A series of observations were made with the alloy as the anode .
It must be mentioned that the surface of the metal remained clear however long the discharge was passing , and there appeared to be no diminution in the rate of absorption of the nitrogen .
These determinations finished , hydrogen was next tested .
The gas prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on zinc passed over phosphorus to remove any oxygen , and also over phosphorus pentoxide .
With this gas , and the alloy forming first the cathode and then the anode , measurements were taken at various pressures .
The surface of the metal did not remain clear as it had done when nitrogen was used , but became coated with a black scum which suggested the presence of the hydrides of sodium and potassium .
Thus it was necessary to keep the surface clean by continual shaking .
On substituting discharge tubes of different shapes the results were found to be independent of the surface area of the alloy , thereby suggesting that the relation between the amount of gas absorbed and the quantity of electricity is independent of the extent of the surface of the alloy .
It was also shown that if aluminium electrodes were used in a bulb-shaped vessel with a pool of Fig. 2. .

alloy at the bottom of the bulb , and not in electrical contact with the electrodes , then absorption of nitrogen and hydrogen resulted when a current was sent through the gas .

Absorption of Oxygen by Mercury .
Stark* has observed that when mercury is placed near the cathode in a discharge tube absorption of nitrogen and oxygen results , with the probable formation of mercury oxide and nitride .
Mercury was substituted for the alloy , and , using oxygen obtained from a cylinder , similar experiments were made to those described above .
Absorption resulted whether mercury formed the cathode or the anode .
Since the mercury became coated with a scum , the formation of the compound of mercury with oxygen probably takes place at the surface of the metal .
The inside of the tube received a reddish deposit of mercury oxide as observed by Stark , so that the chemical action also takes place throughout the gaseous volume .
With nitrogen instead of oxygen very little absorption resulted when the ordinary discharge was employed , but with a condensed discharge the effect was greatly increased .

Discussion of Results .
Stark has suggested that the absorption of nitrogen and oxygen in the presence of mercury in the discharge tube is due probably to the action of dissociated molecules of these gases , i.e. atomic gases , and when in this state Mr. F. H. Newman .
the gas is more active than under ordinary conditions .
Prof. R. J. Strutt* has shown that there is a chemically active modification of nitrogen , so that all the results obtained above can be explained by assuming that , under the influence of the electric discharge , active gas is produced .
That the nitrides of sodium and potassium are formed by the absorption of nitrogen can be shown by passing moist air over the alloy into water and applying the Nessler test for ammonia to the latter .
This suggested that , if the production of these nitrides were due to active gas , then passage of the afterglow obtained in the case of active nitrogen over the sodium-potassium alloy should produce nitrides of these metals .
The apparatus used is shown in fig. 3 .
Nitrogen obtained from a cylinder stood over phosphorus for several hours to remove all oxygen , and the flow was regulated by means of taps , so that 3 or 4 litres per hour passed through TO PUMP Fig. 3 .
TO EARTH the apparatus , being drawn off by a pump .
The two electrodes , Ei , E2 , were connected together and put to earth , in order to eliminate stray discharge\#151 ; one end of the secondary circuit also being earthed .
The alloy was placed in a bulb , which was sealed to the vessel 0 .
Being exposed to the air , it became coated with the oxide , but , on evacuation of the apparatus , by turning the latter so that the alloy flowed into C under a vacuum a clear surface was obtained .
A condensed discharge was used , and active nitrogen allowed to flow over the metal for half an hour , the alloy being vigorously shaken in the meantime .
A blank experiment was then made by passing the nitrogen over some alloy without the discharge .
The two portions were then tested for the presence of nitrides by passing moist air over the surface , and making the Nessler test for ammonia .
A copious precipitate was * Bakerian Lecture , 'Roy .

Absorption of Gases in the Discharge Tube .
505 obtained in the case of the alloy which had been subjected to the action of the active nitrogen , whereas no such precipitate was found where the ordinary nitrogen was used .
This proves that the active modification of nitrogen is absorbed by the alloy , and so gives strength to the theory that the general case of absorption is due to active modifications of gases produced by the electric discharge .
It must be mentioned that no stray discharge passed into the alloy bulb C. If the gases assume an active modification , the results above are easily explained .
As the pressure decreases , the velocity of the electrons becomes greater , and , as it is these which by their collisions with the molecules of the gas produce the active modification , a larger quantity of the latter , compared with the quantity of electricity employed , would be produced at these lower pressures .
It will be observed that greater absorption always takes place at the cathode .
Two reasons might be put forward in explanation .
Owing to the large electric force in the neighbourhood of the cathode , with the resulting high velocity of the electrons , it is probable that most of the active gas is produced at this part of the discharge tube , so there would be more near the alloy when it forms the cathode than when it is the anode .
The absorption of the positive rays would provide another explanation .
When these rays were allowed to fall on a pool of alloy placed at the bottom of the discharge tube , absorption of nitrogen resulted .
However , the question as to whether the rays themselves are absorbed , or the active gas produced by them , is still undecided .
In all probability it is the former , for the amount of active nitrogen produced by the collisions of the positive rays with the molecules of the gas would appear to be small .

Other Experiments .
Other metals in the molten condition , including cadmium/ zinc , bismuth , and lead , were tested for absorption of nitrogen , but no positive result was obtained with the ordinary discharge .
This might be explained by the decomposition of any nitrides produced owing to the high temperatures , or the active gas might not be able to reach the molten metal owing to the presence of vapour of the metal above the surface .

Summary .
1 .
The sodium-potassium alloy not only absorbs nitrogen and hydrogen when used as the cathode , but also when it forms the anode in a discharge tube , although the absorption relative to the quantity of electricity passing is greater in the first case than in the second .
Prof. Dixon and Messrs. Campbell and Slater .
2 .
Mercury absorbs oxygen in a similar manner .
3 .
In all cases the absorption relative to the electricity increases as the pressure decreases .
4 .
The gases probably assume active modifications under the influence of the electric discharge .
This supposition is strengthened by the observation that the known active modification of nitrogen is absorbed when passed over the alloy .
5 .
The greater absorption , when the metals are used as the cathode , is due probably to the combination of the positive rays with the metal .
In conclusion , I wish to express my gratitude to Prof. R. J. Strutt , F.RS .
, at whose suggestion the above investigation was undertaken , for his kind help and interest throughout the course of the research .

In a discussion on Gaseous Combustion with particular reference to explosions , at the British Association Meeting at Sheffield , 1910 , Sir J. J. Thomson called attention to the fact that combustion is concerned not only with atoms and molecules , but also with electrons moving with very high velocities .
In the " surface combustions " studied by Prof. Bone it appeared probable that the streams of electrons known to be emitted by incandescent surfaces promoted combustion by electrifying the contiguous layers of gas , and the great rapidity of combustion in the explosion-wave might be due to the molecules at the moment of combustion sending out electrons with very high velocities .
These may precede the explosion-wave and prepare the way for it by ionising the gas .
But the motion of the ions can be stopped at once by means of a transverse magnetic field , in which they curl up and are caused to revolve in small circles .
He therefore thought it would be of very great interest if Prof. Dixon would repeat his experiments on the photo-
