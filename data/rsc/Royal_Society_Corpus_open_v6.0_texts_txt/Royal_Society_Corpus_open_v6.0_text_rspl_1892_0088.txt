Examination of Photographic Lenses at Kew .
451 with one only covering 40 ' , in order to get the same mean exposure over the whole plate .
In connexion with this test it may he mentioned that the most serions omission in the Kew examination is , that there is nothing to show the actinic transparency of the glass .
A slight yellow tinge in the lenses , which would not be noticed by the eye , might yet be sufficient to seriously affect the rapidity of the objective .
But no test could be devised to investigate this point which did not introduce photographic methods , and , as already stated , the consideration of expense put such operations out of consideration for the present .
I should like , if possible , to have introduced some test which would have at the same time indicated the actual rapidity of the lens , and also the actual falling off of density towards the margin of the photograph ; with the aid of photography this would not have been difficult , and a plan of this kind would have been adopted , but for the cost .
This subject is , however , still under consideration by Captain Abney .

( Abstract .
) 1 .
Berthelot 's measurements of the rates of explosion of a number of gaseous mixtures have been confirmed .
The rate of the explosion wave for each mixture is constant .
It is independent of the diameter of the tube above a certain limit .
2 .
The rate is not absolutely independent of the initial temperature and pressure of the gases .
With rise of temperature the rate falls ; with rise of pressure the rate increases ; but above a certain crucial pressure variations in pressure appear to have no effect .

[ Jan. 19 the presence of steam has a marked effect on the rate .
From measurements of the rate of explosion with different quantities of steam , the conclusion is drawn that at the high temperature of the explosion wave , as well as in ordinary combustion , the oxidation of the carbonic oxide is effected by the interaction of the steam .
4 .
Inert gases are found to retard the explosion wave according to their volume and density .
Within wide limits an excess of one of the combustible gases has the same retarding effect as an inert gas ( of the same volume and density ) which can take no part in the reaction .
5 .
Measurements of the rate of explosion can be employed for determining the course of some chemical changes .
In the explosion of a volatile carbon compound with oxygen , the gaseous carbon appears to burn first to carbonic oxide , and afterwards , if oxygen is present in excess , the carbonic oxide first formed burns to carbonic acid .
6 .
The theory proposed by Berthelot\#151 ; that in the explosion wave the flame travels at the mean velocity of the products of combustion \#151 ; although in agreement with the rates observed in a certain number of cases , does not account for the velocities found in other gaseous mixtures .
7 .
It seems probable that in the explosion wave\#151 ; ( 1 ) The gases are heated at constant , and not at constant 'pressure ; ( 2 ) Each layer of gas is raised in temperature before being burnt ; ( 3 ) The wave is propagated not only by the movements of the burnt molecules , but also by those of the heated but yet unburnt molecules ; ( 4 ) When the permanent volume of the gases is changed in the chemical reaction , an alteration of temperature is thereby caused which affects the velocity of the wave .
8 .
In a gas , of the mean density and temperature calculated on these assumptions , a sound wave would travel at a velocity which nearly agrees with the observed rate of explosion in those cases where the products of combustion are perfect gases .
9 .
With mixtures in which steam is formed , the rate of explosion falls below the calculated rate of the sound wave .
But when such mixtures are largely diluted with an inert gas , the calculated and found velocities coincide .
It seems reasonable to suppose that at the higher temperatures the lowering of the rate of explosion is brought about by the dissociation of the steam , or by an increase in its specific heat , or by both these causes .

The experiments of MM .
Mallard and Le Chatelier , as well as the author 's , show the presence of these fugitive pressures .
It is possible that data for calculating the pressures produced may be derived from a knowledge of the densities of the unburnt gases and of their rates of explosion .
