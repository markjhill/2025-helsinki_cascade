A new Demonstration of the Binomial Theorem , when the Exponent is a positive or negative Fraction .
By the Rev. Abram Robertson , A. M. F.R. S. Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford .
In a Letter to Davies Giddy , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 5 , x8o6 .
DEAR SIR , BEING perfectly convinced of your love of mathematical science , and your extensive acquirements in it , I submit to your perusal a new demonstration of the binomial theorem , when the exponent is a positive or negative fraction .
As I am a strenuous advocate for smoothing the way to the acquisition of useful knowledge , I deem the following articles of some importance ; and unless I were equally sincere in this persuasion , and in that of your desire to promote mathematical studies , in requesting theperusal , I should accuse myself of an attempt to trifle with your valuable time .
The following demonstration is new only to the extent above mentioned ; but in order that the reader may perceive the proof to be complete , a successive perusal of all the articles is necessary .
As far as it relates to the raising of integral powers , it is in substance the same with one which I drew up in the year 1794 , and which was honoured with a place in the Philosophical Transactions for 1795 .
If , therefore , you think the following demonstration worthy the attention of mathematicians , you will much oblige me by presenting it to the Royal Society .
I am , &amp;c. A. ROBERTSON .

i. The binomial theorem is a general expression for any power of the sum or difference of two quantities .
Thus if n be any positive or negative whole number , or vulgar fraction , and a , b , be any two quantities , the binomial theorem expresses in a series the value of a+b1l , or a-h1 " .
The binomial theorem is of very extensive utility .
Besides the advantages derived from it in raising powers and extracting roots , it enables us to conduct , with clearness and ease , a variety of investigations in the higher parts of algebra , which , without its assistance , would become perplexed and laborious .
2 .
If n be a whole positive number , we can raise x+a to the power denoted by n , in the following manner , by multipliation .
gox+a x+a X^+ax ax-+a -x + 2axf-a = x+a x-gx3+2ax9*a2 x ' ax"-a sa x+as 3+ '3ax4+-3a2 xa =x+al x+a .
v4+ 3ax3-+3a2 x+a3 x ax'+3a .
--+3a3 ' 3+a4 x4+4ax3+6a2a V++4ae x+a4=x+al4 , &amp;c. , In the same manner the value of x-aZI may be obtained ; and its only difference from the value of x+ aln will consist in having the negative sign prefixed to such terms as have an odd power of a. And as the powers of any other quantity , either simple or compound , may be obtained gradually by multiplying the last found power by the root , in order to find the next higher power , it is manifest that the principles of multiplication are the most simple and evident , to which we can resort , for the demonstration of the binomial theorem .
These principles , therefore , will be used throughout the whole of the following investigations on the subject , and by them .
every case of the theorem will be established .
-S ?
7 It is well known to mathematicians that the theorem has been repeatedly proved , either by induction , by the summation of figurate numbers , by the doctrine of combinations , by assumed series , or by fluxions ; but that multiplication is a more direct way to the establishment of the theorem than any of these , cannot , I think , be doubted .
Proceeding by multiplication , we have always an evident first principle in view , to which without the aid of any doctrine , foreign to the subject , we can appeal for the truth of our assertions , and the certainty and extent of our conclusions. .
If p , q , be any two quantities , the product arising from the multiplication of p by q is equal to the product arising from the multiplication of q by p. For magnitudes being to one another as their equimultiples , pxq x::p and qxp : i xp : : q : 1 .
But 1xq =q , and 1 xp =p , and therefore , placing for ex aequali in a cross order , pxq : q:1 q xp:p .
Consequently , px q : : q xp : , and therefore pq -qp .
Hence it follows that the product arising from the multiplication of any number of quantities into one another , continues the same in value , in every variation which may be made in the arrangement of the quantities which compose it .
Thus p , q , r , s , being any quantities , pqrs-=pqr xs spqr= spq x r--rspq rsp x q= qrsp=qr xs xp=qr xpx s=qrps , &amp;c. And if x+a =p , x+b-q , x-+c -r , x+ds , x x+e=-t , &amp;c. then x+a xx +-c x x+dx x ed x x-e qrstx =a xx"b x* When I speak of the multiplication of quantities into one another , I mean the multiplication of the numbers into one another which measure those quantities .
S:o ?
x cx x+ exx -d pqrts = any other arrangement which can take place in the quantities .
4 .
It is evident that each of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. will be found the same number of times in the compound product arising from xax xb xx+cx +dx -e , &amp;c. For this product is equal to pqrst-=pqrs xX+e =pqrt xx+ d= pqst x x+c-=prst x x+b =-qrst xx a , by substituting for the compound quantities , x+a , x+b , &amp;c. their equals p , q , &amp; c , Wherefore , in the compound product , each of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. will be found multiplied into the products of all the others .
5 .
These things being premised , we may poceed to the .
multiplication of the compound quantities x+a , x--b , x+.c , &amp;c. into one another ; and in order to be as clear as possible in what follows , let us consider the sum of the quantities , a , b , c , &amp;c. or the sum of any number of them multiplied into one another , as coefficients to the several powers of x , which : arise in the multiplication .
By considering products which contain the same number of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. as homologous , the multiplication will appear as follows , and : equations of various dimensions will arise , according to the powers of x. x +a=p x +b=q x-a}x +ab=pq ; a quadratic equation , or an equation of -+b pq , qadat two dimensions .
x +c-=r x'+a +-abl +b x'-+ac x +abc=pqr ; a cubic , or an equation of three +c J +bcJ dimensions .
x +d-=s x4+aq +ab+b,3+ac + abc1 -+C +bc f2+ad abc+abed=pqrs ; )d ] i &amp; +ad +'acd +bd + bcdJ +cdJ x +.e-t X'+al +abi +abc4 4+b +.ac +abd 4c x*t bc acd +|d d+ad +bcd +-e + bd 3+ abe ?
.cd l +ace &gt; +ae + bce + be 4 " ade + ce + bde +de + cdeJ &amp; c , a biquadratic , or an equation of four dimensions .
+abcdl + abce x -abde &gt; x + abcde = pqrst ; a sir +acde I solid , or an equation of +bedeJ five dimensions .
6 .
From the above it appears , that the coefficient of the highest power of x in any equation is i ; but the coefficient of any other power of x in the same equation consists of a certain number of members , each of which contains one , two , three , &amp;c. of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. Thus the coefficient of the second term of any equation is made up of members , each of which contains only one of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. and the whole coefficient of the second term is the sum of all these members , or the sum of all the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. used in the multiplication by which the equation , under consideration , was produced .
Thus in the equation of four dimensions , the whole coefficient of the second term is a+b-+c+d , and a , b , c , d , were used in the multiplication in obtaining the equation .
The coefficient of the third term , of any equation , is made up of members , each of which contains two of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. used in the multiplication in obtaining the equation .
Thus in the equation of four dimensions , the whole coefficient of the third term is ab + ac + bc + ad + bd + cd .
And indeed , not only from inspection , but also from considering the manner in which the equations are generated , it is evident that each member of any coefficient has as many of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. in it , as there are terms in the equation preceding the term to which the coefficient belongs .
Thus each member of the coefficient in the second term of any equation is one quantity only , and only one term precedes the second term .
Each member of the coefficient in the third term , of any equation , consists of two quantities , and two terms precede the third , &amp;c. 7 .
When any equation is multiplied in order to produce the equation next above it , it is evident that the multiplication by x produces a part in the equation to be obtainea , which has the same coefficients as the equation multiplied .
Thus , multiplying the equation of three dimensions by x we obtain that part of the equation of four dimensions which has the same coefficients as the cubic : the only effect of this multiplication being the increase of the exponents of x by i. 8 .
But when the same equation is multiplied by the quantity adjoined to x by the sign - , each term of the product , in order to rank under the same power of x , must be drawn one term back .
Thus when the first term of the cubic is multiplied by d , the product must be placed in the second term of the biquadratic .
When the second term of the cubic is multiplied by d , the product must be placed in the third term of the biquadratic : and so of others .
9 .
As the equation last produced is the product of all the compound quantities x-+-a , x-+b , x +c , &amp;c. into one another , and as it was proved in the fourth article that each of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. must be found the same number of times in this product , if we can compute the number of times any one of those quantities enters into the coefficient of any term of the last equation , we shall then know how often each of the other enters into the same coefficient : and this may be done with ease , if of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. we fix upon that used in the last multiplication .
For the last equation , and indeed any other , may be considered as made up of two parts ; the first part being the equation immediately before the last multiplied by x , according to the 7th article , and the second part being the same equation multiplied by the quantity adjoined to x by the sign +- , last used in the multiplication , according to the 8th article .
This last used quantity , therefore , never enters into the members of the coefficient of the first of these two parts , but it enters into all the members of the coefficients of the last of them .
But that part into which it S ' , i does not enter has the same members as the coefficients of the equation immediately befre the last , by the 7th article ; and when the members of the first part are multiplied by the last used quantity , the product becomes the second part of the whole coefficient above mentioned .
Thus the first part of the cubic equation , by the 7th article , is , }x'+tabx , and as these coefficients are the same as the coefficients in the quadratic equation , being multiplied by c , and arranged according to the 8th article , we have the coefficients of the second part of the cubic , viz. c+ac -b abc .
4bC Hence it is evident , that there are as many members in any coefficient , which have the last used quantity in them , as there are members in the coefficient preceding , which have not the same quantity .
Thus in the 3d term , in the equation of four dimensions , there are three members of the whole coefficient of x ' which have d in them , viz. ad , bhd cd , and there are three members of the whole coefficient of zx in the second term , which have not d in them , viz. a , b , c. In the fourth term of the same equation , there are three members of the whole coefficient of x , which have d in them , viz. abd , acd , bcd , and there are three members of the whole coefficient of xX in the third term which have not d in them , viz. ab , ac , be .
Now as it has been proved that each of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. enters the same number of times into the coefficient of the same term , what has here been proved of the last used is applicable to each .
10 .
From the lst article the number of members in the several coefficients of any equation may be determined , For Ss ?
if we put s= the number of times each quantity is found in a coefficient , n= the number of quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. used in producing the equation , and p= the number of quantities in each member ; then as a is found s times in this coefficient , b is found s times in this coefficient , &amp;c. the number of quantities in this coefficient , with their repetitions , will be sx n ; and as p expresses the number of quantities requisite for each member , the number of members in the coefficient will be Sp Thus , for the sake of illustration , if we limit the above notation to the second term of the equation of five dimensions , s=i , as each of the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. is found once in the whole coefficient of x4 ; p= 1 , as each member consists of one quantity , and n=5 , as a , b , c , d , e are used in producing the equation .
Consequently ' =5 .
If we limit the above notation to the third term of the same equation , s=4 , p=2 , and -=5 , and therefore Sn =lo .
If we limit the above notation to the fourth term of the same equation , s=6 , p=3 , and n=5 , and -=10 .
If we limit the above notation to the fifth term P of the same equation , s=4 , =4 , and n=5 , and -=5 .
ll .
Using the same notation , we can by the last two articles , calculate the number of members in the next coefficient after that whose number of members is S. For as sexpresses the number of members in the above mentioned coefficient , and s the number of times each quantity is found in it , -s-= the number of times each is not found in it .
By the gth article therefore , a will be found s times , b will be found -p -s times , &amp;c. in the next coefficient , and therefore s , ps Xnp 5_ the number of quantities , with .
ore sxn 314 their repetitions , in it .
But as the number of quantities in each member of a coefficient is 1 less than the number in each member of the coefficient next following , each member of the coefficient whose number of members we are now calculating will have in itp+ 1 number of quantities .
Consequently Stl T sn xp the number of members of the coeffipxp+ fp p+I cient next after that whose number of members is s , as in the last article .
e1 .
It is evident , from the sixth article , that the value of p in the second term of any equation is i ; in the third term of any equation its value is 2 ; in the fourth term of any equation it is 3 , &amp;c. It is also evident that the number of members of the coefficient of the second term of any equation is n ; for the whole coefficient is the sum of all the quantities a , b , c , &amp;c. , used in producing the equation .
It therefore follows that the sn n general expression ' x o , ' obtained in the last article , enables .
us to ascertain the number of members in .
the coefficient of any term in an equation. .
For the number of members of the coefficient in the second term being n , according to the successive values of p the number of members in the third term f--I n-.-2 is n. 2 ; in the fourth term it is n. - ' .
- ; in the fifth 223 term it is n. and this regular form ay be extended to express the number of members in the coefficient of any term whatever .
13 .
The binomial theorem , as far as .
it relates to the raising of integral powers , easily follows from the foregoing articles .
For if all the quantities a , -b , c , &amp;c. used in the multiplicatio : in the fifth article , be equal to one another , and .
consequently each equal to a , each of the members in any coefficient will become a power of a ; and , therefore , as the exponent of x in the first term is equal to n , it follows from the sixth and last n , f , I It 7-.I n71 2 , -i nlarticles that x+al -=x'nax n. 2 tx n.--- .

, in the foregoing multiplication , two observations are to be made , by means of which the demonstration of the theorem may be extended to fractional exponents .
In the first place , supposing n and mz to be whole numbers , the sum of the coefficients prefixed to any individual power ofi , i1 multiplication A , must be equal to the coefficient prefixed to the same power of x in the binomial series l n+im em ade-1 , y n+s rwh tm-x n+rm-z2 3+ n+ins , X+ 11+ plain axiom , viz. that equals being multiplied by equals the products are equal .
In the second place it is to be observed , that the whole coefficient of any power of x , in the products of multiplication A , may be reduced to the regular binomial form , established in the 13th article .
Thus n. n+ -mn-m , the whole coefficient of x2 , by actual multiplication becomes n'+^m+zmn-n-m ?

3 +m 2 .
And from the preceding observation it is evident , that we may in the same manner , reduce the whole coefficient of any other power of x , in the products of multiplication A to the regular binomial form .
16 .
But in proceeding , as above , to change the form of the coefficients prefixed to any power of x , in multiplication A , into the regular binomial form , we are not under the necessity of supposing n and m to be whole numbers .
The actual multiplications will end in the same powers of n and m , the same combinations of them , and the same numerals , whether we consider n and m as whole numbers or as fractions .
We are therefore at liberty to suppose n and m to be any two fractions whatever , in the two series multiplied into one another in multiplication A , and the same two fractions will take the place of n and m respectively in the regular binomial series 1+n+xnx+n+m .

Thus , calling the last mentioned series the root , if it be multiplied by itself , and if the coefficients in the product be expressed in the regular binomial form , its 222 -----I ---I ------2 222 ---square I ---x3 2rr rA 2 -2 -3 - " 4-4 &amp; G. Again , if this series be multiplied by the root , and the coefficients in the product be expressed in the regular binomial form , the cube of the root 3333 -I -_ I -_ -~~will be 1$ rr ba 3r will be 1+ '3X.i 3rX3rr2+ ' 2:3--'- " 33 3--2 33 rr '-T *+ * " &amp;c. Proceeding thus , by multiplying the 34 last found power by the root , in order to find the next higher --Ise e --tI Ii rI r1 power , the nth power of +r+x ' r7 18 .
If in the series , which concludes the last article , n be equal to r , the whole series becomes equal to i+x .
For in n_I this case =1 , and therefore =o , and consequently every term in the series , after the second , becomes equal to o , or vanishes , Hence it is evident that the rth root of i +x , or , which is + iX _ , +IX I --I the same thing , that l+x =1+ Ir X_r2"+IIII -'---I -2 ----1 --2 -3 rIrrr --r r -r rr x4+ .
&amp;c. for this se2 3 Tr *234 ries being raised to the rth power becomes equal to i +x .
