] The nature of this paper is such , as renders it absolutely incapable of abridgement .
By way of introduction to it the author observes , that having some years back , when reading the learned Mr. Landen 's fifth memoir , discovered the manner of applying a method of differences to the species of series whose sums are there obtained by the help of impossible quantities , and having since extended that application , he now ventures to offer it to the consideration of others .
The practice of this method , in most cases , appears , he says , extremely simple , and on that account he is almost induced to imagine that it has already been considered by mathematicians .
And he acknowledges that , since the greatest part of the paper was written , he has , in Euler 's Institutiones Calculi Integralis , met with two simple series , which are in that work summed by multiplications similar to those employed in the investigation of the principal theorems contained in this paper .
But whether that learned mathematician has pursued the method any further , he has not been able to ascertain .
Mr. Gompertz has purposely considered some of the series summed by Mr. Landen , in order to procure an opportunity of comparing both the results and methods ; and as the series may have particular cases , in which both Mr. Landen 's means and those of our author fail , he has added , towards the end , a general Scholium concerning the causes , circumstances , and consequences of such failure .
