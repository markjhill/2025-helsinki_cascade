A Paper was read , entitled " Further Notice of the new Volcano in the Mediterranean .
" By John Davy , M.D. F.R.S. Assistant In ?
spector of Army Hospitals .
The author states that since the 25th of October , the date of his last communication to the Society , the crater of the volcano has undergone several changes of form , and has now entirely disappeared .
He infers from the phsenomena observed , that the crater was one of eruption , composed entirely of loose materials , thrown up by volcanic action , and not one of elevation , that is , formed of rock which once composed the bed of the sea .
In July the heat at Malta was very close and oppressive , the thermometer rising more than once to 105 ?
of Fahrenheit , and the western sky had a dark lurid red hue : but these atmospheric states are regarded by the author as independent of the volcano , for the temperature of the air in its immediate vicinity was very little affected by it .
