A paper was read , entitled , " Proposal for a new method of determining the Longitude , by an absolute Altitude of the Moon , " by John Christian Bowring , Esq. Communicated by John George Children , Esq. , F.R.S. The method employed by the author for determining the longitude by the observation of an absolute altitude of the moon , was proposed , many years ago by Pingre and Lemmonier ; and the princi ?
pal difficulty which stood in the way of its adoption , was its requiring the exact determination of the moon 's declination reduced to the place of observation .
This difficulty the author professes to have removed by supposing two meridians for which the altitudes are to be calculated : and the only remaining requisite is the accu ?
rate determination of the latitude , which presents no great difficulty , either on land or at sea .
Examples are given of the practical working of this method ; showing that if the latitude of a place of observation be obtained within a few seconds , the longitude will be found by means of a single observation of the altitude of the moon .
