) Slowing of the Respiratory Rhythm.\#151 ; The area which , when excited , caused slowing of the respiratory rhythm lies over the continuation of the postero-median column , as it separates from the column of the opposite side , and the part of the floor of the ventricle close to the inner border of the column .
The central point of this small area lies between 1 and 2 mm. from the calamus , and between 2 and 3 mm. from the middle line .
Cardio-inhibition.\#151 ; Whilst cardio-inhibition may be produced all over the floor of the 4th ventricle , as well as just behind the calamus , yet it is best marked both in the frequency of occurrence and in the amount of slowing over the posterior third of the 4th ventricle , and over the inner margin of the continuation forwards of the posteromedian column .
Blood-pressure .
( 1 ) Fall.\#151 ; The chief depressor area is in the hinder part of the floor , between 1 and 4 mm. in front of the calamus .
( 2 ) Rise ( cat only).\#151 ; A rise was produced most frequently and most largely from 4 mm. from the calamus forwards to the anterior end of the ventricle .
These conclusions are exhibited graphically by maps of the ventricle , shaded in various degrees to indicate the intensity of the result ; and a number of tracings are appended as illustrations of the actual changes which were produced by excitation .
The author concludes with a summary of some clinical applications of this research , as well as of the previous one on " Intracranial Pressure , " which forms the subject of a paper in this year 's ' Phil. Trans. ' by the author and Mr. Horsley .

( Abstract .
) This paper is a continuation of the previous ones on the same subject .
After describing the action of caustic alkali in a state of fusion on phyllocyanin and the products thereby formed , the author proceeds to give an account of phylloxanthin , the substance formed along with phyllocyanin by the action of acids on chlorophyll .
This is followed by a description of the change- which chlorophyll undergoes by the action of alkalis , and of the chief product thereby formed , which the author names alkachlorophyll .
