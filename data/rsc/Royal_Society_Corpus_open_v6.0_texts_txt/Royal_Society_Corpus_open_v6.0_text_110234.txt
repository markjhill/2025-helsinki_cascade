] The analytic expressions for the variations of the elliptic constants given by Laplace in his Mecanique Celeste , are true only when the square and higher powers of the disturbing forces are neglected in the computation ; and by proceeding on the supposition that all the planets move in circular orbits and in the same direction , he has demonstrated that the eccentricities and inclinations vary within small limits , and that the stability of the planetary system is always eventually preserved .
But Mr. Lubbock shows in the present paper that these conditions are not necessary to the stability of a system of bodies subject to the law of attraction which governs our system ; and he gives expressions for the variations of the elliptic constants which are rigorously true , whatever power of the disturbing force be retained .
