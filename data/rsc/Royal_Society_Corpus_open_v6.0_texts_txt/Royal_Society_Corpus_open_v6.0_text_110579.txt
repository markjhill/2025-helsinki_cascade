W. L. Wharton , Esq. Communicated by James F. W. Johnston , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S. L. &amp; Ed. The author , considering the generally received explanation of intermitting springs , founded on the operation of a simple syphon , as being insufncient to account for the phenomenon , inasmuch as the water which has risen above the lower side of the bend of the syphon will merely trickle down its longer leg , and be expended before it can fill the whole area of that part of the syphon , has proposed the following hypothesis for the solution of the difficulty .
He conceives that the stream , while falling obliquely down the long leg of the syphon , is broken into drops , and carries along with it numerous air-bubbles , which , if the lower end of the tube have an abrupt bend upwards , will be impelled forwards , and escape at the open part ; thus occasioning a rarefaction of the remaining air in the tube sufficient to ensure its full operation as a syphon .
A model is described , which the author constructed for the purpose of illus ?
trating and corroborating his views .
