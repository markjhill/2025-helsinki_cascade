In the course of an investigation on the flame spectra of metals , the writer has examined the spectrum of lithium .
Some facts have been discovered of sufficient importance for a- separate paper .
The same spectrometer was used as in the investigation on the " Spectra of Potassium , \amp ; c."* Whilst the wave-lengths of some of the lines in the flame spectrum of lithium agree closely with those given by Kayser and Runge for the lines in the arc spectrum , !
the wave-lengths of other lines differ considerably from these .

some Lines in the Spe of Lithium .
1902 .
] The only important differences occur in the lines of the first subordinate series .
Exner and Haschek have given the wave-lengths of three lines in the spark spectrum* as 2815-55 , 3232*91 , and 4603-10 .
The last is described as reversed .
Eder and Yalenta have given the wave-length of the blue line in the Bunsen flame spectrum as 4602*4 , f and as 4602*46 in the spark spectrum when a condenser was used .
J They described the latter measurement as that of the middle of a broad dark line , the less refrangible wing of which was stronger than the other , and diffuse towards the red .
They also gave measurements of five other lines , and these agree closely with the arc lines given by Kayser and Rung .
Professor Hartley recorded four lines in the oxyhydrogen flame spectrum of lithium chloride S corresponding to the first , fourth , sixth and eleventh of the lines in the above table .
The blue line was measured in the flame spectrum on four plates , and the results differed only in the second decimal place , the figures in which were 8 , 7 , 6 and 7 .
Professors Living and Dewar made some observations by eye on the appearance of the blue line in the arc spectrum which led them to believe there were two lines , a strong one with a weak line on the more refrangible side , || and Kayser and Rung , after referring to this , say :\#151 ; U " Wir haben nur bei zwei Aufnahmen neben der Hauptlinie eine zweite schwache umgekehrte Linie bei 4603-13 erhalten ; da aber hier eine Eisenlinie liegt , glauben wir , dass dies eben die Eisenlinie ist , welche sich durch den hellen Hintergrund der Lithiumlinie umgekehrt hat .
" The wave-length of the line which Kayser and Rung attributed to iron agrees with that obtained by the author for the bright line in the flame spectrum , and by Exner and Haschek for the reversed line in a spark spectrum .
It was decided in view of these differences to take a series of photographs of the arc spectrum of lithium , using the carbonate of lithium on carbon poles , and to study especially the appearances of the blue line .
The results will now be briefly described .
A Gulcher arc lamp with vertical carbons was used .
When the arc was started with a quantity of lithium carbonate on the carbons , a large proportion of the salt was freely volatilised and expelled in the form of a dense vapour .
As the arc lamp was placed , the magnetic field produced by the feed mechanism caused the bulk of the vapour to be expelled in the direction of the collimator .
Photographs of the spectrum taken at this early stage show the line as a very broad bright line extending from 4610-4 to 4593"5 , with a narrow dark line extend* ' Sitzber .

slbnoTinal Changes in [ Nov. 19 ing ( 2 in figure ) from 4603-46 to 4602-71 , having its middle ( measured ) at 4603-06 .
The middle of the broad bright line is , according to the above , at wave-length 4601 -95 , and the middle of the dark line ( reversed ) is coincident with the bright line of the flame spectrum .
Diagrams of the blue lithium line as it appears in photographs .
The fine vertical lines are merely shading lines ; the broad wings of the actual lines in the spectra are continuous .
( 1 ) Bright line of flame , arc and spark spectra .
( 2 ) Reversed line from dense outer flame of arc .
( 3 ) Reversed line from inner cone of strong arcs and from near negative pole of weak arcs .
( 4 ) Broad line with two absorption bands , from arc spectrum .
( 5 and 6 ) From spectrum of thin outer flame of arc with different exposures .
One pole of a weak bar magnet was placed near the arc so as to direct the expelled vapour in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the collimator .
After the large excess of the lithium salt had been volatilised the image of the central portion of the arc was thrown on the slit , and the spectrum photographed , when the ends of the carbon poles , not widely separated , were red-hot .
The lithium vapour in the central core was doubtless at a very high temperature , and there was only a thin layer of cooler vapour between it and the slit .
Under these conditions the bright line is again broadly expanded , and so also is the dark line , for it now extends from 4603-55 to 4601*25 ( mean _ 4602*40 ) on one photograph ( 3 in figure ) , and from 4603*68 to 4601-22 ( mean = 4602-45 ) on another .
The bright wings are nearly of the same intensity and extent .
The middles , of these two dark lines are nearly the same as the .

1902.1 some Lines in the Spectrum of Lithium .
167 Some photographs were also taken of the spectrum of the transparent flame which issued from the arc , the bar magnet being used as above .
With a short exposure one narrow bright line was obtained of wave-length 4603-06 ; with a longer exposure this bright line was much stronger , and there was the appearance of a weak line on its more refrangible side , exactly as Professors Liveing and Dewar described .
The wave-lengths of these two were 4603-18 and 4601*89 respectively on one photograph ( 5 in figure ) , and 4603*12 and 4601-65 on another .
The last line was fairly sharp on the less refrangible side , whilst it faded gradually on the other side ( 6 in figure ) .
With still longer exposures the weaker line could not be distinguished from the wing of the much expanded bright line .
This wing when weak always resembles a line , and it was thought that a line might be nearly coincident with its less refrangible edge .
Measurements showed that this edge varied in position on different photographs , but Professor Liveing suggested that the tip might be formed by a line , and if so , the tip should always have the same wave-length .
The following table gives the wave-lengths of the two tips on different photographs Spectrum .

The arc , in these experiments , was formed with a Gulcher lamp with the carbons vertical , the positive being uppermost , and the image of the arc projected on to the slit of the collimator by a lens .
It was observed that the less refrangible point , wave-length 4603*1 , was , in many photographs , higher on the plate than the weaker point ; it was given out by vapour quite near to the positive pole .
It was observed also in some photographs that the line extending from it faded away lower down ; the vapour near the negative pole did not emit this line but gave the broad bright line with the broad dark line down its middle .
This broad bright line fades away as the positive pole is approached ; the more refrangible wing ends in a point , but the less VOL. lx xi .
o Mr. H. Bamage .
Abnormal Changes in [ Nov. 19 , refrangible wing is lost in the bright line of wave-length 4603-1 .
There appears then in the middle portion of the spectrum a broad dark line with wings of unequal extent , and the less refrangible wing is broader , and , near its more refrangible edge , much stronger than the other wing .
The broad dark line extended on such photographs from ( 1 ) 4602-72 to 4601*81 , ( 2 ) 4602-86 to 4602-05 , ( 3 ) 4602*73 to 4601-62 , and in two other cases , where there were less differences of intensity between the two wings , from 4603-26 to 4601-61 and from 4603-07 to 4601-59 .
There were indications on some photographs of a bright line near the middle of the broad dark line ; the measurements of such a photograph gave :\#151 ; Less refrangible edge of broad dark line . .

40 Apparent bright line ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
4602-57 More refrangible edge of broad dark line ... 4601-31 The absorption bands of reversals in such a photograph as this are comparatively bright , for there is considerable action on the plate where the images of these bands fall ( 4 in figure ) .
The effect is probably due to the superposition of the spectrum of the outer flame upon that of the inner core when both are giving reversed lines .
Some observations were made at Professor Liveing 's suggestion on the arc spectrum of lithium when the arc was formed between carbon electrodes inserted horizontally in a magnesia brick .
The arc enclosed in this way is much steadier than in the open .
The light which was examined passed out through a horizontal hole perpendicular to the carbons .
The differences described above between the spectra of the vapours near the two poles were easily observed by eye observations .
Photographs of the spark spectra of lithium were taken in the hope of finding a second line which would account for the remarkable differences in the arc spectra , but no second line was found .
A piece of metallic lithium was placed in a cup formed in the end of an aluminium rod , and sparks were passed between this and an aluminium wire held immediately over the lithium .
No Leyden-jar was put into the secondary circuit at first , and it was found that photographs of the blue line were obtained with exposures of 15 minutes .
The lines were sharp , and showed no signs of reversal .
The wave-length of the blue line was found to be 4603-08 .
The vapour near the electrodes gave broader lines than the vapour a short distance away .
The broadening was much greater at the negative electrode than the positive , and it extended further on the more refrangible side than on the other side .
The bright line and the broad reversed line were , in fact , both present in the spectrum of the spark , near the negative electrode .
It was much more difficult to obtain photographs of the spark spectrum when a Leyden jar was introduced .

The blue line was very weak and nebulous , and it was difficult to obtain measurements of it .
The following were obtained from four photographs 4603*18 , 4603T4 , 4602*99 and 4603*97 ; the mean of these is 4603*15 .
Better photographs were obtained when a coil of wire was also introduced into the secondary circuit .
The line more nearly resembled that obtained when no Leyden jar was used ; the broad reversed line was more clearly defined at the electrode when negative than when positive .
An attempt was made to photograph the blue line in the Bunsen flame spectrum , but with an exposure of six hours no trace of it was obtained .
Other lines in the Spectrum of Lithium .
The orange line was examined in the arc and flame spectra by eye observations and by photography .
The line in the flame spectrum was measured on four plates :\#151 ; Spectrum .

The orange line is easily reversed in the arc .
The reversed line was photographed and the wave-length measured on two plates , the results being 6103*82 and 6103*84 .
The reversal was narrow and the wings did not extend very far .
The more refrangible wing was slightly broader than the other , and this difference was observed in the photographs and by eye observations .
The part of the arc near the negative pole was examined very carefully ; the line was most sharply reversed in that part , but there was no trace of a broad dark line .
The orange line , with the exceptions noted , behaved normally .
170 Abnormal Changes in the Spectrum of Lithium .
[ Nov. 19 Measurements were also made of two other lines in the arc spectrum .
The wave-length of a weak and very diffuse line on one plate was 4132*82 , and that of a very weak sharp line , 4273-32 .
The former line on another plate was stronger and broader ; its middle was at 4132-35 , whilst the other line , much broadened towards the red , had its strongest part at 4273'62 .
The current used in working both the open and enclosed arcs was about 9 amperes .
Kayser and Bunge employed a current of 25________35 amperes from one machine and , to bring out the weak lines in some spectra , a current of 40\#151 ; 50 amperes from another machine .
It seems probable that they worked with the intense arc which was only obtained by the author when the carbons were very near together , and that they .
observed only the spectrum of broadened lines which the author found was emitted by the intense arc and near the negative pole by weaker arcs .
Their remarks on the appearances of the lines in the first and second subordinate series confirm this view .
Eder and Yalenta obtained a similar spectrum to Kayser and Bunge 's arc spectrum in the spark spectrum of metallic lithium when they used a condenser in the secondary circuit .
The author has pleasure in thanking Professor Liveing for the interest he has taken in this work and for some useful suggestions .
Conclusions .
The lines in the principal series of lithium appear to broaden and reverse normally .
The lines in the second subordinate series do not reverse even in the arc , but in strong arcs they broaden towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum and become diffuse on that side .
The first line in the first subordinate series , wave-length 6103-84 , is almost normal ; it broadens " slightly more on the more refrangible side than on the other .
The other lines in this series also broaden on both sides and become diffuse , but they broaden more rapidly on the more refrangible side than on the other .
The centres of the broadened lines are more refrangible than the corresponding lines in the narrow state .
The inner core of intense arcs , and the parts near the negative poles of weak arcs and sparks , give a broad reversed line with its centre about wave-length 4602-4 ; whilst the part near the positive pole in weak arcs , and the flame of the arc , give a sharp bright line , wave-length 4603*07 , coincident with the lines in the spectra of the oxyhydrogen flame and uncondensed spark .
The similar changes in the other lines diminish with their refrangibility .
The wave-lengths hitherto recorded for these diffuse lithium lines would appear to be those of abnormal lines .
The true lines are the sharp bright ones which occur , without complication , in the spectrum of lithium in the oxyhydrogen flame .

] Estimation of the Specific Gravity of Blood .
171 [ Added Nov. 28 , 1902.\#151 ; Since this paper was communicated to the Royal Society , I have seen a paper on the spectrum of lithium , by Hagenbach , in the * Annalen der Physik , ' No. 12 , 1902 , which was published on November 13 .
The experimental part of his paper deals almost entirely with the blue line , and the fact that there are other abnormal lines in the spectrum of lithium is recorded above for the first time .
Hagenbach 's conclusion that there are two lines near wavelength 4603 is not , I think , established ; and I still hold that the views expressed in this paper are more probable .
He has not been able to find the second line as a bright line , so the difficulties in the way of accepting the view that there is a second dark line , without a corresponding bright line , remain .
He has not referred to Professors Liveing and Dewar 's work , * and his evidence for saying there are two lines is , in fact , similar to the evidence they gave .
] 4 An Error in the Estimation of the Specific Gravity of the Blood by Hammerschlag 's Method , when employed in connection with Hydrometers .
" By A. G. Levy , M.D. ( London ) .
Communicated by Sir Victor Horsley , F.R.S. Received November 25 , \#151 ; Read December 11 , 1902 .
( From the Laboratory of Pathological Chemistry , University College , London .
) Hammerschlag 's method of estimation of the specific gravity of the blood is an application to clinical purposes of a physical method frequently employed when only a small quantity of the substance under investigation is obtainable .
The method may be briefly described as the adjustment of the specific gravity of a mixture of chloroform and benzol by small successive additions of either constituent until it corresponds to the specific gravity of the blood , the test of the attainment of this condition being that a small drop of the blood , when immersed in the mixture , shall remain suspended without any very obvious tendency to rise or sink .
The specific gravity of the mixture is then estimated by means of a hydrometer , the scale of which is graduated to register densities lying between the maximum and minimum densities of blood , i.e. , from 1*020 to 1*080 .
In order to attain a rapid adjustment of the relative proportions of the chloroform and benzol , it is the general practice to use a comparatively small quantity only of these fluids and a small hydrometer , and , as will be hereafter seen , the size of the instrument is an important factor in the magnitude of the error .
This error was commented upon in a paper read by Dr. Baumann * * Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 174 ( 1883 ) , p. 215 .
