Determination of Boiling [ June 1^ show the line at \ 500 first observed in a comet by Dr. Huggins in the year 1866 .
It remains for those who hold that the physical structure and temperature of comets and nebulas are not similar in each case to explain the phenomena observed in a more simple and sufficient way .

( Abstract .
) The paper contains an account of experiments made with a view of\#151 ; ( I. ) Comparing the closeness of agreement between the readings of platinum thermometers made from different samples of wire arranged in different manners and insulated by different materials .
( II .
) Ascertaining some accurate method of graduating such ther-mometers without the direct use of the air thermometer .
( III .
) The determination of certain boiling and freezing points .
Eight thermometers were constructed .
The resistance of the platinum coils used varied from about 4 to 50 ohms .
Full particulars of these thermometers are given in the paper .
The insulating substance in thermometers A , B , C , D was glass only ; but the internal arrangements were different , as also were the samples of platinum wire used in their construction .
The form finally adopted ( that of E , F , G ) was as follows:\#151 ; A coil of fine platinum wire was wound on a roll of asbestos paper and slipped into a thin hard-glass tube .
Thick platinum wires ran from 1890 .
] and Freezing Points by the Platinum Thermometer .
221 this coil to the top of the instrument , and the unimmersed portion of the stem was surrounded by the outer tube of a condenser , and kept at a constant temperature by a flow of tap-water .
The resistance of this stem was so small that the change in resistance caused by the changes in the temperature of the tap-water might be neglected .
The diameter of these thermometers was less than of an inch , and their length about 18 inches .
They were extremely sensitive , and could therefore be used to trace the rise in temperature due to suffusion , the freezing points of the metals experimented upon being determined by the limit of this rise .
These thermometers were graduated by the temperature of the boiling points of water , naphthalene , benzophenone , and sulphur , and the freezing point of water .
The values obtained by Crafts ( ' Paris , Soc. Chim .
Bull .
, ' vol. 39 ) were used in the case of naphthalene and benzophenone , and Regnault 's value of the boiling point of sulphur.* The purity of the samples was ascertained by fractional distillation and by the temperature of the melting points .
The selection of these temperatures was forced upon me by the results of my experiments , and the reasons for their adoption are fully given in the paper .
The results were plotted in the manner suggested by Callendar 0 Phil. Trans. , ' A , 1887 ) , and on a scale such that a difference of 0'02 ' could be read with certainty .
The curves thus obtained differed considerably from each other and from the curve given by Callendar.t However , intermediate temperatures deduced from these curves showed remarkably close agreement .
In no case ( the total number of experiments exceeds 300 ) is the divergence of any one experiment from the mean value obtained from all the thermometers as great as 0'2 ' , and if only the results obtained from thermometers E , F , and G be taken , the divergence is in no case as great as 0'05 ' .
Ihe chief difficulties which presented themselves were\#151 ; ( u. ) Variations in the resistance of the connexions between the thermometer coil and the resistance coils .
( 6 .
) Variations in the temperature of the resistance coils themselves .
( c. ) The rise in temperature of the thermometer coil due to the current used when measuring its resistance .

For an account of the manner in which these difficulties were overcome , and of the further precautions taken to secure accuracy , reference must be made to the paper .
The boiling points of the following substances were determined:\#151 ; Aniline , methyl salicylate , triphenylmethane , and mercury ; and the freezing points of tin , bismuth , cadmium , lead , and zinc .
S Every endeavour was made to secure pure specimens of these bodies .
Full particulars of the individual experiments are given in the tables attached to the paper , and the results are summarised in the accompanying tables .
In Table I , I give certain boiling points as determined by means of thermometers A , B , C , D , and E* .
I have thought it unnecessary to give details in Table I , since the forms of thermometers used therein were ultimately discarded in favour of the form adopted in E , F , and G. The mean results , however , are in close agreement with those given in Table II ( see pp. 222\#151 ; 223 ) .

( Abstract .
) The experiments of Helmholtz and Piotrowski* on the oscillations of a metal sphere suspended bifilarly , and filled with various liquids , gave finite values to the slipping coefficients .
The inside of the sphere was gilded and polished , and the value obtained for the coefficient A was , in the case of distilled water , 2'3534 mm. From some experiments of Girardf on transpiration through copper tubes , Helmholtz deduces the value A = 0*3984 mm. for water flowing past a copper surface .
In treatises on hydrodynamics , it is shown that when the motion through a tube is linear , the flux is i Lll Pi~Pz .
