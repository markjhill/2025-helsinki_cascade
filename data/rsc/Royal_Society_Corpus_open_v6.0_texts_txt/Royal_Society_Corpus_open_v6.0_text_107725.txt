n account of Experiments on the velocity of Sound , made in Holland .
By Dr. G. MOLL , Professor of Vatural Philosophy in the University of Utrecht , and Dr. A. VAN BEEEK .
Read March 18 , 18X4 .
iIR ISAAC NEWTON'S formula , expressing the velocity of sound , c= =J has since his time been investigated and demonstrated by several first-rate mathematicians .
Actual experiments however on this velocity , instituted in various countries , and under different circumstances , went to prove that the celerity of sound , found by experimiment , is about one-sixth greater than can be deduced by theory .
The celebrated LAPLACE accounted for this difference between experiment and theory , by showing that it could be attributed to the heat evolved by the compression of the particles of air which is effected by the undulations of sound .
It was found impossible to determine the quantity of heat thus evolved , by the compression which sound occasions in the particles of the air ; and therefore it was deemed expedient to multiply Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S formula by a constant factor Vi + k , the value of which was determined by experiment .
Sir ISAAC'S formula thus altered , became cTs , by the exk .
Thus , by the experiments of the French Academicians of the most accurate on this subject of that time , the value of k was found equal to 0,4254 .
It is plain that this correction of the original formula is merely empirical , and dependant on the accuracy of experiments , which in 1738 , had certainly not attained the perfection which is required at present , In consequence , this formula was thus altered by LAPLACE , n which is the specific eat of the air nder a constant in which C ' is the specific heat of the air under a constant pressure , and c is the specific heat of the air under a constant volume.* My friend Dr. VAN REES , Professor in the University of Liege , gave a demonstration of this correction / .
, which will be subjoined to the present paper , t and which may be C ?
compared with that of Mr. POIssoN.** The value of was determined by LAPLACE from experiments of Messrs. LAROCHE and BERARD , ?
and found equal to 1,4954 ; but later and more accurate experimenits of Messrs. GAY LuSSAc and WELTER brought it to 1,3748 .
Another cause of the difference between actual experiments on the velocity of sound and its theory , exists in the variable force of the wind , which either accelerates or retards the velocity of sound , according to the direction from which it is blowing .
It appears that this cause of error may be annihilated in the following manner .

cited exactly at the same time on both ends of a basis , and let two observers stationed on these ends , measure the velocity with which sounds travels from one end of the basis to the other .
It is quite clear , that the action of the wind must necessarily accelerate the velocity of the sound excited at one end of the basis , as much as it will retard that at the other end , and thus the medium of these two velocities will give the velocity in tranquil air .
This method was not adopted by the French Academicians of 1738 , in their experiments between Monthlery and Montmartre .
Cannon was fired at one of these stations , whilst the observers were at the other , and thus the results remained affected by the whole effect of the wind .
It was found expedient therefore to repeat these experiments with more accuracy , and this was executed with great precaution on Mr. LAPLACE'S proposal , by Messrs. ARAGO , PRONY , MATHIEU , BOUVARD , HUMBOLDT , and GAY LussAc .
The experiments were made in 1822 , on the basis of Monthlery and Villejuif .
In two successive days , the 21st and 22d of June , 1822 , seven shots were fired on both stations , and observed on the other ; the difference of time in which the corresponding shots were fired at both stations not exceeding five minutes , and from these seven correspgnding shots the result was deduced .
These experiments having never been made in this country with any thing like sufficient accuracy , His Royal Highness PRINCE FREDERICK , second son of His MAJESTY the KING of the NETHERLANDS , and Master General of the Ordnance , was pleased to approve of our proposal of repeating the same , and to authorise Lieutenant-Colonel KUYTENBROUWER , and the officers and men of the battalion of Artillery under -46 his command , to give us every assistance in their power , and to take an actual part in these experiments .
SECTION II .
As fitted places to make these experiments , two elevated spots were selected on the extended heaths of the Province of Utrecht .
One of these is a small hill between the town of Naarden and the village of Blaricum , and called the Kooltjesberg ; the other is somewhat higher , and situated on the right of the road from Utrecht to Amersfoort , and very near the last town .
Both places were distinctly visible from one another , and the distance was between 17000 and 18000 metres(9664 fathoms ) .
Our time was kept by two time-keepers , which the Minister of Marine had kindly furnished us with ; one made by ARNOLD , the other by our countryman Mr. KNEBEL .
But the exact interval between the observation of light , and the perception of sound , and consequently the velocity of sound , was measured with small clocks with conical pendulums .
They are made at Wesel by Mr. WILHELM PFAFFIUS , and proved remarkably well adapted for this purpose .
It is well known that HUIGENS laid down the properties of the conical , or centrifugal pendulum , but if we are not mistaken , they were employed for similar purposes for the first time by the German philosopher BENZENBERG.* These clocks with a conical pendulum divide the 24 hours of the day in o , ooo00ooo parts , and one of the indexes gives I-part of a decimal second .
This index or second hand remains quiet , whilst the watch work continues moving as long as a certain spring is not pressed down with the finger ; and on removing the finger , the index is reduced to rest in the identical moment .
Thus the index being at o , the spring is pressed down by the observer at the very instant the light of the opposite station is observed ; the index continues moving till the report of the shot is heard , when the finger is withdrawn , and the index stopped instantaneously .
The number of turns and fractions of a turn of the index shows the time elapsed between the fire and the report .
There was a conical or centrifugal clock on each station ; besides these , each station was furnished with a good barometer , carefully compared with a standard barometer of Mr. DOLLOND , several good thermometers made by Messrs. DOLLOND and NEWMAN , besides a sufficient number of excellent telescopes of DOLLOND'S , and so placed on stands adapted for the object as to bring the opposite station without trouble in the field of the telescope .
The moisture of the air was determined for the first time in such experiments by Mr. DANIELL'S hygrometer , one of which was placed at each station .
The direction of the wind was determined by very good vanes contrived by the Artillery officers .
At each station a twelve pounder and a six pounder was planted , and the instruments were disposed in , or in the vicinity of tents erected for the purpose .
Professor MOLL , with Lieutenants RENAULT and DILG , was stationed at the Kooltjesberg .
Dr. VAN BEEK , with Lieutenants SOMMERTON , VAN DEN BYLAARDT and SEELIG were on the other station , which is commonly called Zevenboompjes , or seven trees , from the circumstance of seven trees being planted on this lonely elevation .
Several gentlemen cadets of the Artillery , and several students of the University , were at both stations employed in observing the different instruments .
The barometers and thermometers were of course ob4,8 served in the open air ; Mr. DANIELL'S hygrometers were also placed in the open air ; and the light of a candle reflected from the surface of the ball of the hygrometer , gave the means of observing the deposition of dew with great accuracy .
It was deemed of the utmost importance that the shots on both stations should be fired at as nearly the same moment as possible .
To obtain this , the following plan was adopted .
At 7h 55 ' P. M. by the chronometer of Zevenboompjes , a rocket was fired at Zevenboompjes , which being observed at the other station of Kooltjesberg , was immediately answered by another rocket from the latter place .
This was the signal that on both stations every thing was ready for observation .
At 8h o ' o " by the chronometer of Zevenboompjes , a cannon shot was fired on that station , whilst the observers at Kooltjesberg took as exactly as possible the time on their chronometer when the light was observed .
A second shot was fired at Zevenboompjes at 8h 5 ' d ' P , M. by the chronometer of that station , and the time at which the light was seen was carefully taken down by the chronometer of Kooltjesberg .
By these means the difference of the two chronometers at both stations , in a distance of about 9 miles , was ascertained with great accuracy ; and in order to show that this preparatory investigation was made with due care , a cannon shot was fired on both places at the moment when the chronometer of Zevenboompjes marked 8h lo ' o " .
If the lights of both shots were seen exactly at the same time , it was a proof that the difference of both time-keepers was known , and that experiments might be safely made .
We own that we did not suppose before hand , that it could 429 be possible to fire continually guns at a distance of g miles exactly at the same second ; but the very great attention and ability of our artillery men overcame this difficulty .
Between our shots at the two stations there was never a greater difference than i " or 9 " , whilst this difference in the experiments of the French philosophers of 18,2 , went to 5 minutes .
This exact correspondence in the firing of the guns was obtained in the following manner .
At each station an officer had the chronometer placed before him on a small table very near the gun ; a non-commissioned officer or gentleman cadet stood ready with the port fire near the touchhole ; and at the instant required the officer holding the chronometer pressed the arm of the person who was to fire the gun , which went off at the very moment .
With a little practice they were certain to fire the gun at any given second .
The first night of our experiments , the 2sd , 24th , and 25th of January , 1823 , we experienced the same annoyance of which the French philosophers had to complain the first night of theirs .
The report of the shots of Zevenboompjes was not heard at all at the station of Kooltjesberg .
But at Zevenboompjes all the shots of Kooltjesberg were distinctly heard .
After the first fhight we constantly used the metal twelve pounders loaded with 6lbs .
of gunpowder .
The 26th of January all the shots were heard at Kooltjesberg , but none were perceived at the opposite place .
But the wind shifting the following night , a good number of corresponding or simultaneous shots were distinctly heard on both stations .
The particulars of the experiments made in these different days will be found in the table3 annexed to this paper .
The dis.430 appointment we met with on the first days was however not entirely fruitless ; we were convinced by it , that none but exactly corresponding shots can be of use in determining the velocity of sound .
The result of the observations of 25th and 26th of January , when the reports were heard at one station only , and reduced to o ?
temperature of the centigrade scale , and dry air , give differences of -- , whilst the obser vations of 27th and 28th of January , when shots were distinctly heard on both stations , had only a difference of -ifrom each other .
The time which sound employs to travel from one station to another being duly ascertained , we proceeded to measure the distance between both stations .
The distances of the steeples of Utrecht and Amersfoort , Utrecht and Naarden , Naarden and Amersfoort being accurately known , we measured angles on jour stations between these steeples , and on each steeple between the other steeples and the stations .
Thus the distance was calculated by four different triangles , and the greatest difference between these calculations was 2m,45 or 8 feet , which appeared of no consequence in these experiments .
The distances of the different steeples which we took for our basis , result from the very exact geometrical survey of General KRAYENHOFF.* From these different data we found , by calculations of which the detail will be given hereafter , that in our experiments at a temperature of 32 ?
FAHRENHEIT , or o ?
of the centigrade scale , the velocity of sound is 332m,049 , or 1089,745 English feet per sexagesimal second .
A table showing the comparison of our experiments , with the observations of other philosophers , is also annexed to this paper .

Having shown in the preceding section how the distance between the two stations was ascertained , we must now proceed to show that the clocks with conical pendulums , with which the interval of time between the light and the report was measured , kept a regular rate ; for this purpose they were frequently compared on each station with the box chronometers .
The following ; table shows how many decimal seconds and fractions of seconds passed on the conical centrifugal pendulum clock in five minutes of the marine box chronometer .

The table shows that the conical pendulum clock , during the course of the experiments , did not alter its rate with respect of the chronometer .
The comparisons between the clock and the chronometer were made at various times of the day , and immediately before and after the experiments .
At the other station of Zevenboompjes , the box chronometer and conical pendulum clock were frequently compared before , during , and after the experiments .
The following table shows that the accuracy of the conical pendulum clock was quite sufficient for the purpose in view .

SECTION VI .
Experiments on the velocity of sound on the 27th June , 1823 , compared with theory .
Having thus far stated the means by which the distance between the stations of Kooltjesberg and Zevenboompjes was ascertained , and the rate determined of the clocks by which the velocity of sound was measured , I will now proceed to give the experiments which were made on the 27th of June , and compare the result with theory .
The following table contains the time which sound employed to travel over the basis on the 27th of June , when 22 shots were simultaneously fired , and equally seen and heard on both stations .
The first column of this table shows the number of the shot , the second the time which sound employed to travel from Kooltjesberg to Zevenboompjes , as observed on the latter station , and the third column the time which sound employed to come from Zevenboompjes to Kooltjesberg , also observed on the latter place .

And as the basis was equal to 17669,28 metres , or 9664,7044 fathoms , we have the velocity of sound , found by experiment as above , equal to 340 , o6 metres , or 1116,032 English feet per second .

In Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S formula / g P , by which the velocity of sound is expressed , D is the density of air , that of mercury being taken for unit .
By BIOT'S and ARAGO'S experiments , the density of perfectly dry air was found at om,76 barometrical pressure to be equal to unity divided by 10o466,89 .
But when the barometrical pressure alters and becomes p , and the temperature becomes t , we have by the law of MARIOTTE D -= , 10466,82xo,76 t i+to0375 And introducing into this formula the correction for the aqueous vapour existing in the air , and calling F the tension of aqueous vapour existing in the air , we find D= -F o1466,82 Xo,76.+t .

Thus the final formula for the velocity of sound , given by theory , is v= / { 0466,82X0m,76{ +t 0,03375 } }pXV Substituting in this formula the quantities stated above , theory gives the velocity of sound for the state of the atmosphere on the 27th of June , 1823 , when the experiments were made , V= 335,14 metres , or 1099,885 Englishl feet ; but the velocity as obtained by experiment was So40,06 = 1116,032 feet .

Experi nents on the SECTION VII .

On the 28th of June , 1823 , fourteen simultaneous shots were equally seen and heard on both stations ; the following table contains the results .

Difference between theory and experiment 4,24 metres = 13,916 feet .
Thus it appears by the experiments both of the 27th and 28th of June , that sound travels faster than its theoretical calculation .
The 27th of June , difference of experiment and theory 4m,92 e8th of June,24 The difference between the experiments of 27th and 28th of June , is but of om,62 , or 2,3629 feet ; that is about -7of the mean result of the experiments of both days .
4B0 The French philosophers found a difference between their experiments of 2sd and 24th of June , 1822 , of .
But the difference of , -^ , which we obtained , if we reduce the observations of both days to what they would have been in perfectly dry air , and in temperature of o ?
cent. is still remarkably lessened .
The formula by which the velocity of sound in given hygrometrical circumstances , and a given temperature of the air , is reduced to what it would be in dry air of o0 cent. temperature , calling U ' the velocity of sound in dry air of o ?
temperature ; U the velocity of sound at a tension of aqueous vapour F , is as follows : I f. - , _^ ___ { = i+ 0,00375 t}x / 1-0,37651). .

Substituting these quantities in the formula , we have U'-332's,38 o090o,827 English feet .
The s8th June , 1823 , we had U 339m,3,4 = 1113,669 feet t= 10,215 F= o , oo840465 ; which being substituted in the formula , we have U'= 331m,72 = lo88,661 English feet .
Thus the difference between the observations of both days , when reduced to dry air , and oo cent. is om66 =,166 feet ; or a0 of the mean of the observations of both days .
It appears also , that by our experiments of the 27th and 28th 451 of June , 1823 , the mean velocity of sound in air perfectly dry , and at o ?
temperature , was 332m , o5 1089,744 feet in a second .
SECTION VIII .
Experiments on the 25th qo June , when the shots were not reciprocal .
The following experiments will I trust prove , that in experiments on the velocity of sound , such observations can only be relied on in which the shots on both stations were reciprocal , that is fell within the same second in both places , and were equally heard and seen on both stations .
The t5th of June , the cannon fired at Zevenboompjes was not heard at Kooltjesberg , but at Zevenboompjes the report of the guns fired at the other place was distinctly perceived .

This difference is about ~3 of the mean of both observations .
But the 27th and 28th of June , when the shots were reciprocal , the difference between the results of both days were only om,66 =,166 feet , that is about z~-3 of the mean result of the observations .
From the comparison of these results we may safely infer , that only such shots will answer the purpose for which these experiments are made , which are exactly fired at the same instant on both stations .
It is in this respect , I imagine , that our experiment may claim some attention , as the very great care and ability of our artillery men enabled us have the guns fired within the interval of one second .
