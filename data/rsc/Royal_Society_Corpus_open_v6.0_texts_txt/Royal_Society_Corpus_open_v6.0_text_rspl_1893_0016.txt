( Abstract .
) In a preliminary note presented to the Society in June , 1887 , the results of twenty-one experiments on the composition of water by volume were given in detail .
The ratio deduced from these experiments was less than two volumes to one of oxygen .
This result was unexpected , because of the greater compressibility of oxygen than of hydrogen , but as every one of the experiments pointed to this result , the evidence for it seemed conclusive .
Pursuing the investigation with improved apparatus , especially as regarded making a complete analysis of the residual gas , a serious source of error was discovered in the use of any combustible lubricant for the taps employed .
On substituting syrupy phosphoric acid for the vaseline previously employed , the oxides of carbon disappeared as ordinary impurities .
In the later experiments two forms of apparatus were employed , the chief difference being that in the earlier form the measuring vessel was not of fixed volume , so that both volume and pressure of the gas had to be measured ; in the later form the gas was measured at constant volume by varying the pressure , which alone , therefore , required measurement in each experiment .
As in the apparatus formerly used , the entire apparatus could be completely exhausted of air before beginning an experiment by using the mercury reservoir ( Mi ) and the measuring vessel as a Toppler 's pump .
The gases were measured in A and B , and after measurement were mixed in the jar H , whence they were drawn into the explosion tube J , and then exploded in fractions till all was used up .
The residue was now passed back into H , and then into B , and there measured , 1893.1 On the Composition of Water by , t\#187 ; i .

These gases were most probably nitrogen , hydrogen , and carbon monoxide ( from the absorbents ) .
The mixture thus obtained gave at any rate a maximum value for any impurity in the gases employed ; when it fell below 1/ 110,000 the gases were considered pure .

All the results in which potassium chlorate was used as the source of the oxygen gave low results , doubtless due to traces of chlorine accompanying the oxygen even after passing through potassium hydrate .
The best oxygen was obtained from silver oxide , and the best hydrogen from palladium hydride .
The palladium used combined with enough hydrogen to perform twelve experiments in succession .

1893.1 On the Composition of Water by Volume .
133 The mean of all the experiments in ihe variable volume apparatus , and in which potassium chlorate was the chief source of oxygen , is 2.000903+000004 impurity equally distributed in both gases , 1-99925 + 0-00005 " assumed to be all in hydrogen , in 5 series of 19 experiments in all .
The mean of all the experiments in the constant volume apparatus , in which silver oxide was used as the source of the oxygen , and sodium and steam either directly , or after absorption in palladiu m lor the hydrogen , is 2-002435+0'00006 impurity in both gases equally , or 2-002431 + 0-00006 " hydrogen alone .
This is the mean of 53 experiments in 5 series .
If 6 experiments be rejected we get the value 2-002466 + 0 0000G3 as the result of 47 experiments in 5 series , and any impurity makes no difference , whether it be assumed all in the hydrogen or equally distributed in both gases .
The most probable value , however , is 2-00245 .
This value , combined with the value 15*882 for the ratio of the densities found by Lord Rayleigh , gives for the atomic weight of oxygen 15-862 Dittmar and Henderson 's value is ... .

" On the Densities of the Principal Gases .
" By Lord Rayleigh , Sec. R.S , Received March 4 , 1893 .
In former communications* I have described the arrangements by which I determined the ratio of densities of oxygen and hydrogen ( 15-882 ) .
For the purpose of that work it was not necessary to know with precision the actual volume of gas weighed , nor even the pressure at which the containing vessel was filled .
But I was desirous before lea'ving the subject of ascertaining not merely the relative , but also the absolute , densities of the more important gases , that is , of comparing their weights with that of an equal volume of water .
To effect this it was necessary to weigh the globe used to contain the gases when charged with water , an operation not quite so simple as at first sight it appears .
And , further , in the corresponding work upon the gases , a precise absolute specification is required of the temperature and pressure at which a filling takes place .
To render the former weighings available for this purpose , it would be necessary to determine the errors of the barometers then employed .
There would , perhaps , be no great difficulty in doing this , but I was of opinion that it would be an improvement to use a manometer in direct connexion with the globe , without the intervention of the atmosphere .
In the latter manner of working , there is a doubt as to the time required for full establishment of equilibrium of pressure , especially when the passages through the taps are partially obstructed by grease .
When the directly connected manometer is employed , there is no temptation to hurry from fear of the entrance of air by diffusion , and , moreover ( Note A ) , the time actually required for the establishment of equilibrium is greatly diminished .
With respect to temperature , also , it was thought better to avoid all further questions by surrounding the globe with ice , as in Hegnault 's original determinations .
It is true that this procedure involves a subsequent cleaning and wiping of the globe , by which the errors of weighing are considerably augmented ; but , as it was not proposed to experiment further with hydrogen , the objection was of less force .
In the case of the heavier * ' Roy .
