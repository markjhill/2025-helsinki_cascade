( Abstract .
) The subject of the present paper was discovered during the " excavations of docks now in progress at Tilbury Fort , Essex , at a depth of 32 feet from the present surface .
It oonsists of a considerable proportion \lt ; of a human skeleton , the parts of which are determined and described .
The inferences deduced are that they were from a somewhat aged male of great muscular strength ; and such inferences as to food , as might be drawn from the worn crowns of the teeth in use at his demise , are given .
A chemical analysis of the bones is added by Dr , Walter Flight , of the Laboratory Department in the British Museum .
A section of the several strata dug through before arriving at the bed is appended .
This section determines the man to have lived at the so-called " Palaeolithic period .
" The author acknowledges his indebtedness to Colonel Du Plat Taylor for the transmission of the skeleton , with a notification of its discovery , in a letter of the 1st October , 1883 ; also to Mr. Donald Baynes , engineer of the dock works , who transmitted a section of the strata .
These consist , from the grave-bed upwards , of " sand , " " mud , " " peat , " " mrud and peat , " " mud , " " clay .
" Figures of the bones and teeth described , and \#166 ; ** plan of the section , ' ' accompany the text .
