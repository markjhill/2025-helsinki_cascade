The first paper read was entitled , " On the Elements of the Orbit of the Comet of Halley in 1759 .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. and Treasurer of the Royal Society .
In calculating the elements of Halley 's comet , former astronomers have in general adopted the parabolic hypothesis , neglecting the re ?
ciprocal of the semi-axis major ; and even in the more recent inves ?
tigations of its orbit , no accurate value of this quantity has been employed .
Mr. Lubbock , perceiving the serious effect which an error in the semi-axis major would occasion in the determination of the other elements , renewed these very laborious calculations , assuming as the value of this quantity that given by M. Pontdcoulant , in his " Theory analytique du Systeme du Monde ; " taking also into account the aiterations which the elements of the comet have undergone by the action of the planets , and likewise the effect of precession upon the longitude of the node , and of the perihelion .
The author takes this opportunity of correcting the very erroneous statements that have been made respecting the results of his investigations , especially with regard to the time of the perihelion passage , which is , of course , very different from that of its actual appearance to spectators on the earth ; although these two epochs are frequently confounded with one another .
