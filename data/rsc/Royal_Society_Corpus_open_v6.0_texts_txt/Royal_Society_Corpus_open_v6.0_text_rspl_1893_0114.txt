[ Mar. 2 , found , as in the copper wire , that there was no permanent alteration unless there was permanent stretching .
Hitherto the results on specific resistance have been given by all investigators on this subject , except Lord Kelvin , in volume units , but , as the alteration in density is in every case very small , the results obtained in the present investigation are in very good agreement with those of former experimenters .
The conclusions arrived at are that for practical purposes any mechanical treatment , however severe , does not affect the electrical properties of the metals tested .
As contrasted with this , it is interesting to note that the smallest impurity in the metal produces a greater change than the most severe mechanical treatment .
For example , an impurity of f per cent , lowers the electrical conductivity by 13 5 per cent , while an impurity of \#163 ; per cent , lowers it as much as 30 per cent. HI .

Professor Dewar made an oral statement to the effect that he had succeeded in freezing liquefied atmospheric air into a clear transparent solid .
Whether this solid is a jelly of solid nitrogen containing liquid oxygen , or a true ice of liquid air , in which both oxygen and nitrogen exist in the solid form , was , however , stated to be a question for further research .

( Abstract .
) In a communication made early this year ( 1892 ) to the Geological Society , the author showed that in the South of England , besides the superficial drift deposits of river , sea , and glacial origin , there was yet another which could not be referred to any of these agencies , and which he was led to conclude was the result of a submergence of not less than 1000 feet at the close of the so-called Post-Glacial Period .
This drift , unlike the others , does not contain either fluviatile or
