) The fixation of nitrogen by Azotobacter and Pseudomonas depends upon the presence of a fermentable carbohydrate as a source of energy .
Although a large number of carbohydrates can be utilised by these organisms there is a considerable variation in their efficiency , and for effective fixation it is necessary to work with a sugar specially suitable for the organism under investigation .
It is generally recognised that mannite is the most efficient kind for Azotobacter and maltose for Pseudomonas .
Unfortunately mannite is practically useless for Pseudomonas and maltose for Azotobacter .
Further it was found when working with a mixed culture of Azotobacter and Pseudomonas that the mixture of carbohydrates ( mannite and maltose ) was not satisfactory .
It was desirable , therefore , to obtain a carbohydrate which would be equally efficient as a source of energy for both organisms .
This has been obtained in dextrin .
In order to compare the influence of dextrin with mannite and maltose upon Azotobacter and Pseudomonas respectively , six series of Erlenmeyer flasks , four flasks in each series , were arranged .
All the flasks contained 100 c.c. of a nutrient solution consisting of di-potassium phosphate 0*2 grm. , magnesium sulphate 0*02 grm. , basic slag 0'4 grm. , in 100 c.c. distilled water .
The series were treated as follows:\#151 ; A received 1 grm. dextrin ; B , 1 grm. maltose ; C , 1 grm. dextrin ; D , 1 grm. mannite ; E , 2 grm. dextrin ; F , 1 grm. maltose and 1 grm. dextrin .
A and B were each inoculated with 1 c.c. of a pure culture of , C and D with 1 c.c. of a pure culture of Azotobacter , and E and F with 2 c.c. of a mixed culture ( 1 c.c. of Pseudomonas and 1 c.c. of Azotobacter ) .
In each series flask 1 was autoclaved immediately after inoculation and served as a control ; flask 2 was used for testing the carbohydrate ; flasks 3 and 4 were analysed for amount of nitrogen fixation .
All the flasks were incubated at 26 ' C. until the carbohydrate was completely used up as shown by flasks 2 .
Nitrogen determinations were then made and the following results obtained:\#151 ; Nitrogen Fixation by Aerobic Organisms .

Another difficulty encountered in working with mixed cultures was the neutralisation of the nutrient medium .
The neutralisation agents generally employed are calcium carbonate for Pseudomonas , and sodium hydrate for Azotobaeter .
In some preliminary experiments with various neutralising agents it was found that basic slag gave excellent results with both organisms , not only effectively neutralising the medium but also increasing nitrogen fixation .
This tonic effect of basic slag is probably due to the presence of iron and manganese .
Krzemieniewski* has shown that humus stimulates the fixation of nitrogen by Azotobacter in a remarkable manner .
Later it was pointed out by Remy and Rosingf that this stimulating effect is due to the presence of iron in the * ' Bull .

humus .
As these experiments had reference only to Azotobacter an investigation was made on the effect of humus and basic slag ( which contains iron ) on the fixation of nitrogen by pure cultures of Pseudomonas .
Three series of four flasks each were arranged .
Each flask contained 100 c.c. of culture solution containing 1 per cent , dextrin , 0*2 per cent , di-potassium phosphate and 0*02 per cent , magnesium sulphate .
Each flask was inoculated with 1 c.c. of a pure culture , .of Pseudomonas from the root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris .
Series A received 1 per cent , of chalk ; Series B , 0*03 per cent , of potassium humate ; and Series C , 0*4 per cent , basic slag ( containing lime 47 per cent. , phosphoric acid 18*88 per cent. , and iron 6*89 per cent. ) .
The flasks were inoculated at 26 ' C. until all the dextrin had disappeared .
Nitrogen determinations then gave the following:\#151 ; Series .

From the two sets of experiments described above it is evident that a simple and effective nutrient medium for both Azotobacter and Pseudomonas is obtained by adding to distilled water 1 per cent , of dextrin , 0*2 per cent , of di-potassium phosphate , 0*02 per cent , magnesium sulphate and 0*4 per cent , basic slag .
