( Abstract .
) Experiments by different observers have shown that electrical resistance thermometers afford the most convenient and accurate method of measuring temperature through a very wide range .
By selecting a particular thermometer as the standard , and directly comparing others with it , it has been found possible to attain a degree of accuracy of the order of 0''001 in the relative measurements between 0 ' and 100 ' C. , and of the order of 0O-01 at 450 ' C. In a previous communication* it has been shown that , if t be the temperature by air thermometer , and if pt be the temperature by platinum resistance thermometer , the difference between them is very closely represented from 0 ' to 700 ' C. by the formula d = t-Pt = b { i/ Ibbp-*/ ioo } ... ... ... . .

The value of the constant B for a particular wire was found to be 1-570 .
The object of the present paper is to describe a method of finding the value of this constant for any such thermometer , by means of a single observation at some known fixed point other than 0 ' or 100 C. The boiling point of sulphur happens to be the most convenient for this purpose .
AVe have therefore made a careful determination of this point by reference to the standard air thermometer , and have given a full description of the method and apparatus which we have * Callendar , 'Phil .

] Determination of the Boiling Point of Sulphur , fyc .
found most suitable for standardising platinum thermometers by means of it .
The paper is divided into three parts .
Part I contains a description of the method and apparatus employed in comparing the platinum thermometers used in this investigation with the air thermometer at a temperature very near the boiling point of sulphur .
Part II contains the determination of the actual boiling point of sulphur by means of the thermometers thus standardised , and a description of the method and apparatus to be used in standardising other platinum thermometers .
A table is also given reduced from a previous series of observations of other fixed points which may be used for the same purpose .
Part III contains a comparison of the platinum and air thermometers between 0 ' and 100 ' , and shows that the ^-formula holds-accurately between those limits .
The determination of the boiling point of sulphur was made by means of three platinum thermometers , L , Mx , and M2 , constructed out of the wire used in the experiments of 1887 , before referred to .
Pull descriptions of these thermometers are given in the paper .
They were furnished with double electrodes for measuring the resistance of the connecting wires at each observation , their insulation was carefully tested , and all due precautions were taken to guard against thermal effects and other sources of error .
Thermometers Mx and M2 were standardised by direct comparison with an air thermometer at the boiling point of sulphur .
Full particulars are given of the details of the observations and calculations , showing the limits of error of the experiments .
The expansion of the glass forming the bulb of the air thermometer was determined both by the method of linear expansion , and also by using the bulb itself as a mercury weight thermometer .
The values found by the two methods agreed very closely .
The small changes of the volume of the bulb were determined from time to time during the progress of the experiments .
The final observations were not taken till the thermometer had reached a fairly steady state .
The limit of accuracy attainable with this air thermometer was found to depend chiefly on that of the barometric readings .
The barometer used was therefore verified by a careful comparison with the standard metre scale .
The iron-tube apparatus in which the platinum and air thermometers were compared was so constructed as to be capable of being maintained at a constant temperature by a steady flow of sulphur vapour for any length of time .
Observations were taken with it on two separate days .
On each Messrs. H. L. Callendar and E. H. Griffiths .
[ Dec. 18 , Ij occasion the temperature was kept steady to 0''l for about two hoars .
\#166 ; Allowing for the difference of the atmospheric pressure , the tempera- 8 tnre attained was the same on both days .
The results of the comparison were in perfect agreement with the IB experiments of 1887 , and showed that the ^-coefficient of the wire I had not altered appreciably in the interval .
The apparatus which we have found most convenient for standard- I ising platinum thermometers by means of the boiling point of sulphur I consists of a wide glass tube , 40 cm .
long and 4 cm .
in diameter , ||Bt with a spherical bulb at the end .
Tubes of this kind are com- f monly used to heat Victor Meyer 's vapour-density apparatus .
For f brevity we have called it a " Meyer " tube .
The outside of the tube is thickly padded with asbestos wool , with the exception of the lower half of the bulb , and of a short length of 1 3\#151 ; 5 cm .
at the top , which serves as a condenser .
The tube is filled 1 with sulphur to a level of 3 or 4 cm .
above the bulb , and is heated by I a Bunsen burner .
The gas is adjusted so as to keep the level of the 1 vapour near the top of the tube , which is covered with asbestos card | to prevent the sulphur catching fire .
Our experiments have shown that a thermometer inserted in an S apparatus of this kind will not attain the actual temperature of the 1 vapour , unless it is protected from , radiation to the sides of the tube , | and from the condensed liquid which runs down the stem .
The .
l| lowering of temperature due to radiation , \amp ; c. , may readily amount to upwards of 2 ' at the boiling point of sulphur .
The method which we have adopted for screening the thermometer is to bind an umbrella of asbestos card on to its stem a short distance J above the bulb .
Two coaxial tubes are hung on to this umbrella to ] screen the thermometer from radiation .
We have found that glass is j not sufficiently opaque to heat radiation at this temperature .
The j inner tube at least should be of metal .
To avoid superheating of the vapour , it is necessary to make sure i that the level of the liquid sulphur stands well above that part of the bulb which is exposed to the flame .
Using these precautions , we have found that the temperature by normal air thermometer at constant pressure of the saturated vapour sulphur boiling freely under a pressure , of 760 mm. of mercury at 0 ' C. , and g = 980*61 C.G.S. ( sea level in lat. 45 ' ) , is t \#151 ; 444'*53 C. The value given by Regnault* is nearly 4 ' higher than this ; but .
in the account which he gives of his experiments he has pointed out several sources of error , and it is evident that he did not place much confidence in his results .

] Determination of the Boiling Point of , 59 The close agreement between the air thermometer experiments of 1887 and the present series , leads us to conclude that the number above given is probably correct to a tenth of a degree , and that it may be safely used for standardising platinum thermometers .
The method which we recommend for standardising platinum thermometers is briefly as follows:\#151 ; Observe the value Id* of the resistance in sulphur vapour in an apparatus such as we have described .
Calculate the value of ptsby the formula pts = 100 ( R* R0)/ ( R100 K-o)Find the temperature t of the sulphur vapour , corresponding to the corrected barometric pressure H0 , from the formula t = 444-53 + 0-082 ( H0-760 ) .
The appropriate value of o is then given by the equation t-pt = a { */ 100j3-*/ 100 } .
We have made use of this method to reduce the results given in a previous communication , " On the Determination of some Boiling and Freezing Points by means of the Platinum Thermometer , " * and we find that the values of t deduced from the observations with several thermometers of different patterns and with very different coefficients , are in remarkably close agreement .
The results found with the three best thermometers are given in the following table :\#151 ; Table of Boiling and Freezing Points reduced by Formula ( d ) .

On Generic [ Dec. 18,1 assumption of the accuracy of the 3-formula , and have not been directly referred to the air thermometer .
We believe , however , that they are probably correct to 0''l C. , and that they may be safely used to standardise thermometers of limited range , in cases where it may happen to be inconvenient to make use of the sulphur point .
In comparing the platinum and air thermometers between 0 ' and 100 ' C. observations were taken at intervals of 5 ' all the way up .
The mean deviation of the observations from the parabolic formula ( d ) is only 0''006 .
This corresponds to the limit of accuracy of the barometric readings , and there is no reason to suppose that the 3-formula may not represent the difference even more closely than this .
The same platinum thermometer has been compared with several mercury thermometers standardised at Kew.* The result seems to show that .the Kew standard reads 0o , l C. lower than our air-thermometer at 30 ' .

] In the year 1872 , Sir Richard Owen described and figured in the ' Phil. Trans.'f two imperfect lower jaws of a large extinct Wombat , from the Pleistocene of Queensland , under the name of Phdscolomys ( Phascolonus ) gig as , the term Phascolon being employed in a subgeneric sense .
The species Phascolomys gigas , it should be observed , was founded by the same writer J at an earlier date , upon the evidence of a detached cheek-tooth .
Subsequently Sir Richard OwenS described and figured certain imperfect upper incisors , from Queensland and South Australia , characterised by their peculiarly flattened and chisel-like shape , under the new generic name , which was suggested from their contour .
In cataloguing the fossil Mammalia in the collection of the British Museum , || I was at once struck by the circumstance that , while the upper incisors of the so-called Phascolomys gigas were unknown , there were no cheek-teeth which could be referred to Sceparnodon , and it accordingly occurred to me that the two might prove to be identical .
Support was afforded to this conjecture by the following circumstances : 1st .
