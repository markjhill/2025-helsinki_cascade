174 Drs. Brunton and Fairer on Pulsation [ June 15 , arrested .
When the pressure begins to fall the secretion of urine again commences .
The urine collected after the recommencement of the secretion was not albuminous .
24 .
When injected into a loop of intestine it does not increase the secretion , nor does it produce any distinct congestion .
25 .
When applied to the eye it has no action on the pupil , nor does it cause congestion of the conjunctiva or lachrymation .
26 .
When administered to a pregnant cat it did not produce abortion .

The temperature of the body is not affected by administration of the drug .

" Note on Independent Pulsation of the Pulmonary Veins and Vena Cava .
" By T. Lauder Brunton , M.D. , F.R.S. , and Sir J. Fayrer , M.D. , K.C.S.I. Received June 15 , 1876 .
In a former communication* we incidentally mentioned that in a rabbit killed by the injection of cobra-poison into the jugular vein we had observed the pulmonary vein pulsating after all motion had ceased in the cavities of the heart .
We have since observed the same phenomenon three or four times under conditions which show that this pulsation is not due to the action of the cobra-poison with which the animal in which we first observed it had been killed .
The following example will show the changes in rhythm observed in these pulsations .
A cat was chloroformed , and the vagi exposed and irritated by an interrupted current .
Artificial respiration was kept up by air containing chloroform vapour , and the thorax was then opened , and a solution of atropia injected directly into the heart by means of a Wood 's syringe .
The vagi were again irritated , but without any effect being produced on the heart , the inhibitory apparatus in it being evidently paralyzed by the atropia .
A solution of glycerine extract of physostigma was now injected into the heart in a similar way .
The vagi were now irritated again , and the heart stood still , the effect of the atropia having been counteracted by the physostigma .
After the irritation ceased the heart again commenced to pulsate .
Artificial respiration was now discontinued , but all the cavities of the heart continued to beat for a considerable time .
The ventricles then stopped , but the auricles continued to beat .
It was then noticed that the pulmonary veins in the right lung , which was exposed to view , were pulsating .
The veins , as well as both auricles , pulsated at the rate of 119 per minute , but the contractions of the veins were not synchronous with those of the auricles .
Both auricles next ceased to beat , but the pulmonary veins in both lungs continued to pulsate .
The ventricles now began to beat again , while the auricles remained still .
The ventricles pulsated at the rate of 8 per minute , while the pulmonary veins pulsated at the rate of 46 per minute ; and no motion was perceptible in any part of the auricles .

] of the Pulmonary Veins and Vena Cava .
175 One hour and twenty minutes after the thorax had been opened , and about an hour and ten minutes after artificial respiration had been discontinued , the ventricle was still pulsating .
Its rhythm was very irregular .
After one beat a pause of half a minute followed , and then 37 pulsations all together .
One hour and forty minutes after opening the thorax the inferior vena cava was noticed to be pulsating close to its entrance into the auricle .
A contraction spread like a wave from the vena cava over the right auricle , and the appendix contracted after the auricle itself .
The superior vena cava also pulsated close to the heart .
The left aui'icle had ceased to pulsate a considerable time previously , and the ventricles had also stopped .
After the auricles had pulsated for a while the ventricles again began .
At one hour and fifty minutes after opening the thorax the inferior vena cava was still pulsating .
In ten minutes more all movement had nearly ceased , and the observation was discontinued .
At one hour and fifty minutes after opening the thorax slight contractions of the diaphragm were noticed .
The striking points in this experiment are the contractions of the pulmonary veins and the vena cava independently of the heart , the long time during which they retained their irritability , and the continuance of their pulsations after the other parts of the heart had ceased .
The pulsation of the pulmonary veins and of the ventricles at the same time , while the auricles were motionless , is also deserving of attention .
In another experiment we found the pulmonary veins pulsating in a cat killed by a blow on the head .
We have also seen pulsation in animals killed in other ways ; but the proportion of cases in which we have seen it to those in which we have not seen it is very small .
On looking through several modern text-books of physiology , we have failed to find any mention of the rhythmical contractile power of the pulmonary veins and vena cava ; but the earlier anatomists were well acquainted with it ; and Haller* states that he has seen the pulmonary veins continue to pulsate for two hours , and that others had seen the vena cava pulsate for three hours while all motion in the other cavities of the heart had already ceased .
Johannes Muller 1 " has also observed contractions of the vena cava and pulmonary veins ; and in young animals the contractions of the pulmonary veins extend as far as they can be followed into the lungs .
I he importance of contraction of the vena cava and pulmonary veins in prc venting reflux of blood into them during the contraction of the auricle , under circumstances when any hindrance is opposed to the free flow of its contents into the ventricle , is self-evident .
Indeed Haller says that it was supposed to exist by Senac , although he had not seen it .

Mr. W. H. L. Russell on certain Integrals .
[ June 15 , Especially in cases of valvular disease of the heart is it likely to be of great service ; and we think it advisable to bring again before the notice of physiologists and physicians this power of the veins , which , although so long known , appears of late years to have been overlooked .
