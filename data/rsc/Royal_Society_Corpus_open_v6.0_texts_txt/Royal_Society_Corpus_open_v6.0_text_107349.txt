Experiments to ascertain the State in which Spirit exists in fermented Liquors : with a Table exhibiting the relative Proportion of pure Alcohol contained in several Kinds of Wine and some other Liquors .
By William Thomas Brand , Esq. F.R.S. Read June 13 , i8ni .
SECTION I. IT has been a commonly received opinion , that the alcohol obtained by the distillation of wine , does not exist ready formed in the liquor , but that it is principally a product of the operation , arising out of a new arrangement of its ultimate elements .
The proofs which have been brought forward in support of this theory , are chiefly founded on the researches of FABRONI , * who attempted to separate alcohol by saturating the wine with dry subcarbonate of potash , but did not succeed , although by the same means he could detect very minute portions of alcohol which had been purposely added .
To obtain satisfactory results from many of the following experiments , it became necessary to employ wines to which little or no spirit had been added ; for a very considerable addition of brandy is made to most of the common wines , even before they are imported into this country .
I therefore occasionally used Burgundy , Hermitage , Cote Roti , Champagne , Frontignac , and some other French wines , to which , when of the best quality , no spirit can be added , as even the smallest proportion impairs the delicacy of their flavour , and is consequently readily detected by those who are accustomed to taste them .
For these , and for the opportunity of examining many of the scarce wines enumerated in the table annexed to this Paper , I am indebted to the liberality of the Right Hon. Sir JOSEPH BANKS .
Dr. BAILLIE , who took considerable interest in this investigation , was also kind enough to procure for me some port wine , sent from Portugal for the express purpose of ascertaining how long it would remain sound , without any addition whatever of spirit having been made to it .
Lastly , I employed raisin wine , which had been fermented without the addition of spirit .
At a very early period of the present inquiry , I ascertained by the following experiments , that the separation of the alcohol , by means of subcarbonate of potash , was interfered with , and often wholly prevented by some of the other ingredients of the wine .
A pint of port wine was put into a retort placed in a sand heat , and eight fluid ounces were distilled over , which by saturation with dry subcarbonate of potash , afforded about three fluid ounces of tolerably pure spirit floating on the surface .
I repeated this distillation precisely under the same circumstances , and mixed the distilled liquor with the residuum in the retort , conceiving that if the spirit were a product , I now should have no difficulty in separating it from the wine by the addition of subcarbonate of potash ; but although every pre8u caution was taken , no spirit separated : a portion of the subcarbonate , in combination with some of the ingredients of the wine , formed a gelatinous compound , and thus prevented the appearance of the alcohol .
It has been remarked by FABRONI , in the Memoir above quoted , that one hundredth part of alcohol purposely added to wine may be separated by subcarbonate of potash , but several repetitions of the experiment have not enabled me to verify this result ; when however a considerable addition of alcohol has been made to the wine , a part of it may be again obtained by saturation with the subcarbonate .
The necessary addition of spirit to port wine , for this purpose , will be seen by the following experiments .
Four ounces of dry and warm subcarbonate of potash were added to eight fluid ounces of port wine , which was previously ascertained to afford by distillization o2 per cent. of alcohol ( by measure ) , of the specific gravity of 0,825 at 60oo .
In twenty-four hours the mixture had separated into two distinct portions ; at the bottom of the vessel was a strong solution of the subcarbonate , upon which floated a gelatinous substance , of such consistency as to prevent the escape of the liquor beneath when the vessel was inverted , and which appeared to contain the alcohol of the wine , with the principal part of the extract , tan , and colouring matter , some of the subcarbonate , and a portion of water ; but as these experiments relate chiefly to the spirit contained in wine , the other ingredients were not minutely examined .
To seven fluid ounces of the same wine , I added one fluid ounce of alcohol ( specific gravity o,825 ) , and the same quantity of the subcarbonate of potash as in the last experiment ; but after twenty-four hours had elapsed , no distinct separation of alcohol had taken place .
When two fluid ounces of alcohol were added to six fluid ounces of the wine , and the mixture allowed to remain undisturbed for the same length of time as in the former experiments , a stratum of impure alcohol , of about a quarter of an inch in thickness , separated on the surface .
The addition of three fluid ounces of the alcohol to five fluid ounces of the wine , formed a mixture from which a quantity of spirit readily separated on the surface , when the subcarbonate was added , and the gelatinous compound sunk nearly to the bottom of the vessel , there being below it a strong solution of the subcarbonate .
When in these experiments Madeira and Sherry were employed instead of Port wine , the results were nearly similar .
It was suggested to me by Dr. WOLLASTON , that if the wine were previously deprived of its acid , the subsequent separation of the alcohol , by means of potash , might be less interfered with .
I therefore added , to eight fluid ounces of port wine , a sufiPcient quantity of carbonate of lime to saturate the acid , and separated the insoluble compounds produced by means of a filter .
The addition of potash rendered the filtered liquor turbid , some soluble salt of lime , probably the ralate , having passed through the paper ; but the separation of alcohol was as indistinct , as in the experiments just related .
It is commonly stated , that the addition of lime water to wine , not only forms insoluble compounds with the acids , but also with the colouring matter , and that these ingredients may be thus separated without heat ; but on repeating these experiments , they did not succeed , nor could I devise any mode of perfectly separating the acids , and the extractive and colouring matter ( excepting by distillation ) , which did not interfere with the alcohol .
If the spirit afforded by the distillation of wine were a pro duct and not an educt , I conceived that by performing the distillation at different temperatures , diffRerent proportions of spirit should be obtained .
The following are the experiments made to ascertain this point .
Four ounces of dried muriate of lime were dissolved in eicVht fluid ounces of the Port wine employed in the former experiments : by this addition , the boiling point of the wine , which was 9go ?
FAHRENHEIT , was raised to 200o .
The solution was put into a retort placed in a sand heat , and was kept b , iling until four fluid ounces had passed over into the receiver , the specific gravity of which was 0,96316 at 60 ?
FAHRENHEIT.* The experiment was repeated with eight fluid ounces of the wine without any addition , and the same quantity was distilled over , as in the last experiment : its specific gravity at 60 ?
FAHRENHEIT , was 0,96311 .
Eight fluid ounces of the wine were distilled in a water bath ; when four fluid ounces had passed over , the heat was withdrawn .
The specific gravity of the liquor in the receiver was 0,96320 at 60 ?
FAHRENHEIT .
The same quantity of the wine , as in the last experiment , was distilled at a temperature not exceeding 180 ?
FAHRENIEIT .
This temnperature was kept up from four to five hours , { for five successive days , at the end of which period , four ounces having passed into the receiver ; its specific gravity at 60 ?
was ascertained to be O,961i4 .
It may be concluded , from these results , that the proportion of alcohol is not influenced by the temperature at which wine is distilled , the variation of the specific gravities in the above experiments being even less than might have been expected , when the delicacy of the operation by which they are ascertained , is considered .
I have repeatedly endeavoured to separate the spirit from wine , by subjecting it to low temperatures , with a view to freeze the aqueous part ; but when the temperature is sufficiently reduced , the whole of the wine forms a spongy cake of ice .
In a mixture of one fluid ounce of alcohol with three of water , I dissolved the residuary matter , afforded by evaporating four fluid ounces of Port wine , and attempted to separate the alcohol from this artificial mixture by freezing ; but a spongy cake of ice was produced as in the last experiment .
When the temperature is more gradually reduced , and when large quantities of wine are operated upon , the separation of alcohol succeeds to a certain extent , and the portion which first freezes is principally , if not entirely water , hence in some countries this method is employed to render wine strong .
SECTION II .
Having ascertained that alcohol exists in wine ready formed , and that it is not produced during distillation , I employed that process to discover the relative proportion of alcohol contained in different wines .
In the following experiments , the wine was distilled in glass retorts , and the escape of any uncondensed vapour was prevented by employing sufficiently capacious receivers , well luted , and kept cold during the experiment .
By a proper management of the heat towards the end of the process , I could distil over nearly the whole of the wine without burning the residuary matter : thus , from a pint of Port wine , of Madeira , of Sherry , &amp;c. I distilled off from fifteen fluid ounces , to fifteen fluid ounces and a half ; and from the same quantity of Malaga , and other wines containing much saccharine matter , I could readily distil from fourteen to fifteen fluid ounces .
In order to ascertain the proportion of alcohol with precision , pure water was added to the distilled wine , so as nearly to make up the original measure of the wine , a very small allowance being made for the space occupied by the solid ingredients of the wine , and for the inevitable loss during the experiments : thus , five fluid drachms and a half of distilled water were added to fifteen fluid ounces and a quarter of the liquor procured by the distillation of a pint of port wine , and in other ca':es n-early the same proportions were observed .
This mixtire of the distilled wine and water , was immediately trans errd ito a wll stopped pp phial , and having been thorougjily agitated , was allowed to remain at rest for some hours ; its specific gravity ( at the temperature of 6o FAHRENHEIT ) , was then very carefully ascertained , by weighing it in a bottle holding exactly one thousand grains of distilled water at the above temperature , and the proportion of alcohol per cent. by measure , was estimated by a reference to Mr. GILPIN'S tables , * the specific gravity of the standard alcohol being 0,850oo at 60 ? .
As the most convenient mode of exhibiting the results of these numerous experiments , I have thrown them into the form of a table ; in the first column the wine is specified ; the second contains its specific gravity after distillation , as above described ; and the third exhibits the proportion of the pure spirit , which every hundred parts of the wine contain .
I have also inserted porter , ale , cider , brandy , and some other spirituous liquors , for the convenience of comparing their strength , with that of the wines .

t The proportion of spirit , which may be obtained from these three liquors , is subject to considerable variation in different samples : the number given for each , in the table , is therefore the mean of several experiments , as it did not seem necessary to specify them separately .
