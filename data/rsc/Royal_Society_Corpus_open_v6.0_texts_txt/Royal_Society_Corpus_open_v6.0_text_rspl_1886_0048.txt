( Abstract .
) The author has recently had the honour of presenting to the Society a memoir relating to the internal friction of metals when vibrating torsionally at temperatures ranging from 0 ' C. to 25 ' C. He now brings forward results which have been obtained in experiments on the effect of change of temperature on the torsional elasticity and internal friction of metals .
The apparatus used and the mode of experimenting are fully described in the paper , so that it will be sufficient , perhaps , to state here that the vibration-period and the logarithmic decrement were very carefully determined at four different temperatures between 0 ' C. and 100 ' C. , and that the formulae given below were worked out by the method of least squares ; these formulas are to be found in Tables I and II .
A full account of the method adopted for eliminating the effect of the resistance of the air has been given in the previous memoir above alluded to .

This treatment consisted in repeatedly heating the wire to 100 ' C. , and then cooling it again until the torsional elasticity and the internal friction both became constant at all the temperatures at which the wires were tested , and produced the following permanent effects :\#151 ; ( a. ) Very appreciable increase of the torsional elasticity in the case of some metals and appreciable increase of the torsional elasticity in all cases .
( 5 .
) Large diminution of the internal molecular friction , the effect on the friction being considerably greater than the effect on the elasticity .
( e. ) Yery appreciable increase of the limiting amplitude beyond which the logarithmic decrement ceases to be independent of the amplitude .
From a consideration of Tables I and II it may be gathered that:\#151 ; ( d. ) The torsional elasticity of all metals is temporarily decreased by rise of temperature between the limits of 0 ' 0 .
and 100 ' 0 .
, the amount of decrease per degree rise of temperature increasing with the temperature .
To this may be added that the percentage decrease of torsional elasticity produced by a given rise of temperature is for most metals about twenty times the corresponding percentage increase of length .
( e. ) If we start with a sufficiently low temperature the internal friction of all annealed metals is first temporarily decreased by rise of temperature and afterwards increased .
The temperature of minimum internal friction is for most annealed metals between 0 ' C. and 1886 .

( / .
) The temporary change , whether o\#163 ; the nature of increase or decrease , wrought by alteration of temperature in the internal friction of metals , is in most cases enormously greater than the corresponding change in the torsional elasticity .

It was shown by M. Henri Loewel ( see " The Chemist , " Part VIII , p. 476 ) that the addition of a solution of chromous chloride to stannous chloride caused a precipitate of metallic tin , the reaction forming chromic chloride .
On heating the solution to the boiling point , 212 ' F. , it was found the precipitated metal was in a great measure redissolved , forming the original solution , chromous chloride and stannous chloride , without the liberation of hydrogen .
On cooling this solution the tin was again precipitated , the action continuing as often as the solution was heated and cooled .
As chromous chloride has a great affinity for oxygen , it is necessary the air should be excluded from the solution , otherwise the chromous chloride would be reduced to oxychloride of chrome , as Loewel states , and the reactions would cease to take place after a time , the stannous chloride formed during each heating remaining in solution .
I constructed , in the form of a simple galvanic cell , a small element with this solution , chromic chloride , * as the electrolyte , using tin as the positive , and platinum as the negative metal .
At 60 ' F. this element gives no electromotive force , although in this case , when the ceil was first set up , it gave 0'0048 volt , owing probably to the presence of some foreign substance .
On the elevation of its temperature by the application of heat , the electromotive force rose and fell , as indicated in the diagram ; the curves A , B , C , D , E , represent its increase during the rising temperature , and the curves F , G , H , I , J , its fall while cooling .
The irregularity of the curves A , B , C , D , E , was probably due to unequal heating .
At the termination of the experiment , when the cell had cooled down to 60 ' F. , no electromotive force was observed , as indicated on * The solution used was made by combining chromium trioxide with hydrochloric acid , and heating .
