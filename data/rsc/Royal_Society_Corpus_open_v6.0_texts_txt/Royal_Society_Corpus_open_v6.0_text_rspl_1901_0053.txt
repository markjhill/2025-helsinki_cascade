( Abstract .
) At the outset , the idea of a true yeast ( Saccliaromyces ) which conjugates may appear anomalous in the extreme , but it is not improbable that such an event has been observed before in such organisms , though the phenomena have been misinterpreted .
The yeast which is the subject of this communication was obtained from commercial ginger , pieces of this substance being placed in sterile saccharose-Mayer solution and kept at 25 ' C. until the organisms situated on the surface of the ginger had attained vigorous growth .
These were separated by means of fractional plate-cultures of beer-wort gelatine .
The colonies of the yeast-form , as seen on beer-wort gelatine plate-cultures , appeared to the naked eye as small rounded white dots , about the size of a pin 's head .
Under the low power of the microscope colonies on the surface of the gelatine had regular edges , while submerged colonies had a woolly appearance , due to numerous radiating branches .
\amp ; A pure culture was obtained from a colony developed from a single cell kept under observation in a hanging drop of beer-wort gelatine .
Streak cultures on beer-wort gelatine and beer-wort agar are of a milky-looking brownish-white colour , and have well-marked regular crenate edges .
Streak cultures on potato and bread are milky-white when moist , and chalky-looking when dry ; on pieces of moist ginger their colour is darker .
A yeast-ring is formed in-old cultures on many liquid media , but no films are produced .
In tubes of beer-wort , which have been actively fermenting , the ring makes its appearance in 10\#151 ; 14 days at 25 ' C It is milky-white in colour , and looks like a layer of cream , deposited around the edges of the liquid .
Such rings are also formed on dextrose-Mayer , lsevulose-Mayer , saccharose-Mayer , and maltose-Mayer solutions being particularly well developed on those liquids which have undergone an active fermentation .
The vegetation of the cultures described consists of typical ovoid and round yeast cells , and in the older cultures a few sausage-shaped and many irregular cells also , some of the latter containing spores .
Reproduction by budding in a typical yeast-like manner is the usual method of growth , taking place best at 25\#151 ; 30 ' C. , the maximum and minimum limits being 37\#151 ; 38 ' C. and 10\#151 ; 13 ' C. respectively .
Reproduction by spores occurs under the usual conditions of spore- Mr. B. T. P. Barker .
formation for the Saccharomycetes .
The gypsum-block method gives a plentiful supply , while spore-containing cells are frequently found in old cultures on nutrient media , whether solid or liquid .
The spore-containing cells differ from those of most other Saccharomycetes in being compound cells , i.e. , they consist of two ordinary ovoid or round cells which have conjugated by means of a beak developed from each , the tips of the beaks fusing , the process thus resembling the well-known case of conjugation of many Algae and Fungi .
The compound cells are thus made up of two ordinary yeast-like cells joined together by a narrow neck , the length of which varies according to the circumstances under which spore formation has taken place .
Details of the process have been observed in hanging-drops of distilled water , in which have been placed a number of vigorously growing cells , the temperature being kept about 25 ' C. The cells , originally clear and homogeneous , in a few hours began to grow vacuolated , and numerous bright-looking granules made their appearance .
In twelve or more hours after sowing , a beak-like tubular process was put forth by many of the cells .
The beaks of two neighbouring cells grew towards each other until their tips were in contact .
Fusion of the walls then took place at the point of contact , being followed by the fusion of the protoplasmic contents of the beaks , which were clearer and brighter than the rest of the protoplasm in the cells .
In a few hours after fusion , the protoplasm began to contract in the cells , and small round masses were formed : these eventually developed into the The bright granules in the cells arranged themselves into groups in connection with the above masses and formed a network around them , the final differentiation of the spores being completed by the formation of a cell-wall around each mass .
The size of the ripe spore is 4\#151 ; 5 ; and the number in each compartment of the mature cell varies from one to four , the most common arrangement being two in each .
The spores germinate in a normal manner .
After swelling they bud like ordinary veast-cells .
Fusion of spores in some cases seems to occur before germination .
The optimum temperature for spore formation lies between 25 ' C. and 30 ' C. , the first signs of spores appearing in 16-24 hours .
At 34 ' C. , 32-36 hours are required , and at 36\#151 ; 37 ' C. , 2\#151 ; 3 days .
Above 38 ' C. no spores are formed .
At 13____25 ' Q fio____14 days are required , and below 13 ' C. practically no spores are produced .
' When heated for 10 minutes in beer-wort the spores are generally killed at 60 ' C. , but some withstand an exposure of 5 minutes to a tempera^ureo^ C. nVitTientmedia , and in spore cultures where the conditions were not of the most favourable character for the formation of spores , many cells of exceedingly irregular shape are found .

The second view receives a certain amount of support from the fact that such fusions are known in other yeasts , Saccharomyces Ludwigii ( Hans ) , but in these eases growth is active , and there does not seem to be any nuclear fusion .
Having regard to the behaviour of the nuclear contents and the subsequent formation of spores , the third view seems most likely .
Looking upon the process then as a sexual act of the simplest kind , and in view of the fact that , while all its other characters accord with those of Saccharomyces , it differs from the latter in the manner of its spore-formation , it is proposed to place it in a new genus , saccharomyces , on the analogy of the genus Schizo-saccharomyces , suggested by Beyerinck for the fission-yeasts .

( Abstract .

In 1895 one of the authors described* a method of measuring hysteresis by observation of the throw of a ballistic electro-dynamometer .
The method in its most elementary form is very simple .
An iron ring of section A and mean circumference l is uniformly wound with NZ turns of primary winding , and the primary current C passes also round the fixed coils of an electro-dynamometer .
A secondary coil of n turns wound on the ring is connected in series with the suspended coil of the dynamometer and an earth inductor , the total resistance of the circuit being S. The effects of self-induction in the secondary circuit being neglected , the secondary current c is An C " S " dT If the couple acting on the suspended coil due to the currents C , be qCc , then at any instant " i n tt Couple since H = 4ttNC , when the magnetic force due to c is neglected .
If the instrument be used ballistically , the angular momentum acquired by the coil while C changes from Co to - Co , is K\#171 ; \gt ; = Ccdt = q | H'/ B- * G. F. C. Searle , " A Method of Measuring the Loss of Energy in Hysteresis , ' Camb .
