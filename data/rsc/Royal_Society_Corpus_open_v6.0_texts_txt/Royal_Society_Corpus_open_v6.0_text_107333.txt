of any Functions of Multinomials .
By Thomas Knight , Esq. Communicated by Humphry Davy , Esq. LL. D. Sec. R. S. Read June 7th , 181o .
F. 1 HE expansion of multinomial functions has , of late , been so ably and fully treated by M. ARBOGAST , in his learned work ' Du Calcul des Derivations , ' that it may appear , perhaps , scarcely necessary to add any thing to what has been written , on the subject , by that excellent geomteter .
Nevertheless , as he is the only one that has hitherto cultivated this part of analysis with any great success ; and as it is agreeable , I believe , to most persons , to be presented with various solutions to mathematical problems , I hope it will not be thought superfluous if I show how the same things may be accomplished in a very different manner .
By the procedure here made use of , we shall also be enabled to arrive at many new and remarkable theorems ( both for direct and inverse derivation ) , which could not , I imagine , be very easily found by M. ARBOGAST'S method-s .
For a function of one simple nultinomial , I give ( amongst others ) the same rules of direct derivaiin ; z , as that author ; but when there are many , and in the more difficult cases of double and triple multinomials , &amp;c. or functions of any number of these , I ofer new and expeditious mietliods ; which are demonstrated with the less trouble , from the analogy which reigns throughout , in this manner of treating the subject ; and the regularity with which we proceed from the easy to the more complex cases .
By means of this analogy also , the reader may without difficulty keep all the rules in his memory .

I shall begin with the expansion of any function of a simple multinomial .
First method.* Iff ( c + z ) represent any function of c+ z , and the fluxions be taken , separately , with respect to c and , , the fluxional coefficient is the same in both cases : or ff +/ Qi ( cz ) ) = ( f+'E ) Q } ; whence it follows , that f( ) -zz z ) f(-- ) fz =f(c + ) .
This being premised , let f(c -cx + cx'+cx'+)= B+B B X-Bx 3 ++ Bx'+ IQ ~ 2 .
3 B+ , &amp;c. ... . .
( 1 ) ; n2 let B , B , B , &amp;c. represent the fluxional coefficients of B , B , B , IA 2I &amp;c. with respect to c , and we shall have f(c ?
cx Ia 2~ 3__2 .
3n If we multiply this by cx 2XXC xs -3 c x ... znc x " n &amp; x + and take the fluent , we shall get , by what was just now shown , another expansion off ( c +cx +cx+c x3 + ) ; See LA CRIOX , C Traite ' le'ment .

Though this is a complete solution of the problem , it affords by no means an easy way of calculating the coefficients ; on which account I shall not trouble the reader with examples .
It will be shown presently , that the nethod of derivation in M. ARBOGAST'S first section is easily obtained from this. .
Second Method .
I here , as in the former case , consider the quantity c+cx+c xz +c 3l + to be a binomial , and take the fluxional coefficient of the function with respect to c ; but l ultiply by the partial fuxion c x , instead of c -+ 2vXx M. , &amp;c. ; we find , by this way of proceedingg , f c ' for the sUn of all thole terms in that are multiplied by the powers !
tl 51 ofc .
In like manner , J B. will be the sum of all those terms , in the sae coefficient , that contain c and its powers ; and , in general , Bc the sum of those that have for factors It m the powers of c Hence is derived an easy method of finding any coefficient , when we know those that precede it : for if these partial values be united , there arises i +j 2 c. + ' .
, &amp;c. ... ... ( 3 ) , provided that we neglect in B2 all those terms which contain c , in 3 all those which contain c or c In -4 all those which have c or c or c , and so on ; whence it happens , that many of the B 's will be neglected entirely , and the chief part of the operation will always be in the first termj Bd .
From equation ( 3 ) , we find the first part of the expansion off ( c +cx+cx + ) to be 2*I *1 + ( C &gt; ) 3 , +J( ) + , , , , +.J ( .

To make the operation plain , I have put a star over every term we are to use , excepting the coefficient of x ' , which is wholly employed .

Now it appears , from what has been shown in this article , that B n-I nn1 n ; ( where y n-z 3 " C. C ; w"2a\ i j\ i/ c6 .

" / " ( m-2 ) It is evident that we might find many other relations between the B 's and their fluxional coefficients ; but those I have given seem the most useful .

By means of these equations , we may find B from n in several ways .
First Method .
If we substitute , in equation ( 2 ) , for B !
for B3 , , S )fo r B , L , ; ... ... ?
for J. ?
I.-4n ( l , ,r ) ; swhich values are got fro equation ( 4 ) , we find ^-nC ( ( I. ) j+ ( n I)c I,.(2 ) ++C+( J*.* ( 6 ) .
This expression agrees with M. ARBOGASTS first method , and affords the following rule .
To find B from .
n take theflion of the latter , with re.pect " " ( ..m+i ) to c , , c , &amp;c. and change generally c ?
into cx - .
This rule is , however , more simple in the enunciation than the practice ; on which account I proceed to a 5 .
Second Method .
We might obtain one from equations ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , but , as it would be somewhat worse than the last , I omit it ; and substitute in equation ( 3 ) , the values of n-z , n-3 , &amp; C. given by ( 5 ) .
We fiAd thus pB '---CB ( I ) , ( I , + ( 3 ) or , if we consider , B under the +form , _ , 13 4+ c+t+3C 7 ) c , f i ) , .

C I-+I c+ * , &amp;c. ... . .
( 8)* Where ainy number of strokes nder the i 's denotes that the fluxional coefficients of f ( c ) therein contained , must be depressed so many orders .
( 2 ) In this expression , we must neglect in t all terms contain11 ( 3 ) I. It ing c , in 3 all those containing c or c , and so on .
Let it be required , for an example , to find the coefcient of x ' , from that of x ' given in article 3 .
We shall have , after neglecting such terms as are above specified , ( I ) ( / nn n 111 ( 2 ) if 1 ( 0/ ww .

i 5.6 / ic= '(c ) c ; these being added give the coefficient of x7 , which was required .
To find B from equation ( 7 ) requires the use of both fluxions and fluents ; in ( 8 ) we are without the fluxional process ; but , in its place , have the trouble of observing the numeral coefficients of each term : there is , however , a way of avoiding the mention of fluents , and the necessity of paying attention to these coefficients .
If we consider equation ( 3 ) and the mode of expansion derived from it , it will be evideiit , Ii Ill that whenever we have any power ( as the mth ) of c or c or c , or &amp;c. it must be divided by the product 2.3.4 ... .m .
This follows from the manner of finding the fluent of such a quantity , r , t , m as c c , and the consideration that we cannot arrive at c with ; i out having passed through all the lower powers , and repeated the fluential process at each .
Hence results the following ( z ) ( 3 ) rule ; ( where by ' , / 3 , &amp;c. I mean these quantities after we have neglected in each of them the terms that have been already specified ) .
( I ) ( 2 ) Omitting all the denominators , multipl y c ; ' by c ; P i , , ( 3 ) , ,1 , -b c ; F by c ; and so on : add these products together , and wherever '1 there is any power of , c , &amp;c. as the mnth , put the product 2.3 ... ..m for a denominator .
6 .
Third Methods If we substitute in equation ( 3 ) the values of B , B , &amp;c. given by ( 4 ) , and it will become n-2 n-3 -3 / nI n l-n-I n ?
n.- .
1III + , &amp;c. ... ... ( 9 ) , where we must neglect , in the second term , every thing that contains c ; in the third term every thing that contains c or c and so on .
If we did not do this , we should have the same combinations of letters , frequently , more than once .
We may , however , instead of proceeding according to the above given direction , omit the superfluous terms at last ; and then the rule will be as follows : / II ToJind n , take the fuxion ofr_ with respect to c , c , c , &amp;c. and " ... m " ..(m+i ) after changing , every where , c ?
into c , take thefluent with respect to this last ; observing to keep only once ihe same combination ?
f letters .
But now let us consider , whether we cannot , by omitting to make certain of the letters vary , prevent the same combinations from being repeated .
/ ( ... ( r.-m ) n ( " ..r(q m r-M ) First , if , in the term Pxcx c , we mmake c vary , according to the rule just now given , there results the ^ ' ... ( r-m ) n-I.(rm+ I ) { .r\ q combination Px cxcxCc ( ... .
( ) ; but the same fluxional coefficient off ( c ) that is multiplied by 1 " ... ( r-m ) n rl " .\ q " ^(r-m ) nPxl c } xi cj willbealsomultiplied by Px c " ... ( r-m+ ) " ... ( r-i ) ( " ... r q-"..e(r-l ) xcxcxc ( where c is either the last factor , with respect to the number of strokes , or the last but one , accordingly as q is equal to or greater than one ) ; if " ..(r--I ) we make this term vary , with respect to c , we shall have the combination marked ( a ) over again .
Let us next consider when it will be necessary to make c " ^.n " ... m\p vary .
In the term ( c ) xPxc ) ... .(3 ) , if we make c " ( n I ) r i)..wP vary , there arises the combination f ( c ) xcxPx c ; but the same coefficient ( as B ) that contains ( / 3 ) , will also r *^..(8tI ) r X..(m-.l).6.m VP-i contain f(c ) x cx xcxc which when we " ... ( m ) * " ... ( z+i ) , make it vary with respect to c gives also f ( c ) xcxPx 1c .
Now c was here the last quantity or the last but one .
We may then affirm , in general , that , if we make every term in B vary with respect to the last quantity , and the last but one also , when this immediately precedes the last , not in place only , but in the number of its strokes , we shall get all the terms we ought to have , any firther variation only giving the same over again .
From equation ( 9 ) we have then the following Rule .
Tofind B take thefluxion of B with respect to the last of the nn -I quantities c , c , c , &amp;c. in each term , and the last but one also , f it immediately precede the last in the number of strokes .
5,8 .n " ... m ( m+ I ) Change every where c* into c* and take the fluent with respect to this last .
This is exactly the same rule as that given by M. ARBOGAST in p. 25 of his work .
7 .
The method pursued in this paper , has a remarkable advantage over M. ARBOGAST'S in what he calls inverse derivation ; * which I shall show hereafter to be extremely useful in the expansion of double and triple , &amp; c , multinomials .
In the present case , of a simple one , we have , as was shown at the end of Art .
3 , nI c. ( 4 ) ( 4I whence this Rule .
Tojind B , the coeficient of x"m , from B that of x , take the mn fluxional coejficient of the latter , with respect to c , and at the same time depress , to the next lower order , all thejfuxional coefficents of f(c ) that are in j. Thus from the coefficient of x6 , which was found in Art .

To complete the theory of the expansion of any function of a simple multinomial , there remains , for us to solve , the following Problem .
It is required to find B without knowig .
any of the coeficients that precede or follow it .
It is , in the first place , evident enough , from what has been done , that / * , , ?
if 'I ff " ... ( m-I ) " ... ( m--1 ) B =/ J(c ) C +f(c ) A+/ J'(C ) A+ ... ... ( c ) " ,.( " .I .

( ... .-+f^(c).i r where A consists ( without considering the denominators ) of all the combinations that can be formed of c , c , c , &amp;c. in whic1 the sum of the strokes shall be n , and the sum of the exponents m. But to form these combinations , for the higher powers , would not be very easy .
It may not be amiss to inquire , therefore , for some regular method of immediately " ... ( m ) " ... " m deriving { from s ; so that we may get all the 4 's In " ... n successively , beginning with which multipliesf ( c ) .
23,.3.f I 11 t I shall take no notice of any numbers , which divide the different terms , till the end of the operation ; haviig shown , in Article 5 , that it will be suficient then to place the product 2.3.4 ... t under every yth powVer There can be no difficulty in perceiving , hat all the con".,.(m--i.)..7 " , , binations in 4 may be derived from those terms in , : that are multiplied by the powers of , in the follwing maw r ner .
First , diminish the exponet of c by one .
Then , diminish the exponent of one of the other quantities by one , and multiply by the quantity that has the next greater number of 3 ' ... r ta..\b strokes .
For , if tcxPxc be one of the combinations " ... ( n ml ) " ... * in 4I , there must necessarily be in , the combination " " ..r a ^. .

( p-.I ) c is either the last quantity or the last but one in the order oj the strokes .
We can then have no difficulty .
in perceiving the truth of the following Rule . ?
" ..(m-- ) " ... m ist .
To find '4 take no notice of any terms in '4 but those that are multiplied by the powers ofc , in all these diminish the exponent of c by one ; and omit the denominators .
edly .
Dimizish the exponent of the last quantity , in these terms , by one ; and multiply by the quantity that has the next greater zlmber of strokes .
3dly .
If the last quantity but one be that which immediately precedes the last in the number of strokes , make it vary in the same manner as was directed for the last .
4thly .
All the combinations being thus formed , put the product '.3e4 ... . .
under every pth power .
The reader may compare this rule with that given by M. , AiRBOGAST , p. 36 .
Suppose it were required to find B ; we must begin with 10 1"..IO 'IO " ' 09 i ?

See Note I. at the end .
The succeeding terms are found with equal ease , I omit to find them only on account of the length of the calculation,.9 I shall now show that the same method may be successfully employed in more complicated cases ; and , instead of dwelling on particular problems , shall proceed at once to the expansion of any function of any functions of simple multinomials , q { F(c+cx+cx'+ ) , f(e+ex+eaz+ ) , &amp;c. ... ... .(4 If we consider c+cx + , e+ex + , &amp;c. as binomials c+ y , e+ z , &amp;c. the function ( a ) , which may be , for the moment , represented by qp , will have for its fluxion , ( y , z , &amp;c. being made to vary ) ' ) '+( )d Z+ &amp;c. =(c)J+ ( ' ' ) Z+ ' &amp;c. ; and consequently ( + &amp; C. 7= F(cc+cx+ ) , f(e 4 exe + ) , &amp; c x ... .

( But B= { F ( c ) , f(e ) , &amp;c. }whence all the coefficients are known .

This solution , however , gives no very expeditious way of actually expanding the function in question ; particularly when we get to the higher powers : but by proceeding as in the second method , made use of for a function of one single multinomial , we find B , i b , , 2 c , , , ce e , , n , , -3 B c+/ c+JeB e+/ B..'+ ... ..+ Bee+B n ?

In B must be negn-I e lected all terms which contain any of the c 's ; in B these , and n-2 those also containing e ; and , n generat all those terms must be neglected , as we proceed , which contain any quantities whose fluxzons have eztered into the preceding terms .
From the above equation is derived an easy mode of expansion , I shall give an example in the case of two fnctions ; and sha1 represent , for brevity , pF ( c ) , f(e ) } by p , and its fluxional coeftcient of the m+ nth order ( when the fluxion has been taken m imes with respect to c and n times with respect toi e ) by p. 1,0 , 0 , rt We find here , B= ; B= c-+ p , e I 1 , O / 2,0 0 , tf , 0,2 ^ I , , BQ c+ qs -+ p e+ +c p4 e ; but to expain more filly the manner of proceeding , let it be required to find B3 from the preceding coefficients .

By this method the expansion might be accomplished without dificulty , each term is found at once , and no reductions are necessary : the one which Iam going to give is , however , much better , being , I conceive , the simplest possible .

Every mth power will be divided by the product 69 a , , y &amp;c. 2,34.,..m : and the fluxional coefficient * X , that multiplies any term , will have for the left hand figure over it that number which is the sum of the exponents of the c 's ; for the next figure on the same side that number which is the sum of the exponents of the e 's ; for the third that which is the sum of the exponents of the d 's ; and so o. The only difficulty then is to find these combinations ( without the possibility of missing any , or the trouble of finding the same more than once ) by some regular process of derivation .
A rule was given in Art .
8 , when we were considering the similar problem in the case of one multinomial , for deriving all the combinations in B , in which the sum of the strokes is r r , from c as origin of derivatio : .
The same rule will apply here , but instead of the one origin f , we have , in the case of two multinomials , the origins Cr e ) I- , ce .
Cc e -e e. Let us consider any particular origin as c em. I denote the term derived immediately from c ( by the rule in Art .
8 , ) by A c ; A and the terms derived from this last , from the same rule by A2 c ; those got from A2 Zc by a3 c ; and so on .
It is evident that all the possible combinations ( of the kind we are seeking ) derived from the origin c e , will be expressed by the product ( +A+C -2 +3 C+ ) ( em+ A en+ az -+ 3e ) , wtlere each derivation of em is multiplied by every one of c , and conversely each one of c by every one of em. We have nothing to do then but to deduce the derivations from ci and e ' by the rule in Art , 8 .
Suppose that B was the coefficient required , and that we 5 wanted all the combinations arising from c3 e2 .
We have here A3=C ; A ' A3 * c3'- ' Ae 2= e ; 2eZ , nd , by substituting hes vales in the above product , we find all the comnbnaiions arising from the origin c3 e to be c3 e it l it , ,/ Il II II It II c3 e ?

It would be as well to rite dowtv the appropriate denominators to each combination as we proceed : and when we had treated all the origins of derivation in this manner , there would only remain to arrange the terms under their proper fluxional coefficients.* If the function under consideration contain three multinlomials , the origins of derivation will be c , c e , c e ... ... ... .

As we have , in this manner , a certain , easy , and regular way of finding all the combinations in any coefficient B , the pror blem is completely solved .
I go on to multinomfals of ihg'her kinds : and , with M. ARBOGAST , shall call those multinomials of the nth order which are disposed according to the powers and products of n dierent letters x , y , z , &amp;c. 15 .
After having so fully entered into particulars , in the preceding cases , there can be no difficulty in perceiving , that a conplete theory of derivation , for the expansio ; z of ny fun ction of any number of functions of multinomials , whether they be simple , or double , or triple , &amp;c. is contained in the following equations .

The sign Z , in the first formula , expresses the sum of all the terms that can be formed by taking for p , v , p , &amp;c. all the whole numbers from o to m , z , r , &amp;c. e , y , p , &amp;c. must not however all equal nothing at the same time .
It is scarcely necessary to , bserve , that certain terms are understood to be neglected in equation ( v ) , according to the rule given in article o1 , which is , that all terms in the B 's must be neglected , as we proceed , which contain quantities whose fluxions enter into the preceding terms .
The above expressions if considered not only in themselves , but with respect to the formulas that are immediately deducible from their developement and combination , in the manner that will presently be shown , appear to be the most general and important in this branch of analysis .

If the function to be expanded contains functions of many double niultinomials , all the formulas , and rules , that have been given for one , may be extended to this case , by means of equations ( x ) and ( x ) ; in the same manner as a like extension was made in treating of simple multinomials .
Thus , from the method of finding B given in article 19 , we m , n get the following Rule .

To find any coefficient , without a knovledge of the rest , when the function contains more than one double multinomial we must combine the rule in the last article , with what was shown in article 14.* ^. .
Thus we have a complete and simple theory of the expansion of functions of double multinomials ; and from equations ( z ) and ( x ) a precisely similar theory may be derived for multinomials of higher kinds .
But it is wholly unnecessary to enter into further details ; we are able , without any more trouble , to see what must be the solution of the following General Problem .
It is required , in the expansion of anyiction of a multzomzial of any kind , to find B the coeiient of Xm in r us vt &amp;c. s n , r , s , t , &amp;c. from B that of xm+ ' yn- ' u ' v &amp;c. m n-*i , r , s , t ) &amp;c. ee Note II .

24 .
In treating multinomials of higher kinds , I have given rules by which certain terms are frequently found more than once : this was done for the sake of simplicity , and that the precepts might be easily retained in the memory ; but was by no means a matter of necessity ; for rules miuiglt without difficulty have been formed ( as from equations ( v ) and ( f ) for a double multinomial ) by which no superfluous terms woulid have been found .
25 .
It will not be an improper termination of this paper , to state what are the peculiar advantages of the method pursued in it .
To many , I have no doubt , its brevity will be a recommenldation ; and that it requires no notation different from that in common use .
For though I have represented some of the fluxional coo :iicients in an unusual manner , as by the doing so was not necessary ; but it appeared advisable to make a distinction between the taking the fluxion with respect to c , and the same operation with respect to c , c , &amp;c. which enter into the c(eficie-nts in a manner different from te first .
The un-iformnity of the procedure is such , that , when we have arrived at the rules for one simple multi &amp; nomial , a person of any skill in this kind'of inquiry might easily divine those for the more difficult cases .
But the most important circumstance is the perfection given to inverse derivation , and the facility with which we may , by that means , find ally large number of terms in the expatision of the higher kinds of multinomials , as has been shown in article 18 and 19 .
The last advantage I shall notice is , that the same rules of derivation serve equally for the expansion of a function of one or of a thousand multinomials : whereas , from M. ARBOGAST'S methods , it woudu not , I imiagine , be very easy to give a rule in words for the expansion of a function of five or six .
85 Note I. Th rule in article 8 may be differently enunciated thus .
" ..(Zm-I ) " , m , To fird 4 take tbefluxional coeffcient of b with respect to c ; and of this i/ tuxional coeficient take the fluxion with respect the last quantities ; change gene"..m " ... ( m+ I ) rally c* into c ?

If the last quantity but one be that which precedes the last in the number of strokes make it vary in the same manner and take thefluent .
This is simpler than the rule in article 8 , and more conformable to the mode of expression made use of in other parts of the paper .
Note .
I. In looking back on what I have written , I am apprehensive it may be thought that I have affected too great brevity in the last paragraph of article zI .
That the reader may have no difficulty , the following problem is added , to illustrate what was said in the passage alluded to .
Problem .
To find at once B in the expansion of a function of two functions of double multino .
msn mials .
It is plain that B must contain all the possible combinations of c 's and e 's ( see the m , n totation of article 2z ) that can be formed with this condition ; that the number of left hand strokes be m ; the number of right hand strokes n. Every rth power must be divided by the product 2.3A4.-.r .
And the flixional coeffcient p , that multiplies each term , will have , for the left hand figure ' and over it , the sum of the exponents of the c 's in that term ; for the right hand figure 1g the sum of the exponents of the e 's , Now to get all the combinations of the kind mentioned above , with their proper divisors , we must plainly take , for origins .
of derivation , all the terms of the following product , when actually multiplieid , { ( ICO)~ ?

3.3u IZ.3..t 2.3 ... 2Z3.t 2JJ In this manner may the terms be derived from all the origins ; after which we have only to arrange them under their appropriate fluxional coefficients .
If we wanted to find immediately B in a function of two multinomials of a m , n , r , &amp; c , still higher kind , the method would be exactly similar .
Note III .
In the preceding pages , I have considered the expansion of multinomial functions generally ; and abstaied from giving particular examples , that the paper might not be extended to an unreasonable length .
There are , however , some cases , --.when the function is a whole positive power--which require a separate notice .
The method of direct derivation given in article 5 , and a similar one at the end of article iI will here fail : this indeed is of no consequence , as the rules in article 6 and z are both easier than the former , and applicable to every case , But it will be necessary to give new methods of inverse derivation ; for if we consider those in the paper , in article 7 for example , it will easily appear , that though they are true generally for the mth power , the case is very different when we give to this letter the particular values I , z , &amp;c. The reason of which is that the fluxional coefficients off ( c ) , after the first , or the second , or the third , &amp;c. vanish ; and these functions may be said not im. properly , when compared with the general form , to give defective expansions ; any rules , therefore , which depend on the depression of the fluxional coeffcients off ( c ) will be of no use here .
The fololowing very extensive rule is the reverse of that , for direct derivation , in article i. It agrees , in its simplest case , with that ofM .
AR OGAST in his article 36 .

Neglecting the terms into which cg c , c1 &amp;c. e , e &amp; C. enter , consider those , I II 111 of the remainder , which contain d , d , d , &amp;c. and proceed as before , -And so on .
This rule has no difficulty , whatever may be the number of multisomials .
The words in italics , were inserted to make the rule include the finding of B from I B ; they are of no use when n is greater than one .
Similar rules for multinomials of higher orders are formed with equal case ; being the reverse of those that have been given for direct derivation .
