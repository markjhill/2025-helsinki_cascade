I. In the equilibrium theory of the tides , as worked out by Newton and Bernouilli , it is assumed that the figure of the ocean is at eacn instant of equilibrium .
But Sir William Thomson has pointed out that , when portions of the globe are occupied by land , the law of rise and fall of water given in the usual solution cannot be satisfied by a constant volume of water .
* In Part I of this paper Sir William Thomsoll'S work is placed in a new light , which renders the conclusions more easily intelligible , and Part II contains the numerical calculations necessary to apply the results to the case of the earth .

On the Correction to the [ Apr. 1 , This equiIibrium law would still hold good when the ocean is interrupted by continents , if water were appropriately supplied to or exhausted from the sea as the earth rotates .
Since when water is supplied or exhausted the height of water will rise or fall everywhere to the same extent , it follows that the rise and fall of tide , according to the revised equilibrium theory , must be given by\mdash ; . .

Let be the fraction of the earth 's surface which is occupied by sea ; let be the latitude and the longitude of any point ; and let stand for , an element of solid angle .
Then we have\mdash ; integrated all the oceanic area .
The quantity ofwater which mnst be subtracted from he sea , so as to depress the sea level everywhere by , is ; and the quantity required to raise it by the variable height is the integral of this function , taken all over the ocean .
But since the volume of water must be constant , continuity demands that\mdash ; . . . . . . .

On substituting this value of in ( 2 ) we shall obtain the law of rise and fall .
Now if be the latitude and W. longitude of the place of observation ; the Greenwich westward hour-angle of the moon at the time and place of observation ; and the moon 's declination , is well known that\mdash ; . . . . .

These five integrals are called by Sir William Thomson , but by introducing the five ] iary latitudes and longitudes , we shall find for the conclusions an easily intelligible physical interpl'etation .
It may be well to observe that ( 5 ) necessarily give real values to the auxiliaries .
For consider the first as a sample:\mdash ; Every element of is , whether positive or negative , necessarily numerically less than the corresponding element of and therefore , even if all the elements of the former integral were taken with the same sign , would be numerically less than unity , and a fortiori in the actual case it is numerically less than unity .
Now using ( 5 ) in obtaining the value of , and substituting in , we have\mdash ; . . . .
( 6 ) The first term of ( 6 ) gives the semi-diurnal tide , the second the diurnal , and the third the tide of long period .
The meaning of the resuIt is clear .
The latitude and tude is a cer.tain definite spot on the earth 's snrface which has : reference to the semi-diurnal tide .
Similarly is anothel definite spot which has reference to the diurnal tide ; and is a definite parallel of latitude which has reference to the tide of long period .
From inspection we see that at the point the semi-diurnal tide ; is evanescent , and that at the point there is doubled tide , ; tide ivanescent , there ieriod.atitude ( sometimes imaginary)there iatitu.eriod tvanesoent , as compared with the uncorrected equilibr.ium theory .

the Correction to the [ Apr. 1 , Many or of these points may fall on continents , so that the evanescence or doubling may only apply to the algebraical expressions , which are , unlike the sea , continuous over the whole globe .
But now let us consider more precisely what the points are .
It is obvious that the latitude and longitude and , being derived from expressions for and sin2 , really correspond with four points whose latitudes and longitudes are\mdash ; Thus there are points of -diurnal tide , situated on a single great circle or meridian , in equal latitudes N. and S. , and antipodal two and two .
Corresponding to these four , there are four points of doubled semi-dinrnal tide , whose latitudes and longitudes are\mdash ; and these also are on a single great circle or meridian , at ight angles to the former great circle , and are in the same latitudes N. and S. as are the places of evanescence , and are antipodal two and two .
Passing now to the case of the al tide we see that being derived from expressions for and , really respond with four points whose latitudes and longitudes are\mdash ; Thus there are four points of evanescent diurnal tide , situated on a great circle or meridian , two of them are in one quadrant in complemental latitudes , and antipodal to them are the two others .
Corresponding to these four there are four points of donbled diurnal tide lying in the same great circle or meridian , and situated similarly with legard to the S. pole as are the points of evanescence with regard to the N. pole ; their latitudes and longitudes are\mdash ; Lastly , in the case of the long period tide , it is obvious that the latitude is either N. or S. , and that there two parallels of latitude of evanescent tide .
In case is less than , or less than , there are two parallels of latitude of doubled tide of long period in latitude arc From a consideration of the integrals , it appears that as the continents diminish towards vanishing , the four points of evanescent and the four points of doubled semi-diurnal tide close in to the pole , two of each going to the N. , and two going to the S. pole ; also one of the points of evanescent and one of doubled diurnal tide go to the N. pole , a second pair of points of evanescence and of doubling go to the S. pole , a third pair of points of evanescence and of antipodes of the third pair ; lastly , in the case of tides of long of doubled tide , in latitudes N. and S. heory by comparison with Bernouilli 's theory . .

307 doubling coalesce on the equator , and a fourth pair coalesce at the period the circles of evanescent tide tend to coalesce with the circles We are now in a position to state the results of Thomson 's corrected Consider the semi-diurnal tide on an ocean-covered globe , then at the four points on a single meridian great circle which correspond to the points of evanescence on the partially covered globe , the tide has the same height ; and at any point on the partially covered globe the semi-diurnal tide is the excess ( interpreted algebraically ) of the tide at the point on the ocean-covered globe above that at the four points .
A similar statement holds good for the diurnal and tides of long By laborious quadratures Mr. Turner has evaluated in Part II the five definite integrals on which the corrections to the equilibrium theory , as applied to the earth , depend .
The values found show that the points of evanescent semi-diurnal tide are only distant about from the N. and S. poles ; and that of the four points of evanescent diurnal tide two are olose to the equator , one close to the N. pole , and the other close to the S. pole ; lastly , that the latitudes of evanescent tide of long period are N. and S. , and are thus but little affected by the land .
Thus in all cases the points of evanescence situated near the ; therefore , that the correction to the equilibrium theory for land is of places where the tide , vanish when there is no land .
It follows , no importance .

On the Correction to the [ Apr. 1 , We have We may thus simply travel round the boundary omitting the places where constant : being careful to go round all the pieces of in the same , direction .
If we suppose to be the meridian of Greeliwich , and the land to be in the norbhern hemisphere , the direction ed above is the wrong one for obtaining the value of the integrals over the land , for the longitudes increase to the left ; but by following this direction we shall obtain the values over the sea as is in reality required .
The resuIt of integration has , of course , a different form for each form of the relation between and representing the boundary .
In computing the numerical values of the integrals , it is convenient to consider together all the parts of the boundary represented by similar equations .
Below are given as representative the forms which the numerator of the first integral a assumes for different forms of the boundary , the quantities within square brackets being taken within limits .

] librium Theory of for the Evaluating these integrals on this supposition , we obtain It will be noticed that the values of are exactly the same as before .
From these we deduce The agreement of these values of ths quantities with the values calculated on the previous supposition is not quite so close as I anticipated , but ib should be remarked that the numerators of the quantities 3 , the differences of positive and 1legative quantities of very much greater magnitude , as becomes obvious on proceeding to the numerical calculation ; and thus a comparatively small change in one of the large compensating quantities , due to large tracts of land in different portions of the globe , affects the integrals a considerable exlent .
In this connexion I was led to investigate the effect of counting various small islands and promontories as sea , or small bays and straits as land .
For instance , a portion of sea in the neighbourhood of Behring 's Straits is included as land , and a corresponding correction must be applied to the integrals .
This correction I have estimated as follows : area of the sea is estimated in square degrees , by drawing lines on a large map corresponding to each degree of latitude and longitude and counting the squares covered by sea , fractions of a square to one decimal place being included , though the tenths have been neglected in the concluded sum .
This area has then been multiplied by the value of ( say ) 314 On the quihbrium of .

By drawing the assumed coast line on a map , it will become obvious that such corrections may be applied for the following portions , defined by the latitude and longitude of their centres of gravity ; remarking that when there is a portion of land which may be fairly considered to compensate a portion of sea in the immediate neighbourhood , no correction has been applied .
For instance , it would be seen that part of the Kamschatkan Peninsula is excluded from the coast line , and part of the Sea of Okhotsk is included ; but these produce nearly equal effects on the integrals in opposite directions , and are thus left out of consideration .
