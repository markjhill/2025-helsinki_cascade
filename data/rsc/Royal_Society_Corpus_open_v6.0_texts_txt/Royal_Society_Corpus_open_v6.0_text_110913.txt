" An Account of some Experiments on the Electro-Culture of Farm Crops .
" &gt; By Mr. William Sturgeon .
Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. , &amp;c. Grass grown on a parallelogram of land , fifty-five yards long by twenty-two yards wide , enclosed by underground wires , was found to be much more abundant than in any other part of the field ; especially in a plot " upwards of fifty yards long , whose breadth was within the wires , and nearly at right angles to the axis of the parallelogram .
" This plot of grass was principally on the western side of the wires , and extended but a very little way on the eastern side .
The axis of the wire-enclosed parallelogram was in the magnetic meridian .
