364 Prof. Owen on the alleged Existence of [ June 11 , tubes containing the pure metal , which had been manufactured and preserved out of contact with any hydrocarbon , were prepared , the metal being obtained free from oxide and the absorption-spectrum being observed in the manner already described .
As soon as the metal began to boil , a series of bands in the blue ( Na y ) made their appearance , and shortly afterwards bands in the red and yellow ( Na a ) , stretching as far as the D lines , came out .
At this period of the experiment the D lines widened , thus blotting .
out a series of fine bands occurring in the orange ( Na ft ) , some of which , consequenly , could not be mapped .
All the bands of the sodium-spectrum shade off , like the potassium-bands , towards the red .
When the vapour of sodium is examined in a red-hot iron tube , the colour of the lime-light , as seen through it , is a dark blue .
As the sodium is swept away by the current of hydrogen passing through , the colour becomes lighter , and the transmitted rays can be analyzed by the spectroscope .
At first , the whole red and green and part of the blue is cut out entirely .
The D lines are considerably widened , and an absorption-band is seen in the green , apparently coinciding with the double sodium-line , which comes next in strength to the D lines .
All the colours , therefore , seem to be shut out , except part of the orange , part of the green , and the ultra-blue .
As the sodium-vapour becomes less dense , more light passes through , and the same absorption-bands are seen as are observed in the other method .
The vapour then has a slight bluish-green tint , but is nearly colourless .
The following numbers give the wave-lengths of the more refrangible edge of the sodium absorption-bands in tenth-metres , obtained in the manner above described:\#151 ; 6668 " 6616 6552 6499 sa 6450 6405 63611 6272 | 6235 )-a 6105 6092 6071 6051 j 6035 \gt ; P 5999 5150"j 5129 | 5082 \gt ; y 5038 5002 4964^1 4927 j 4889 I 4863 'y 4832 4810 Plate IY .

" Note on the alleged Existence of Remains of a Lemming in Cave-deposits of England.^ By Professor Owen , C.B. , F.R.S. Received April 25 , 1874 .
In the " Report on the Exploration of Brixham Cave " ( Phil. Trans. 1873 ) it is stated ( p. 560):\#151 ; " With the appearance in the cave of the smaller common rodents now living in this country , we have to note a remarkable exception , that of the Lemming ( And again , in the list of animal remains as determined by Dr. Ealconer and by 1874 .
] Lemming-remains in England .
365 Mr. Busk , there occurs ( p. 556):\#151 ; " 16 .
Lemming. .

" This is throughout the " Report " treated as an original discovery , the importance of which is impressed upon the Royal Society by the remark:\#151 ; " This circumstance tends to give a greater antiquity to a portion of the smaller remains than from their condition and position we might have been disposed to assign to them " ( .
p. 560 , note ) .
These remains are referred to " the smaller common rodents now living in this country , " viz. " Hare , Rabbit , Water-rats , " " at least two species of Arvi-cola"(ib .
p. 548 ) .
The supposed existence of remains of a Grisly Bear in the Brixham Cave ( Mr. Busk having " reason to believe that bear-remains referred to Ursus priscus belong in fact to Ursus ferox " \#151 ; an " important determination " ) leads to the remark:\#151 ; " The presence of another small North-American animal has been ascertained , viz. the Lemming " ( ib. p. 556 ) .
At the date of publication of my ' British Fossil Mammals , ' it is true that no fossil evidence of a Lemming ( , Illiger ; Link ) had come to my knowledge ; but I have since obtained such of species of both Spermophilus and Georychus , the latter nearly allied to , if not identical with , the Siberian Lemming ( aspalax ) , from a deposit of lacustrine brick-earth near Salisbury , associated with primigenius .
The Lemmings , I may remark , belong to the family of " Voles " ( Arvicolidce ) , not of " Hares " ( Leporidce ) ; but the fossil from " the surface of the cave-earth far in the Reindeer gallery " of the Brixham Cave ( Report , p. 558 ) appears from the figures ( plate xlvi .
figs. 12 , 13 ) to be rightly referred to Lagomys , and to the same species determined and named ( p. 213 , figs. 82 , 83 , 84 ) in the ' British Fossil Mammals ' ( 1846 ) .
The specimen submitted to me by Dr. Buckland was found by the Rev. Mr. M'Enery in Kent 's Hole , Torquay , and includes a larger proportion of the skull than the specimen figured in the " Report " from the Brixham Cave .
It is evidently a Pika , or tailless Hare , not a Lemming .
And the determination of the original or first evidence of Lagomys spelceus , now in the British Museum , led me also to remark:\#151 ; " None of the circumstances attending its discovery , nor any character deducible from its colour or chemical state , indicate it to be an older fossil than the jaws and teeth of the Hares , Rabbits , Field-voles , or Water-voles already described ; yet it unquestionably attests the former existence in England of a species of rodent , whose genus not only is unrepresented at the present day in our British fauna , but has long ceased to exist in any part of the Continent of Europe " ( ' British Fossil Mammals , ' p. 213 ) .
The Lemmings still disturb , by their multitudinous migratory swarms , the husbandmen of Scandinavia .
