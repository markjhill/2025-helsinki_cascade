If the limiting angular velocity permissible in the elongated ellipsoid rotating about a short axis be taken as 100 , then the limiting angular velocities in the thin elliptic disc and the elongated cylinder rotating about their short axes\#151 ; the material , and the length of the long dimension being the same for all\#151 ; are approximately 87 and 71 respectively , both on the stress-difference and greatest strain theories .
A caution must , however , be added that in bodies of such elongated form rotating about a short axis , a sudden change in the angular velocity may prove disastrous .

Secondary Micro-crystalline Structure in Metallic Iron .
The term metallography appositely describes , in one word , that department of metallurgical science which deals with the accurate study and delineation of the ultimate formation or structure of metals , a knowledge of which is of the utmost importance .
This development of the science of metallurgy is destined to prove of incalculable value in the study of the ultimate micro-structure of iron and steel .
Experiments on the microscopic structure of iron and steel appear * This is more exact for a long beam of rectangular cross section than the result I obtained in the ' Quarterly Journal ' for 1888 , p. 29 .
Mr. T. Andrews .
to have been first initiated by Dr. H. Clifton Sorby , F.R.S. , about thirty years ago , and the author about the same time commenced some investigations in this direction .
Strange to say , the subject has since then lain almost dormant , and only recently have scientific investigators resumed the study of the ultimate microscopic structure of metals .
Comparatively little progress has jet been made in this important and fertile field of research , and our knowledge of the true structure of metals is , consequently , at the present time limited .
Excellent work in this direction is now , however , in progress at the hands of several investigators , and it is hoped that by means of further careful detailed observation with accurate modern microscopic appliances valuable and reliable results will accrue .
In the course of a research.with high microscopical powers ( including 300 , 500 , 800 , 1200 , and upwards to 2000 diameters ) on the microcrystalline structure of large masses of wrought iron , the author had the privilege recently to observe the following novel metallurgical facts .
When large masses , several tons in weight , of practically pure wrought iron were allowed to slowly cool from a white heat , a secondary or subcrj sfcallisation of the metallic iron occurred .
The normal primary crystals of the iron , or those which have hitherto been regarded as constituting the ultimate structure of the metal , were found to enclose a subcrystalline formation consisting of very minute , and much smaller , crystals of pure iron also belonging to the regular order of crystallisation .
These crystals sometimes manifested the hexagonal form , the predominant angle being about 120 ' , and often they assumed the form of simple cubes .
The secondary crystals were contained within the area ' of .
the larger primary crystals .
Typical illustrations of this duplex crystallisation found in two large iron forgings are given in figs. 1 and 2 , and the relative dimensions of a number of individual crystals are given on Tables I and II .
The results of twenty measurements of the primary crystals and twenty measurements of the secondary crystals taken on each forging are given on these tables .
The markings of the intercrystalline spaces or junctions of the secondary crystals were very clearly defined , but they were exceedingly minute .
The general form , contour , and relative size of the primary and secondary crystals , as seen in section , will be noticed on reference to the accurate tracings , figs. 1 and 2 .
Judging roughly from the indications of the average micromeasurements on Tables I and II , there would appear to be approximately 1,000,000,000 of the secondary crystals in a cubic inch of the metallic iron .

The majority of the angle readings , made with the goniometer attached to the microscope , indicated generally a hexagonal structure or form of crystallisation .
There were , however , also perfect cubical crystals observed .
The observations were made with a Ross ' first-class microscope .
The micro-measurements afford an indication of the comparative size of the primary and secondary crystals .
These measurements were carefully taken by a Jackson micrometer and in some cases by a Ramsden screw micrometer , both accurately calibrated with a standard stage micrometer .
The wrought-iron forgings on which the observations were made were constituted of practically pure hammered wrought iron , the dimensions of the mass being about 10 feet long .'and about 12 inches square .
The great length of time required for Micro-Metallography of Iron .
such large masses of iron to cool from a white heat appeared to facilitate the production of the crystals of the secondary formation .

The majority of the angle readings , ma.de with the goniometer attached to the microscope , indicated generally a hexagonal structure or form of crystallisation .
There were , however , also perfect cubical crystals observed .
The rationale of this duplex crystallisation has apparently been as follows :\#151 ; The mass of metallic iron on cooling having reached the crystallising point at about 740 ' C. , the periphery or skeletons of the larger or primary crystals were then formed .
As the period of cooling was , however , very slow , the semi-fluid or viscous metal in the interior of these primary crystals was , on finally consolidating , Micro-Metallography of Iron .
apparently further broken up or subdivided into a considerable number of smaller crystals , enclosed within the boundary or periphery of the primary crystals .
In the course of further experiments on the cooling of large masses of wrought iron , the author has also found , by the use of high power objectives , that the secondary crystals sometimes enclosed a still more minute form of crystals of pure iron , of the cubical form , which may hence be regarded as constituting a tertiary system of crystallisation in pure metallic iron .
These experiments therefore indicate that large masses of heated wrought iron , on cooling from above the temperature of the crystallisation of metallic iron , viz. , 740 ' C. , # are capable of crystallising in three distinct modifications , which may tentatively be called the primary , secondary , and tertiary system of crystallisation in iron , these various crystalline modifications being all , however , connected with the regular system of crystallisation .
The author has microscopically examined numerous large masses of practically pure wrought iron varying in weight from about 2 tons to 4 cwt .
, and even less , and he finds these subcrystalline formations to be frequently present , consequent on the slow cooling of such large masses .
The crystals of this secondary formation are not often distinctly discernible in smaller masses of metallic iron , such as rolled rods , plates , or sheets , as these in the coarse of manufacture rapidly cool , and are frequently manipulated during the finishing processes at temperatures below the crystallising point of wrought iron ( 740 ' C. ) .
The author has , however , observed the presence of this subcrystalline structure in small masses of iron , but , in these instances , the subcrystals are generally smaller in size and not always so distinctly marked as those found in larger masses of metallic iron .
The microscopical examinations were made on carefully-prepared and polished samples , etched in nitric acid ( 1 part HN03 , sp. gr. 1*20 , and 49 parts water ) , and by the use of high microscopical powers ( i inch to inch , and other objectives ) .
The drawings were accurately made with the camera Lucida .
In each observation the etching was prolonged , under constant observation with lenses , a suitable time to develop the accurate structure of the metal .
The varied forms of crystallisation observed in this research and referred to in this paper appear to be of such novel metallurgical intei'est , that the author felt it desirable at once to record the observations , and he hopes to be able to furnish the results of further* investigations in this direction .
* The temperature at which pure irOn crystallises , viz. , 740 ' C. , has recently been approximately determined with great care and accuracy by Professor J. O. Arnold , F.C.S. , at the Sheffield Technical School .
