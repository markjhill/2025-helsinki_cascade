1889.1 Electrical Resistance of Iron at High lemperature .
457 quantity of heat liberated .
The dotted lines in the curve show the continuation of the first and second parts of the curve , the horizontal distance between these approximately represents the time during which the material was giving out heat without fall of temperature .
After the bend in the curve the temperature is falling at the rate of 0'21 ' C. per second .
The distance between the two curves is 810 seconds .
It follows that the heat liberated in recalescence of tin 's sample is 173 times the heat liberated when the iron falls in temperature 1 ' C. With the same sample I have also observed an ascending curve of temperature .
There is in this case no reduction of temperature at the point of recalescence , but there is a very substantial reduction in the rate at which the temperature rises .
V. " Electrical Resistance ot Iron at a High Temperature .
" By J. Hopkinson .
Received March 14 , 1889 .
Auerbach , Callendar , and I think also Tait , have observed that the temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of iron is abnormally high .
So far as I know no one has pushed his observations to the temperature at which iron ceases to be magnetic .

The absciss\#174 ; are the temperatures as estimated by the resistance of a copper wire , the ordinates represent the resistance of the iron wire having unit resistance at 20 ' C. It 2 h 2 Presents .
[ Mar. 21 , will be seen that the temperature coefficient of iron ranges from 00048 at the ordinary temperature to O'018 at a temperature just short of 855 ' C. ; it then suddenly changes to about 0*0067 .
The last coefficient can only be regarded as a somewhat rough estimate .
This temperature being a higher temperature than I had observed previously in any case as the temperature at which a sample of iron ceases to be magnetic , it appeared desirable to ascertain whether the iron wire differed from other samples in this respect .
A ring was formed of the wire , and was wound with a primary and secondary coil , and the resistance of the secondary was determined when the magnetisability of the iron disappeared .
It was found that this resistance was the resistance which corresponded to a temperature of 870 ' 0 .
; this temperature agrees with that at which the discontinuity in the resistance curve occurs , within the limits of errors of observation .
