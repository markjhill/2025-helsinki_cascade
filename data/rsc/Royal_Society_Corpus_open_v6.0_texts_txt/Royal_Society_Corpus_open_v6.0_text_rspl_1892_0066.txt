The temperature of the cooling globe was read off at equal intervals of time by means of a thermo-electric junction ; and from these readings the absolute loss of heat per unit of cooling surface , per unit difference of temperatures of surface and surroundings , per unit of time , is calculated .
The details of the apparatus and method of experimenting are given in the paper .
It is enough to sa.y here that the globes were used with their surfaces in two different conditions :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Thinly coated with lamp-black , and ( 2 ) silvered and brightly polished ; and in both conditions the absolute loss of heat , both in air and in vacuum , more or less complete , was determined .
The tables and curves attached to the paper give the details of the results .
To quote one or two examples :\#151 ; With the sooted surface a total loss of heat by convection and radiation of 3'42 x 10-4 c.g.s. units per square centimetre , per second , per 1 ' C. of difference of temperatures of globe and surroundings , was observed with a difference of temperatures of 100 C. , and with the surroundings at about 14 ' C. Under similar circumstances the radiation in vacuum of -|M ( half-a-millionth of atmospheric pressure of non-collapsible gas ) was about 1-40 xl0~4 .
Taking a silvered and brightly-polished surface under the same circumstances , the loss in full air was 2*30 x 10~4 c.g.s. ; and with the highest vacuum and brightest polish obtained , it was reduced 1'80 x 10~6 with in this case a difference of temperatures of 180 ' C. The loss with 100 ' C. difference would be considerably less , but is not known experimentally at present .
The author returns thanks to Mr. James H. Gray , M.A. , B.Sc. , for excellent assistance given ; and expresses himself most deeply indebted , both for assistance in experimenting and calculating of the results , and for most valuable and ingenious aid of various kinds during the course of this work , to his friend Mr. A. Tanakadate , now Professor in Tokio , Japan .

( Abstract .
) The brain of Ornithorhynclius paradoxus is by no means Avian in type .
All its characters are Mammalian , but it presents certain peculiar features which have been overlooked or misunderstood by the anatomists who have hitherto examined it with the naked eye .
The most obvious and noteworthy departures from the form of brain m 2 164 Deferred Papers .
[ June 16 found in all other Mammals concern the rhinencephalon , the hippo-campus , and the cerebral commissures .
The olfactory bulb is quite free from the frontal portion of the hemisphere .
Its stalk is exceedingly thin , and connected with the under surface of the hemisphere near the median line .
The portion of the mantle which receives it is separated from the general surface by a deep incision ( ectorhinal fissure ) , which extends in depth almost to the mesial surface .
The pyriform lobe thus formed merges with the general surface far back on the mesial aspect of the hemisphere , at the spot at which the hippocampal fold commences .
The hippocampus is very extensive ; it lies entirely dorsal to the velum interpositum , and is continued forwards to the extreme anterior end of the brain .
With the rhinencephalon it forms therefore a loop , open in front .
No commissural fibres cross the incisura pallii longitudinalis dorsally to the hippocampus .
For reasons stated in his paper , the writer considers that fibres which cross from one hemisphere to the other on the peduncular ( portal ) side of the fascia dentata cannot be homologous with the corpus callosum , and he therefore concludes that this structure is completely absent from the brain of Ornithorhynchus .
A strong commissure or decussation lies within the concavity of the rhinencephalic loop , but its fibres are restricted in their distribution to the hippocampal fold , as shown in sections stained after Weigert 's method .
The convex portions of the mantle are entirely dependent upon the anterior commissure for mutual connexion .
Exception being made to the incisura rhinalis and dentary fossa as not belonging to the category of fissures , the cortex is completely destitute of convolution .
Each hemisphere of the brain was cut into a series of sections , the anatomical features of which were described in detail .
