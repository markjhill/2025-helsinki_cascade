" Note regarding the Observations of T. Wharton Jones , Esq. , F.R.S. , &lt; On the Blood Corpuscles ; " By Martin Barrv , M.D. , F.R.S. L. &amp; E. The author observes , that the structure of the blood-corpuscles can be accurately learned only by a careful investigation of their mode of origin , and by following them through all their changes in the capillary vessels , and especially in the capillary plexuses and dilatations , where all their stages of transition from the colourless to the red corpuscles may be seen .
The filament which forms here and there in the corpuscles of coagulating blood he has shown to other persons , with Microscopes made by Ross and Powell .
Dr. Barry denies that he mcant certain general remarks in his paper , re ?
ferring to more than twenty delineations of corpuscles from various animals , to apply exclusively to those of man .
