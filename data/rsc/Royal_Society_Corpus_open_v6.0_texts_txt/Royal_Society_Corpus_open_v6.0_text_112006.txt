" On the Conditions , Extent , and Realization of a Perfect Musical Scale on Instruments with Fixed Tones .
" -By ALEXANDER J. ELLIS , B.A. , F.C.P.S. Communicated by C. WHEATSTONE , Esq. , F.R.S. Received January 7 , 1864 .
EULER* , perceiving that the relative pitches of all musical notes might be represented by 2m .
3n .
5P , formed different " I genera musica " by allowing n and p to vary from O to fixed limits .
His " genus diatonicum hodiernum " ( op .
cit. p. 135 ) limits n to 3 and p to 2 , and consists of 12 tones .
These tones and 12 others are contained in his " genus cujus exponens est 2- .
37 .
52 , , " that is , which limits n to 7 and p to 2 .
He has further ( i1 .
p. 161 ) given a scheme in which each manual of an instrument should represent two sounds , the primary belonging to the first 12 tones , and the secondary to the additional 12 .
He says ( ib. p. 162 ) , " Soni secundarii summo rigore ab iisdem clavibus edi nequeunt , quia vero tam parum a primariis discrepant , ad eos exprimendos hae claves sine isensibili harmonice jactura tuto adhiberi possunt .
Nam etiamsi ab acutioribus auribus comma secu diasckisma , quibus intervallis soni secundarii a primaris differunt , distingui queat , tamen quia soni secundarii cum primariis neque in eademn consonantia neqaGe in duarum consonantiarum successione misceri possunt , error etiam ab acutissimo auditu percipi non poterit .
" It will appear in the sequel that these assertions , when tested by experiments on instruments with fixed tones , are all incorrect .
The musical scale has formed the subject of many recent investigations * ; but I have been unable to find a complete account of the necessary coiw ditions to be fulfilled by a perfect scale , the least number of fixed tolnes required , and the practical means of producing them uncurtailed without inconvenience to the performer , although instruments which produce a limited number of just tones have been practically used by Gen. Perronet Thompson , Mr. Poole , Prof. Hlelmholtz , Prof. Wheatstone , myself , and others .
This is therefore the subject of the present paper .
The following notation is employed .
I have introduced it for the purpose of supplying a want which has been greatly felt by all writers on the theory of music .
It is founded on the principle of retaining the whole of the usual notation unaltered , but restricting its signification so as to prevent ambiguity , and introducing the smallest possible number of additional signs to express the required shades of sound with mathematical accuracy , selecting such signs as are convenient for the printer , and harmonize with the ordinary notation of accidentals on the staff .
A letter , as C , called a ntoie , will represent both a certain tone and its pitch , defined to be the liunuber of double vibrations in one second , to which the tone is due .
The letters D , E , F , G , A , B represent other tones and pitches , so that 8D=9C , 4E=5C , 3F=4C , 2G=3C , 3A=5C , 8B=15C .
Small and numbered letters will be so used that 1I 1418 c=_c =C _1=. .
a2C=4 C4 =8 ell and similarly for other letters .
The pitch of c is that of the " tenor or middle c , " usually written on the leger line between the treble and bass staves ; and the other letters are noted on the staff as usual in the scale of C major .
The following symbols always represent the fractionis , and are called by the names written against them : 1 .
Following a Note .
135 = sharp , or greater limma .
-12-8 _ -18 = flat , or hypolimma .
x== double sharp ; b= b. = double flat .
2 .
Preceding a Note .
t 81 = acute , or comma .
80 1= = grave , or hypocomma .
639ยง 63septime ( an inverted 2 ) .
32808 1-001129150390625 schisma .
327168 3278 0 99887212315 = hyposchisma .
The name and pitch of the tones represented by any such notes as 80 135 25 +c# = grave csharp = C.c.l2 =2c , teb-=acute e flat =_ 8( .
e. , 135 = 4e , and the ratio of their pitches to the corresponding notes in the scale of C major is therefore precisely indicated .
In ordinary musical notation on the staff , it is only necessary to prefix the signs t , 1 , Z , , L , to those already in use .
These symbols suffice for writing any tone whose index is the producit 2m .
3n .

72 ( see Tables I. and 1II .
) .
For equally tempered tones , when it is necessary to distinguish them , the sign 11 is prefixed to the usual names , and read " equal .
" Since 11g : c &gt; 27 : 1=0 998871384584 x3 and L:c 0 99887212315 x 2 , Ve may without sensible error consider lyg = 16g , and hence represent the equally tempered scale C , d !

In Table I. the principal intervals are given as fractions , logarithms , and degrees .
If we call 0-00568 one degree , then 53 degreess030Q104=log 2-0-00001 , and 31 degrees-017608=log a3-000001 .
If we moreover represenit the addition and subtraction of 0-00035 ( or one-sixteenth of a degree ) by an acute or grave accent respectively , then 17 ' degrees=0 09691 =log , and 1 ' degree=0 00533=_log8 8-0 00007 .
Two numbers of degrees which differ by a single accent of the same kind , as 17 ' , 17 " represent notes whose real interval is a schisma ( thus e has 17 ' degrees ; and dx , =T ?
e , has 17 " degrees ) , having a difference of logarithm=0-00049 or 0 ' degrees + 0-00014 .
By observing this , degrees may be very conveniently used for all calculation of intervals between tones of pitches represented by 2 " ' .
3 " .
5 " .
Table IV .
contains a list of tones which differ from each other by a schisma , and will be useful hereafter .
The conditions of a perfect musical scale are not discovered by taking all the tones which can be expressed by one of Euler 's " Cexponents , " nor by forming all the tones which are consonant with a certain tone , and then all the tones consonant with these , as Drobiscli has done .
Such processes produce many useless , and omit many necessary tones .
Since modern music depends on the relations of harmonies , and not on scales , it is necessary to find what consonant chords of three tones are most closely connected Three tones whose pitches are as 4 : 5 : 6 , or 10 12 : 15 form a major or minor consonant chord respectively .
The same names are used when any one or more of the pitches is multiplied or divided by a power of 2 , notwithstanding the dissonant effect in some cases .
Thus , C : E : G4 : 5 ; 6 is a major , and c : te:g=10:12 : 15 is a minor chord , and the same names are applied toe::g " : C4=5 : 2x 6 : 22 X4 , and G te : : 15 : 2x 12 : 22 x 10 , although these chords are really dissonant ( Helmholtz , ib. p. 333-4 ) .
I shall consequently use a group of capitals , as CGE G , to Tepresent a major chord , and a group of small letters , as ?
tefg , to represent a minor chord , irrespective of the octaves .
The three notes in this order , being the first , third and fifth of the major or minor scale commencing with the first , are called the first , third and fifth of the chords respectively .
Both chords contain a fifth , a major and a minor third .
If the interval of the fifth is contained by the same tones in a major and minor chord , as There are consonant chords of four tones , such as gb d2 f2 and these are insisted on by Poole ( loc. cit. ) ; but , though they are quite consonant and aoreeable , and much pleasanter than the dissonant chords by which they are replaced , such as gb dtf2 , they do not form a part of modern music , for reasons clearly laid down by H Imholtz ( op .
cit. p. 295 ) .
Dissonant chords mnst always arise from the union of tonies belonging to two consonant chords , or from the inversions of consonant chords ; and therefore their tones are determined with those of the others .
C E G , c tet g , or A E , ac e , the chords are here termed &amp; ynonymous .
If the interval of the major third is contained by the same tones , as CE G , ae e ; or tEb G tBt , C tel g , they are termed relative .
If two chords , major or minor , have the fifth tone of the one the same as the first tone of the other , as FA C , CE G ; fta7 c , c te5 g ; fta5 , CE G ; FA C , c te g , they are here termed dominative .
If a chain of three such dominative chords 'be formed ( as FA C , CE G , GB D , or f tab c , c tee g , g t6L d , the minor and major chords being interchanged at pleasure ) , the first is called the subdominant , the second the tonic , and the third the dominant .
Three such chords contain seven tones , and if such octaves of these tones are taken that all seven tones may lie within the compass of one octave they form a scale , of which 24 varieties can be formed by varying the major and minor chords , and beginning with the first of any one of the three chords .
These scales include all the old ecclesiastical modes and several others .
If all three chords are major and the scale begins on the first of the tonic chord , the result is the major scale , C , D , E , F , G , A , 1X , c. If all three chords are minor and the scale begins on the first of the tonic chord , the result is the minor descending scale , c ' , t 6 , g , f , te ' , d , c. If the first and second are mninor , and the third major , or if the first and third are major and the second minor , we have the two usual ascending minor scales , c , d , teb , f , g , tab , 6 , c , or c , d , te , f &gt; , g , a 6 , eq. Three major chords may therefore be considered to represent a major scale , but both major and minor chords are necessary for the various minor scales .
If to each of three domninative major chords we form the relative and synonymous minor chords , the synonymous and relative majors of these , and the relative minor of this synonymous major , we shall have a group of 9 major and 9 minor chords , which I shall call the k7ey of the first of the tonic chord .

, From this complex scale 54 scales of 7 tones each may be formed , similar to the 24 scales already named .
A selection of 12 tones , suich as c , t14 , d , ted , e , f , If , g , tab , a , 6I , , 6 , c0 forms the so-called chromatic scale , which , however , has no proper existence except in equal temperament .
Now proceed to form a series of seven dominative major chords , as E1ITGSB , 4 IDF FAC , CEG GIG BD , DFf tA tC city .
and form the five related chords of each as before .
The result will be five keys , as those of BL , F , C , G , D , such that the primary major scales of each wilI have either two major chords , or one major chord in common with the originial primary major scale .
I call these five keys the postdominant,.subdominant , tonic , dominant , and stuperdominant keys , and the whole group of 21 major and 21 minor chords , with the 30 tones which they contain , I term the systern of the first tone of the toici chord of the original primary major scale , which tone may be called the tonic of the system .
A piece of muisic is written in a certain system .
, determinied by the compass or quality of tone of the instruments or voices which have to perform it , and rarely exceeds that system .
It is only in the system that the true relation of the tones of a piece of music , the course and intentioni of the modulation , and the return to the original key or scale can be appreciated .
I have not yet found these relations fully expressed in any theoretical work on music ; but their full expression was necessary to the solution of the problem here proposed .
It will be found practically that only II systems are used in music .
These are , in dominative order , the systems of 42Db , ic , Ei , Bb , F , C , G , D , tA , tE , tBJ , which contain the II keys of the same name , together with the 4 keys of +0C , G7 , and tF# , tCB .
In Table V. , columns III .
to VIII .
, the whole of the major and minor chords of these 15 keys are exhibited in dominative order ? .
This Table , therefore , furnishes the tones which mutst be contained in a perfect musical scale of fixed tones , or the conditions of the problem .
on examination it will be found that these six columns contain 72 different notes .
Hence the extent of a perfect scale is fixed at 72 tones to the octave .
It is therefore six times as extensive as the equally tempered scale .
Some means of reducing this unwieldy extent is required .
The most obvious is that proposed by Euler , in the passage already quoted , namely , the use of certaini tones for others which differ from them by a comma or diaschisma .
Such substitution within the same chord creates intolerable dissonance .
But in melody and in successions of chords it might seem feasible .
I have had a concertina tuned , so that the three chords of The u-se of the eqLially tempered scale has muiELch climinished the fee6ing for th relations otf the system , by confoLudinu tonies originally distinct , and has thus led to the confusion of the corresponding niotes .
Thus such a note tas jgy will have to be readl as jg# , g , tu ; T4b , a or tcO , according to the requhirements of the system , for all six tones are representec by one on the eqLually tenpered seal . ?
The Table of ey-relationships ( ToncG7tenveivazncltsc/ h , tte-t ) in Gottfried Webr 's lIeoric clr Tonsetzktwst ( 3rd ed. 1830 , vol. ii .
p. 8G ) , may be form from Table V. , by suLppressing , the sigons , Ii supposing all the niotes to represent temiipered tones , contracting the n mies of the chords to their first notes , and extending the Table indefinitely in all directions .
the major scale of D are played as GB D , D F , tA , and A +Cj E , instead of tA C : tE .
The dominant chord is therefore too flat by a comma , and in passing from the chord of A to that of D , as in the ordinary cadence , the note A has to be changed into tA .
If A is the highest or lowest note in the chords , the effect is decidedly bad .
The flatness of the " leading note " 4C# , in place of C# , although only a comma in extent , is felt as annoying in the sLiccession +c+ , d. The result is such that it would not be worth while to invent new instruments with such a defect in common scales .
On the same instrument I have the three chords of the major scale of A tuiied as D F# tA , A +C# E , E+G# B , in which the subdominant chord is now a comma too sharp .
As the subdominant is a much less important chord than the dominant , the effect is better , but trouble arises from having occasionally to alter the tonic note A itself .
Even the dissonance of the dominant seventh , when played as E+GS Bd is perceptibly harsher than the correct E+G# B td ( both forms lie on the instrument ) , although the added seventh d now forms a true minor third with the fifth B , whereas the correct note td forms a dissonant Pythagorean minor third with the same note B. When , however , the first E is omitted , the chord of the diminished fifth 4G# B 4d is not so pleasant as GB d. Again , on the same instrument , instead of having 4D +FA , as the synonymous major of +df a in the scale of a miinor , I have only D F1 $ tA , which is a comma too sharp .
The rarity of the chord , however , renders the bad effect of less importance .
Again , I am obliged to modulate from D major to td minor instead of d minor .
Even here the error of a comma is perceptible .
The general result , therefore , is that commatic mbstitution , even within the same melody or succession of chords , is inadmissible in just intonation .
Professor I-Ielmholtz ( op .
cit. pp. 433 &amp; 484 ) has suggested what may be termed schismatic substitution , or the use of one note for another which only differs from it by a schisma , the eleventh part of a comma .
Having one concertina tuned to equal temperament , and another to just intervals , the equation Jlg= Lg has enabled me to test this suggestion by practice .
I find that in slow chords , the altered fifth c j6g , the altered major third 16b 6 , and the altered minor third e L6g are all decidedly , though only slightly , dissonant .
In rapid chords the effect would be necessarily much less perceptible .
Such chords as CESG , e Ig b are far superior either to the Pythagorean C tE C , teg tb ( of which I can produce the counterparts F tA4 C , df ta ) , or the still worse tempered chords C IIE I1 G , Ile I1g lb. If we modified Professor Helmholtz 's suggestion , and , where practicable , used only entire chords which are too flat or too sharp by a schisma , so that the schismatic errors would only occtur in harmonies where a note was prolonged from a chord to which it belonged into another for which it was too sharp or too flat by a schisma , then there could be no objection whatever to schismatic substitution , which would be quite inappreciable in melody .
Now schismatic substitutio-n will materially reduce the numilber of diffferenit tonies required .
By referring to Table IV .
it will be seen that all the tones in Table V. , lines 1 to 8 , throughout all the columns are exactly one schismaflatter than the corresponding tones in lines 10 to 17 .
Hence we only require the tones in lines 5 to 13 in order to reproduce the whole Table , with the help of schismatic substitution .
It is , however , more convenient to use columns III .
, IV .
, lines 14 to 17 , in place of columns I. and II .
, lines 5 to 8 ; and columns VII .
, VIII .
, liines I to 4 , in place of columns IX .
and X. , lines 10 to 13 .
In this case only 48 tones will be required .
If the schismatic substitution of 4f , ab , cb for e : , gy , tb were allowed , which would introduce three schismatic errors of no great importance , the number of tones would be reduced to 45 , which is the lowest possible number of tones by which a complete scale can be played .
All these tones are enumerated in Table III .
There are several ways of realizing such a scale in whole or in part* .
The following appears to be the most feasible , as it would render the mere mechanism of playing a perfect scale on an organ or harmonium easier than that of playing the tempered scale on the same instruments .
On a board of manuals similar to that now in use for the organ , introduce two additional red manluals ( of the same shape as the black , but with a serrated front edge to be recognizable by blind and colour-blind performers , as in some cases on General Perronet Thompson 's organ ) in the two gaps between B and U , and between E and F , so as to make 14 manuals in all .
Let there be 16 stops worked as pedals with the foot , as in Mr. Poole 's Euharmonic Organi ( loc. cit. p. 209 ) .
Let one of these stops give the equally tempered tones to the manuals , so that any piece could be played in the tempered scale , and thus compared with the same piece when played with just intervals .
Let the 15 other stops give the tones required for the 15 keys tC to C# , as shown in Table II .
, and be numbered 7b , 6 b ... 1 b , natural , 1 ... 7 # .
When any pedal is put down , let the seven white manuals give the seven tones of the primary major scale of the corresponding key , and the seven coloured manuals give seven out of the nine other tones required to complete the key , omitting the acute fourth ( which would be found in the key of the dominant ) and the grave seventh ( which would be found in the key of the subdominant ) .
To the right of each white manual let there be its conjugate coloured manual , of such a value that , if the seven tones of the major scale be indicated by the numbers 1 to 7 , the tones corresponding to the manuals in any key may be Coloured. .
1 II 2 t3b 14# 15# t6b t7b White ... .
123456 7 .
Table II .
shows the tones associated with the manuals in each stop ; capital letters indicate white manuals , small letters black , and small capitals red* , By this arrangement the fingering of every key would be the same .
The performer would disregard the signature except as naming the pedal , and play as if the signature were natural .
Table V. would inform him whether the accidentals belonged to the key , its dominant , or any other key ; and if they indicated another key , he would change the pedal .
It would be convenient to mark where a new pedal had to be used ; but no change would be required in the established notation ? .
Mr. Poole 's organ , which suggested the above arrangement , has 11 stops , from 5b to 5# , and only 12 manuals , which appear to be associated with the following tonies on each stop : Black1. .
3/ 2 ( t2# , ) ( 4# , ) t,5# g7b WAhite. .
1234567 The two manuals whose notes are put in parentheses are inadequately described .
Mr. Poole 's scale does not include the synonymous minor chords , which he plays by commatic substitution .
Another method of realizing such a scale is by additional manuals and additional boards of manuals .
Thus three boards of manuals , each with 23 manuals , containing the tones in Table V. cols .
III .
to VIII .
, lines 4 to 8 , 7 to 11 , and 10 to 14 respectively would be nearly complete .
The manuals might be similar to those on General T. Perronet Thompson 's Eiiharrnonic Organ , which has 3 boards , with 20 , 23 and 22 manuals respectively , and contains the chords in Table V. cols .
III .
, lines 6 to 11 ; IV .
6 to 12 ; V. , VI .
, VII .
, 5 to 12 ; VIII .
and IX .
, 6 to 12 ( four chords belonging to col .
IX .
, lines 6 to 9 , are not in the Table , but can be readily supplied , as well as the additional lines 0 , 1 , niamed below ) .
Euler 's " genus cujus exponens est 2- .
37 .
52 , " as developed in his T'entamen , p. 161 , must be considered as adapted for an instrument with two boards of ordinary manuals , such as some harmoniums are now constructed .
His " soni primarii " would occupy the lower , and his " I soni secundarii " the uipper board .
If to these we add their schismatic equivalents , enclosed in brackets , and distinguish white and black manuals by capital an(I small letters as in Table II .
, Euler 's scheme will appear as follows , where the notation interprets his arithmetical expressions of pitcl ( " soni " ) , and not his notes ( " signa sonora " ) , which are too vaguie .

It would be therefore niearly complete in major scales , but would have only td , a , e , 6 , fi , c4 , g : minor , and their comparatively useless schismatic equivalents .
It would have no single complete key , and would therefore require many commatic substitutions in modulation , and the use of the Pythagorean major third in the major chords of the comparatively common minor scales of Tf , tc , tg .
If only the " soni primarii " of the lower board are used the substitutions become very harsh , as for example A# D F , D F:A for B5 tD F , D F$ tA .
Euler 's " soni primarii " may be compared with Rameau 's scale * , which was as follows , c , t tD , te5 , E IF Tf ?

It possessed the perfect major and minor scales of C and E. The harshness of the chords tB9 ' D , F , D F$ A , for lb tD F , D F4 tA has , however , led to the abandonment of this scheme , and to the introduction of a tempered scale .
I have taken advanitage of the 14 manuals to contrive 4 different methods of tuning , so that 4 concertinas would play in all the commoi major and minor scales .
Two of these I have in use , and find them effective and very useful for experimental purposes .
The following gives the arrangement of the manuals in each , together with the scales possessed by each instrument , major in capitals , and minor in small letters .
Where commatic substitution makes the dominant chord too flat in major scales , parentheses ( ) are used ; where it makes the subdominant chord too sharp , brackets [ ] are used .
Minor scales in brackets have only the subdominant tone too sharp .
The major chord GBD and the tone C being common to all four instruments , determine their relative pitch .
The method of tuning these and all justly intoned or teleon * instruments is very simple .
C being tuned to any standard pitch , the fifths above and below it are tuned perfect .
To any convenient tone thus formed , as C itself , form the major thirds above , as EL , $0# , tB# , &amp;c. , and below as tAb , tFb &amp;c. , and then the fifths above and below these tones .
The namnes of the tones thus tuned are apparent from Table V. This tuning is much simpler than any system of temperament , and can be successfully conducted by ear ornly , taking care to avoid all beats in the middle octave e to C2 .
