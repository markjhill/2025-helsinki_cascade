The preparation of the ethyl-bases by the action of ammonia upon iodide of ethyl , presents a difficulty which greatly interferes with the general application of this otherwise so convenient method .
This difficulty consists in the simultaneous formation of all the four ethylbases .
The equations H13N+Cj I=[(C2H5 ) H1 , N ] I ( C,2 H ) H2 N+C .
5 1= [ ( C2 15)2 H2 NI ( 0,211 )2 N+C H2 5 I= [ ( C2 1I , ) H N ] I ( C2 H5)3 N+C02 , 5 I=[(C 1H 5)4 N]I , are an ideal representation of the four different phases through which ammonia passes during its transformation into iodide of tetrethylammonium .
In practice it is found impossible to carry out this transformation in the several steps indicated by these equations .
The first substitution-product , generated as it is in the presence of the agent of substitution , is immediately acted upon again , the second *.=-l 0--16 ; C=12 , &amp;c. product being formed , which in its turn may be converted into the third and even into the fourth compound .
The following equations represent perhaps more correctly the final result of the several changes which are accomplished in the reaction of ammonia on iodide of ethyl .
13N+ C2,5I1=[(C1 , H ) 3N ] I 2I13 N2 C2 , I=5 I[(C , H , )2 II N ] I+ [ HI , N ] I3 HN+3 C2 HJ I=(C I-H5)3H N ] I+2([H , N ] I ) .

The mixture of iodides , when submlitted to the action of potassa , yields ammonia , ethylamine , diethylamine , and triethylamine , the hydrate of tetrethylammonium , which is liberated , splitting into ethylene , triethylamine , and water .

it was thought that they might be readily separated by distillation .
Experiments made with very large quantities showed , however , that even after ten fractional distillations the bases were far from being pure .
After many unsuccessful attempts , I have found a simple and elegant process by which the three ethyl-bases may be easily and perfectly separated .
This process consists in submitting the anhydrous mixture of the three bases to the action of anhydrous oxalate of ethyl .
By this treatment , ethylamine is converted into diethyl .
oxamide , a beautifully crystalline body very difficultly soluble in water , diethylamine into ethyl-oxamate of ethyl , a liquid boiling at a very high temperature , whilst triethylamine is not affected by oxalic ether By the action of oxalic ether upon ethylamnine , two substances may be formed , viz. ethzyl-oxamate of ethyl and diethyl-oxamide .

In practice it appears that the second of these compounds only is produced .
In the action of oxalate of ethyl upon diethylamine , two similar phases may be distinguished capable of producing respectively Diethyl-oxamate of ethyl. .

The action of oxalate of ethyl upon triethylamine might have involved the formation of the secondary oxalate of tetrethylammonium , ( C 020 V 12 CHN ( C2 02 ) 0 ( 2 , 2 ) } ?

The product of the reaction of oxalate of ethyl upon the mixture of the ethyl-bases , when distilled in the water-bath , yields triethylamine freefrom ethylamine and diethylamine .
The residue in the retort solidifies on cooling into a fibrous mass of crystals of diethyloxamide , which are soaked with an oily liquid .
They are drained from the oil and recrystallized from boiling water .
Distilled with potassa , these crystals furnish ethylamine free from diethylamine and triethylamine .
The oily liquid is cooled to 0 ?
, when a few more of the crystals are deposited ; it is then submitted to distillation .
The boiling-point rapidly rises to 260 ? .
What distils at that temperature is pure diethyl-oxamate of ethyl , from which , by distillation with potassa , diethylamine free from ethylamine and triethylamine may be obtained .
