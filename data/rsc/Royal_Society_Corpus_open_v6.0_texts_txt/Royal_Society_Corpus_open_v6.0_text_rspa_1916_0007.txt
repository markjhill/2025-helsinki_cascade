The problem before us is as follows .
Suppose that we have a populatiol of living things numbering individuals , of whom a number are affect : by something ( such as a disease ) , and the remainder A are not so affect suppose that a proportion of the non-affected become affected in element of time , and that , conversely , a proportion of the affeotSd become unaffected , that is , revert in every element of time to the non-affected group ; and , lastly , suppose that both the groups , the affected and the non- affected , are subject also to possibly different birth-rates , death-rates , and immigration and emigration rates in an element of time ; then what will b6 the number of affected individuals , of new cases , and of the total ) living at any time ?
For the solution of this and the subsidiary problems I have ventured to suggest the name " " Theory of Happenings It covers many cases which occur not only in pathometry but in the analysis of questions oonuected with statistics , demography , public health , the theory of evolution , and even commerce , politics , and statesmanship .
The name ( pathos , happening ) was previously suggested by myself in antithesis nosos , a disease ) for the quantitative study of parasitic in ffl individual .
III .
( i ) Let , rndt , denote respectively the nativjty , mortality , gration , and emigration rates of the non-affected part of the population in the .
element of time ; and Ndt , , Idt , denote the similar rates the affected part .
Then , as argued in my previous writings and as will easily seen , the problem before us may be put in the form of the followirS .
