[ Oct. 14 , larger deflection was obtained when " B " was made negative than when it was made positive .
These results correspond with the known fact that negative ions have a greater velocity than positive ions .
As was to be expected , having regard to the unstable nature of the arc , the galvanometer deflections were not very steady .
They were , however , invariably in the directions indicated , according as the polarity of the electrodes was transposed , and endured as long as the arc covered the aperture in the upper electrode .
The writer is indebted to Mr. J. C. M. Stanton and Mr. R.C. Pierce for their skilful assistance in carrying out the above experiments .

) ( Abstract .
) The value of the direct method of measuring ionic velocities has been seriously diminished in the past by the necessity of using gelatine solutions in the measuring apparatus , and by the restriction of the method to more concentrated solutions .
The authors have succeeded in devising an apparatus in which it is possible to compare and measure the velocities of the ions of a given salt without using gelatine or other partitions during the actual experiment ; and they have also succeeded in extending the method to the measurement of dilute solutions .
The apparatus consists of two reservoirs , each supplied with a special electrode vessel , and of a measuring-tube of known cross-section , in which the solution to be measured is placed .
One of the reservoirs contains a solution of a salt which has a slower cation than that to be measured , and the other a solution of a salt with a slower anion than that to be measured .
When a current is passed in the proper direction through such a system , an electrolytic margin of constant velocity is formed , provided certain conditions are fulfilled .
These conditions have been already described.* The measuring tube is provided at each end with a parchment-paper partition , which facilitates the formation of a sharp electrolytic margin between the indicator * Masson , ' Phil. Trans. , ' A , 1899 , p. 331 ; Steele , A , 1902 , p. 105 .

There is thus no membrane of any sort between the two electrodes , and electrolysis is not complicated by the occurrence of electric endosmose .
The formation of bubbles of hydrogen or oxygen gas in the electrode vessels is prevented by the use of unpolarisable electrodes .
The transport number and the average absolute velocity of the ions of a number of salts have been measured with very satisfactory results .
Transport numbers have been measured at dilutions down to one-fiftieth normal , and the following results will serve to illustrate the degree of accuracy obtained .

It also gives a means of comparing the degree of dissociation of salts containing a common ion .
