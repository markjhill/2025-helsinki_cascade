The Action of Light on Chlorophyll .
the chlorophyll takes place in the dark in the presence of a dilute solution of permanganate of potash to which a few drops of sulphuric acid have been added .
In both cases an aldehyde is produced which can be made evident by means of Sehiffs solution .

If a strip of potassium iodide starch paper is exposed to light under coloured filters the paper turns reddish blue under the blue filter , showing the liberation of iodine , but not under the red filter .
If , however , the iodised starch paper is first of all tinged with chlorophyll and then exposed to light under the same filters , a strong reaction takes place under the red filter .
A strip of bleached chlorophyll paper , placed in contact with a strip of damp iodised starch paper in the dark , is also capable of effecting the liberation of iodine , and the starch paper turns blue .

It is suggested in conclusion that the production of sugars and starch in the green leaf may be initiated by the photo-oxidation of chlorophyll and the subsequent polymerisation of the aldehyde thus formed , rather than by the direct photo-synthesis of carbon dioxide and water .
