355 was removed from the jar , baryta water was introduced and well shaken , and after standing a sufficient time to effect the absorption of he carbonic acid was titrated in the usual manner .
The results obtained were highly interesting , but it would not , ,t present be prudent to speak of them except in general terms .
It \vi\\ suffice to say that the experiments showed that if the plant did not actually absorb carbonic acid during the day , it exhaled none ; while at night large quantities were so got rid of\#151 ; thus fully substantiating the generally accepted view of the matter in point .
As a mean of seven night experiments made between 23rd August md 29th September , there were 12-18 vols .

The largest quantity present was 14'9 vols .
, and the least 9-13 vols .
in 10,000 vols .
of air .
The former was at an early period of the experiments , the latter towards their close when the plant had lost a few of its leaves and was beginning to show a diminished activity generally .
Summarising the results contained in this communication , it may be stated\#151 ; 4 ( 1 .
) That the normal amount of carbonic acid present in the air of the land is distinctly less than that usually stated , and that it does not exceed 3'5 vols .
in 10,000 of air .
( 2 .
) That plants absorb carbonic acid during the day and exhale it at night , and that vegetation , therefore , affects the quantity of carbonic acid present in the air , decreasing it by day and increasing it at night .
( 3 .
) That from this cause there is , during that part of the year when vegetation is active , at least 10 per cent , more carbonic acid present in the air of the open country at night than during the day .

" Measurement of the Actinism of the Sun 's Kays and of Daylight .
" By Dr. R. Angus Smith , F.R.S. ( Preliminary Notice .
) When examining the air of towns and the effect of smoke and fogs , I have often wished for a very simple chemical method of measuring the total light absorbed by these gases , vapours , and floating solids .
I do not undervalue the work of others , -but I think I have obtained a process promising good results with great simplicity , although I dare say it introduces its own class of difficulties .
1 .
The fundamental fact is that when iodide of potassium in solution is treated with nitric acid , so small in quantity as to cause no change of colour in dull diffused light , a change takes place when the same Dr. R. A. Smith .
Measurement of the [ Apr. 2\amp ; mixture is brought into clear light ; iodine is set free and the solution becomes yellow .
2 .
The amount of iodine freed can be titrated with great exactnes by the use of hyposulphite , as is well known .
In these two facts lies the whole process , the first is the new pari the second makes the first quantitative , and its use is of course par of the novelty .
3 .
It is known that strong acid liberates iodine .
Weak acid doe so after a long time , but the process is hastened by light .
* 4 .
Heat even to the boiling point does not act so well as ligh ( experiments being made in sealed tubes to prevent loss of iodine , an* with a considerable volume of air ) .
5 .
Heat assists the action of light .
6 .
A solution may be exposed day after day so as to give thd accumulated effect of sunlight , in a measurable condition at the ent of the time .
7 .
The solution of iodide of potassium as hitherto obtained is subjeei to change .
An old solution , that is , one nearly a month old , was fount more sensitive than a new one in all cases tried .
8 .
The result of No. 7 is , that a certain allowance may require to b\lt ; made for this , in those cases where the periods of observation with ont solution are long .
9 .
The amount of allowance to be made for temperature is nol made out .
It is not certain that any is required in the cases when weak acid is used .
The weather has not allowed any combined action of great light and heat , but with heat and light in the rays from ai electric light with a parabolic reflector , the action was very rapid .
10 .
Specimens of experiments ( prospective at first ) .
It was found convenient to use a solution of 2 grms. of iodide of potassium , afterwards changed to 1 grin .
, in 100 of water , and to use half of this foi an experiment , i.e. , 50 cub. centims. of the solution , which may be called A. A nitric acid solution having an acidity equal to 1 per cent , oi sulphuric anhydride was made ; this may be called B. Only verj small portions of B were added to A. The following experiments were made in wide loosely corked ana half filled test tubes , and here are early trials:\#151 ; 13th February .

Indeed I had once a mode projected of measuring light by the decomposition of nitric acid or nitrates , but I did not expect this to take place in such weak solutions .
To avoid this change , sulphuric acid was tried with the following result .

nay add that I did obtain better results at the window of my house m at the laboratory at the same time , the latter being nearer the itre of the town ; thus the process has done the duty it was in-l(jed for , although only once tried for this special purpose .
I am king to it as an agent specially for the examination of climate , but course it may have many uses .
This process does not aim at licacy , hut at accumulation of effect .
I have not spoken of a mdard ; the results are only comparative , but the process may be ade to supply its own standard .

The iodine volatilized by heat was found to be so ittle that it might be neglected here .
The strength of solutions and the kind of acid to be used may vary .
Similar results may be got by using bromide of potassium , but it is less lelicate .
The surface exposed and other questions require attention .

Received April 19 , 1880 .
The following experiments were made upon Dr. Alexander Mac-alister , at intervals from November , 1877 , to May , 1879 , and consisted in observing the lengths of time during which the extended horizontal arms , with supinated hands holding equal weights , could be held out:\#151 ; The following results were obtained , in which w denotes the weight held in the hand in pounds ; and t , the time , in seconds , of holding out before fatigue stopped the experiment :
