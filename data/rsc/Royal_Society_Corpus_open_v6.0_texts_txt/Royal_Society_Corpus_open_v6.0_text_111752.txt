This compound is formed by acting upon glycerine with a mixture , in equal volumes , of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids , the glycerine being added by a few drops at a time .
It is heavier than water , in which it is slightly soluble , and is soluble in alcohol and in ether .
From its proneness to decomposition in drying , even by the airpump , a complete analysis could not be made , but a qualitative examination of the relative amounts of carbon and nitrogen gave the following results:1 .

63N04 It would therefore appear that 3H are replaced by 3NO4 .
On boiling this compound with concentrated solution of potash , it is decomposed into glycerine and nitrate of potash ,
