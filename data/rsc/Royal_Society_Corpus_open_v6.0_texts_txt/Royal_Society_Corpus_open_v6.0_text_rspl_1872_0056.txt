] On the Condensation of Steam upon Cold Surfaces .
275 I. " On the Condensation of a Mixture of Air and Steam upon Cold Surfaces .
" By Osborne Reynolds , M.A. , Fellow of Queen 's College , Cambridge , and Professor of Engineering in the Owens College , Manchester .
Communicated by Professor Roscoe , F.R.S. Received March 22 , 1873 .
1 .
The object of this investigation is to ascertain how far the presence of a small quantity of air affects the power of a cold surface to condense steam .
A priori it seemed probable that it might retard condensation very much ; for when pure steam comes up to a cold surface and is condensed , it leaves an empty space which is immediately filled with fresh steam ; so that the passage of the steam up to the cold surface is unobstructed , and if the surface could carry off the heat fast enough , then the rate of condensation would be unlimited .
If , however , the steam is mixed with air , then , as the mixture comes into contact with the cold surface , the steam will be condensed and the air will be left between the fresh steam and the cold surface ; so that after condensation has commenced that surface will be protected by a stratum of air , and fresh steam will have either to displace this or pass through it before it in turn can be condensed .
2 .
This question , besides its philosophical interest , has important practical bearings on the steam-engine .
First .
If the quantity of air mixed with the steam affects the rate at which it condenses , then the ratio which the pressure of air bears to the pressure of steam in a condenser will materially affect its efficiency : this is particularly important with reference to the surface-condenser .
Second .
If air prevents the condensation of steam , then by sending air into the boiler of a high-pressure engine , the condensation at the surface of the cylinder will be prevented , which , if allowed to occur , becomes a source of great waste ; for when the steam comes into a cold cylinder it condenses , heating the cylinder and leaving water , which will again be evaporated as soon as the steam escapes ; and this , in evaporating , will cool the cylinder .
By preventing this , the mixing of air with the steam would effect the same object as the steam-jacket , only in a more efficient manner ; for the heat communicated to the steam in the cylinder from the jacket is not nearly so effective as that which is communicated from the boiler , in consequence of the steam in the cylinder being at a lower temperature than that in the boiler .
, 3 .
The experiments for this investigation were , by the kind permission of Dr. Roscoe , carried out by Mr. Pasley , a student in the Chemical Laboratory of the Owens College ; and I beg to tender him my best thanks .
4 .
In making these experiments two objects were particularly kept in view:\#151 ; First .
To ascertain if there is a great difference in the rate of condensation of pure steam and a mixture of steam and air\#151 ; to ascertain in fact whether pure steam condenses at an unlimited speed .
VOL. xxi .
2 A. 276 Mr. O. Reynolds on the Condensation of a [ May 1 , Second .
To ascertain if ( and according to what law ) the effect of air on the condensation increases as the proportion of air to steam increases .
5 .
Of these two undertakings the first is much the most difficult .
The rate of condensation of pure steam is so great that it is practically impossible to measure it ; and to institute a comparison between this and the condensation of a mixture of steam and air is like comparing the infinite with the finite .
It is practically impossible to keep any surface cold when an unlimited supply of pure steam is condensed upon it , so that under such circumstances the quantity of pure steam condensed is limited by the power of the surface to carry off the heat .
The best method of obtaining a qualitative result seems to be by introducing sufficient cold water into a flask of steam to condense it all , and ascertain whether this condensation is effected suddenly or slowly .
6 .
The presence of hot water in the flask with the steam very much assists in ascertaining the rapidity of condensation .
When there is no hot water in the flask , the condensation by the injected water is only a question of time ; the gauge will come to the same point whether the condensation is quick or slow , the only difference being in the speed at which it will rise\#151 ; a difference not easy to appreciate , especially when the motion is quick .
But if hot water is present , then as the steam in the flask is condensed it is replaced by fresh steam from the water , and the interval between the condensation and the consequent ebullition is the only time allowed for the creation of a vacuum ; the vacuum which is attained in the interval will therefore depend on the rapidity of condensation .
The interval will be very short ; and the better the vacuum the shorter it will be ; so that unless the condensation is very sudden , there will be but a slight reduction of pressure .
If , however , the condensation is really instantaneous , a perfect vacuum may exist for an instant .
Hence , when there is water in the flask , the rapidity of condensation is indicated by the height to which the gauge rises , instead of the speed with which it rises ; and this is much easier to estimate .
7 .
The apparatus employed in making these experiments consisted of a glass flask fitted with a mercurial vacuum-gauge and pipes for admitting water and air , or allowing steam to escape .
The flask and all the pipes were freed from air by boiling ; and when all the air had been driven out the pipes were closed , the lamp removed , and the flask allowed to cool until the gauge showed a slight vacuum ; the water-pipe was then opened and a few drops of water allowed to enter and fall through the flask ; as they did so the mercury rushed up the gauge , and , by its momentum , above the point for a perfect vacuum , showing that the condensation was instantaneous .
Immediately afterwards the gauge fell nearly to its starting-point .
Next , the flask was allowed to cool and a little air was let in ( about equal to half an inch o mercury in the gauge , or about a sixtieth of the volume of the flask ) .
The lamp was then replaced , and the operation was repeated as before , 1873 .
] Mixture of Air and Steam , upon Cold Surfaces .
2 this time , however , as the cold water entered the mercury did not rush up the gauge , but rose slowly a small distance and there remained .
8 .
This experiment shows , therefore , that there is a great difference in the rates at which pure steam and steam with air condense on a cold surface , so great in fact that the speed with pure steam must be regarded as nearly infinite .
9 .
To compare the various effects of different quantities of , two methods have been used , which may be described as follows:\#151 ; I. A surface-condenser is formed within the boiler or flask , so that the steam may be condensed as fast as it is generated .
Then , when a flame of a certain size acts on the boiler , the effect of the air is to cause the pressure of steam in the flask to increase .
This method is founded on the assumption that the rate at which steam will condense at a cold surface is , cceteris paribus , proportional to its pressure\#151 ; an assumption which is probably not far from the truth .
II .
With the same apparatus as in method I. the rate of condensation is measured by the quantity of water condensed in a given time , obtained by counting the drops from the condenser , the pressure within the flask being kept constant .
This method does not involve any assumption ; but the conditions for its being accurate are such as cannot be obtained ; for not only must the temperature of the condenser and the temperature of the steam remain constant , but the pressure of the steam must also remain constant , and if the two former conditions are fulfilled the latter cannot be ; for the temperature of the steam will be the boiling-point of the water in the flask ; and if this is to remain constant , the pressure of air and steam must be constant , and therefore , as the pressure of the air increases , the pressure of the steam must decrease .
This variation of pressure is not very great ; and its effect may be allowed for on the assumption that the condensation is proportional to the pressure of steam .
This is accomplished by dividing the drops by the pressure of the steam .
These methods , neither of which , as it appears , is rigorous , seem nevertheless to be the best ; and fortunately .the law which the effect of the additions of air follows is of such a decided character as to be easily distinguished ; and the two methods give results which are sufficiently concordant for practical purposes .
10 .
The apparatus employed in these experiments consisted of a glass flask , in which a surface-condenser was formed of a copper pipe passing in and out through the cork .
This pipe was kept cool by a stream of water , and was so fixed that all the condensed water dropped from it , and the drops could be counted .
The flask was freed from air by boiling ; the volume of air passed into the flask could be accurately measured ; and ample time was allowed for the air in the flask to produce its effect before more was admitted .
For the experiments according to method I. , the flame under the flask and the stream of water through the condenser were kept constant from first to last .
For those made according to method II .
, in one case the 2 a 2 Mr. O. Reynolds on th Condensation of a [ May 1 , stream of water was kept constant , and in the other it was altered , so that the effluent water was kept at a constant temperature .

Table I. shows the result of an experiment after the first method , during which the flame and condensation remained Constant , whilst the pressure within the flask increased with the quantity of air .
Table II .
shows the result of an experiment after the second method , in which the pressure within the flask remained constant , whilst the flame and condensation were reduced as the air was admitted .
In this experiment the rate at which the water passed through the condenser was constant from first to last , and consequently the temperature of the effluent water varied with the condensation .
Table III .
shows the result of an experiment , also made according to the second method , but in which the quantity of water flowing through the condenser was so varied that the temperature of the effluent water remained constant .
13 .
Each of these Tables shows the effect of air on the condensation in a very definite manner ; but the results as given in the column p3 in Table I. cannot be compared with the Drops in Tables II .
and III .
as they stand ; for these show the effect of the air in a series of increasing figures .
If , however , these figures show the power of the air to diminish condensation , then they will be inversely proportional to the quantity of water condensed , i. e. what would have been condensed if the pressure and other things had remained constant .
Hence the numbers in the column Drops in Tables \#151 ; should be proportional to the numbers in the column II .
and IT .
In order to compare the results of these experiments , the results in each Table have been multiplied by a common factor , so that they may be the same when the pressure of air is one tenth that of the steam .
Thus the numbers in the column i in Table I. have been multiplied by 2000 , and numbers under -^'^8 in Table II .
by 7 .
The result of the experiments thus reduced are shown in the curves 1 , 2 , 3 .
280 On the Condensation of Steam upon Cold Surfaces .
[ May 1 , The point of no air might have been chosen as the point in which the curves should coincide ; but , as has been previously explained , the results under such circumstances are to be taken as indicating the power of the condenser to carry off the heat .
Had it been possible to keep the condenser cool , then there is reason to believe that there would have been no limit to the condensation of pure steam , and that the true form of the curves is like that shown by the dots .
Ratio of the pressure of air to that oi steam .
Although the curves do not coincide , yet they are all of the same form , and the difference between them is not greater than can be accounte or by the disturbing causes already mentioned .
They all show that \#174 ; effect of air begins to fall off rapidly when its pressure amounts to one-tenth that of the steam , and that when it amounts to about one iourt that of the steam the admission of more air produces scarcely any effect .
14 .
Conclusions .
\#151 ; The conclusions to be drawn from these experiments are as follows :\#151 ; , . .
1 .
That a small quantity of air in steam does very much retard us condensation upon a cold surface ; that , in fact , there is no bmit rate at which pure steam will condense but the power o t e su ace carry off the heat .
, tv 2.That the rate of condensation diminishes rapidly and n 1873 .
] On the direct Synthesis of Ammonia .
281 uniformly as the pressure of air increases from two to ten per cent , that of the steam , and then less and less rapidly until thirty per cent , is reached , after which the rate of condensation remains nearly constant .
3 .
That in consequence of this effect of air the necessary size of a surface-condenser for a steam-engine increases very rapidly with the quantity of air allowed to be present within it .
4 .
That by mixing air with the steam before it is used , the condensation at the surface of a cylinder may be greatly diminished , and consequently the efficiency of the engine increased .
5 .
That the maximum effect , or nearly so , will be obtained when the pressure of the air is one tenth that of the steam , or when about two cubic feet of air at the pressure of the atmosphere and the temperature 60 ' F. are mixed with each pound of steam .
15 .
Remarks .
As this investigation was nearly completed my attention was called to a statement by Sir W. Armstrong , to the effect that Mr. Siemens had suggested as an explanation of the otherwise anomalous advantage of forcing air into the boiler of a steam-engine , that the air may prevent , in a great measure , the condensation at the surface of the cylinder .
It would thus seem that Mr. Siemens has already suggested the probability of the fact which is proved in this investigation .
I am not aware , however , that any previous experiments have been made on the subject , and therefore I offer these results as independent testimony of the correctness of Mr. Siemens 's views as well as of my own .

" On the direct Synthesis of Ammonia .
" By W. F. Donkin .
Communicated by Sir B. C. Brodie , Bart. , F.R.S. Received May 1 , 1873 .
The action of induced electricity on mixtures of certain gases has been lately shown by Sir Benjamin Brodie ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. April 3 , 1873 ) to yield very interesting results .
An obvious application of his method was to treat a mixture of dry hydrogen and nitrogen in a similar manner as those referred to above , with the view of effecting the synthesis of ammonia ; and Sir B. Brodie kindly allowed me the use of his apparatus for the purpose of the experiment , which was conducted as follows:\#151 ; A mixture of about three volumes of hydrogen with one of nitrogen in a bell-jar over water , was passed through two tubes containing pumice moistened with alkaline pyrogallate and sulphuric acid respectively , then through a Siemens induction-tube , and into a bulb containing dilute hydrochloric acid .
The whole apparatus being first filled with pure hydrogen , about half a litre of the mixed gases was sent through the apparatus , the induction-coil not being in action ; the bulb containing the acid was then removed and another substituted , containing an equal volume of the same acid .
