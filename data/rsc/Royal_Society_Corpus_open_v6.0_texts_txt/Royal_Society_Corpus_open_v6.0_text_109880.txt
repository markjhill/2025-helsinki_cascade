] In this note the author expresses his regret at finding that the demonstration of the binomial theorem , and the first proposition of his paper on the construction of logarithms , formerly presented to the Royal Society , had been previously given by Mr. Spence in his Essay on Logarithmic Transcendents .
This author , however , says Mr. Knight , is not particularly happy in the manner of developing the kind of functions treated of in his preface , and therefore in the present note gives a solution of a class of equations of which Mr. Spence has considered a particular case , without however resolving .
