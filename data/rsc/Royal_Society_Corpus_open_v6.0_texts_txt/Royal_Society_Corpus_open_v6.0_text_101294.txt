An Extract of a Letter , Written from Dantzick to the Honourable R. Boyle , containing the success of some Experiments of Infusing Medicines into humane Veins .
MOnsieur Smith , Physician in Ordinary to this City , having liberty granted him to try an Experiment upon some persons desperately infected with the Pox , then in the public Hospital here , adventured the opening a Vein , and Infusing some Medicines into the blood ; which was tried upon two persons , whereof the one recovered , and the other dyed .
Yet being since farther encouraged by corresponding with some of the Royal Society in England , about a Month since , the said Physician , together with Monsieur scheffeler , another ancient Practitioner in this City , repeated the Experiment by infusing Altering Medicines into the Veins of the right Arms of three persons : the one , lame of the Gout ; the other , extremely Apoplectical ; and the third , reduced to extremity by that odd distemper , the Plica Polenica .
The Success of this , as Monsieur Hevelius ( who was the person only admitted to be present at the operation ) informs me , was ; That the Gouty man found himself pretty well next day , and shortly after went to work , it being Harvest time , and has continued well ever since , leaving the Hospital yesterday , and professing himself cured .
The Apoplecticall hath not had one Paroxysme since : And the several Sores , which the Plica Polonica had occasioned , are healed ; and both these Persons have been able to work any time these three Weeks .
