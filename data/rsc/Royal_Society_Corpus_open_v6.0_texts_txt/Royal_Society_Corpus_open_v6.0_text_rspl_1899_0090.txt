commencing at X 4736*18 , which so far has not been observed in the chromosphere .
The other flutings of carbon which are present in the chromosphere do not appear in the coronal spectrum .
The reductions indicate that there may be feeble indications of the presence of some of the chromospheric gases in the inner corona .
Thus in photograph 3d , on the north-eastern edge , fragments of rings corresponding to lines of helium at 4472 , 4714 , and 4922 have been recorded ; these occur also on the south-western limb , where the chromosphere itself is coming into view , but as the chromosphere was completely eclipsed in the north-east at this stage , the radiations mentioned as occurring there perhaps belong to the inner corona .
A very interesting result of this detailed examination of the photographs is that the chief coronal ring in the green is very closely associated with the form of the inner , and appears to have no distinct connection with the outer , corona .
This suggests that the green line of the coronal spectrum is not produced in the outer corona , and that the indications of its presence there on previous occasions , as obtained by slit spectroscopes , were simply due to glare , as in the case of hydrogen and calcium .
So far as the photographs taken with the prismatic cameras are concerned , the spectrum of the outer corona gives no indications of bright rings .
The measurements of the coronal rings and the diagram which accompanies this paper have been made by Mr. Fowler .
Dr. Lockyer has investigated the coronal spectrum in relation to carbon , and Mr. Baxandall has made comparisons with the spectra of stars and nebulae .
* " The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at the Freezing Point .

( Abstract .
) It is known that the depression of the freezing point of water , produced by dissolving molecularly equivalent amounts of different acids .and salts in a given quantity of it , is approximately proportional to the number of ions which these substances must be supposed to yield in order to explain their electrical conductivities .
Again , as the concentration of a solution of one such substance is gradually increased , .the molecular depression of the freezing point , and the equivalent electrical conductivity , both vary , and vary by amounts which seem in .some cases to correspond , but in others to differ considerably .
There appeared reason to suppose that it was desirable to increase The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at the .
Freezing 193 both the extent and the accuracy of our experimental knowledge of these relations .
Freezing-point determinations for very dilute solutions are extremely difficult , owing to the minute differences of tern-Lrature to be measured , and the results given by various observers Showed great discrepancies .
On the other hand , the most satisfactory experiments on the electrical ionisation of corresponding solutions had been made at higher temperatures , instead of at the freezing point , at which they should be obtained for purposes of comparison .
The fact that the temperature coefficient of conductivity differs for solutions of different concentration , showed that the values of the ionisation would vary if the temperature was changed .
t .
Mr E H. Griffiths therefore undertook the examination of the freezing points by the method of platinum thermometry , and the present paper contains an account of corresponding measurements of the electrical conductivities at 0 C. In order to avoid any possible action of glass on the solvent used , it was determined that the water should be obtained from a platinum still and collected in platinum bottles , and that both the freezing point and the electrical measurements should be made in platinum vessels .
The structure of the resistance cell is represented in fig. 1 .
The walls of the vessel itself are used as one electrode , and an insulated platinum cage , suspended inside , forms the other .
Within the cage is a platinum screw , mounted on a shaft , which can be turned by means of a hand wheel and cord .
This screw is used to insure temperature equality throughout the liquid , and to mix the solutions when made .
The shaft of the screw is a hollow tube , closed at the bottom , which contains a thermometer .
Instead of beginning with a strong solution and gradually diluting , it was thought better to begin with a definite quantity of the pure solvent , and , when its resistance had been observed , to add weighed amounts of stock solution of known strength by means of the platinum vessel shown in fig. 2 .
This vessel will obviously empty itself if a flow of liquid is started by slightly increasing the air pressure at the neck . .
In order to obtain a definite quantity of solvent , slightly more than the volume needed was placed in the cell , and the level of the liquid was then adjusted by sucking water through a capillary platinum tube into the glass vessel shown in fig. 3 .
The bottom of the capillary always comes to the same position relatively to the cell , and , if the sucking pressure is kept constant and equal to that of a water column of about a foot in height , it is found that the amount of water left in the cell is constant to within about one-tenth of a gramme .
Thus three independent withdrawals left 219*60 , 219*63 , and 219*59 grammes .
Whenever the cell was dismounted and set up again , this measurement was repeated .
The platinum vessel was surrounded by a brass case , coils of meta 194 Mr. W. C. D. Whetham .

tubing being placed in the narrow air space between them .
Evaporated ether vapour could be drawn through these coils by an air-pump , and thus the whole vessel cooled .
The apparatus was fixed in a large copper tank , which was filled with melting ice .
The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at the Freezing Point .
195 The electrical resistance measurements were made by the method of alternating currents , but the usual telephone indicator was replaced by a D'Arsonval galvanometer .
This was done by using a revolving commutator , which , turned by a hand-wheel and cord , alternated the connections of the bridge with the battery and with the galvanometer simultaneously .
The usual Wheatstone-bridge method could then be used , and measurements obtained in the same cell of resistances varying from 10 to 50,000 ohms , the accuracy throughout being at least 1 in 1000 .
The method eliminates several troublesome periodic disturbances , and , in this form , seems entirely satisfactory .
The surface of the electrodes was platinised in the usual manner , but was afterwards heated to redness .
This process gives a roughened platinum surface of large area , which is less liable to absorb matter from the solution than is the unheated platinum black .
The water used was thrice distilled , twice with alkaline permanganate and once in a platinum still with a trace of acid potassium sulphate .
It had an average conductivity at 18 ' of about 09 x 10-15in C.G.S. units .
Fig. 3 .
O Mr. W. C. D. Whetham .
Some of the stock solutions for the early part of the work were* prepared by Miss D. Marshall , and most of those used in the later measurements were made up at the Cambridge University Chemical Laboratory by Mr. G. Hall , under the advice of Mr. H. J. H. Fenton .
Others were prepared by the writer from recrystallised salts obtained from Kahlbaum , of Berlin .
From a knowledge of the weight of solvent used and the weight of stock solution added it was easy to calculate the concentration ( m ) of the resulting solution in terms of gramme-equivalents of solute per thousand grammes of solution .
All the experiments were made on solutions so dilute that this way of defining m leads to practically the same results as though the gramme-equivalents of solute were referred to 1000 grammes of solvent , or to one litre of solution .
The differences only become visible on the curves in the cases of two or three of the strongest solutions of some of the substances used .
The observed resistance is corrected for any slight difference in temperature from zero , and for the increased volume of liquid in the cell due to the volume of stock solution added .
The reciprocal of this corrected resistance is the conductivity in arbitrary cell units , and from this the corresponding arbitrary conductivity of the solvent is subtracted .
The resultant conductivity , due to the added solute alone , is divided by m , and k/ m , the equivalent conductivity , plotted on a diagram as ordinate , the value of m* , a number proportional to the average nearness of the molecules , being used as abscissa .
From these curves the maximum value of k/ m is estimated , and taken to represent complete ionisation , the ionisation for the solutions measured being calculated as the ratio between the actual value of k/ m and its maximum .
The values obtained for these ionisations were arranged as shown in the following table , which is given as an example , and are plotted as curves on the diagrams appended .
Sulphuric Acid.-\#151 ; Prepared at the Chemical Laboratory by adding the calculated amount of S03 to distilled acid .
Successive crystallisation brought the melting point of the resultant H2SO4 to + 10*5 ' Cent. The crystals were dissolved in water and the concentration of the solution estimated by the barium sulphate method .
Similar measurements were made on Potassium Chloride , Barium Chloride , Copper Sulphate , Potassium Permanganate , Potassium Ferri-cyanide , and Potassium Bichromate .
In discussing the results , we may first notice that , in cases where it has been possible to obtain values for the ionisation at 18 ' from Kohlrausch 's work , the ionisation curve at 0 ' is appreciably different from that at 18 ' , the ionisation falling off more rapidly with increasing concentration at the higher temperature .
In the diagrams the values for 0 ' are given by dots inside circles , and those for 18 ' by crosses .
The Ionisation of Dilute Solutions at the Freezing Point .
197 In the case of copper sulphate , measurements by the present method were made at 18 ' as well as at 0 ' , and are indicated by crosses inside circles ; giving a curve which agrees with Kohlrausch 's observations at moderate concentrations , but differs from them at extreme dilution .
The normal type of curve is given by potassium chloride , barium chloride , \amp ; c. The curve for sulphuric acid departs from this form , as other observers , using glass vessels , and working at higher temperatures , have previously found .
The drop in this curve at extreme dilution is seen also in solutions of other acids and alkalies , and it has been usual to explain it by supposing that the effective amount of acid is reduced at extreme dilution by interaction with the residual impurities of the solvent .
The phenomenon seems too constant for this Table I. \#163 ; H2S04 = 49*04 , Solvent .

The drop in the curve for potassium permanganate is , on the other hand , probably due to interaction between the salt and the solvent impurities .
The effect is completed by the first addition of salt , for if a correction be made in the case of the first solution for the salt thus put out of action , it is found that the curve reverts to the normal type .
This is clearly shown by the diagram .
Again , both in this case and in that of sulphuric acid , it was foimd that for solutions of great dilution the resistance showed a gradual rise for some time after the VOL. LXVI .

The Ionisation of Dilate Solution# at the Freezing Point .
201 stock solution was added to the solvent , as though the action took time for its completion .
While , however , in the case of permanganate this phenomenon was only observed on adding the first lot of stock solution , in the case of acid it appeared in the second solution also .
This confirms the idea that the action is not completed by the first addition of acid , though the quantity of acid present must be large compared with the amount of residual impurity in the solvent .
The permanganate measurements also show that the slant of- the curve is that of a salt like potassium chloride , with a monovalent acid radicle , rather than that of a salt such as copper sulphate , with ai divalent acid .
The chemical structure of permanganate in water , solution is therefore probably represented by the formula KMnC\gt ; 4 .
The curve for potassium bichromate appears to consist of two parts , an indication , perhaps , that the ions are , different at different concentrations .
In order to collect the results , smoothed values have been obtained from the curves and are appended in Tables IX , X , XI , and XII .
; The : first three tables contain ionisation coefficients at 0 ' , the concentration being tabulated in different ways .
Table XII shows approximate values for the equivalent conductivities at 0 ' .
These were not necessary for the determination of ionisation , so a single value of the celt constant , obtained by comparison of the copper sulphate measurements at 18 ' with Kohlrausch 's absolute values , was used , except for the potassium chloride solutions , which were reduced by a figure given by Kohlrausch for this salt at 0 ' .
The errors will be small , for the amount of solvent left in the cell in each case was very nearly constant , and this is a measure of the accuracy with which the cell is readjusted after being taken to pieces .
The results , however , are not supposed to be as trustworthy as those of the ionisation coefficients .
