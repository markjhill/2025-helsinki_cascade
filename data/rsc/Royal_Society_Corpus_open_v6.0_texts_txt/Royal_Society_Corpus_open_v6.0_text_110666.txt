A paper was read , entitled " On the structure of Normal and Adventitious Bone .
" By Alfred Smec , Esq. , communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. Sec. R.S. On examining , by means of a microscope , very thin sections of bone , prepared in a peculiar manner , the author observed a number of small , irregularly-shaped , oblong corpusclcs , arranged in circular layers round the canals of Havers , and also rows of similar bodies distributed around both the external and the internal margins of the bone .
Each corpuscle is connected by numerous filaments , passing in all directions with the Haversian canals and the margins of the bone , and also with the adjaccnt corpusclcs .
He finds that the ca ?
nals of Havers are vascular tubes containing blood .
The corpusclcs themselves are hollow , and their cavities occasionally communicate with those of the canals ; their length is equal to about two or three diameters of the globules of the blood .
They exist in cartilaginous as well as osseous structures , and are found in every instance of ad ?
ventitious bone , such as callus after fracture , morbid ossific growths either from bone or from other tissues ; and the author has also as ?
certained their presence in the bony and cartilaginous structures of inferior animals , such as birds and fishes .
Measurements relating to these corpuscles , by Mr. Bowcrbank , are subjoined , from which it appears that their diameters vary from about the 10,000th to the 4000th , and their lengths from the 2300th to the 1400th part of an inch .
