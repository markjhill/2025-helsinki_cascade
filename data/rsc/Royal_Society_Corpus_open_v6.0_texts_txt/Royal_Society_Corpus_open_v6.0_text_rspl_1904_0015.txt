" The Secreto-motor Effects in the Cat 's Foot Studied by the \gt ; i Electrometer .
" By Augustus D. Waller , M.D. , F.R.S. Received November 17 , \#151 ; Read November 19 , 1903 .
Re- 1 ceived in revised form January 16 , 1904 .
In a previous communication* it was stated that the electrical signs a of secreto-motor action by tetanisation of the sciatic nerve are a demonstrable in the pads of a cat 's foot after death , best so during ; the second half-hour after death , when the action of the nerve upon muscles of the limb has ceased .
The subsequent study of these effects , by means of electrometer records , has brought out with great distinctness the chief classical events with which we are familiar in the case of the contraction of voluntary muscle , viz. , the latency and course of a single response to a -ingle stimulus , the super-position of two or more responses and the composition of tetanus , summation of stimuli , fatigue and recovery , and the staircase phenomenon .
The difference between the muscular and the secreto-motor series of phenomena is principally a difference of time , the former being about 100 times more rapid than the latter .
I may pi eface the description by stating that I have experimentally satisfied myself that the electrical effects are in reality of glandular oiigin .
I he response is completely abolished by atropine , and it is restricted to the pads ( glandular ) of the skin ! !
being completely absent from the hairy ( non-glandular ) skin , i.e. , it is not a pilo-motor concomitant .
llie description itself will be best given by means of the following electrometer records of :\#151 ; 1 .
A single response to show the latent period and duration of the response .
2 .
A series of single responses to show staircase phenomenon .
3 .

9 A series to show the difference between infrequent and frequent stimuli .
No special comment upon the records appears to be necessary , beyond , perhaps , a remark to the effect that " summation of stimuli , " as distinguished from " summation of effects , " is , by reason of the great length of the latent period , a particularly evident phenomenon .
The latent period itself has its seat at the organ of intermediation between nerve and secreting cell , as is shown by the absence of demonstrable lost time to direct excitation and along the nerve itself .
The declining excitability of the secreto-motor nerve fibres is very evidently in the centrifugal direction , stimulation of the nerve nearer to the periphery being effective after stimulation further from the periphery has ceased to be effective .
Similar effects are obtainable on nerve-skin preparations of the frog , " summation of stimuli " and " staircase effect " being , as in the case of the cat , particularly evident .

The first response , aroused by five shocks at an interval of 2 seconds , is an incomplete tetanus with a maximum value of 0*0040 volt .
The second and third responses are each to five shocks at an interval of about T^th second , and reach maximum values of 0*0123 and 0*0120 volt .

The latent period and the duration of the response are smaller at high temperature , greater at low temperature .
And under similar , conditions the voltage of the response is greater at high than at low temperature .
These three points are illustrated by fig. 10 of a single response from the left foot enclosed in a cool chamber at + 9 ' , and from the right foot enclosed in a warm chamber at + 35 ' .
