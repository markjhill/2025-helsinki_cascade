] This tusk , which weighed fifty pounds , and measured about six feet in length , is supposed to have been imported from Africa , and was purchased at Liverpool by a manufacturer of Birmingham .
On shaking it , a rattling noise was heard near the middle part , which , on cutting the tooth transversely , was found to be occasioned by an iron spear-head , about six inches and a half long , which lay in the longitudinal direction of the tooth , with the point foremost , and was considerably corroded .
It is conjectured that the spear had entered at the basis of the trunk , between the interior angle of the eye and the proboscis , the cavity of the tusk being placed immediately beneath this part .
From the quantity of bony matter that had been formed round this extraneous body , it is inferred that the animal must have lived a considerable time after it had received the wound .
-The spear-head and the part of the tooth in which it had been imbedded were exhibited to the Society at the close of the Meeting .
