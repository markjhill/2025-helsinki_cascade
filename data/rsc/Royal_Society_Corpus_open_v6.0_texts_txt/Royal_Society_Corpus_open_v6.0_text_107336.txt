1H E rectification of the hyperbola by means of two ellipses is one proof , among many others , of the great sagacity of the late Mr. JOHN LANDEN , F. R.S. ; and the ingenuity which he displayed on that occasion has obtained the notice and called forth the praises of eminent mathematicians both in this island and on the Continent .
Yet , while the great ingenuity of the device is thus generally and justly allowed , this method of rectifying the hyperbola has always appeared to me to be It more curious than useful , as it is circittous , and requires muct more calculatzon than is requ sitefor that purpose by an approprate theorem .
The establishment of this truth is the main design of this short paper ; a truth which , to my surprise , has not been noticed in any book that has come to my hands .
B. But , before I proceed to investigation , it seems proper to remark , that Mr. LANDEN has , in his Memoirt on the Hyperbola and Ellipsis , expressed himself as if he thought that the difference between an hyperbolic arch and its tangent , when both are of an immense length , could not be computed before he published that work .
His words at the beginning of the memoir above-menti'oned , are these : Some of the tileoiems given by mathematicians for the calculation of fluents by " eans of elliptic and hyperbolic arcs requiting , in the apply .
cation tlereof , the difference to be taken between an arc of an hyperbola and its tangent and such difrence being not directly attainable wlen such arc and its tangent both " become infinite , as they w11 do when the who fluent is w wanted , although such sflent be at the sam tme fii'te ; " those theorems therefoe in that case fal , a computation " thereby being then impracticable w'thout some n there " help .
" " The supplying that defect I cons'dereds a point of some importance in geomeiry , and therefore I earnestly vished and ndeavoured to accomplsh that business my aim eing to ascertain , by means of suclo arcs as above-mentioned , the " imit of the difference between the hyperbolic are and its * On this occasion , no one has betrayed more ignarance , m not shown a greater want of candour , that the writer of Art .

The result of my endeavours respecting that point appears in this Me : moir : which , among other matters , contains the investigation of a general theorem for finding the length of any arc ( of any conic hyperbola by means of two elliptic arcs."Vol .

And towards the end of the sane memoir he has expressed himself thus : " Mr. MACLAURIN 's method of construction , , [ of the elastic curve , J ( just now adverted to , though very " elegant , is not without a defect .
The difference between the hyperbolic arc and its tangent being necessary to be taken , the method ( for the reason mentioned at the beginning s of this Memoir ) always fails when some principal point in ' the figure is to be determined ; the said arc and its tangent " then both becoming infinite , though their difference be at " the same time finite .

Whoever reads the passages here quoted , and knows not what was done on the subject before Mr. LANDEN handled it , will undoubtedly conceive that he was the first person who solved the problem of computing the difference between the length of the infinite arch of an hyperbola and its asymptote .
Yet the fact is not so .
That diiference may be computed , in many cases , by the first series given by Mr. MACLAURIN in Art , 8o8 of his Treatise of Fluxionzs , which series admits oi an easy transformation into another form , by which the aforesaid difference may be conmputed in all cases ; or the fluent may be ti~ taken in a series whichwill always converge ; and both he and Mr. SIMPSoN have actually produced such a series , the one in the place before referred to , and the other in Art .
435 of his Doctrine of Fluxions .
And although this series , when the transverse axis of the hyperbola is much greater than the conjugate , will converge very slowly , yet ( as I have shown in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1798 , ) the value of it to seven , or even to ten places of figures is , in all cases , attainable .
As Mr. LANDEN had the character of a man of great probity , and as he has , in various parts of his writings , shown a regard for the memory of the eminent mathematicians above-mentioned , I cannot account for this misrepresentation of the matter any other way than by supposing that , being oldwhen he wrote this memoir , and encumbered with much other business , his memory failed him .
His just praise on this occasion is , that his solution of the aforesaid problem is much better tha those of his contemporaries .
I shall have occasion to speak again of this problem in my observations towards the end of this paper ; but now proceed to the proof of the main point which I had in view in writing it .

If the transverse axis of any conic hyperbola be called 2 , and the conjugate axis b ; and if the abscissa counted from the center on the transverse axis be called x , the corresponding ordinate y , and the length of the arch from the vertex to the ordinate H ; then , by SIMPSON 's Fluxions , Art .

Let us now ( to simplify the expression ) put e , and ' As this result differs from that given by Mr. WOODHOUSS , in p. 260 of the Philosophical Transactions for 1804 , I have set down the process at large , that the intelligent reader may the more easily p:reeive where the truth lies .

si uu ) is u. The third term , 3('J- , by multiplying both ( IUU)2 numerator and denominator by e/ ( -s uu ) , becomes Z ; UU_Et U U4 3 3U---- , which ( by division ) is very easily resolved ( I -uu)2 X / ( Ie UU ) into ?
EiUU +I ( I-aE ) UU ; so that the sum / ( Iuu ) xA/ ( l-6 uu ) ( I -C U)2 X u/ I EuU ) of the second and third terms on that side of the equation becomes barely 3 ' - , which expression is ob(x-UU ) X( -EE Ui ) viously =.-)iu + u(i-.U Xi-r ) and the / ( l-UU ) X V/ ( I -U U ) + ( I-UU ) X ( I- , E uu ) last of these ( e being by the notation =-- ) differs from H , the fluxion of the hyperbolic arch , found in the preceding Article , only in that it is not multiplied by e ; or , in other words , it is = - .
Let us therefore substitute the values now found e for their equals in the above fluxional equation , and we shall h *^%~ -e / iEEss ( I -le ) fl have V - " " 1 ( a ) have V I. } ( I x-u ) x V(-a + u. ( ) e 7 .
Now it is easy to perceive , from what is done in Art .
13 and 4 of LANDEN'S second Memoir , ( above referred to , ) that the fluent of the second term on the right-hand side of this equation may be found by means of the fluent of the first term .
, " W0 an algebraic quantity , and the arch of another ellipsis which is more eccentric .
And as this has been done by some late writers on the rectification of the ellipsis , * I shall , on the present occasion , only state and use the result in a notation convenient for an arithmetical calculator .
Thus , putting , = - , and w + uu-- ' ( ee-u u ) ( i-uu ) and the fluent of - , ,--E , ( / u ) iuu ) 9 of F , --c( --w ) VE , it is certain that Fis=\+)u+ y is -2 IE Iie 2U --Multiply this equation by i es , and write 2e for its equal q ( 1 ) ' , and it becomes ( i-e-e ) F 2eU + 2E -2(I+E ) 'E .
If we now take the fluents of the fluxions in the equation marked ( a ) in the preceding Article , we shall have V= E( i-s ) F+H .
And since all these quantities begin and increase together , this equation needs no correction .
And by writing for ( i.e)F its value found in the preceding equation , we haveV E+2 ( i + ) E+ - ; and thence by reduction and transposition , H= 2E eu+e Ve E , e ( 1 + s ) E ' ; which expression will be found to exceed that given ( for the same purpose ) by Mr. WOODHOUSE , in p. 661 of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1804 , in the ratio of e to 1 .
e See M. LACROIX 's Traite ' du Calcul Differentiel et du Calcul Inte'gral , Tome 1. .

116 Moreover ; since by the notation in Art .
5 and 6 , e ies = , and V ux , , we have , by substituting these values for their equals in the last equation , H= su +e ( u x+ E)-~ ( i e ) 'E , ( ) which is LANDEN'S theorem in a differenti notation .

I am now to prove , that all the labour of computing the eccentricity* and abscissa , and the arch itself , of this second ellipsis , and the subsequent operations of multiplication and subtraction requisite in the application of it to the rectification of the hyperbola , is altogether needless ; since the samt end may be obtained by only computing and applying the flent of t v/ _f u-which will require no more calculation than must be made to find and apply the elliptic arch denoted by E ( of which the axis , and eccentricity , and abscissa , are given ) .
And the truth of this will quickly appar .

This theorem , as fr as I know , is new .
Here then it appears , that the rectification of the hyperbola is accomplished by means of the algebraic quantity e V , When it is more convenient to use the conjugate semi-axis than the eccentricity , in the arithmetical calculation , then that must be computed instead of the eccentricity .

Yet , for the more ready co mparison of the series , with each other , which arise in taking these fluents , I will here set them down in the NEWTONIAN form , which undoubtedly is the most convenient for arithmnetical calculations that has yet been discovered .

Now , by comparing together the fluents denoted by A ' and A , B ' and B , C ' and C , &amp;c. it is obvious that the arithmetical calculation of the one will not , in any respect , be more difficult than that of the other ; and that A is always less than A ' , B than B ' , C than C ' , &amp;c. Antd it is evident that each of the series denoted by E and G converges by the same geometrical progression , viz. E s4 , s ' &amp;c. So that the arithmetical value of any number of terms of the latter series will always be nearer to the value of the whole , than1 the aritnhetical value of the same number of terms of the former series will be to its whole .
And as to transformations of the expression V/ ( il'U u into others , in order to obtain the flulent in series of swifter convergency , when the case requires it ; it is obvious that similar operations may be performed on the expression.vd G to er hIn the application of E and Gt the recticrat on of the bhyperbola , the one is multiplied by e , the other by e , ( see the no equations marked ( C ) and ( a ) in Art .

Thus it appears , that all the labour of computing the eccentricity , the abcissa , and the lengtl of the elliptic arch denoted by 'E , and of applying it to the rectification of the hyperbola , is wholly unnecessary ; and consequently , that that method is circutous , and more curious than usef u.

The new seres above given in Art .
11 , it is obvious , will converge swiftly so long as u is small in comaparison of i ; ( which it will be when x is not much greater than ) so that this series will be very convenient for computing a small arch of any hyperbola near the vertex , even when is nearly = i : and , when e is small in comparison of i , any arch , how great so ever , may easily be computed by it .
But , when e is nearly and uu is greater than this series will convege but slowly ; and , for that reason , Will not be an eligible form for arthmetical calculation .
In such cases , however , a swift convergency will take place in some of the descending series ( discovered by me , and ) inserted in the Philosophical TransI By comparing the expressions marked y and , in Article 9 of ths Paper , with the short paragraph near the top of page z6i of the Philosophical Transactions for 18o4 , tce n.t hematical reader will quickly perceive that Mr. WODHOUSE has the.re asseede too much actions for 1802 .
And as those descending series differ from the ascending ones by a constant quantity , ( as is there shown , ) I will now add something to what was then said on the methlods of computing the value of that constant quantity .
14 .
It is very evident from what is done in the Philosophical Transactions for 180 , from page 46o to page 465 , that the constant quantity here spoken of is no other than the difference between the length of the arch of the hyperbola and its tangent , " when the point of contact " ( to use LAND $NS words , ) " is supposed to be carried to an ifinite distance from " the vertex of the curve : " *--which differece is undoubtedly the same as " the difference between the leigth of the arch infinitely produced and its asymptote"'-(as SIMPSON-expresses it .
) And since each of these e-inent n athematicians , and MAC LAURIN also , ( as I before observed , ) has treated of this difference , it stems requisite that I should here give a brief statement of their methods of coputing it , and compare them with such of my own as I o'f:r to the pIIic .

And this series will be found to agree also with the value of sG in the equation marked ( ?

For , in that case , eV ex denotes the asymptote , and I the infinite arch of the hyperbola ; and we have , by transposition , ex H -= sG .
And , u being = i , A , the first term of the series denoted by G in Art .

This series , it is obvious , will converge but slowly when e is not much greater , and consequently a not much less , than i ; that is when b is small in comparison of i. But , in such cases , other series which have a good rate of convergency may be used , as was shown in my former paper on the Rectification 12 L3 of the Hyperbola , and will more fully appear in the following pages .
Mr. LANDEN'S methods of computing the aforesaid difference next come under consideration : and , first , his method of computing it by means of the arches of two ellipses .
1.6 We have seen above , that , when x becomes immensely great , u becomes = i ; and in this case the equation ( C ) in Art .
7 becomes H =ex + eE E( 1+ e ) 'E ; from which we have ex -H 2(1+ e ) 'EeE - , another expression of the difference between the length of the asymptote and the infinite arch : wfich expression , however , is not so convenient for arithmetical calculation as the preceding .
For here E denotes the quadrantal arch of an ellipsis of which the transverse semi-axis is i , and the eccentricity a ; which arch is Nx ' 3e4 3 -35 33 '5 5'7 ?

24 + 6.6 z.z. .
6.-.8will require as much labour as the computation of ?
G , which is the very difference sourlgt .
( See the preceding Art .
) But , by this method , we have yet to compute the elliptic arch denoted by 'E , of which the transverse semi-axis is i , the eccentricity = , ( = , ) and abscissa v= 2/ ( ) ( = / ( ) .
and then there must be a multiplication of this quantity by , ( 1 + e ) , and , after that , a subtraction of eE + , from the product , to obtain the difference sought : all which labour is more than is required by the method described in the preceding article .
Here , then , we have a striking instance ( and a thousand more might be produced ) of the inutility of rectifying the hyperbola by means of two ellipses .
R2 I23 But Mr. LANDEN discovered another and a better no thod of computing the difibrence in question , which is briefly ths : If from C , the center of an hyperbola , CP be drawn perpendicular to DP , a tangentto the curve in D ; and if the transverse semi-axis CA be = m , the conjugate semi-axis = n , the perpendicular CP = p ; and iff be CA B mm--nn P put= and p 2r i 'n P then will the difference between the length of the tangent DP and the arch AD be universally expressed by dthe fluent of 2fni- ; z ) where d is a constant quantity = the fluent generated while z increases from o to m. If now LP be written instead of z , the above fluxion will becoimne ( M2tln P4agreeing with MAC LAURIN'S expression of the same thing in Art .
804 and 8o8 of his Fluxions , where the transverse and conjug.te semi-axes are denoted by a and b , respectively ; and , in the latter of those articles , this expression is resolved into -..a p ) and its fluent generated ( aarpp)V i ( bb+pp ) ' while p increases from o to a , or m , is exhibted in series of which I have spoken in Art .
3 and 15 of this Paper .
Mr. LANDEN has no where , that I know of , exhibited the fluent of the above fluxion in series , but in the following manner.* Denoting the fluent of mm ( n , generated while p increases from o to m , by L , ( which I denote by d , ) he says that , when the abscissa CB is =mx v/ ( + -V-(nm , / ( mm+-nn ) ' ) ( at which time the ordinate BD is =ix v/ ( mm+-nn ) , and the tangent DP == / ( m-m + in ) ) , then L , ( or d , ) is =2 DP 2 AD +2 -r(m + n)n ) n+ ( / ( mm +n )m AD .
18 .
Now , in order to compare this method with those of MAC LAUaIN and SIMPSON which have been described above , we may proceed thu s : ( mpp)p/ ( Fpp ) ( which , for the sake of brevity in a subsequent use of the fluent , I denote by ~ , ) is pi ) , pp 3Pr 35p ' 35-7P " PHJLL *1 + . ? ?

19 .
Two series being thus obtained as expressions of the general value of the fluent of ( m p(denoted by p , ) the next thing to be done is , to ascertain the rate of convergency of each when the abscissa CB is m V/ ( + -(m ) .
Now to this value of the abscissa CB , the corresponding value of the perpendicular CP -(as appears from the equations in Art .

20 .
It is now easy to compare these rates of convergency with that which has place in the series in Art .
15 , thus : Putting i instead of m , and b instead of n , the rates are these , viz. In Ist Series , In 2d Series .

15 will , on a double account of simplicity , be much easier than by the second series in the preceding Art .
notwithstanding its greater rate of convergency , Let us now write 2- , , 2 , &amp;c. successively instead of b , and we shall have the following rates In ist Series .

If indeed the hyperbola were equilateral , then , n being = m , the fluxional expression ; p becomes -= V(mm -pp)Vl(nnt ' pp ) ipp ~pp 3f 3SP .

In , ' And taking p= V(n+n / m+nf ) ) , which , in this case , is / ( I( ) , we shall have =3 the rate of convergency of the geometrical progression which will have place in this series ; and this rate of convergency , together with the simplicity of the numeral coefficients , will render this series eligible for numerical calculation in preference to either of the other series .
e. The fluent of pp ) -^ pmv ( n+/ ( mi mnn ) ) ' being obtained in converging series , whatever be the ratio of m to n ; let this particular value of it be denoted by 0 , ( to distinguish it from the general value denoted by , ) and substituted in the general eqiation dq= DP -AD , in Art .
17 , and we shall have d == DP AD ; and this value of DP AD being substituted for it in the particular equation Li =d -2 DP-AD n/ / ( mm + nn ) , in the same 128 Article ( in which equation DP =/ ( mm +nn ) , ) we have ad 2ds2 + nV(mm + nn ) , and hence L=d= 2(I + ^/ ( mm nn ) n , which is the difference , or quantity sought .
23 .
I come now to make a comparison of Mr. LANDEN'S last mentioned method of computing the difference in question with some of my own methods .
We have already seen in Art .
2o , that , when the conjugate axis of the hyperbola is greater than the transverse , LANDEN'S method is not wanted , since the operation by the old series will , in general , be easier .
The comparison therefore , now to be made , is only in cases when the conjugate axis is equal to , or less than , the transverse axis .
It appears from Art .
9 , i , and 17 of this Paper , that , when mis put= i , and x is taken =m / ( + n--m ) ) the value of E ?
uu is + , + , ( f+ ) , the powers of which fraction form the geometrical progression which will have place in the series denoted by G , from which H , or the arch AD is quickly obtained .
And , with these values of m and x , we have , by Art .
'pp n 19 , --PP n , the powers of which fraction form the mm n+/ ( I+nn ) ' geometrical progression which will have place in the series denoted by ( .
When n is taken = i , the former of these algebraic fractions is ' , the latter is = ~As the one fraction increases with n , and the other decreases , it is easy to find that value of n which shall make them equal , viz. n= ( 2+ V-2o ) -= 0786 , &amp;c. ; and , with this value of n , each of these fractions is =3 =_ o381966 , &amp;c. Thus it appears , that , n having any value greater than V/ ( -2 + / 9 , o ) , the fraction -- ' w will be less than -- , + nn +l+(l nn ) n -i / ( Inn)( and less than o'381966 ; and consequentiy that the hyperbolic arch AD may be more easily obtained from the series denoted by G , in Art .
1 , than by either of those denoted by qp in Art .
18 .
And hence we may derive another expresssion of the value of d in the following manner .
uni ver sal ee xx-ee .
e 4 .
Since uu is universally =e ( see equation in Art .
5 , where e denotes the eccentricity ; ) by putting xx =1+ / ( i+ , n and writing i+ nn instead of ee , we shall have V( +nn ) iu Iu uu =t 7(1+ntt3 and s_u = , + I-+(iYnn Let the na+V~ 4(I Znn ) ' -nd Eee nni Let the value of G , corresponding to these values of u and e , be denoted by r ; then , by the equation ( a ) in Art .
9 , the hyperbolic arch AD = H , is = eV eg .
But , since V was put = ux , ( see Art .
5 and 6 , ) it will in this case be = 1 .
Writing therefore e Er for AD , and i for m , in the equation at the end of Art .
17 , we have d=n+ V/ ( i + nn ) 2e + 2Er 2Er +n / ( 1 I Jnn ) .
XJ It now appears , that d , the difference between the length of an infinite arch of an hyperbola and its tangent , or asymptote , may be computed by means of one series converging swifter than the powers of -4 even in the most disadvantageous case ; so that a dozen terms of it will be sufficient for all common uses : but , that a series of such convergency was attainable in this case , appears not to have been observed by either of the writers before mentioned .
25 .
If the transverse and conjugate semi-axes of an hyperbola are denoted by a and i , respectively , the ordinate by y , and the arch by z ; and if v(aa + 1 ) , the eccentricity , be 80o put = e , and if e be written instead of y , in Theorems II .
and IV .
in pages 453 and 454 of the Philos. Trans. for 1802 ; then , ( as appears by pages 466 and 467 of the same Vol. ) the corresponding value of z may be obtained from either of the following equations , viz. 1 .

17 , obtained by LANDEN'S method , the difference being only in the notation .
It appears by this result , that the constant difference between the values of the ascending and descending series , here denoted by d , is equal to the difference between the lengths of the infinite arch and its tangent , as was observed in Art .
14 , and may be briefly proved thus : by the notation specified at the beginning of this Art .
and the property of the curve , as i : e : : y : ey , the length of a line drawn parallel to the asymptote from the extremity of the ordinate to the transverse axis ; which line , , when y becomes immensely great , will coincide with the tangent drawn from the same point , and will be equal to the corresponding portion of the asymptote .
And it appears by Art .
13 of my former Paper on the Rectification of the Hyperbola , ( see Philos. Trans , for 1802 , p. 461 , ) that the corresponding arch of the hyperbola , z , is = ey d. We therefore have , in this case , d= the asymptole the ifinite arch .
26 .
Thus is LANDEN'S best theorem respecting the rectification of the hyperbola obtained by the common application of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S doctrine of infinite series .
And I further observe , in transitu , that FAGNANI'S theorem , respecting the rectification of the ellipsis , is attainable in the same easy manner .
These devices are indeed very ingenious ; but their utility appears to me to be much less than has been imagined .
It has been represented even in these Transactions , for the year 1804 , p. 236 ; 3 that FAGNANI'S theorem is necessary to the investigation of EuLER 's series for computing the length of a quadrantal arch of an ellipsis ; yet , the fact is , that FAGNANI'S theoren is no more requisite on that occasion than LANDEN'S theorem is in the investigation of a simnilar series for computing the difference between the lengths of an infinite arch of an hyperbola and its asymptote , which will be given in this Paper .
27 .
It appears by inspecting the values of z and z+ d , exhibited in terms of e and 1 , in Art .
25 , that when y becomes equal to , or greater than , L , Theorem IV .
will be more eligible for arithmetical calculation than Theorem II .
It is obvious also , from the same article , that no more than one of those values need be computed in order to obtain the value of d. Putting , therefore , for the value of z corresponding / Ve + ee toy = , and S= = &lt; + A , -B.4 , + C ' , C &amp;c. ( A ' , B ' , C ' , &amp;c. being as there specified , ) we have = Sd ; and this value being written for ' in the equation d= +e 2 , it becomes d= +e+ 2d 2S ; from which we have d= 2S I e , which is another convenientformula for computing the value of d. 28 .
If the diagonal line of quantities in which I enters , either in the value of z or z+ d , before referred to , were written by itself , and the remaining perpendicular columns summed in the manner by me described in the Philos. Trans. for 1798 , p. 548 et seq. the value of d might be obtained in a pair of series , each of them converging by the powers of .
But the advantage of computing by such a pair of series , instead of the single one above described , is less than might at first be imagined ; for , in order to have a result true to the same number of figures , about the same number of terms must be computed , whether of the single series or of the pair .
Since , therefore , the advantage obtained by such a transformation lies not in the literal powers , it call have place only in the coefficients ; and there it may be very considerable .
I now proceed to the investigation of a pair of series for computing the value of the constant quantity d , each of which converges by the powers of .
29 .
If the transverse and conjugate cemi-axes of an hyperbola are denoted by a atid i , respectively , the ordinate byy , and the corresponding arch by z ; and if the eccentricity , Vaa + , be denoted by e , and i+ eeyy be put = uu ; then , as I have shown in the Philos.

25 ; ) 135 equal to the difference between the lengths of the infinite arch and its asymptote .
Now , when yo , then z= o , and u becomes = i ; and the value of the series , in this case , is the value of d ; and this value , if the terms of the series are ranged one under another according to the powers of 2 .

3 3.5.7 ; 3 shall have d =2 aa +.6 + V/ + aa x : 1 &amp;c. The law of continuation ad iinfinitum is very evident in the first of this pair of series ; and although it is not so in the second , still it is obvious that b is less : than a , c than b , &amp;c. ad iifini#tum .
And since the numeral coeficients of'each of these series may be expressed in decitnals , and their logarithms written out ready for use , an arithmetical calculation by this pair of series , when a is considerably greater than 1i will be much easier than by either of the single series given1 in Art .
25 .
But this pair of series may be transformed into another pair converging by the same powers of a , yet of a simpler form , and therefore more convenient for arithmetical calcution .
The operations f to be performed on this occasion are as follows .
So .
The H. L. of ( v/ i+ aa a ) , which enters into the value of A , is = H. L. ( a -+ vi + aa ) ; and this logarithm , expressed in correct descending series , is H. L.2a , 33 3.5 + z4.7 2..6 , , &amp;c. A , therefore being H. L. ( / + aa -a ) , is =H .

The law which the coefficients of the logarithmic series observe is evident ; the law , which the coefficients ( A , B , C , &amp;c. ) of the other series observe , will be discovered by the following process .
31 .
It appears by MAC LAURIN'S Fluxions , Art .
808 , and by the Philos. Trans. for 1802 , p. 462 , that d= 157 , &amp;c. x2 2.24 3 3.546 2.z8-7 XL , &amp;c. ; where it is evident that 27 2.4 2.2.4-4.6 2..4.4.6.6 the value of d depends entirely upon that of a , and that these two quantities must be constant or vary together .
Therefore , supposing these quantities to vary , and taking the fluxion on both sides of the equation , we have d= 1-57 &amp;c. a x : a+3 355i7 &amp; C. 2.2 2.24.4 2.2.4.46.6 .

Now this may easily be done as follows : Multiply the last equation by a , and take the fluents , and there will be r dd " a3,3a 3 .

The values of d , d , and d , are now to be taken in terms of the pair of series obtained in Art .
3o , and substituted in the equation last found .

Now , unless each of these parcels of quantities , as well as their sum , be universally o , this equation will be of no use to us .
And if it can be proved , that the coefficients of the terms in the one series are , each of them , o , then it will follow , that each of the coefficients of the terms in the other series is also = o. But each of the coefficients of the terms in the logarithmic series is = o ; wh-ich may be proved thus : when the like quantities in this series are added together , the first term will vanish ; and the coefficients of the second , third , fourth , fifth , &amp;c. terms ( without the common factor 1 , ) will be 3c - , 4.6 , 5.7y 6.-8 7.9 + 8.10e , &amp;c. respectively ; and the law of continuation is obvious .
But by the law ( see Art .
29 and 30 ; ) which the coefficeients a , C , y , , &amp;c. are known to observe , 3L is -=,.8 Y , - , 2.4 4.6 6.8 -79 = e , &amp;c. ; and therefore , 3v 2.4 = o , 3.5 4.6y o , 5.7y 6.8 ' = o , 7.9k 8.1o =o , &amp;c. The valuie of a , viz. j- , which was discovered in Art .
29 , is found also in the algebraic series , as will presently appear .
For , adding like quantities together , the first term of this series also will vanish ; and the coefficients of the second , third , fourth , fifth , sixth , &amp;c. will be as follows : 143 Coeff of id term 1-ia , sd ( 3.3 ~ i ) B+ i.3A 4+ 6g , 4th + ( 5.-5 ) -.B + 86ioy , 5th ( 7.7 - ) D -+5.7C 12 + 14 ) , 6th + ( 9.9 -~ )E 7.9D + 16S i8E , &amp;c. &amp;c. And , putting each of these coefficients o , ( since the whole series is now known to be = o , ) writing 2.4 for its equal 3.3 i , 4.6 for 5.5 i , 6.8 for 7.7 t , &amp;c. we obtain from these equations x.3 A 41+ 3g 2.4 2+ z.2_ C35 B ?

Thus , by the common application of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S doctrine of fluxions and infinite series , without any assistance 143 144 from , or regard to , LANDEN'S theorem , we have obtained a pair of series for computing the value of d , which converge by the powers of a , and of which we can readily find as many aa terms as we please .
And , by a similar process , ( as was observed in Art .
26 , ) may EULEr 's series for computing the quadrantal arch of an ellipsis be obtained , without any use of FAGNANI 's theorem , or the " tentative methods , " and " ?
strange art/ fices , " as Mr. WOODHoUSE * calls them , which appear in EuLEn 's paper .

If we look back to Art .
18 and 20 of this Paper , we shall find that , when the transverse and conjugate semi-axes of an hyperbola are denoted by i and - , respectively , ( which hyperbola will be similar to that of which the semi-axes are a and i , ) the convergency of the first series , derived from LANDEN'S theorem , will be by the powers of the fraction ai ( -+ a rT t ) ?
i + i(aa + i ) assisted by coefficients .
And the same rate of convergency will obtain in the series given in Art .
e9 , by putting y = , ; for then lu , by which the terms of that series are divided , will be -= + e , e being / aai + 1 : so that , when aa is less than i+ Vaa+ , the terms of the single series will decrease swifter than the terms of the pair of series ; and consequently half as many terms of the former as the latter will give a result equally near the truth .
The two quantities aa and i -+ Vlaa i are equal when aa = 3 ; and hence it appears , that the proper use of the pair of series above found , is , when a is considerably greater t haln g. When a is a large number , about as many terms of the single series as of the pair must be computed to have the results true to the same number of figures ; yet the operation by the pair will be by much the easiest .

It was observed in Art .
12 , that the fluxion there given , of an hyperbolic arch , is as capable of transformation as that which has been commronly used for the rectification of an ellipsis : so also are those which I have used in the Philos. Trans. for 802o , p. 451 and 455 , and from which series converging by the powers of ( e)J &amp;c. may easily be obtained ; but to treat of such1 transformations is not only foreign from ny present design , but would extend this paper to a considerable le)gth .
I shall therefore only point out , by a few examples , the great advantage , in many cases , of computing by descending series , and then conclude .

Example 1 .
The transverse and conjugate semi-axes IDcCCXI .
U of an hyperbola are 7 and 1 , respectively ; it is requiIred to find the lengths of three arches of hich th tt three ordinates are 10 , 2o , and 30 .
Setting aside the circuitous method of rectifying the hyperbola by means of two ellipses , if one was to think of computing these arches by means of a similar hyperbola , and by the theorem ( o ) given in Art .
9 , ( which is a very uselfui ormula within the limits specified in Art .
13 , ) he would quicikly perceive , that the ascending series , by which the value of G is obtained , would converge very slowly ; and therefore would make cloice of some other imethod .
Theorem IV .
in my former tract ( see Philos. Trans. for 80o2 , p. 454 , ) is a very convenient form to be used on this occasio ; n , and is as follows : Retaining the notation used in the beginning of Art .

g2 ; but , since a computation of it was made by two series , in p. 466 , 467 , and 468 of the volume here referred to , the ascending series bei-g = o06360768 , the descending series a5s gi1 7434991s , and their difference , d , = 67 989144 ; we need only to verify that work , which may easily be done by the FormuaIe given in Art .
5 and e7 , thus : denotitg the value of the ascending series crresponding to the ordinlate b by ' , and the value of the descending series corresponding t the same ordinate by S , we have , bi A = .

The rest of the work may stand as follows : wheny is = 10 , then , ( a being 7 , and = Vaa i+--/ o , ) A= H.L. ( v+)- ' .

Hence we have v _ 71o63520 , B= o'ooooooi , sum of the posit .

When y 9o , we ' have A H.L. 0(YY+= o'0499794 , yB ( y+ ) A __ o-oooo45 ; 2Iyy 2 Ooo04 of which two terms the first only is sufficient to give the resuit true to eight places of figures .

When y is30 , the value of A H. L. ( yy is e o032774 ; and since the value , of B ( as appeared in the prec ?

A -oooS3566 , --d= 6S7989144 ; sum 6-8o0,271o ; 1w % It is now obvious that , to obtain the length of any greater arch of this hyperbola , the values of the algebraic quantity e vyy ' + i , and -2 A , the first term of the series , are all that need be computed ; for the value of d , once found , serves for all .
And if seven more arches of this hyperbola , corresponding to the ordinates 4 , 50 , 6o , &amp;c. to loo , were to be computed , this theorem would aflbrd a striking instance of the great utility of descending series .
38 .
A second example might be , to find the lengths of ten arches of an equilateral hyperbola , of which the semi-axis is i , when the ordinates are i , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 1o .
These arches may be computed by the new theorem given in Art .
9 , in which the value of G is always given in ascend-ing series ; but that series , when y is much greater than i , will converge very little faster than the powers of - : whereas , by using the theorem given in the Philos. Trans. for 18o0 , p. 458 , viz. f xu ^ -3 '._ 3_ &amp; c 3 2.32.4.7u7 2.4.6,.Ilu"I 2.4,6.8.15 I5 ( where % denotes the arch of an equilateral hyperbola of which the semi-axis is i , u is = V/ + yyj anddis =-o5g907o2 ; ) the geometrical progressions which will have place in the series , for the respective ordinates , will be the powers of these .

In these examples the use and advantage of descending series appear : more examples of their utility might be given ; and it miglt easily be shown , that there are cases in whichd 1.53 such series have the advantage , even when the ascending series have a good rate of convergency .
I trust , however , that enough has been done , in this Paper to satisfy all candid and competent judges of the matter , that the Rectification of the Hpierbola by means of two Efhlpses is more curious tha sseful ; that the advantage of computing by descending series , is , in many cases , very great ; and that such series will often answer the end of a transformation without the trouble of making it .
