] In the second volume of the Memoirs of the National Institute , M. Bossut announces a theorem relative to the solidity of a sphere similar to Viviani 's , by which quadrable portions of a hemispherical vault are assigned .
M. Bossut withholds the analysis that led him to his result , but mentions that it involves an integration much more complicated than that which occurs in Viviani 's problem .
In the present paper , Mr. Woodhouse furnishes the analysis that leads to the result announced in Bossut 's theorem , and , by a transformation of the co-ordinates of the sphere , arrives at a differential expression , the integration of which does ilot appear more complicated than that employed in the solution of Viviani 's problem .
