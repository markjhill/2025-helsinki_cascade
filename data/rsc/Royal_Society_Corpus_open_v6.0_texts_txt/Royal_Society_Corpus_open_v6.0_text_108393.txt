Introductory Remarks .
THE Roman numerals at the head of the Tables refer to the same stations as in former years .
The gauge at Round Close near Whitehaven has been discontinued , and a new station has been established on the top of Lingmell ( which mountain forms the lower paart of Sca Fell facing the village of Wastdale Head ) , so that the number of instruments is the same as in the year 1848 .
During the spring , summer and autumn , the mountain gauges are emptied on the last day of each month , whatever may be the state of the weather at the time ; but in the winter months , they are of course only examined when accessible , or when the contents are judged to be in a state of partial or entire liquefaction .
These gauges have been frozen up since the end of October last ; and at the close of the year the higher stations were inaccessible from ice and snow .
On the 31st of January , 1850 , the whole of the receivers were brought down into the valley , and their contents liquefied by artificial heat .
In severe winters , like the present , I find it difficult to get parties to attend to these instruments , for almost any pecuniary recompense ; indeed , so great is the risk of fractured limbs , and the sacrifice of life itself , that even the hardy shepherds shrink from the task of ascending such elevated and rugged peaks as Sea Fell Pike and the Gabel , at this season ; and when there is a considerable accumulation of snow on the summits , an occurrence by no means unusual , it is quite impracticable .
On the 31st of January , as the person who has charge of the gauges was ascending the Gabel , with two large empty copper receivers fastened together , his foot slipped and he slided down the precipice , a distance of several hundred yards , but fortunately escaped without any material injury .
The receivers parted company in the descent , and both of them were literally dashed to pieces .
On the same day a shepherd met with a similar accident on Sea Fell , and the injuries he sustained were of so serious a nature as to endanger his life .
regret that my endeavours to obtain the monthly extremes of temperature on the summit of Sca Fell Pike have hitherto failed .
The indications for 1849 are apparently so erroneous , that I cannot place any dependence upon them .
The instruments are slightly inclined in the box , which is riddled with small circular holes , and it is supposed that strong currents of air passing through them have shaken the thermometers , and caused the indices to descend in the tubes .
The instruments are now fastened in the case , and I hope to secure correct readings during the current year .

iii i , i miiW Remarks .
As regards the fall of rain , the years 1848 and 1849 have been of a totally opposite character ; for , whilst 1848 was by much the wettest , the year 1849 is the driest which has occurred since these experiments were begun in the summer of 1844 .
In 1849 , the vales of Seathwaite , Langdale , Gatesgarth , Buttermere and Loweswater , have received less rain than the average of the four previous years by 20*90 inches , 18-85 inches , 24'36 inches , 20-88 inches , and 17-65 inches respectively ; and 35'42 inches , 22-55 inches , 36-46 inches , 27'86 inches and 21'38 inches respectively , less than in the excessively wet year 1848 .
It is a remarkable fact , that whilst from one-fourth to one-seventh less rain than usual has descended in the valleys generally , Wastdale Head has obtained nearly half an inch more than its average quantity* .
It will be observed that the south-west wind has prevailed to an unusual extent in the past year .
The south-west is the predominant wind in nine months of 1849 , and in the other three months it has been the same current which brought the rain .
Now , whereas the valleys in geneial open out towards the noltth-west , the Vale of Wastdale directly faces the south-west , and a cur* The rain was read off and recorded by the same registrar as in former years , and there can be no doubt of the correctness of the returns .
That this instrument must have been attended to with the greatest regularity , is evident from the fact of there having been 236 measurements of rain at Wastdale Head in 1849 , a number considerably exceeding the wet days at any other station , so that the smallest appreciable portions must have been recorded .
154 rent from that quarter flowrs freely up the valley without any intervening object to obstruct its progress ; so that an extraordinary prevalence of south-westerly winds might be expected to increase the amount of rain at Wastdale , and to diminish it in the other valleys ; and vice versed , with a long continuance of north-westerly winds .
Troutbeck , which is similarly situated to Wastdale , has only received about 5 inches , or one-sixteenth less than the average quantity .
The wet days at Wastdale are generally about sixteen more than at Seathwaite , the wettest of the stations ; but in 1849 , they are forty-three in excess , and thirty-one more than have been recorded in any other part of the Lake District .
This may be accounted for from the fact , that the mountains surrounding the Head of Wastdale are both the highest and the nearest to the sea ; their elevated peaks attract the clouds , and occasionally deprive them of the whole of their water ; and such appears to be more particularly the case in dry seasons and periods .
Hence Wastdale is visited with many showers which never reach the more inland valleys .
The increase in the annual depth of rain from this cause is , however , very trifling .
Gatesgarth , which usually obtains about one-fifth more rain than Wastdale , in 1849 has received nearly 10 inches less ; and in the latter half of the exceedingly dry year 1844 , I find that the excess was also in favour of Wastdale .
These abnormal results are evidently the effect of the position or bearing of the respective valleys in regard to the prevalent wind .
Wastdale may be said to receive the south-west wind with open arms ; but , at Gatesgarth , it traverses the narrow valley and its mountain ridges nearly at right angles .
The wettest days in 1849 were the 24th of January and the 24th of October ; on the former there fell 4'30 inches at Seathwaite , and on the latter 4-37 inches at Wastdale Head .
In four days , between the 22nd and 25th of October , the fall at Wastdale was 9'94 inches , and at Seathwaite 10'79 inches .
The average depth of rain in the different valleys throughout the Lake District during the last five years , is as under:inches .

The Flosh is three miles south-east of Whitehaven , and the same distance from the sea in the direction of the mountains .
Cockermouth is about six miles from the nearest part of the coast , and eight miles nearer to the sea than Seathwaite .
Now places situated on the west coast of England are generally warmer than more inland localities ; and , were the whole country a vast plain , the temperature would probably be found to diminish with some regularity in prloporltioni to the distance from the western ocean ; but from the operation of causes referred to in a former paper , the mountain district of Cumberland is an exception to the general fact .
At Seathwaite , the thermometer on the grass has been below the freezing-point in every month of 1849 , except July , when it was 1 ?

The Mountain Gauges.-On the whole , the results are similar to those of the three preceding years , but , as might be looked for in a dry year like the past , the quantities deposited at the various stations are more nearly equal than usual ; in other words , the differences are not so great or striking as obtain in either wet or average periods .
A trifling change in the position of the gauge on Seatollar Common in Borrowdale , has led to some rather startling results , which promise in time to guide us to the proximate cause of the enormous excess of rain in this valley over every other in the Lake country .
It is expected that this gauge ( Seatollar , supposed to be 1300 feet above the sea ) , which has hitherto obtained about one-fifth less , will in future impound quite as much , or even more rain than the noted vale of Borrowdale .
The year 1849 has not enabled me to add any new fact of importance to those already communicated to the Royal Society in reference to this part of the inquiry ; and as the past annual period has evidently been of an anomalous character , I think it better to avoid drawing any inference or conclusion from the results which it has afforded .
I am the more inclined to defer deductions to a future time , from the circumstance of my having been compelled to estimate the heights of some of the mountain stations , which have never been measured ; and because I hope to have an opportunity of taking the altitudes myself in the course of the ensuing summer .
These scanty remarks must therefore be regarded as a mere supplement to the papers previously printed in the Philosophical Transactions .
