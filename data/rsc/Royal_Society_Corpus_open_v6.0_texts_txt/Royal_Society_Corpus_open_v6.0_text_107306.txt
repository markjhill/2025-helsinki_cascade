On the Attractions of an extensive Class of Spheroids .
By J. Ivory , A. M. Communicated by Henry Brougham , Esq. F.R.S. M. P Read November 14 , 811 .
IN this discourse I propose to investigate the attractions of a very extensive class of spheroids , of which the general description is , that they have their radii expressed by rational and integral functions of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere .
Such spheroids may be characterized more precisely in the following manner : conceive a sphere of which the radius is unit , and three planes intersecting one another at right angles in the centre ; from any point in the surface of the sphere draw three perpendicular co-ordinates to the fixed planes , and through the same point in the surface likewise draw a right line from the centre , and cut off from that line a part equal to any rational and integral function of the three co-ordinates : then will the extremity of the part so cut off be a point in the surface of a spheroid of the kind alluded to ; and all the points in the same surface will be determined by making the like construction for every point in the surface of the sphere .
The term of a rational and integral function is not to be strictly confined here to such functions only as consist of a finite number of terms ; it may include infinite serieses , provided they are converging ones ; and it may even be extended to any algebraic expressions that can be expanded into such serieses .
This class of spheroids comprehends the sphere , the ellipsoid , both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution , and an infinite number of other figures , as well such as can be described by the revolving of curves about their axes , as others which cannot be sr generated .
In the second chapter of the third book of the AM !
canique Celeste , LAPLACE has treated of the attractions of spheroids of every kind ; and in particular he has given a very ingenious method for computing the attractive forces of that class which in the ur appr nerly to sph I thei gures approac nearly t spheres .
In studyig that work , I discovered that the learned author had fallen into anl error in the proof of his fundamental theorem ; in consequence of which he has represented his method as applicable to all spheroids whatever , provided they do not differ much from spheres ; whereas in truth , when the error of calculation is corrected , and the demonstration made rigorous , his analysis is confined exclusively to that particular kind , described above , which it is proposed to make the subject of this discourse .
I have already treated of this matter in a separate paper , in which I have pointed out the source of LAPLACE'S mistake , and likewise have strictly demonstrated his method for the instances that properly fall within its scope .
In farther considering the same subject , it occurred to me that the investigation in the second chapter of the third book of the Mecanique Celeste , however skilfully and ingeniously conceived , is nevertheless indirect , and is besides liable to another objection of still greater weight ; it does not exhibit the several terms of the series for the attractive foree in separate and independent expressions : it only points out in what manner they may be derived successively , one after another ; in so much that the terms of the series near the beginning cannot be found without previously computing all the rest .
This remark gave occasion to the following paper , in which it is my design to give a solution of the problem which is not chargeable with the imperfections just mentioned : the analysis is direct , and every term of the series for the attractive force is deduced immediately from the radius of the spheroid .
As the ellipsoid , which comprehends both sorts of elliptical spheroids of revolution , falls within the class of figures here treated of , I have derived , as a corollary from my investigation , the formulas for the attractions of that figure which are required in the theory of the earth : this paper therefore will contain all that is useful on the subject of the attractions of spheroids , as far as our knowledge at present extends , deduced by one uniform mode of analysis .
Having mentioned the principal object of this discourse , I must likewise notice a subordinate purpose I have in view ; it is to put in a clear light the real grounds of LAPLACE'S method , and of the equivalent method delivered in the following pages ; to the accomplishment of which nothing is likely to contribute so much , as a direct and rigorous analysis perspicuously conducted .
To promote the same end still farther , by preserving greater order and perspicuity in treating a subject in its own nature very complicated , this paper will be divided into two principal sections : in the first section it is proposed 48 to lay down the analyticali propositions on which the investigation is founded::the seen section will contain the solution of the probiLem : under consideration .
One more preliminary observation it is proper to add .
The problern of attractions 'contains two ca.ses ; when the density of the attracting body is uniform throughoult ; when it varies according to any given law : it is in the first of these two cases that the chief difficulties 'occur ; and as I have nothing new to add on the second case , I shall here confine my attention to homogeneous spheroids , unit being supposed to denote the density .

Instead of seeking immediately the attraction of a spheroid in any proposed direction , it will be more advantageous to investigate ( as LAPLACE has done ) the value of the expression ( to be henceforth denoted by V ) which is the sum of the quotients produced by dividing all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid by their respective distances from the attracted point .
For such is the nature of the analytical expression now mentioned , that if it be first transformed into a function of three rectangular co-ordinates one of which is parallel to a line given by position , and the fluxion with regard to this co-ordinate be taken ; the coefficient of the partial fluxion after its sign is changed , will denote the attractive force which acts parallel to the given line .
In order to demonstrate this property of the function V , we shall suppose that x , y , z denote the co-ordinates of the molecule dM , and a , b , c , the co-ordinates of the attracted point : then dM a }(a(b ; y)+ ( cczy ) the fluent being understood to be extended to all the molecules of the mass of the spheroid : now if the fluxion of this expression be taken , making a the only variable , we shall have d vl. .
( a-.- .
dM\da iJ ( C x ) t ) 2+ ^J + ( b-y)2+ 3 : wshere the expression on the right hand side is the attractive force parallel to a , as will readily appear by decomposing the direct attractions of all the molecules into the partial attractions parallel to the co-ordinates .
But , besides enabling us to find the attractive force in any proposed direction , the function V has another advantage ; for it is this function , and not the expressions of the attractive forces , which enters into the equation of the surface of a body , wholly or partly fluid , in a state of equilibrium.* The expression for V , exhibited above is not of a commodious form , and on this account it becomes necessary to transform it .
Let x-R ' cos. 0 ' ; y=R sin. 0 ' cos. ' ; and z -R sin. 6 ' sin. ' ; then will R ' be the line drawn from the molecule dM to the origin of the co-ordinates ; 0 ' will be the angle which R ' makes with the axis of x ; and w ' the angle which the projection of R ' upon the plane to which x is perpendicular , makes with a line given by position in the same plane : from the assumed values of x , y , z , it is easy to derive these new values , viz. xR ' cos. 0'= v-R-y'- , z1 y == ' sin. 0 ' cos. = ' = V/ R ; sin.

When the attracted point is without the surface , the expression for V , in order to embrace the whole mass of the spheroid , must be integrated from R ' = o , to R ' = R , R denoting what R ' becomes at the surface ; from ig ' 1 to -'= i ; and from '-= o to w ' = 2r : , Lir being the circumference when the radius is unit .
In this case V must , be reduced into a series containingg the descending powers of r , which we may thus represent , viz. B( ?

Q(i ) , which may be found by means of the analytical formulas in the first part of this discourse , as we now proceed to show .
In the first place , when y is a rational and integral function of vs only without ' , which will be the case in spheroids of revolution : substitute for Q(i ) its developement in No. 5 , writing '-for 9 ; integrate from t'-= o to 2z'= 2r , observing that the fluents of all the terms which contain the cosines of ; s are of the same magnitude at both the limits , and therefore they will add nothing to the value of the integral taken between these limits : then we shall have simply jffy'.d d.

In order to find the part of the integral resulting from the genleral term , we must multiply that term into the expansion of Q(i investigated in No. 5 ; and in combining these two expressions we may omit all the terms which , after multiplication , would contain the sines and cosines of the multiples of it ; because these , when they are integrated with regard to dV ' , will be of the same value at both the limits , on which account they will produce nothing in the value of the integral : this being observed , the only term of Q(i ) which it is necessary to retain is that one containing cos. n ( i'--r ) , which may be thus written , 68 Zl ' dnC(i ) dnC , ( i ) I 1 ' , ( cosl--)5 .

( 6 ) The formulas ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) enable us to compute the attractions of homogeneous spheroids on a point without or within the surface ; and , for a point in the surface , we may make use of either series , observing to put r= a in all the terms multiplied by a , and r =a .
( l + a.y ) in the rest .
Wheny ' is a finite function , the two expressions for V will both stop .
It would be easy to deduce from hence the attractions of heterogeneous spheroids ; but having nothing new to offer on this head , I shall refer the reader to LAPLACE'S work , No. 14 , Chap. 2 , Liv .

The two serieses marked ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) will be found to be entirely equivalent to the formulas ( 3)* and ( 4)t which LAPLACE has given in the second chapter of the third book of ai+3 ihe Mecanique Celeste : for in effect the coefficient of a. a , in two of the serieses ; and the coefficient of .
T in the a other two , are only different expressions of the same integral ffy ' .

Q( ) , the symbol y ' being always understood to denote a rational and integral function of three rectangular co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere .
In point of result therefore the two methods are one and the same , and the solutions they furnish are both applicable in the same circumrstances .
Neither of them can be of use , unless the radius of the spheroid be first reduced into such a function as y ' is supposed to denote .
The one solution can claim no preference No -x i. t No. 173 .
to the other , except:i decin g the same conclusion with greater clearness and expressing it with greater simplicity , and in a form better fitted to fulfil the views of the analyst .
In these respects it can hardly be denied that the procedure delivered in the preceding pages has some advantages above that of the author of the Mecanique Celeste .
The analysis here given is direct ; and it exhibits the several coefficients in separate and independent expressions derived immediately from the radius of the : spheroid .
On the other hand LAPLACE'S investigation is indirect ; and the coefficients are:found successively by decomposing the radius of the spheroid into a series of parts which follow a known law .
If we now compare the two methods with respect to the grounds on which the investigations are founded we shall not find the same agreement between them .
In this paper it is admitted as a necessary hypothesis , that the radius of the spheroid must be a rational and integral function of three co-ordinates of a point in the surface of a sphere : and , in consequence , the result of the analysis is limited to spheroids of that description .
LAPLACE , grounding his investigation on a property which , according to his demonstration , belongs to all spheroids that differ little from spheres , seems to prove that the radius of such a spheroid cannot be an arbitrary expression , and in this inference it is necessarily implied that the radius must be such a function as we have supposed it to be.* What in the one olution is assumed as a necessary hypothesis without which the investigation will not succeed , in the other , is derived as a necessary consequence of a more general supposition .
Here then the two methods are so much at variance , that if one be rigorous and exact , the other cannot be exculpated from the charge of erroneous or insufficient reasoning .
This contradiction between the preceding analysis and the procedure of LAPLACE is entirely consonant to the conclusions obtained in my former paper alluded to in the beginning of this discourse ; and the origin of it is to be sought for in the error I there pointed out in the investigation of that geometer .
It cannot be denied that an error of calculation does exist in the demonstration of the theorem on which that author 's method is grounded : his reasoning is therefore imperfect and inconclusive ; and the inferences he has drawn from it cannot be supported in opposition to a rigorous analysis .

The same procedure which has been applied to approximate to the attractions of spheroids cdiffering little from spheres , may likewise be employed to find accurate expressions in serieses of the attractive forces of any spheroid , provided the radius of it be such a function as the analysis requires .
In both cases the research turns upon the same sort of integrals .

The same process will apply when the attracted point is within the surface .

To complete the plan of this discourse , it remains that we apply the theory laid down in it to the case of the ellipsoid .
Let the semi'axes be k , kt kt " the first being the least of all the-three ; and let x , y , z , respectively parallel to the same axes , be three co-ordinates of a point in the surface : then will the equation of the solid be k'x + kIcZ +n V : put x= R( ' ; y =R .

nothing ( No. 4 ) .
Therefore all the terms are evanescent when i is odd .
Again I say that all the terms are evanescent when/ i is even , , -2 except when it is 2 .
For in this case sz will be an integer power , and it will contain a finite number of terms which may be generally presenteds thus , viz. -tA )2 , MM cos. m ; M( ' " being a rational and integral function of W : and this quantity when combined with the developement of Q(0 , will produce one term , r and : only one , clear of sines and cosines , viz. " .
) ^~dC(2 0 fyrs2n ) * d2C ) M(n ) d n. now since Is is the greatest power in s , the greatest power in sT will be Vtz ; therefore ( i-i , ' ) .
M( .
cannot contain any power of ' greater than i2- , nor M( " ) any greater than i-en--2 .
, which number the dimensions of M( ) cannot pass : but i--n , greater than i-2-n-2 , denotes the diInensions of d 2C( : therefore , by a property of this sort of integrals already demonstrated ( No. 4 ) , the preceding quantity is evanescent .
Therefore all those terms of the series areevanescent in which i is an even number ; but from this the case of i = , when the term assumes a particular form , must be excepted .
If now we reject all the terms that have been proved to be evanescent , we shall have , for a point within or in the surface 'af the ellipsoid , 7 = ---t +Tf flog .

If we suppose k to denote the axis of the greater ellipsoid , and put h for the corresponding , axis of the smaller one ; then the value of V relatively to the latter solid will be found merely by changing k into hI in the last expression ; be cause s contains no quantities but such as are common to the two solids : therefore the value of V , relatively , to the shell of matter included between the two surfaces , will be equal to k-bpf d ' da quantity which is independenton the position of the attracted point : therefore the differential coefficients of V for any coordinates of the attracted point are evanescent ; and consequently so are the attractive forces parallel to the co-ordinates ( No. 6 ) .
Therefore a material point with-in such a shell is attracted equally in opposite directions .
