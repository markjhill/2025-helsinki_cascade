The importance of fertility as a factor in the survival of a species is admirably demonstrated by Hafkine , * whilst Professor Karl Pearsonf shows that fertility when correlated with other characteristics works a progressive change , and that not only is fertility a race characteristic , but may be a class characteristic in the human species .
Among domesticated animals , although fertility may be a racial characteristic , its importance may be much reduced from a variety of circumstances .
Among sheep there is undoubted evidence of the racial character of fertility , but the quality of the wool or the value of fat sheep of a particular breed may render that breed worth keeping in spite of a low rate of fertility as compared with other breeds .
Then the rate of fertility may be artificially increased , as when certain rams of undoubted value as progenitors , but useless as breeders if left to themselves , become valuable sires by the help of the shepherd .
In the same way a certain breed of sheep , kept in one district and managed in a particular manner , may be more liable to abortion , or to barrenness , or to mortality among the lambs , than the same breed in another district managed in another way , and yet the former may , on account of the supply of food which it is possible to grow there per acre , prove the most remunerative .
From these and many other similar reasons the survival of a particular breed or its retention in , or importation to , a particular district is not necessarily due to natural fitness or adaptability .

wider knowledge of the racial character of fertility among sheep might exercise considerable influence on the survival of certain breeds in the future .
Just as the number of Long-horn cattle is rapidly becoming reduced in this country on account of the length of time they require to come to maturity and fatten , so the low fertility of Southdowns if it cannot be increased may lead to the retention , of that breed in the hands of only a few special breeders .
The following account is a brief abstract of information obtained from 397 sheep breeders who have supplied me with records of flocks containing 122,673 ewes for the breeding season of 1896-97 .
Table IV records certain particulars of eight pure breeds separately , and of ten pure breeds jointly ( " Various Pure Breeds " ; details of only a small number of flocks were supplied for each of these ten breeds ) .
These are totalled , particulars of fifty-nine flocks of various cross-bred sheep subjoined , and the totals for all breeds finally arrived at .
Besides the figures contained in Table IY , other statistics were supplied regarding the age of rams and ewes , the size of breeding flocks , the proportions of rams and ewes therein , the usual and the highest percentages of barrenness experienced , \amp ; c. To this were added remarks on the food given to rams and ewes at specified times , on their condition during the breeding season , on various methods of management of breeding flocks , and on numerous views regarding matters which are supposed to influence fertility , abortion , and barrenness amongst ewes ; finally particulars of districts , subsoils , and weather were noted , and the subject considered statistically from all these various points of view for each breed .
The variation in the numbers of flocks and of ewes concerned in the various calculations for each breed ( see Table IY ) is due to the inability of all flock-masters to supply the whole of the information asked for in the schedule , which , by the kindness of the Royal Agricultural Society , was distributed to them , and is not due to my selection of flocks .
Fertility .
It is to be noted the number of lambs returned does not always represent the number born ; that information , although asked for , was not always forthcoming and sometimes the number of lambs alive when the schedule was filled up was given instead .
The percentage of twins given is , however , a check on this element of .error , and in the following account the columns under " lambs " and " twins , " Table IY , are considered together .
The error is most apparent in the Hampshire Down , Oxford Down , Dorset Horn and Lincoln breeds ; in the other four breeds , in which the records have been most carefully kept , the Suffolk , Shropshire , Kent and Southdown breeds , their fertility is demonstrated to be a racial character .
Oil the Fertility of different Breeds of Sheep , tfc .
101 The Suffolk breed is by far the most fertile , while the Southdowns are at the bottom of the list : the value of the former as a prolific breed is incontrovertible , while the record of the latter , as shown both by Idie percentage of twins and lambs , is so low as to suggest cause for some anxiety and to show urgent need for close attention on the part of breeders .
The Hampshire breed also stands low both with regard to twins and lambs , especially when its low percentage of loss from abortion and barrenness is considered ; whereas the Lincoln breed , although recording only 111T per cent , of lambs , shows 29*09 per cent , of ewes bearing twins , and the fault , with this breed , is obviously not so much low fertility as heavy mortality among lambs and a high percentage of loss from abortion and barrenness .
The most fertile of all pure breeds of which I have records , is the Wensleydale breed , in which six flocks with a total of 319 ewes produce 177*43 per cent , of lambs ( included in " Various Pure Breeds " ) .
It is to be noted that both Wensleydale and Suffolk ewes when covered by rams of other breeds , do not appear to produce a larger percentage of lambs than they produce when covered by rams of their own breed ; if anything , they seem to produce a somewhat smaller percentage of lambs .
On the other hand , Dorset Horn ewes are more usually fertile and are more prolific with Down rams than with Dorset Horn rams .
It is a very usual practice with Dorset Horn flock-masters to keep a Down ram to cover those ewes which fail to become pregnant to a Dorset Horn ram , and , when pure-bred ewes are discarded from their breeding flocks , they generally sell them " in young " to Down rams , when they frequently produce as many as 170 per cent , of lambs .
It appears , therefore , that whereas the fertility of Suffolk and Wensleydale ewes is at its maximum when they breed to rams of their own kind , Dorset Horn ewes require to be covered by rams of another breed , in order that they may be stimulated to the greatest generative activity .
Apart from the percentage of ewes which abort or are barren from accident or constitutional defects , the fertility of ewes is chiefly affected by their condition and by the condition of the ram at tupping time .
I have overwelming evidence that flocks in strong condition at tupping time produce a higher percentage of lambs than flocks in poor condition at that period ( Suffolk , Kent , Hampshire , Dorset Horn , and Lincoln breeds ) ; on the other hand , fat rams and ewes are associated with a high percentage of barrenness , and not with a high percentage of lambs .
In close connection with this subject is the production of twins .
Fifty-five per cent , of the flock-masters who send information on this head , report that twins are usually born early in the lambing season , and many of them add that otherwise the crop of lambs is small .
That 102 Mr. W. Heap .
is to say , that most twins are produced by the ewes which first come in season , and I interpret that to mean that it is the ewes with the most active and most vigorous generative system , those which are in strong breeding condition at that time , which bear the most twins .
It is of interest to note that among Southdown and Hampshire flocks , a comparatively small proportion of twins are born .
early in the lambing season , and these breeds produce the smallest percentage of twins .
The effect of locality upon the fertility of a breed is worthy of consideration , and statistics are given in Table V to illustrate this point.* In considering these figures , numerous other important influences must be borne in mind , which the information at my disposal makes it impossible to dissociate from locality ; and in all cases , except those of the Shropshire and Lincoln breeds , where a wide difference in fertility is shown in different districts , it is possible that the variation in fertility may be due to one or other or all of these various influences , apart altogether from locality .
The fertility of a flock is greatly influenced by its management and by the conditions under which it lives ; the condition , kind , and amount of food available before tupping time will affect the condition of the ewes and the percentage of twins subsequently born ; the season may be more favourable for tupping or for lambing in one district than in another ; cold , rain , or want of rain , will affect the feed , the ground , and the ewes themselves ; while , owing to mortality among ewes during lambing or at other times in the preceding year , the flocks in one district may consist of a larger proportion of shearling ewes than the flocks in another district , and this may affect the birth rate of a flock .
These and numerous other such influences , combined with the undue proportionate value of excessive loss or fertility in one flock , where only a few are kept in a district , is sufficient to account for a much greater variation than is shown for most breeds in Table V. At the same time the difference in fertility of Shropshire flocks kept in Staffordshire , as compared with other flocks of the same breed kept elsewhere , and of Lincoln flocks kept in'Yorkshire , as compared with those kept in the home county , is very remarkable .
They certainly suggest that Yorkshire is a more satisfactory habitat for the Lincoln breed than is the home county , and although it is quite possible the method of farming and other influences , in Lincolnshire , are responsible for some of the difference , they can hardly be responsible for all of it .
I do not believe that the high percentage of loss in the Lincolnshire wold flocks is due altogether to mismanagement , but if 50 per cent , of the difference between the losses of the wold flocks and the Yorkshire flocks was added to the percentage of twins of the former , there would still be a difference of 17 per cent , of twins in favour of the Yorkshire # See " Percentage of Twins .
" On the Fertility of different Breeds of Sheep , fc .
flocks .
So also with the Shropshire breed in Staffordshire and the home county , if 50 per cent , of the difference between the losses was added to the percentage of twins in the home county , they would still have 12 per cent , less than the Staffordshire flocks , and it is not probable that a different method of farming in these two neighbouring districts can account for such difference in fertility .
The returns of the Suffolk flocks in Essex are misleading , inasmuch as some of the flocks with the highest percentage of lambs do not show the percentage of twins ; at the same time I am disposed to think that Essex is not so favourable a county as Suffolk for this breed of sheep .
The difference in the return of lambs for Southdowns in East Anglia and in the South , is probably due to the more careful recoids which the smaller size of the flocks and the method of farming in East Anglia allows , and I suspect the difference in the percentage of twins may be similarly accounted for .
In neither of the cases where different breeds are represented in the same locality , does the percentage of twins of the foreign flocks approach that of the home breed .
Southdowns do not approach the fertility of Suffolks in East Anglia , nor do Hampshires become as fertile as Dorset Horns in the West country .
The Suffolks , Hampshires , and Dorset Horns are most fertile in their home districts j in the case of the Shropshire breed , Staffordshire may be considered a part of the home district ; and only in the case of the Lincolns is it demonstrated that any breed thrives better in a foreign district than at home .
This was to be expected , for it can hardly be doubted that natural selection , as well as artificial selection , has been at work on the different breeds of sheep in this country .
In the case of the Lincoln breed it is of interest to note , in this connection , that the method of farming in some parts of Lincolnshire has greatly altered in modern times ; for instance , the facility which the soil on the wolds affords to grow especially fine crops of roots , enables the flock-masters in that district to keep more sheep per acre than is possible on the low-lying farms ; this leads to crowding and to other even more artificial conditions which , as the statistics indicate , are not favourable to the fertility of the breed ; on the other hand several of the more successful flocks in Yorkshire are run on grass chiefly and under more natural conditions for sheep .
The variation in fertility in different districts does not , however , affect the racial character of the fertility of the different breeds ( compare Tables IY and Y\#151 ; " Per cent , of Twins " ) , except in the case of the Lincolns , where the returns of the Yorkshire flocks suggest that this breed should be placed in the first rank with the Suffolks and Shropshires , instead of in the second rank with Dorset Horns , Oxford Downs , and Kents .
The position of the Southdowns at the bottom of the list remains unaltered .
Mr. W. Heap .
While the percentage of lambs and of twins in cross-bred flocks is greater than the same percentage for the total pure-bred flocks , the ewes of certain pure breeds are undoubtedly more fertile than the average cross-bred ewe .
The flock percentage of lambs in 306 pure-bred flocks , ranges from 203-8 to 59-09 per cent. , the percentage for 89,370 ewes being 120-4 per cent. The most frequent percentage in these 306 flocks is between 110 and 120 per cent. ; the following Table ( I ) shows this , and as the column for " under 110 per cent. " includes all failures , the excess in the 110 per cent , column is all the more marked .
There are more flocks of between 100 and 200 ewes than of any other number , and it is in these flocks the highest percentage of lambs occur ; broadly speaking , the frequency of a high percentage of lambs , and the height of that percentage , vary in proportion to the number of flocks and to their size .
Abolition and Barrenness .
There is an element of error in these statistics , due to the fact that some ewes abort at an early stage of gestation , when the foetus is small and the circumstance liable to be overlooked by the shepherd \ some of these ewes come " in use " again and are again served by the ram , but some do not again come " in use , " or , owing to the fact that they have already been drafted into a flock without a ram , they are not again covered ; in either of these cases they are put down as barren .
Thus , although I do not believe the error is a great one , the percentage of abortion in ewes may be higher and the percentage of barrenness lower than is represented in Table IY .
The total loss from both these causes amounts to 7T per cent , for all pure-bred ewes ' of these the Lincoln sheep suffer the most ( 12 per cent. ) and the Hampshires the least ( 4"01 per cent. ) , a very startling difference and of specially grave significance to Lincolnshire flock-masters on the wolds ( see Table V ) .
A bortion .
In 300 pure-bred flocks the percentage of abortion varies from 23-75 per cent , to 0 , while the percentage for 85,878 ewes is 2*39 .
The Dorset Horn ( 4-11 per cent. ) and the Lincoln ( 4 per cent. ) breeds suffer most , while all other breeds except Southdowns have less than 2 per cent. The causes which induce a high percentage of abortion are little understood , and severe losses are from time to time experienced from no known cause ( Lincolns 20 to 30 per cent , and Dorset Horns ) .
Statistics supplied indicate , that an undue proportion of shearling Table I.\#151 ; Total Pure-bred Flocks .

Mr. W. Heap .
ewes in a flock is associated with a high percentage of abortion ( Lincolns ) , and that ewes of a particular breed run on certain subsoils or in certain districts are more liable to abortion than the average for ' that breed , as , for instance , Lincolns run on the wolds and Hampshire** on oolite formation .
In some parts of Lincolnshire abortion sometimes approaches , if it does not actually assume , an epidemic form ; at such times several neighbouring flocks may experience between 30 and 40 per cent , of aborted ewes ; I am unaware of a similar form of abortion in any other-district .
Unsuitable food , causirrg indigestion and intestinal irritation , and poor food , resulting in poor nutrition , are probably responsible for the greatest proportion of abortion in ewes .
It is not the kind of food , as is frequently supposed , but the condition of that food which is at fault , and , as a result , my schedules show that poor condition of ewes during gestation is undoubtedly associated with a relatively high percentage of abortion .
The highly artificial conditions under which sheep are kept in many districts in this country , renders the question of the most suitable food for breeding ewes a very important question , and it is one regarding which but little attention has been paid .
The most frequent percentage of abortion experienced in 300 purebred flocks is shown in Table II to be under 1 per cent. The highest percentage is relatively more frequent in large than in small flocks , and this table shows that much more irregularity is experienced in abortion than Table I shows is the case for fertility .
Barrenness .
In 327 flocks of pure-bred ewes the percentage of barrenness varies from 51'42 per cent , to 0 , while the percentage for 96,520 ewes is 4'7l .
The Lincoln ( 8 per cent. ) and the Shropshire ( 6*06 per cent. ) breeds suffer the most , while , with the exception of Hampshire Downs , Dorset Horns , and Suffolks , no pure breeds record less than 5 per cent , loss from this cause .
The district or subsoil on which ewes are run is associated , in certain breeds , with the proportion of barrenness experienced : thus , Lincoln sheep run on the wolds , Shropshire sheep on new red sandstone subsoil , and Hampshire sheep elsewhere than on chalk downs , are associated statistically with a relatively high percentage of barrenness ; an excessive proportion of shearling ewes in a flock is also frequently found associated with a high percentage of barrenness ; but the quality of the food given and the condition of the rams and ewes at tupping time is no doubt the chief factor which influences the barrenness percentage .
Fat is well described as an enemy to fruitfulness , while the want of Table II.\#151 ; Total Pure-bred Flocks.\#151 ; Abortion .

Ill sufficiently nutritious food also results in poor returns of lambs .
Among Suffolk and Shropshire ewes , which are highly fed as a rule , a hi oh percentage of barrenness occurs in cases where they are excessively highly fed ; on the other hand , among Dorset Horn , Lincoln , and Kent ewes , which are certainly not too highly fed as a rule at tupping time , the highest percentage of barrenness occurs among the poorest kept flocks . . .
oof7 The most frequent percentage of barrenness experienced m 32/ flocks is 1 to 2 per cent. , but , as Table III shows , the returns are much more irregular than was the case for abortion , and there is a much larger proportion of flocks in the " 10 per cent , and ovei column .
The slightly excessive proportion of flocks in the 5 per cent , column ' suggests generalised results rather than accurate returns , but the number of flock-masters who are responsible for this is obviously very small .
In conclusion:\#151 ; 1 Whereas the total loss from abortion and barrenness is fairly constant for most pure breeds of sheep , the Suffolks and Hampshires are markedly free from , and the Lincolns markedly liable to , heavy loss from *ttl6SG C3^riS6S 2 .
Although the loss from the above causes does exert an influence on the returns of fertility of the various breeds , it does not account for the wide variation which exists in this respect .

The ewes of certain pure breeds are conspicuously more fertile than the average cross-bred ewe ; and 4 .
The fertility of certain pure breeds is sufficiently marked to constitute a racial characteristic .

Communicated by Dr. D. Gill , C.B. , F.R.S. Received March 13 , \#151 ; Read April 20 , 1899 .
Since my communication* to the Royal Society of London , by Professor Thomas R. Frazer , I have been able to obtain valuable addi * The conclusions arrived at in that communication ( received June 6 , 1898 ) were as follows 1 .
The blood of animals , themselves healthy , from a red-water area is dangerous if inoculated into an animal which suffers coincidentally from another disease .
2 .
That the blood of animals suffering from mild or modified red-water may be safely used to inoculate a healthy animal subcutaneously , but is dangerous when injected into a vein .
3 .
That the subcutaneous inoculation t of mild or modified red-water blood conveys a mild form of the disease , and since the blood of such an animal is vimVOL .
