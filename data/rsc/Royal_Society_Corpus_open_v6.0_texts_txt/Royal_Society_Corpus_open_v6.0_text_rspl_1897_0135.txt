few exceptions all frozen electrolytes would , in all probability , if reduced to temperatures not far above the absolute zero , have their dielectric constants approximately equal , and reduce to a value not far from 2 or 3 .
At the same time the electric resistivity of such frozen electrolytes would tend to become infinite as the temperature is continuously reduced .
In the very great labour of taking and reducing the above numerous observations , Mr. J. E. Petavel has rendered us much valuable service .

( Abstract .
) Charles Darwin was the first to point out the great importance of the study of the nature and causes of variation .
Since his time , two methods of investigation have been adopted ; in the one the obvious and strongly pronounced variations are selected and the probability of species having been derived from such " sports " is analysed and discussed .
According to the second method a population of a species is taken , and the condition of the organs in each individual is determined .
It is believed that this latter statistical method will lead to more accurate ideas as to the causes of var iation and as to the part which variation has played in the origin of species .
As in all other scientific investigations , the course pursued by statistical inquiry is , firstly , to record facts , and , secondly , to generalise from the facts .
The facts consist oi the nature of the
