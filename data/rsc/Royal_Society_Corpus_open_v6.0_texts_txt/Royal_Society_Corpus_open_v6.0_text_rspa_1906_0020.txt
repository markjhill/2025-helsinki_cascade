Introduction .
It has been shown by Curie and Danne* that the rate of decay of radium C can be altered by subjecting it to temperatures above 630 ' C. The rate of decay increases with rise of temperature , reaching a maximum at about 1100 ' C. , after which it again decreases up to 1300 ' C. The following are some of the values taken from their paper :\#151 ; Temperature centigrade .

L. Bronsonf has more recently made some experiments on the same subject , and is led to the opposite conclusion .
He states that the heating of the active deposit from radium emanation to temperatures between 700 ' and 1100 ' C. is without effect , and to explain both his results and those of Curie and Danne , he suggests that radium C has a shorter instead of a longer period than radium B , and that the latter is the more volatile of the two ; part of the radium B is , however , in general supposed to have remained on his wires after heating .
In view of the conflicting evidence on the subject , it seemed desirable that further experiments on this important question should be undertaken .
The following is an account of an investigation on the influence of temperature on the activity of radium emanation when in radio-active equilibrium with * 'Comptes Rendus , ' vol. 138 , pp. 748-751 , March , 1904 .

On the Effect of [ Dec. 22 , radium A , B , and C , and when sealed up in a quartz tube so that there can have been no possibility of the escape of any volatile product .
The results show clearly that the activity as measured by the / 3 and 7 rays can be changed by high temperatures , the observed effects being consistent with the explanation offered by Curie and Danne , that the rate of decay of radium C is increased by high temperatures .
The experiments do not , however , prove that it is this particular product which is affected , as the results could be equally well explained if one or more of the other radio-active bodies present underwent some alteration .
Further experiments will be necessary before this question can be definitely settled , but there can be no doubt that the rate of decay of one of the products is affected by temperature .

Experimental Method .
The emanation from about 5 milligrammes of radium bromide was collected in a small quartz tube 12 cm .
long and 0*5 cm .
diameter , closed at one end .
The open end was connected to the bulb containing the radium , 'and the whole apparatus was evacuated , to allow the emanation to diffuse rapidly .
The emanation was condensed in the tube by immersing it in liquid air , and sufficient air was admitted to cause the pressure inside the quartz-tube to be about atmospheric when raised to the highest temperatures subsequently to be used .
The quartz-tube was then sealed off in an oxyhydrogen blow-pipe at a constriction near its upper end , and removed from the liquid air bath .
Its radio-activity was tested by measuring the ionisation produced in a cylindrical metal vessel Y ( fig. 1 ) when the quartz-tube was placed on a Fig. 1 .
Earth small wooden stand in the position shown in the figure .
The sides of the quartz-tube and the bottom of the vessel Y were together thick enough to absorb all the a rays coming from the emanation , but thin enough to let through a considerable portion of the ^8-rays and most of the 7-rays .

] High Temperatures on Radium Emanation .
Observations of the ionisation in V therefore afforded a measure of the quantity of radium C present in the quartz-tube , since this is the only radio-active product which emits these rays in sufficient quantity to be of consequence .
A saturation current was obtained from 200 small storage cells , and the measurements were made by means of a Dolezalek electrometer .
It was found that the quartz-tube could be removed from its stand and replaced so nearly in the same position that the ionisation in Y did not change by an appreciable amount .
After leaving sufficient time for radio-active equilibrium to be * established , the activity was measured .
The quartz-tube was then placed in an electric furnace and heated to a high temperature for a definite time , the activity being again tested as soon as possible after the removal of the quartz-tube from the furnace .

First Series of Experiments .
In these experiments a carbon-tube furnace of the kind described by Hutton and Patterson* was used .
No accurate measurements of temperature were made in this series of experiments , but the maximum temperature attained was estimated by placing wires of different metals in the furnace on either side of the quartz-tube , and noting which were fused .
Details of the experiments are given in Table I. The results are also shown graphically in fig. 2 , in which the ordinates represent , in arbitrary units , the radio-activity of the emanation , and the abscissae give time in hours .
The zero of time is taken at the moment of sealing of the quartz-tube .
The points on the curve represent the means of several observations taken within a few minutes of each other , and the points A , B , C , D , E the times at which the quartz-tube was heated .

It will , however , be noticed that the activity always fell temporarily after heating the emanation , the activity recovering to its normal value in about one hour .
The latter point is of importance , as\#171 ; the observed decrease of activity might otherwise be supposed due to the porosity of the quartz when hot to the emanation ; but this would leave unexplained the subsequent recovery of the activity to its normal value .

Second Series of Experiments .
As a result of the frequent heating in a carbon furnace , the quartz-tube used in the previous experiments crystallised and fell to pieces .
A new and similar tube was therefore made , with which the following series of experiments was performed .
The method was the same as in the first series , except that a small porcelain-tube furnace , heated by the passage of an 1905 .
] High Temperatures on Radium Emanation .
245 electric current through a- nickel wire wound on it , was substituted for the carbon-tube furnace .
The furnace was similar to those used by Dr. Harker at the National Physical Laboratory .
Besides the fact that under these conditions the quartz-tube showed less tendency to crystallise , the advantage of the change consisted in the fact that the quartz-tube could be introduced into the furnace when a steady temperature had been reached , and could be quickly withdrawn while hot , and its activity measured within a few minutes after removal .
Furthermore , the furnace temperatures were measured by a platinum platinum-rhodium thermo-couple standardised at the Reichsanstalt .
The temperature of the furnace was very uniform , and remained constant to , about 20 ' C. during an experiment .
The observations are given in Table II .
, and shown graphically in fig. 3 .
The general character of the results is similar to that obtained in the first series .
The change in activity increases with rise of temperature , being small at 1000 ' C. and increasing up to 1200 ' C. If the results are to o explained on the view expressed by Curie and Danne , the maximum change of activity should occur at 1100 ' C. , and heating to a higher temperature should have less effect .
This does not appear to be the case if the estimates of the temperatures in the first series of experiments can be trusted .
Accurate measurements above 1200 ' C. will shortly be undertaken with a view to settling the question .
The observations D , E , E were made after heating the quartz-tube to nearly the same temperature .
Heating for 10 minutes produced little , if any , effect , which certainly did not persist for more than a few minutes .
Heating for two hours was , however , no more effective than heating for one hour .
This is just what would be expected if it is the radium C which is affected .

Summary of Results .
( 1 ) The activity of radium emanation in radio-active equilibrium with its products A , B , and C , is changed by heating above 1000 ' C. ( 2 ) The effect increases with the temperature up to 1200 ' C. , and possibly beyond this temperature .
( 3 ) The effect increases with the time of heating for about the first hour , but subsequent heating is without effect .
Polarisation in Secondary Rontgen Radiation .
247 In conclusion , I have to thank Professor Schuster for lending me the radium used in these experiments .
To Dr. Hutton I am indebted for the kind way in which he placed his electric furnaces at my disposal , and for his advice as to the best methods of obtaining the temperatures required .

) In a paper on " Polarised Rontgen Radiation , " * the writer gave an account of experiments which demonstrated the partial polarisation of a beam of X-rays proceeding from the antikathode of an X-ray focus-tube , and verified the theory previously givenf of the production of secondary X-rays in light substances .
: } : In that paper it was shown that the secondary radiation proceeding in a direction perpendicular to that of propagation of the primary radiation from certain substances placed in that primary beam should , according to the theory put forward , be plane polarised .
From gases , however , the secondary radiation was not sufficiently intense to produce a tertiary of measurable intensity , and thus the polarisation of the secondary from them was not verifiable .
On the other hand , though heavy metals were found to emit secondary radiation of sufficient intensity and ionising power to produce appreciable tertiary effects , in these metals the production of secondary radiation is a more complex phenomenon , and evidence of polarisation of the secondary beam is not to be expected from experiments upon them .
For the secondary radiator a substance had to be chosen which emitted a radiation of considerable intensity , yet differing very little in character from the primary .
It had been shown that from such substances the intensity of radiation is proportional merely to the quantity of matter passed through by the primary of given intensity .
