( Abstract .
) The beautiful result given by Professor Cayley in the Proceedings of the Royal Society ( vol. xiii .
p. 553 ) , and deduced , as I understand , by the methods of his memoir " Onthe Conic of Five-pointic Contact " ( Philosophical Transactions , vol. cxlix .
p. 371 ) , led me to inquire how far the formulae of my own memoir " On the Contact of Plane Curves " ( Philosophical Transactions , vol. clii .
p. 41 ) were applicable to the solution of the present problem .
The formulae in question are as follows : if U=0 be the equation of the curve , II its Hessian , and V==(a , 6 , c , f , g , h3 x , y , z)20 that of the conic of five-pointic contact ; and if , moreover , a , a , y being arbitrary constants , 349 -= ax +/ y + yz O =(vy-w/ 3 ) ba + ( wa--Zuy ) by + ( u va ) a , then , writing as usual bxa , U=ub , y U-= , zU I-w , H=-p , byH=-q , b , II=r , b2 U==u,. .
by ayzU=-u,. .
A=v1 w1-u'2,. .
F=v ' w'-u u',. .
the values of the ratios a : b : c f : g : h are determined by the equations V=0 , IV=0,. .
CE4Vo0 .
Now , if at the point in question the curvature of U be such that a sixth consecutive point lies on the conic V , the point is called a sextactic point ; and the condition for this will be , in terms of the above formulae , [ ]6 V=0 .
From the six equations V=0O , -V= O , ... D5V= 0 , the quantities a , ,. .
h can be linearly eliminated , and the result will be an equation which , when combined with U=O , will determine the ratios of x : y : z , the coordinates of the sextactic points of U. But the equation so derived contains ( beside other extraneous factors ) the indeterminate quantities a , f3 , y , to the degree 15 , which remain to be eliminated .
Instead , however , of proceeding as above , I eliminate a , j3 , y beforehand , in such a way that V=0 , [ LV=O0 , [ 2 V=0 take the form *V VbV wuvw wH l and more generally if W=0 , representing any one of the series V=O , EV=O,. .
from which a , / 3 , y have been already eliminated , the equations W =0 , ]W =0 , 2 W= 0 are replaced by a , W _a , yW a_ AWE ubw uljlI where H is the Hessian of U , wa numerical factor , and A=(A , B , C , F , G , HI ) ( a , , b , ab)2 .
Proceeding in this way , I obtain a result free from a , f3 , y in the three forms , bx(uX--x ) b(uYP ) ) bx(uZ-zP)u =0 , ba((uX-XP ) ay(uYyl ) by(uZ--zP)v a , ( 21X-xp ) az(UY-yp ) aZ(Ilz-zP ) A ( uX-xP ) A ( Y-yP ) A ( uZ--zP ) H x(vX-xQ ) iX(vY-yQ ) bx(vZ-zQ ) =0 , l ( ?
wX--x ) x(wY-yR ) ba(wZ-zR ) u =0 , where X=vr-wq , Y=wp-ur , Z=uq-vp , P=u1 X+w Y+v'Z , Q=w ' X+ vi +u'Z R=v ' X+u ' Y+w1 Z , and w2 is a numerical factor .
Each of these equations is of the degree 18u-36 in the variables ; but it is shown in the paper that they are all divisible by H , and that they further differ only in respect of the several factors u3 , v3 , w3 .
Dividing these out , the degree of the result is reduced to ( 18n-36)-3 ( n-2)-3 ( n-1)=12n--27 , as it should be .
I have not thought it necessary to reduce the expressions completely , as the form of the result given by Professor Cayley leaves nothing to be desired , and the point specially considered here is the degree of the equation .
At the same time , the reductions necessarily effected in the course of the proof of the extraneous factors are sufficient to indicate that the formulae of the present memoir would lead to an equation of the same form as that given by Professor Cayley .
