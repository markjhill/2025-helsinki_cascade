Received March 8 , 1864 .
In the volume on Sun Spots which CarriDgton has recenitly published , we are furnished with a curve denoting the relative frequenicy of these phenomena from 1760 to the presenit time .
This curve exhibits a maximum corresponlding to 1 788 6 .
Again , in Dalton 's I'Meteorology ' we have a list of aurorare observed at Kendal and Keswick from May 1786 to May 1793 .
The observations at Kenidal were made by Dalton himself , and those at Keswick by Crosthwaite .
This list givesFor the year 1 78 7..27 aurorte , For the year 1 790 ... 36 aurorce ; 1788 ... 53 , , I1791 ... 37 1789 ... 45 I1792..213 showing a maximum about the middle , or near the enid of 1788 .
This corresponds -very nearly with 1 788-6 , which we have seen is one of Carrington 's dates of maximum suni spots .
The following , observation is unconnected with the auirora borealis .
In examining the sun pictures taken with the Kew Heliograph under the superinitendenice of Mr. De laRue , it appears to be a nearly universal law that the faculin belonging to a spot appear to the left of that spot , the motion due to the suni 's rotation being across the picture from left to right .
These pictures comprise a few takea in 1858 , more in 1859 , a few in 1861 , and many MOre in 1862 and 1863 , and they have been carefully examinied by Mr. Beckley , of Kew Observatory , and myself .
The following Table expresses the result obtained : No. of cases of No. of cases of No. of cases of No. of cases of faYear .
