" On the Diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination of St. Helena .
" By Lieut.-Colonel Edward Sabine , R.A. , For .
Sec. R.S. It has long been known that the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle is in an opposite direction in the southern , to what it is in the northern hemisphere ; and it was therefore proposed as a problem by Arago , Humboldt and others , to determine whether there exists any intermediate line of stations on the earth where those diurnal , variations disappear .
The results recorded in the present paper are founded on observations made at St. Helena during the five consecutive years , from 1841 to 1845 inclusive ; and also on similar observations made at Singapore , in the years 1841 and 1842 ; and show that at these stations , which are intermediate between the northern and southern magnetic hemispheres , the diurnal variations still take place ; but those peculiar to each hemisphere prevail at opposite seasons of the year , apparently in accordance with the position of the sun with relation to the earth 's equator .
