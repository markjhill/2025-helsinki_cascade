353 Reflex Electrical Effects Mixed Nerve , Sc , and consequently the progression is undisturbed by the modification of the directional differences for the same salt , which are relatively so much more important in the case of the thermal constants .
The net effect of the replacement of one metal by another has , however , been shown to be clearly demonstrated by the progression of the coefficients of the cubical expansion and their increments .
The final conclusion of the investigation , therefore , is that : The thermal deformation constants of the crystal 's of normal of potassium , rubidium , and caesium exhibit variations which , in common the morphological , optical , and other physical properties previously follow the order of progression of the atomic weights of the alkali metals which the salts contain .

The following experiments were made during the months of May , June , and July , 1897 , in the Physiological Laboratory of Leipzig , under the guidance of Professors Hearing and v. Frey , to test whether in the frog , reflex electrical changes could be demonstrated at the central end\#151 ; I. Of a mixed nerve .
II .
Of anterior roots alone .
III .
Of posterior roots alone .
As regards the first two heads , the end in view was simply the actual verification of an extremely probable phenomenon , preparatory to an examination of the third head , viz. , reflex electrical effects propagated down the posterior roots , which , in 1891 , * were pointed out by Gotch and Horsley , and offered as proof of the passage of centrifugal nerve impulses in normally afferent nerve channels .
The results obtained in the present experiments being somewhat difficult to interpret , the notes were laid aside until opportunity should offer for carrying the investigation further .
Professor Bernstein having , however , quite recently !
discussed the question of the reflex negative variation of the nerve current , the moment seemed opportune for submitting these results as they stand to the attention of those interested in the subject .
The galvanometer used was on the lines of Thomson 's reflecting instrument , with modifications by Carpentier .
The leading-off electrodes had finely pointed camel 's hair brushes inserted in the plug * ' Phil. Trans. , ' B , vol. 182 .

The current of injury was compensated in the usual way .
In the exciting circuit the Du Bois Reymond induction coil was supplied by a singte Darnell cell , the stimulating electrodes were of platinum wire and had effect \#153 ; l0'P 'f " ire ( Hering'S Pattorn ) to Suard against'unipolar Frogs of the Esculents species were used ; they were cooled , U , kept im six or seven days on ice to ensure a high degree of excitability .
The frog was prepared with as little loss of blood as possible , the brain above the medulla being destroyed by insertion of a small peg of wood For experiments under head I , the frog having been fimly secured ' the two sciatica were exposed , cut at the knee-joint , and isolated in their full extent .
The nerve of one side was then raised , supported by a glass hook , and connected at transverse and longitudinal surfaces with the galvanometer electrodes the hook was so arranged as to obviate any possible shifting of contacts .
The sciatic of the opposite side was then also raised , and its lower end laid across the stimulating e ectrodes .
In one or two preliminary experiments , one branch only of the sciatic was divided at the knee and led off to the galvanometer , the other branch being left in connection with its muscles to serve as a control ; under these conditions , on stimulating the sciatic of the opposite side , the electrical and muscular effects corresponded , both .sometimes failing to appear .

Reflex Effects minute or two was necessary before repeating the stimulation , and the latent period was very marked\#151 ; to be reckoned often in seconds .
In experiments where the nerve roots were to he led off to the galvanometer , the frog was always curarised .
A sciatic having then been prepared as before for stimulation , its nerve roots ( 7th , 8th , and 9th pairs ) , or the corresponding pairs of the opposite side , were exposed by opening up the lower part of the spinal column ; the roots were then carefully separated and those to be led off to the galvanometer were cut as far as possible from the cord ( just above the ganglion , in the case of posterior roots ) .
Two roots were usually taken together and their central ends connected with the brush electrodes .
In cases where the bulb was stimulated , the brain and upper half of the cord were exposed , and the brain cut off at the bulb .
The cord having then been severed from its attachments , was carefully raised and the bulb laid upon the stimulating electrodes .

o\gt ; I oJ O In these last nine experiments where the lead-off was from posterior roots the deflection had not the characters of a reflex deflection viz. , delay and exhaustibility ; the negative variation followed at once on stimulation and could be repeated without the pause necessary in the case of an ordinary reflex .
The same thing was also observed on one occasion in the case of anterior roots ( experiment of June 29 ) .
In the remaining experiments III ( 3 ) where , the bulb being stimulated , the posterior roots were led off to the galvanometer , this non-reflex effect was observed in certainly two cases ( June 29 and 30 ) .

359 Throughout the experiments fallacies arising through induction were carefully guarded against , the negative variation was tested by reversing the direction of the stimulating current ; and as a final test for current escape the led-off nerve was cut through with wet scissors in such a way that the severed ends remained in contact , though physiological continuity was destroyed ; the stimulation was then repeated , but in no case was there any deflection after such section .
In the main my results exhibit\#151 ; I. Electrical effects of an indubitably reflex character in the mixed nerve and in the anterior roots alone .
II .
Slight effects of doubtful character in the posterior roots .
My warmest thanks are due to Professor Hearing for the courteous hospitality of his laboratory , and to Professor von Frey I would offer my grateful acknowledgment of his ready help .
