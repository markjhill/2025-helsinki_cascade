A satisfactory general explanation of all the phenomena is found in the view that with a smooth sphere , cohesion is operative in guiding the advancing edge of the liquid sheath which rises over and closely envelops the sphere .
If the surface is not rigid .
, is dusty ) , or is rough , then the momentum of the sheath carries it , once for all , away from the surface of the sphere , and the subsequent motion is quite different .
The persistence of the remarkable radial ribs or flutings observable in the film that ensheathes a smooth entering sphere is completely explained by the assumption of a viscous drag spreading from the surface of the sphere outwards , and these flutings are always absent from any part of the sheath that has left the sphere .
Their presence is an indication that there is no finite slip at the solid surface .
Experiments made with water mixed with glycerine show that , up to a certain point , the character of the disturbance is but slightly affected by large changes in viscosity .
With pure glycerine , however , a thin film of water absorbed from the atmosphere equivalent to a layer mm. thick , was found completely to change the course of a splash , a striking proof of the importance of the initial motion in determining that which is to follow .
Experiments conducted in vacuo prove that the presence of the air has no noticeable influence on the early course of a splash , but that its pressure subsequently prevents cavitation of the liquid under what would otherwise be negative pressures .
The paper concludes with a reference to the remarkable similarity between the splash at the surface of a liquid and that caused at the surface of a hard-steel armour-plate by the impact of a projectile , and with the suggestion that the explanation may be found in the argument of Pointing , * which demands an increase of molecular mobility with increase of pressure .

On certain theoretical grounds it has been supposed by Weismann that offspring produced by parthenogenesis exhibit little or no variability , To determine how far this conclusion was warranted by fact , some measurements were made on Daphnia magna ( Straus).t * Pointing , " Change of State , Solid-Liquid , " * Phil. Mag. , ' July , 1881 ; see also two very important papers by Tresca on the " Flow of Solids , " ' Proceedings of Institution of Mechanical Engineers , ' June , 1867 , and June , 1878 .
t The measurements were made under the microscope with Zeiss 's screw-micrometer .
An Observation on Parthenogenesis .
The dimensions taken were :\#151 ; ( 1 ) The total length of the body measured along a line passing ventrally from the base of the spine and cutting the convex surface of the head opposite the middle of the compound eye ( AB , see figure ) .
( 2 ) The length of the protopodite of the 2nd antenna of the right side .
The measurement was made on the posterior surface of the protopodite along a line parallel to the dorsal edge .
At the articulation with the head the exo-skeleton of the protopodite possesses a well defined point , which forms a good inner limit to the measurement ( CD ) .
Since , under favourable conditions , these animals continue to grow throughout life , the second dimension was expressed in terms of the first , thus Length of R protopcriite x 1000 Total length of body The mean of the relative length of the protopodite sinks as the animal grows , but between a body length of 2-4 mm. and 3'6 mm. ( the total range of size ) the change would not be large .
I find that at the time of measurement the offspring were constantly somewhat smaller ( 0-4 to 05 mm. ) than the parents , but as this applies to all the broods which were measured , the rise in the mean of the offspring would not affect the correlation surface .
From twenty-three Daphnia ( themselves originating by parthenogenesis ) broods were produced consisting of three to six individuals .
The parents were measured , and the offspring were allowed to grow up .
On measuring the offspring it was at once obvious that the children of the same brood exhibited very considerable variability .
In the following table ( p. 156 ) the results of the measurements are displayed in a correlation surface .
The table illustrates the variability of children of the same partheno-genetic family , and we can further see , for example , that offspring with a parentage of 169 *5thousandths exhibited a range of variation 159-5\#151 ; 181-5 thousandths .

Professor Pearson shows that the total regression of the progeny on the mid-parent of any generation is constant and is equal to 0*6 , while the correlation and regression of an individual parent of the nth generation ( supposing equal variability for all generations ) = 0*6(^)n and the correlation of the midparent of the with generation = 0*6| Hence the coefficients of correlation and regression of an individual parent of the 1st generation ( i.e. , father or mother ) = 0*6(^)1 = 0*3 , and the coefficient of correlation of the mid-parent = 0*6^-^j = 0*424 , and the coefficient of regression , as we have just seen above , = 0*6 .
Now , on comparing observation with theory , we see that the par-thenogenetic mother appears to act like a mid-parent ; the coefficients of correlation and regression being respectively 0*466 and 0*619 .

The evidence of these measurements cannot be said to be conclusive and I am about to test the theory on some other parthenogenetie animal .
If , however , this kind of inheritance be found to hold at all generally in parthenogenesis , it would be a fact of very considerable significance , and might conceivably give some insight into the physiological causes of heredity and variation .

) : a Horn-destroying Fungus .

( Abstract .
) The genus Onygena comprises half a dozen species of fungi , all very imperfectly known , remarkable for their growth on feathers , hair , horn , hoofs , \amp ; c. , on which their sporoearps appear as drum-stick shaped bodies 5\#151 ; 10 mm. high .
A cow 's horn , thoroughly infested with the mycelium of the present species , yielded material for the investigation , and the author has not only verified what little was known , but has been able to cultivate the fungus and trace its life-history , neither of which had been done before , and to supply some details of its action on the horn .
The principal new points concern the development of the sporo phores , which arise as domed or club-shaped masses of hyphae and stand up into the air covered with a glistening white powder .
Closer investigation shows this to consist of chlamydospores , formed at the free ends of the up-growing hyphae .
Their details of structure and development are fully described , and their spore nature proved by culture in hanging drops .
The germination , growth into mycelia , and peculiar .biology of these hitherto unknown spores were followed in detail , and in some cases new crops of chlamydospores obtained direct in the cultures .
When the crop of chlamydospores on the outside of the young sporophore is exhausted , the hyphae which bore the spores fuse to form the peridium clothing the head of the sporocarp , and peculiar changes begin in the internal hyphae below .
Minute tufts or knots of claw-like filaments spring from the hyphae forming the main mass of the fungus , push their way in between the latter , and so find room in the mesh-like cavities .
Here the closely segmented claws form asci\#151 ; they are the ascogenous hyphae\#151 ; and the
