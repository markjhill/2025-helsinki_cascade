) The effects mentioned in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are independent of any changes produced by the current in the temperature of the wire .
Finally , certain critical points are alluded to , there being at least two such for each metal , at which sudden changes take place in the ratio of the permanent extension produced by any load and the load itself .
The existence of the first of these critical points seems to prove beyond a doubt that , in all well-annealed metals , there is a true limit of elasticity , which is intimately connected with the elasticity of the substance , and it will appear from the investigations made in the other parts of this paper , that changes more or less profound take place in most , if not all , of the physical properties of the substance at these points .

" Lucifer : a Study in Morphology/ ' By W. K. Brooks , Associate in Biology and Director of the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Md. , U.S.A. Communicated by Professor Huxley , Sec. R.S. Received April 6 , 1881 .
( Abstract .
) Our knowledge of the life-history of this extremely interesting genus is very scanty , and the only published observations are contained in a short paper , without illustrations , in " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 24 , p. 132 , by Willemdes-Suhm .
The death of this naturalist , only a few months after his paper was written , put an end to his studies , which he had expressed a hope of finishing , and I therefore take pleasure in stating that I have been so fortunate as to procure the eggs of Lucifer , and to trace every stage of the metamorphosis , from the time the larva leaves the egg up to the mature male , by the actual moulting of isolated specimens in captivity ; and I have also been able to add a few observations upon its embryology .
The early stages of development are extremely interesting , since the segmentation is quite different from that of any arthropod egg which has been described .
The egg undergoes total regular segmentation ; there is a true central segmentation cavity , and during the early stages there is nothing to represent the yolk-pyramids of the ordinary crustacean egg .
When segmentation is somewhat advanced , the granular matter becomes restricted to one of the spherules ; this then pushes into the segmentation cavity , and appears to correspond to a single yolk-pyramid .
Its outer end splits off as a blastoderm cell , 1881 .

and its inner granular end , which is now situated in the segmentation cavity , soon divides up into a number of food-yolk spherules .
The primitive digestive cavity is next formed by an invagination , at- the point where the yolk-pyramid has been pushed an .
The larva leaves the egg as a Nauplius , which , after two moults , is changed into a Protozocea , with nauplius-like antennules and antennas ; mandibles like those of the adult ; two pairs of maxillae ; two pairs of maxillipeds , and a long hind-body divided at .
its anterior end into four zoonites .
After a number of moults it becomes changed into Dana s thina demissa , which Willemoes-Suhm has shown to be a Lucifer larva .
The Erichthina gradually changes by three moults into Dana 's Serbatina armata , which seems to be the same as Willemoes-Sulim 's Amphion stage .
After a number of moults it becomes a , and then both sexes gradually assume the adult female form , the characteristics of the adult male appearing last .
The first four sections of the paper describe the structure , embryology , and metamorphosis of Lucifer .
Among the more important points are the total absence at all stages of the fifth thoracic zoonite and its appendages ; the origin of the metastoma as a pair of buds homologous with the other appendages , and the absence of larval stages with the distinctive features of the and larvae of Sergestes .
The fifth section gives an account of the metamorphosis of another Sergestid , which there is reason to believe to be , although it was not reared to the adult form .
At the and stages this form is intermediate between the highly modified larva of Sergestes and the simple larva of Lucifer .
The sixth section discusses the relation between the larvae of Lucifer , Acetes , Sergestes , Penceus , and Euphausia , and the significance of the deapod Zocea and crustacean Nauplius .
As one result of the comparison , I attempt to show that , while the life-history of Lucifer , Acetes , Sergestes , and Penacus , tends to confirm Claus ' view that the Zocea is a secondary modification of the more primitive Protozocea , a comparison of these forms with Euphausia shows that this view is not without difficulties , since these genera differ from each other in the very point in question ; the manner in which the zoonites and appendages of the thorax make their appearance .
The seventh section discusses the phenomena of serial homology and bilateral symmetry in the Crustacea , and is an attempt to show that these rssemblances cannot be explained by heredity from the parts of an unspecialised form , since the facts of embryology do not Presents .
[ Mar. 24 , support the view that the remote ancestor of the Crustacea was a long series of independent zoonites or metameres .
Even if this view were supported by facts , the embryology of Lucifer compels us to recognise a recent and persistent bond of homology between its appendages .
The next section is an attempt to show that , while we are unable to believe that serially homologous organs , in all cases , owe their resemblance to heredity from the unspecialised organs of a remote ancestor , they may still be due to heredity ; but to heredity from the same part of the developing egg , rather than from a remote ancestor .
The last section is an attempt to show that , by making a slight change in Darwin 's " Pangenesis Hypothesis , " it can be so simplified , that the germinules which it demands may be few in numbers , simple in their properties , and not infinitely small .
In its modified form the hypothesis accounts for the phenomena of serial homology and symmetry , and it removes some of the most serious difficulties of the theory of natural selection , especially by showing why variations appear when they are needed .
