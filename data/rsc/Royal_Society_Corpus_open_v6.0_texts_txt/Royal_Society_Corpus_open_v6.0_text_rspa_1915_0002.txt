] Introductory .
Last autumn Prof. Strutt observed that the vapour of boron trichloride , when admitted into the afterglow of active nitrogen , developed a band spectrum , which he photographed with a quartz spectrograph of small dispersion .
It seemed likely that this result might be of interest in view of certain facts already established in connection with compounds of the chemically related elements carbon and silicon , namely , that the interaction of carbon compounds and active nitrogen developed the cyanogen bands , f and that the vapour of silicon tetrachloride in the afterglow gave rise to a band spectrum of silicon nitride.^ Prof. Strutt , therefore , invited me to continue the boron experiments with a view to tracing the origin of the new system of bands , and determining the numerical relations existing in it .
The remarkable scarcity of boron lines lends additional interest to any new work on the spectroscopy of boron as a possible means of detecting hitherto unrecorded lines , or of eliminating others formerly attributed to boron .
In this connection Sir William CrookesS has shown that the boron lines are only three in number , viz. , X 345P50 , X 2497-83 , X 2496'89 ( Rowland scale ) , and that some linesll observed by Eder and Valenta and others were due not to boron but to impurities .
The new bands have been attributed to the nitride of boron for reasons which will appear in due course .
Experimental .
In order to render a detailed examination possible , the spectrum was photographed with instruments giving greater dispersion than that employed * I , A. Fowler and R. J. Strutt , 'Roy .

Active Modification of Nitrogen .
by Prof. Strutt .
This , of course , necessitated longer exposures .
The arrangement of a pair of aspirator bottles and a muslin bag of chopped phosphorus described by Prof. Strutt* for storing and purifying the nitrogen had been found in previous spectroscopic work to be somewhat inadequate for these long exposures .
After the aspirator had been emptied of its pure nitrogen , it was necessary not only to interrupt the exposure for the process of refilling from a commercial nitrogen cylinder , but also to wait some time afterwards for the fresh gas to purify by standing in Contact with the phosphorus before resuming the exposure .
In the present work , therefore , Prof. Strutt 's holder was duplicated ; two pairs of aspirators with bags of phosphorus were arranged on the same carriage , with a single drying tube and a suitable arrangement of glass taps , so that a flow of pure nitrogen could be maintained for any length of time , by using the two halves of the arrangement alternately .
In the meantime , the * half not in use was shut off and refilled from a cylinder , and ample time was allowed for the purification of the gas .
The dual holder thus presents many advantages over the single arrangement for spectroscopic investigations .
The remainder of the afterglow apparatus was exactly the same as that previously employed .
The first experiments of the new series were confined to the interaction of boron trichloride and active nitrogen .
The trichloride is an exceedingly volatile , colourless liquid , boiling at 18 ' C. , and fuming strongly and decomposing on exposure to the atmosphere .
A sample was supplied by Prof. Strutt , and the remainder prepared in the Chemical Department of the Imperial College .
It was made by passing chlorine over heated amorphous boron , and collected in a vessel cooled in a freezing mixture and containing mercury ( to remove excess of chlorine ) .
The product was finally purified by fractional distillation .
On the introduction of the vapour of the trichloride into active nitrogen , a very pale blue-green glow is produced , the colour being readily distinguishable from the vivid green of the boron flame so well known in chemical analysis .
The spectrum of the glow consists of the new system of bands , the three boron lines , and bands of impurities , namely , nitrogen and cyanogen .
The New Bands .
The new bands degrade throughout to the less refrangible side , and are quite distinct from the headless , wavy bands ( Plate 2 , strip 1 ) observed by others and tabulated by Kayser under the title of oxide spectrum.f The * 'Roy .

oxide bands consist of alternate , indefinite maxima and minima occurring at or near X639 , 620 , 603 , 580 , 545 , 518 , 493 , 471 , 452 .
The new spectrum extends over a very large range , namely , from the red to the region of the shortest wave-lengths conveniently investigated with a quartz spectrograph .
A general examination of plates taken with a larger quartz instrument showed the existence of two principal systems of bands .
One of them , in the ultra-violet , is a very complex system in which some of the bands appear to have double heads on account of the overlapping of different constituent series ( Plate 2 , strips 5 and 6 ) .
The other , occupying the visible part of the spectrum , is of comparatively simple structure , and consists of prominent bands with double heads ( Plate 2 , strip 4 ) .
As the dispersion of the quartz instrument is comparatively small ( 25\#151 ; 50 l.U. per millimetre ) in the visible region , for study in further detail this portion of the spectrum was photographed with a Littrow prismatic spectrograph , the dispersion varying from about 8-5 A.U. per millimetre near X4000 to 40 A.U. per millimetre near X 6500 .
The heads were measured with regard to an iron comparison as far as X 2330 , * beyond which point the copper arc was employed as the comparison spectrum .
No measurements have been made of the structure lines of any of the bands .
The Less Refrangible System ( a ) .
On the larger dispersion photographs , not only do the less refrangible bands appear double as stated above , but each of the component heads , A and B , is itself a close doublet ( Plate 2 , strips 2 and 3 ) .
Thus a typical band in this region may be said to have four heads , Ai , A2 , Bi , B2 .
In the case of Ai and Bi the structure lines fall off very rapidly in intensity as their distances from the head increase .
A2 and B2 , on the other hand , have series of structure lines which are easily resolved on the photographs , and persist in intensity for considerable distances from the heads .
These features may conveniently be represented diagrammatically , as in the figure , the heights and slopes of the curves indicating roughly the variations of intensities of the lines throughout the band .
From Table I , giving the results of measurement of this system , it appears that , in the first place , the two doublets Ai-A2 , Bi-B2 of each band have the same interval on the wave-number scale , and this interval is constant throughout the system .
The measured intervals vary between 11 and 15 , the mean being 13 .
The discrepancies are attributable to the extreme * The head of smallest wave-length measurable by Burns ' Iron Arc Standards 0 Zeitsch .

difficulty of measuring a close pair of heads with precision .
The difficulty is enormously greater in the case of bands than of lines .
Secondly , the A , A2 B , B2 component doublets of a band are also equally separated throughout the system within the limits of error of measurement , the mean separation , A1-B1 , being 124 .

The wave-numbers in brackets are estimated values .
In the discussion of the distribution of the bands it will therefore be sufficient to consider one\#151 ; say , A2\#151 ; of the four heads of each band .
Table II shows the wave-numbers of the heads A2 arranged in groups similar to those of the bands of cyanogen , * and of silicon nitride.f Thus , the heads A2 may be represented by a Deslandres equation , n \#151 ; A + B(m + yu , )2 + C ( j\gt ; + 7r)2 , in which A , B , and C are constants , ra and p take successive integral values for consecutive values of n in vertical and horizontal directions respectively , while fL and 77 are fractional terms .
B and C are respectively equal to half the common differences in the progressions formed by the tabulated intervals ( or " first differences " ) in the vertical and horizontal directions .
Adopting as the means of the " second differences " the values 20'40 and 23'70 ( which are partly derived from the measures of the more refrangible system , / 3X ) the equation becomes nAa = 11-85 ( p + 0-04)2 \#151 ; 10-20 ( m + 0'18)2-12203 .
The same equation will include the other three heads if the constant A be altered in accordance with the constant intervals 13 and 124 .

The values of m and p for the observed bands are shown in both tables , and the differences ( A n ) between observed and calculated wave-numbers are given in Table I. The More Refrangible System ( / 3 ) .
* This system has a close resemblance to the silicon nitride spectrum , the bands in each case having single heads .
Data relating- to all the bands observed in the more refrangible region are included in Table III whether they belong directly to System ft or not , while in Table IV the wavenumbers of the heads in System / 3 are arranged in a manner similar to that already indicated for System a. The bands are more numerous than in the less refrangible system , and the determination of the constants of the Deslandres formula is therefore rendered more exact .

It is at once evident that the intervals 1237 ... and 1861 ... of Table II occur also in Table IV , and that the common differences in the progressions have the same two values in both systems of hands .
The constants of the formulae have , therefore , been evaluated from observations of the two systems jointly , and the same values adopted for both .
The mean " second differences " in the rows and columns of Tables II and IV are 23'70 and 20'40 , and the equation representing System j3 is np = 11-85 QH-0-04)2\#151 ; 10-20 ( m + 0'l8)2 + 8291 , in which m and p take the integral values indicated in Tables III and IV .
The ranges of m and p are very nearly the same in the two systems .
Thus it results that the equations differ only in the values assigned to the constant A , i.e. four suitable shifts of System / 3 ( or a portion of it ) bodily on a scale of wave-numbers will suffice to reproduce the quadruple head System a. Subsidiary Systems .
In addition to the two chief systems of hands ( a and / 3 ) already considered , there is evidence of other systems which are only comparatively feebly developed .
These , however , are not entirely independent of the main System / 3 , since the heads are single , and the intervals and second differences are of the same orders of magnitude .
Two such subsidiary systems have been recognised , and may conveniently be designated / 3i and / 32- The positions of these bands are included in Table III , and their inter-relations are indicated in Table V. Table V. System j3i .

Origin of the New Bands .
In the course of the experiments on boron trichloride in active nitrogen , a white solid substance was deposited on the inside of the afterglow tube .
With a view to gaining some evidence as to the origin of the new bands this substance was removed and submitted to a Nessler test , which amply proved the presence of nitrogen in the deposit .
In order to investigate the possibility of chlorine being necessary for the development of the bands , the vapour of another boron compound not containing chlorine was substituted for the trichloride .
The compound selected was methyl borate ( CH3)3B03 , a colourless liquid , not so volatile as the trichloride\#151 ; boiling point 72 ' C. It was prepared by passing the vapour of the trichloride into pure methyl alcohol cooled in a freezing mixture .
Excess of HC1 , one product of the reaction , was removed by bubbling dry air through the resulting liquid for some time , and the product was further purified by fractional distillation .
The glow produced by the introduction of this substance had not the pale blue-green colour of the former glow ' , but was obviously contaminated by the purple cyanogen glow .
The spectrum consisted of the boron lines , the cyanogen and nitrogen bands , and the new bands under consideration .
It therefore results that chlorine does not enter into the question .
The latter conclusion was confirmed by an observation of the spectrum of boron trichloride in a vacuum tube provided with a quartz window .
The vapour was obtained in such a state of purity that no nitrogen bands were present .
The new bands were entirely absent .
It is evident , therefore , that while boron and nitrogen are concerned in the development of the bands , no other element appears to be necessary for their production .
They have therefore been attributed to boron nitride .
A search for the nitride bands in the green flame produced by methyl borate in the bunsen flame proved to be unfruitful .
This spectrum contains only the oxide bands as observed by Weith , * and later by Eder and Valenta.f Ihe non-disruptive spark spectrum of boron was also investigated with a view to determining whether the nitride bands were produced .
This experiment was rendered possible by the kindness of Sir William Crookes , who supplied a sample of the melted boron ( prepared by Dr. WeintraubJ ) used by him in 1911 in his work on the boron line spectrum .
Photographs of the spectrum of the spark in an atmosphere of nitrogen showed no trace of the nitride bands , even when sufficient self-induction was included in the circuit * 4 Chem. Centralbl .

131 to develop strongly the band spectrum of nitrogen .
In an atmosphere of oxygen the oxide bands were similarly absent , even with the self-induction in the circuit .
Lecoq de Boisbaudran , * however , observed these bands in the spark , using a hydrochloric acid solution of boric acid .
Eder and Yalenta , and Hagenbach and Konen , have also observed the oxide bands in the uncondensed spark spectrum of boric acid .
Occurrence in the Arc. If boron nitride is the true origin of the new spectrum , then since this compound is formed when nitrogen is passed over heated boron , the bands would be expected to occur in the boron arc in air or nitrogen , just as the cyanogen bands are developed in the carbon arc .
Although much work has been done on the arc spectrum of boron compounds ( chiefly boric acid and anhydride ) , the only bands which have been recorded in addition to the oxide bands already referred to above are some observed by G. Kuhne.f Kiihne photographed the flame and arc spectra of boric acid by means of the 21-ft .
concave grating at Bonn , and measured structure lines emanating from four single heads , which are stated to be at XX 5022-19,5046'79,5515'02 , 5552-98 .
These degrade to the red , and are designated by Kuhne A , B , C , 1 ) , respectively .
The series from A and C were found to consist of single lines and those from B and D of doublets .
The figures in the boron nitride spectrum ( Table I ) nearest to those quoted above are respectively 07-5 ' A2-4 '39-1 : -1T9 Vf-5 45-9- belonging to two of the strong bands of System \#171 ; .
The agreement , however , is not near enough to do more than barely suggest identity .
Moreover , while the nitride heads are double , Kiihne 's are described as single , and no mention is made of other heads having wave-lengths correspondingly near- other strong bands of the nitride system .
The arc spectrum of boric oxide was photographed with the same two spectrographs as were used in the afterglow experiments .
The headless oxide bands are the most prominent feature of the spectrum ( Plate 2 , strip 1 ) .
Cyanogen bands and lines due to impurities are also present , and superposition of afterglow photographs led to the detection of the strongest of the nitride heads of System a in the arc spectrum .
The intervening fainter heads of System a have not been detected in the arc owing partly to the confusion caused by the presence of the oxide * ' Spectres Lumineux , ' p. 193 , Paris , 1874 .

spectrum , and also , perhaps , to certain modifications of intensity presently to be described in connection with the more refrangible bands .
On none of the arc photographs was it possible to detect any heads near the four positions given by Kiihne other than those already mentioned .
In each case the present measurements result m smaller wave-lengths than Ktihne 's corresponding value .
A possible explanation of the discrepancy , assuming the identity of the bands , would be that , on account of the high J dispersion employed and the ill-defined nature of the heads in the arc , Kuhne , misjudged the positions of the heads A2 and B2 , and entirely missed the I second heads , Ai and Bi , of the doublets .
Similar results were obtained in the case of elemental boron in the arc in 1 air , and in nitrogen ; in the latter case the oxide bands occurred with f relatively diminished intensity but were never entirely absent , as would 1 be expected if oxygen could be totally excluded .
Photographs of the 1 elemental boron arc in an atmosphere of oxygen were consistent with the j nitride origin of the new spectrum ; for , although the less refrangible system ] was feebly present , the more refrangible bands were generally absent .
The J experiment , however , was not regarded as very important , as with the 1 arrangement employed it was uncertain whether all the air was displaced 1 by oxygen .
In the far ultra-violet region , not confused by the superposition of other j bands , the difference between the nitride bands ( System f3 ) in the arc and 1 the afterglow is mainly one of intensity .
As in the visible region , the strong ] heads are well defined in the arc , but in addition to these the intervening I feebler heads are sometimes discernible .
In the afterglow the heads are much ] better defined , and the structure lines fall off in intensity much more rapidly ; as their distance from the head increases than is the case in the arc .
Thus the feebler heads stand out distinctly above the structure lines from the preceding strong head in the afterglow ; while in the arc they are almost entirely masked by the intense structure lines .
This contraction of the bands in the afterglow relatively to the arc may be j a direct result ot the diminished pressure .
A similar contraction is observed in the cyanogen bands as produced in the electric discharge through a cyanogen tube , compared with the same bands developed in the carbon arc j at atmospheric pressure.* Cases are known , also , in which bands are shorter in the afterglow than the same bands in the electric discharge , e.g. the nitrogen bands of group y.f * Fowler and Shaw , loc. cit. , Plate 7 .

Active Modification of Nitrogen .
Comparison with Carbon and Silicon .
Boron , the only non-metallic element in its group ( III ) in the Periodic Classification , is well known not only to have similar general chemical properties to the other elements ( aluminium , gallium , etc. ) of the same trivalent group , but also to bear some striking analogies to the tetravalent non-metals , carbon and silicon , of the next group ( 1Y ) .
The behaviour of the vapours of its compounds in the afterglow is now shown to be a new instance of this resemblance .
Compounds of all three elements develop the spectra of the products of their reactions with the active nitrogen , and not merely the spectrum of the substance introduced , or the line spectrum of the element itself , as in the case with the tetrachloride of titanium , * a metal of the carbon group .
Moreover , in each of the three leases under consideration the product is the nitride of the element .
Although the spectra of the three nitrides may each be analysed into groups and repre-i sented by equations , of the general type given by Deslandres , yet marked i differences in the constitution of the bands themselves occur in the three spectra .
Silicon nitride has the simplest spectrum , consisting of one system of bands with single heads degraded towards the red .
Thus it resembles the i more refrangible system ( / 3 ) of boron nitride .
The quadruple head system ( \#171 ; ) .
L of boron nitride has no real counterpart in the nitrides of the other elements. .
' Of the two cyanogen systems , the less refrangible has triple heads degraded ; towards the red , and the more refrangible ( comprising the well-known groups i at A , 4216,3883 , and 3590 ) has single heads degraded in the opposite direction .
, i Both these systems are well developed in the afterglow together with the associated " tails."f Summary .

) In 1887 , Hermann* published an account of some experiments from which he drew the conclusion that when an electric current passed from a dilute solution of a salt , such as sodium sulphate , to one more concentrated , a liberation of acid took place at the boundary layer between the two fluids ; also , that'when the current passed in the opposite direction alkali was liberated at the same place .
His experimental difficulties were considerable , but the facts were firmly established , though it is only to be expected that their repetition and amplification to-day should suggest another interpretation to thatlput forward 27 years ago .
Strangely enough , although these phenomena were cited by early pliysio- * ' Gottinger Nachrichten , ' 1887 .
