[ Mar. 5 , Summary .
The principal results obtained in this paper may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) When radium emanation , in radio-active equilibrium with its products of disintegration , is condensed at the bottom of an evacuated tube immersed in liquid air , active deposit particles are radiated up the tube .
This phenomenon is ascribed to the recoil of the residual atom when an a-particle is emitted .
( 2 ) The law of absorption of this radiation both in air and hydrogen has been investigated .
The radiation reaching a surface at a fixed distance from the condensed emanation is an exponential function of the gas pressure .
( 3 ) From the rate of decay of the activity collected on a surface exposed to the radiation from the emanation , it appears that both radium A and radium B reach the surface .
( 4 ) Eadium B and radium C are both radiated through a vacuum from a surface previously rendered active by exposure to the emanation .
Supposing that radium B emits only / 3-particles , 4he radiation of radium C must be due to the recoil of the atoms when / 3-particles are emitted .
The work has been greatly facilitated by the kindness of Prof. Rutherford in supplying us with the emanation necessary for these experiments .
We-take this opportunity of expressing our thanks to him .
An Attempt to detect some Electro-optical Effects .
By Prof. Harold A. Wilson , F.R.S. , King 's College , London .
( Received March 5 , \#151 ; Read March 18 , 1909 .
) The following paper contains a description of some experiments made with the object of detecting possible effects due to electric and magnetic fields and moving matter on the velocity of propagation of light in glass .
The results obtained were negative , but it seems worth while to publish a short account of the experiments .
The optical part of the apparatus is a simple form of interferometer which proved very easy and convenient to work with .
It consists of a square glass frame made up of glass bars of square cross-section cemented together with Canada balsam .
Three of the corners are cut off at 45 ' , as shown in the figure , and the fourth corner contains a half silvered surface FF .
Light entering in the direction of the arrow A is divided into two beams by the silver film , which pass round the frame in opposite directions , being totally reflected at the cut-off corners .
Half of each beam emerges in the direction of the arrow B , and the two beams at B are in a condition to interfere with each other .

exactly with those due to the steady source .
This experiment shows that there is no effect due to a rapidly varying electric force acting round the frame .
The rate of variation of the induced electric force in the glass in this experiment was about one million volts per cm .
per sec. Another experiment was then tried , using sparks from a secondary coil of two turns wound round the coil of 150 turns as the source of light .
In this experiment the light was a maximum when the induced force was a maximum .
Again no effect was observed .
The same two experiments were then repeated with a coil of two turns instead of the coil of 150 turns , with similar results .
A small Hertz oscillator , with its axis along the axis of the frame , was then tried , using the sparks of the oscillator as the source of light , without effect .
A single layer of about 100 turns of wire was then wound on the bars of the frame so as to produce a magnetic field round the frame .
A powerful jar discharge was passed through this coil without effect , using both primary and secondary sparks as the source of light .
The frame was now fixed up round the poles of a large Du Bois magnet which were put close together .
The core of the magnet is 8 cm .
in diameter , and it is wound for 100 volts .
The magnet was connected directly to an electric supply at 200 volts , and the current started , stopped , and reversed without effect.* The connections to one of the coils of the magnet were then reversed so that both poles could be magnetised in the same way so as to produce a radial field at the glass frame .
No effect was obtained .
The frame was next put between two parallel metal plates , 2 cm .
apart , which were connected to a Wimshurst^ electrical machine , and charged up till sparks passed between them .
A very slight motion of the bands was observed when the sparks passed , which was no doubt due to the frame being strained by the electrostatic forces .
Holes were cut in the plates so that the frame and plates could be put round the poles of the Du Bois magnet .
In this way the effect of a radial magnetic field with a perpendicular electric field was tried .
Reversing the magnetic field while the electric field was steady produced no effect .
In this experiment , according to Poynting 's theorem , there was a flow of electromagnetic energy round the frame inside the glass .
Indiarubber tubing was then wound round the bars of the frame until the hole through the frame was nearly filled with the turns .
A rapid stream of water was passed through the tubing without any effect on the interference bands .
The glass frame was very excellently made and adjusted by Adam Hilger , Ltd. , and it has remained in perfect adjustment and never given the slightest trouble .
* The total current flowing round the core was 70,000 amperes .
The axis of the frame coincided with the axis of the core .
