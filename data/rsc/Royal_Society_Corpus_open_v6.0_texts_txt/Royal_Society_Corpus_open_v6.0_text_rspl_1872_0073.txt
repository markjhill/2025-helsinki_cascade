" On a newly discovered extinct Mammal from Patagonia ( Ho-malodotherium Cunninghami ) By Willtam Henry Flower , F.R.S. , Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy , and Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons .
Received May 30 , 1873 .
( Abstract .
) The author describes the complete adult dentition of a new genus of mammal , founded on remains discovered by Dr. Robert O. Cunningham in deposits of uncertain age on the banks of the River Gallegos , South Patagonia .
The animal appears to have possessed the complete typical number of teeth , i. e. twenty-two above and below , arranged in an unbroken series , and of nearly even height , and presenting a remarkable gradual transition in characters , in both jaws , from the first incisor to the last molar .
The molars more nearly resemble those of the genus Rhinoceros than any other known mammal ; and , judging only by the general characters of the teeth , the animal would appear to have been a very generalized type of Perissodactyle Ungulate , allied through Hyracodon ( a North-American Miocene form ) to Rhinoceros , also more remotely to Macrauchenia , and , though still more remotely , to the aberrant Nesodon and Toxodon .
* The generic name Homcdodotherium was suggested for this form by Professor Huxley in his Presidential Address to the Geological Society in 1870 .
* Taken by another instrument in mouth .
