condition had formerly been regarded as portions of separate scutes .
This unique specimen shows Polacanthus to have possessed a more complete dermal armature than any other Dinosaur yet described .
The pelvis is more fully described than was possible in 1881 , and in particular the form and direction of the ischian arch shown to be different from those obtaining in the Iguanodont family .

" The Reputed Suicide of Scorpions .
" By Alfred G. Bourne , D.Sc .
, Fellow of University College , London , and Professor of Biology in the Presidency College , Madras .
Communicated by Professor Ray Lankester , F.R.S. Received December 22 , 1886 .
The legend that a scorpion when placed within a ring of red-hot embers will , after making futile efforts to pass the fiery circle which surrounds it , deliberately kill itself by inflicting a wound with its sting in its own head is said to emanate from Spain , and is of considerable antiquity : it has been , moreover , attested by very high authority .
The phenomenon would , however , be so extraordinary that its occurrence has been much doubted .
Did it happen , it would stand as Romanes* says " as a unique case of an instinct detrimental alike to the individual and to the species .
" The subject has within recent years attracted a considerable amount of attention , and numerous conflicting statements based both upon incidental observations and upon definite experiments have been from time to time recorded .
Surgeon-General Bidie of Madras has describedf an experiment where he concentrated the sun 's rays with a burning glass upon the back of a scorpion , which thereupon stung itself and died .
Dr. Allen Thomson^ also brings forward corroborative evidence as to the effect of rays of light .
Mr. Gillman described experiments made with a circle of glowing charcoal in which he states that the scorpions died from their own sting .
Mr. R. F. Hutchinson S pointed out that the animals experimented upon by Mr. Gillman died from the excessive heat .
Mr. Gillman , however , subsequently pointed out that the temperature in the centre of such a circle of glowing charcoal as he used does not exceed 50 ' C. Mr. Curran S tried the same experiment " a score of times , " and # * Animal Intelligence , ' p. 225 .
