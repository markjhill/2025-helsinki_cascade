On the Circulation of the Blood in Insects .
By John Tyrrell , Esq. , A.M. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Secretary to the Royal Society .
The observations on the circulation of the blood in insects , which is a discovery of comparatively recent date , have been made almost exclusively on insects in the farva state 5 but the author of the present paper details a variety of observations of the same fact in insects which had arrived at their last or perfect stage of development .
Among the Myriapoda , the circulation was traced in the Geophilus , and still more distinctly in the Lithobiusforficalus .
The author also detected the circulation , by the motion of globules , through the nervures of the wings of various perfect insects , namely , of some species of the Hemerobius , Panorpa , Phryganea , and Ephemera ; and particularly in the Musca domestica , or common house-fly .
The paper is accompanied by drawings of the appearances described .
