[ Jan. 26 This bright band may very well correspond to the a Cygni enhanced iron lines 4549-64 and 4556-06 thrown together in the Centauri spectrum .
It is possible , though , that the dark line 4553-4 , quoted by Pickering , is only the dark interspace between the bright 4549-64 and 4556*06 lines .
It may be here remarked that among the brightest lines in the spectra of Novae at their initial stages are lines agreeing in position with the most marked a Cygni and enhanced Fe lines , and in this way we trace a resemblance between the minor bright lines of Centauri and the most conspicuous bright lines\#151 ; other than those of hydrogen \#151 ; in the early spectra of Novae .
Lines corresponding to these bright lines in Centauri also occur in the spectrum of y Cassiopeiae , but they are far less well-defined in the case of the latter star .
The wave-lengths of the p Centauri lines given in the table were reduced , by means of Hartmann 's formula , from measures made on Pickering 's reproduction , the fiducial lines used being 4121-0 ( He ) , Hyv and Hj3 .
" On Europium and its Ultra-violet Spectrum .

Europium was discovered in 1901 by Dema^ay , * accompanying samarium , from which he separated it by fractional crystallisation of the double nitrates of magnesium and the earths .
Dema^ay considered that his new earth was identical with De Boisbaudran 's Ze and Z\#163 ; , and was the same which I had announced in 1885f as giving an extremely sharp red line in the phosphorescent spectrum at wave-length 609\#151 ; an earth which in 1889J I said was a new one , and designated by the name of SS .
I detected the earth SS during an examination of the phosphorescent spectra given by some of the fractions of samaria and of yttria , neither of the earths being pure .
Europium is the first member of the terbium group , gadolinium being the second member .
On the other side it comes next to samarium , the last member of the cerium group .
Assuming the oxide of europium to be EU2O3 , the element has an atomic weight of 151*8 , from the analysis of its sulphate , Et^SO^SHgO .

551 MM .
Urbain and Lacombe* have sharply separated europium from samarium in the manner outlined by them in my note on gadolinium f by fractional crystallisation of the double nitrates of bismuth or magnesium with the nitrates of the rare earths .
I owe to the kindness of M. Urbain a sufficient quantity of the oxide of europium to enable me to obtain a good series of its photographed spectrum , a copy of which accompanies the present paper .
( Not reproduced .
) Exner and Haschek have measured the wave-lengths of the europium lines J from material supplied by Demar^ay .
A comparison of their lines with mine shows that the material was by no means pure .
Urbain 's europia is not quite so free from impurities as his gadolinia .
I have been able to detect in my photographs the following lines:\#151 ; Gadolinium is represented by very faint lines at 3450*55 , 3481*99 , 3585*10 , 3646*36 , 3654*79 , 3656*32 , 3664*76 , 3697*90 , 3699*89 , 3743*62 , 3768*52 , 3796*58 , 3805*70 , 3850*83 , 3851*16 , 4050*08 , 4225*33 .
Yttrium is represented by the line at 3774*51 , lanthanum by the line at 3988*66 , and calcium by the two lines at 3933*825 and 3968*625 .
No lines of bismuth or magnesium are to be seen .
Most of the lines of impurities are exceedingly faint , showing that the impurity is only present in very minute proportion .
Indeed , I have only mentioned them if they correspond with strong lines in the gadolinium or other spectra .
Both in the europium and the gadolinium spectrum I have not attempted to give wave-lengths of all the excessively laint lines .
If at some future time it becomes of interest or value to ascertain their wave-lengths , all the necessary data are present whereby they can be identified .
