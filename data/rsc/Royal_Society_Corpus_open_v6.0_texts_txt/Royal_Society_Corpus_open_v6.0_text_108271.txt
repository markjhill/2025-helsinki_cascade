On Benzoline , a new Organic Salt-basefrom Bitter Almond Oil .
By GEORGE FOWNES , Esq. , Ph. D. , F.R.S. Received May 9 , -Read May 29 , 1845 .
WVHEN pure oil of bitter almonds is left some days in contact with a strong solution of ammonia , at the ordinary temperature of the air , it is slowly , but in the end completely converted into a white crystalline substance , insoluble in water , but readily soluble in hiot alcohol .
The solidification of the oil is complete , and there is no secondary product .
This substance was examined by M. LAURENT* , who conferlred upon it the name of hydrobenzamide , and assigned to it the formula C42 IHI8 N2 ; it is generated by the union of the elements of two equivalents of ammonia with those of three equivalents of hydruret of benzoyle , and the separation of six equivalents of water .

LAURENT , no perceptible change .
I found however that when the boiling was prolonged for some hours , a change was induced resembling that undergone by furfurolamidet under similar circumstances .
A few brownish crystalline flocks appear in the solution , and after cooling , the cake of resin-like substance is found harder and less fusible than hydrobenzamide which has been nielted and left to solidify .
This change is unaccompanied by any notable alteration of weight , although a faint odour of bitter almond oil is disengaged during the whole course of the ebullition .
The new substance is an olganic salt-base , having the same composition as hydrobenzalnide itself ; it might perhaps with propriety be called benzoline .
The salts formed by this substance are for the most part remarkable for sparing solubility , with the exception of the acetate ; the hydrochlorate , the nitrate , and the sulphate are crystallizable ; the last-named salt is exceedingly beautiful , crystallizing from an acid solution in colourless prisms resembling those of oxalic acid .
Precipitated by ammonia from a cold solution of the hydrochlorate or sulphate , t See preceding paper .
benzoline separates in white curdy masses , which when washed and dried diminished greatly in volume when quite dry the powder is singularly electric ; if rubbed with a spatula its particles repel each other with violence , scattering the powder over the paper on which it lies .
It is not sensibly soluble in water , but dissolves with great ease in alcohol and ether .
A hot alcoholic solution left for some time deposits the base in brilliant transparent colourless crystals , which apparently have the form of square prisms with variously-terminated summits ; the alcoholic solution is strongly alkaline to test-paper .
At a temperature below 212 ?
benzoline melts , and on cooling assumes a transparent glassy state , without any tendency to crystallization .
Heated in a retort , it boils and at length entirely volatilizes , with scarcely a residue of charcoal .
Ammonia is disengaged during the distillation , a highly volatile oily liquid , having the odour of benzine , collects in the receiver , and a crystalline solid matter condenses in the neck of the retort .
This latter substance , which seems to be the most abundant product , has been but partially examined ; ittis described below under the name pyrobenzoline .
The action of oxidizing agents upon benzoline is remarkable .
When heated in a retort with a mixture of bichromate of potash , sulphuric acid and water , it is attacked with great energy , the mixture becomes dark green , and on distillation benzoic acid in large quantity passes over with the vapour of water .
With nitric acid the same change seems to occur , but the action is not so definite and speedy .
Hydrobenzamide , under similar circumstances , yields the same product , accompanied however in the first part of the distillation by a little bitter almond oil .
Melted hydrate of potash appears to exert no action on benzoline , unless the temperature be excessive .
The composition of this substance and its isomerism with hydrobenzamide , are shown by the following analyses:(1 .

It crystallizes from a hot solution in small but exceedingly brilliant colourless needles , which effloresce in the dry vacuum .
It has , in common with the other salts , an intensely bitter taste .

Pyrobenzoline.-T his , as before observed , is the solid product of the dry distillation of benzoline .
It is pressed between folds of bibulous paper to free it as much as possible from oily matter , and then crystallized from boiling alcohol , in which it dissolves pretty freely .
It is but sparingly soluble in alcohol in the cold , and apparently quite insoluble in water , dilute acids and alkalies .
It is tasteless , and the alcoholic solution has little or no alkaline reaction .
At a high temperature this substance fuses , and with still further increase of heat distils ; it sublimes at a temperature below its boiling-point , the vapour condensing in feathery crystals like those of benzoic acid .
Melted pyrobenzoline on cooling forms a mass of radiated crystals , presenlting a great contrast to the glassy or resinous appearance of benzoline under similar circumstances .
This substance was at first imagined to be a hydrocarbon ; it contains nitrogen , however , and gave on analysis the results stated below .

95 100'00 This , which appears to be a neutra"l body , together with its accompanying liquid product , deserves a more extended examination .
The hope which I ventured to express in a former paper of the formation of new organic bases from the volatile oils which unite with amlnonia , by subjecting their amides to the influence of agents , as caustic potash , capable of bringing about metamorphosis of the compolund into a more stable form or forms of combination , has thus been partially fulfilled .
M. LAURENT has recently announced the discovery of a new substance obtained from bitter almnond oil , isorneric with hydrobenzamide , possessing basic properties , and corresponding in some other respects with benzoline ; it is stated however to be volatile without decomposition , which is certainly not the case with that body .
The name amarine was conferred upon it* .
The publication of the experiments in detail will probably determine the identity or separate nature of the two sul)stances .
