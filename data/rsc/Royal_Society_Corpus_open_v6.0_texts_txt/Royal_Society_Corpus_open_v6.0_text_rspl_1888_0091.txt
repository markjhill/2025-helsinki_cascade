1889 ] The Spinal Curvature in an Aboriginal .
301 organism in different cultures .
Of particular interest is the fact , which is brought out in the quantitative results of the experiments made by both of us , that there is a great variation in the power of resistance possessed by the individual organisms in an ordinary cultivation , and that conditions which exert a rapidly destructive influence on the majority of the microbes , leave the more hardy individuals of the same culture unaffected .
I have already had occasion* to notice a similar result in experiments on the introduction of Koch 's comma spirilla and into drinking water ; in these experiments it was repeatedly observed that the greater proportion of the organisms which were inoculated into the water rapidly died off , whilst a small proportion survived much longer , and , in fact , subsequently exhibited multiplication .

The lumbo-vertebral index gives no information as to the character and degree of the lumbar curve of the vertebral column .
If it did so , we might assume that in the native Australian the lumbar region of the spine was curved so as to present a concavity to the front .
2 .
To estimate the extent and the degree of the different curves of the column it is necessary to examine fresh spines in which both the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks may be studied in conjunction with each other .
3 .
In the spine of the native Australian ( described in the extended paper ) the secondary curves ( i.e. , the cervical and the lumbar curves ) are strongly accentuated , whilst the primary curves ( i.e. , dorsal and sacral ) are not so marked .
In these particulars the Australian spine resembles somewhat the spine of a Chimpanzee .
4 .
The points of inflexion of the axial curvature of the vertebral column , in the case of the cervico-dorsal transition and the dorso-lumbar transition , are placed differently in the Australian from the corresponding points in the European female and the Chimpanzee .
I*1 the European the sacral curve is cut off in the most decided manner from the lumbar curve : not so in the Australian .
In the latter the first sacral vertebra just escapes being included in the ttmbar curve , and the importance of this is centred in the fact that w Q11 th\#174 ; Multiplication ot Micro -organisms .

24 , in the Chimpanzee the lumbar curve passes continuously into the sacral region , and involves one , or perhaps two , of its vertebrae .
In connexion with this question , it is interesting to note the close association which the last lumbar vertebra in the Chimpanzee exhibits with the sacrum .
The intervening disk of cartilage is very thin , and quite different from those above it .
Further , it is extremely common to find the last lumbar vertebra of the Chimpanzee pre-sen ting sacral characters and joined by osseous union to the sacrum .
In the Australian and European the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae are well separated from each other by a thick pad of inter-vertebral substance , but there is reason to believe that the last lumbar vertebra of the Australian more frequently exhibits sacral characters than the corresponding vertebra of the European .

A single glance at the tracing obtained from the mesial section of the Australian spine will be sufficient to dissipate any doubt thft| may be remaining regarding the presence of a lumbar convexity \#166 ; Si the vertebral column of this race .
Not only does it exist , but it exists in a very pronounced form .
The degree of curvature in the lumbar region of the Australian , while it falls slightly short of that which is seen in the Chimpanzee , corresponds closely with the degree of curvature in the European female .
At the same time we must not lose sight of the fact that the lumbar curve does not consolidate until adult life , and the Australian spine was taken from a girl who had only reached the age of sixteen .
It is more than probable , therefore , that the spine in question does not express the full amount of curvature of the lumbar region in this race .
7 .
In the Australian , the curvature in the lumbar region is entirely due to the strongly wedge-shaped form of the intervertebral disks .
If we lcrm an index for these , as has been done for the vertebral bodies , the amount which they contribute to the curve can be appreciated .
The following are the indices obtained for the Australian spine , and also the average indices of the spines of four Europeans : \#151 ; liumbo-vertebral Lumbo-infcerverfcebral index . .

In the extended paper the character of the lumbar axial curve is discussed , and it is shown to differ materially from that of tM European .
In both it is composed of the arcs of three circles .
TW parts entering into these , and the lengths of their respective radj| differ in the two cases markedly .
In the Australian the lower part o the curve is abrupt and sudden ; in the European it is more uniform throughout .

A sagitto-vertical index of the lumbar vertebrae suggests some Presents .

] interesting points .
In calculating this , the sagittal diameter of the different vertebral bodies is taken as the standard and compared with the axial vertical diameter .
This index is observed to present a direct relation to the proportion of bone and cartilage which enters into the construction of the lumbar column .
The higher the index the smaller is the amount of intervertebral substance , and vice versed .
This has been tested in the European , Australian , Chimpanzee , Baboon , Macaque , and Orang .
The European excels all these in the amount of cartilage as compared with bone in the lumbar region of the vertebral column .
In the erect attitude of man this greater amount of cartilage lessens the shocks transmitted upwards through the column .
In the prone or semi-prone position of the trunk the same provision is not so necessary .* Presents , January 24 , 1889 .
