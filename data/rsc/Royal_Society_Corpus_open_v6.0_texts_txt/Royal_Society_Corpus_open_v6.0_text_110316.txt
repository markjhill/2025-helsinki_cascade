1.An Account of the magnetical Experiments made on the Western Coast of Africa in 1830 and 183I , " by Commander Edward Belcher of H.M.S. Etna .
Communicated by the Rev. George Fisher , M.A. F.R S. , through Captain Beaufort , R.N. F.R.S. The object of the inquiry specified in this paper , and of which the results are given in a tabular form , was to determine the relative horizontal intensities of terrestrial magnetism on the different parts of the coast of Africa which the author has been lately employed in surveying .
The experiments were made with four needles constructed by Dollond on the model of those of Professor Hansteen ? .
and the permanence of their magnetism during the voyage was verified by a comparison of trials made in England before and since the voyage .
Errors arising from local causes of irregularity were guarded against by varying the places of observation at each station , and taking mean results .
