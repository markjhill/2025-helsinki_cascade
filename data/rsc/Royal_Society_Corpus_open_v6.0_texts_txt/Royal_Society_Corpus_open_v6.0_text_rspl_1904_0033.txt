This paper contains an account of a continuation of the work of Dr. P. Chappuis and the author , * on a comparison of the scale of the gas thermometer with that of certain specially-constructed platinum thermometers , from temperatures below zero up to the boiling point of sulphur , and in one case to a point close to 600 ' C. The results of this work substantially confirm the experiments of Callendar and Griffiths , and show that the indications of the platinum thermometer may be reduced to the normal scale by the aid of Callendar 's difference formula : where pt is the platinum temperature , T the temperature on the normal scale , and 8 a constant which , for pure platinum , does not differ much from the value P5 .
The temperatures chosen for the determination of are 0 ' C. , 100 ' C. , and the boiling point of sulphur .
In the present paper the work is extended to a temperature of 1000 ' C. Moreover , a number of standard thermo-junctions of platinum\#151 ; platinum-rhodium were included in the comparisons .
The gas-thermometer employed for this work was presented to the laboratory by Sir Andrew Noble ; it was obtained , along with materials for the electric furnaces and thermo-junctions , through the kindness of Dr. Holborn , of the Reichsanstalt .
The bulbs used were of porcelain , glazed inside and out , and the gas used was pure dry nitrogen .
The thermo-junctions , which were carefully compared by Dr. Holborn with the standards of the Reichsanstalt , at a number of fixed points up to 960 ' C. , were again tested and compared together before use , with concordant results .
A special potentiometer designed and made in the laboratory enabled the thermo-junction readings to be taken with great accuracy .

[ Jan. 20 The platinum thermometers employed were one of the three use\lt ; by Harker and Chappuis in their earlier work , and a new one con structed in the laboratory as one of a number belonging to the Britisl Association .
The different instruments , after determination of theii constants , were tested together in specially constructed electric resistant furnaces , heated from a special battery , in which temperatures from 400\#151 ; 1100 ' C. could be very steadily maintained for considerabh periods .
Special winding enabled a compensation to be made for th\lt ; greater cooling effect at the ends of the furnaces , so that over a considerable length the temperature was exceedingly uniform .
The following table gives the results of one series of comparisons , and indicates the agreement obtained:\#151 ; Second Series of Comparisons .

The readings of the platinum thermometers BA2 and Ko , which may be taken as representative instruments , when reduced to the air scale by the use of Callendar 's difference formula are , up to a temperature of 1000 ' C. , in reasonably close agreement with the results obtained from the constant volume nitrogen thermometer , employing chemical nitrogen , and using the received value for the dilatation of the Berlin porcelain , of which the bulb is made .

The above platinum thermometers agree very closely with a set or thermo-junctions representing the temperature scale of the Reiehsan-stalt , and based on measurements with a gas thermometer having a bulb of platinum-iridium .

] Spectra of Antarian Stars in Relation to Titanium.219 As the results of these experiments seem to justify very completely the use of Callendar 's parabolic formula over a wide range , a table has been calculated by which the value of T may be obtained directly from the value of P tfor a range of temperature extending from -200 to +1100 ' C. , and for the value 1'5 of the constant A second short table extends this to all values of 8 usually met with .
It is hoped that this table may be of general use to others who are employing platinum thermometers .
The experiments were carried out at the National Physical Laboratory , , and , in conclusion , I wish to thank those members of the staff who have assisted in it .
" The Spectra of Antarian Stars in delation to the Fluted Spectrum of Titanium .

[ Plate 6 .
] The distinguishing feature of the spectra of the Antarian Stars* is the system of apparently dark flutings , sharp towards the violet and fading off towards the red end of the spectrum .
The principal flutings are well seen in Antares , but they are more strongly developed in the spectra of a Herculis and o Ceti , in which stars additional details are also seen .
These flutings have not hitherto received a definite chemical interpretation , and it has been uncertain , owing to the possibly misleading effects of contrast , whether the spectrum was to be regarded as one consisting wholly of absorption flutings fading towards the red , or as one partly consisting of emission flutings fading in the opposite direction .
The purpose of the present communication is to state the nature of the evidence which indicates that the spectrum is essentially an absorption spectrum , and that the chief substance concerned in the production of the flutings is titanium , or possibly a compound of that element with oxygen .
The first indication of this result was the striking general resemblance of the titanium flutings , as seen in photographs recently obtained , with the stellar flutings , both as to relative intensity and apparent position ( Plate 6 ) .
The interspaces between the flutings , as they appear on a negative , in some cases also strongly recall the eorresponding bright spaces in the stellar spectra .
