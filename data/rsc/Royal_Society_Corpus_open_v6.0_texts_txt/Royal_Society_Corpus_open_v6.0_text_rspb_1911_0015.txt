328 Experiments to Ascertain if the Domestic Fowl of Uganda may Act as a Reservoir of the Virus of Sleeping Sickness [ Trypanosoma gambiense ) .

) Introduction .
Birds of various species are very numerous on the shores of Lake Yictoria .
Of these , cormorants , darters , herons ( African grey and purple , and other species ) , ibises ( glossy and sacred ) , fish-eagles , weaver birds ( various species ) , terns ( various species ) , gulls , geese ( Egyptian and spur-winged ) , plovers ( various species ) , pratincoles , storks , kingfishers and gallinules are the most common .
These birds all inhabit areas where the are numerous , and some evidence is forthcoming that in Nature the fly feeds on avian blood.* In view of the continued infectivity of the fly in the depopulated areas of the Lake-shore , it is clear that every effort should be made to ascertain the source of such infectivity .
Search for a reservoir of the virus of Sleeping Sickness at once suggests itself , and to those acquainted with the fauna of the Lake-shore , an avian host would be included amongst the various species requiring investigation .
Domestic fowls were employed in these experiments .
They are readily obtained , easily handled , and the flies feed greedily on them .
One species of trypanosome may in Nature only affect one species of avian host ; therefore , it follows that whatever the result of this series of experiments may be , that result is only applicable to the fowl .
The Commission trust that no wider significance will be attached to the conclusions set forth at the end of this paper : in other words , because a Uganda fowl is or is not a reservoir of Trypanosoma gambiense , it does not follow that a cormorant , or other bird , is or is not a reservoir .
It would have been better for this reason to have experimented with one or other of the various species of wild Lake-shore birds .
The difficulties were , however , too great at the time these experiments were carried out .
It is hoped that this paper will stimulate rather than discourage other workers to carry on this line of investigation .

Fowl of Uganda as a Reservoir of Virus of Sleeping Sickness .
329 In order to discover whether Uganda fowls can act as a reservoir of the virus of Sleeping Sickness , the Commission asked themselves the following questions:\#151 ; 1 .
Can fowls be infected with the virus of Sleeping Sickness by the bites of laboratory-bred and laboratory-infected Glossina , palpalis 2 .
Can fowls transmit the virus of Sleeping Sickness ( gambiense ) to clean laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis If this is possible , can the flies so infected convey the virus to normal susceptible animals ?
An answer in the affirmative to those two questions would throw suspicion on a possible avian host .
To decide these points , the following experiments were devised and carried out:\#151 ; Can Foxds be Infected with the Virus of Sleeping Sickness ( gambiense ) by the Bites of Laboratory-bred and Laboratory-infected Glossina palpalis 1 The method adopted to infect the fowls was carried out as follows:\#151 ; Clean Glossina palpalis , hatched out in the laboratory , were given their first feeds on a monkey whose blood contained many Trypanosoma gambiense .
An interval of at least 24 hours was then allowed to elapse before the infected flies were first fed on the fowl .
The fowl was then fed on , for varying periods , by these flies .
To make certain the flies were infective , their infectivity was usually tested by their being allowed to bite normal susceptible animals during the experiment .
Finally , to discover if the fowl had become infected with Trypanosoma gambiense by the bites of the Glossina palpalis:\#151 ; ( a ) The fowl 's blood was examined frequently throughout the experiment for Trypanosoma gambiense .
( b ) The fowl was killed and its centrifuged heart or jugular vein blood was carefully examined microscopically for Trypanosoma gambiense .
( c ) Two or more cubic centimetres of the centrifuged blood were injected into a normal susceptible animal on one or more occasions during the experiment .
Two typical experiments are given in detail .

Remarks.\#151 ; In these experiments it is seen that 1820 laboratory-bred and laboratory-infected Glossina palpalis were fed on 13 fowls , with uniformly negative results .
With one exception , Experiment 1915 c , the flies were proved to be infective by feeding them on animals susceptible to Trypanosoma gambiense infection .
That the fowls had not become infected with Trypanosoma pam hie use was proved by carrying out the three tests given above , under headings a , b , and c. In Experiment 2325 , the liver , spleen and bone-marrow of Fowl 2334 were also examined for trypanosomes , and 10 c.c. of the pooled pulp injected into a normal monkey .
This monkey remained healthy .
A further series of experiments ' bearing on this question was carried out .
These experiments are not so complete .
The procedure was as follows:\#151 ; A varying number of laboratory-bred were fed for several .days on Trypanosoma gainbiense-udected antelope .
The infected flies were then fed for varying periods on fowls .
The fowls were then killed and 2 c.c. of their blood were injected into a normal monkey .
The monkey 's blood was examined for Trypanosoma gambiense bi-weekly for a month after the injection of the fowl 's blood .
The experiments are given in tabular form .

However , as results have been recorded by the Commission where Glossina palpalis have infected susceptible animals as early as the 18th day of an experiment , it has been decided to publish these experiments .
Can Folds Transmit the Virus of Sleeping Sickness to clean Laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis l If this is possible , can the Flies so Infected convey the Virus to Formal Susceptible Animals ?
In view of the results obtained by the first series of experiments , it would seem somewhat unnecessary to follow this question further .
It has so far been proved that the blood of fowls which have been fed upon by infected Glossina palpalis is non-infective when injected into susceptible animals .
It has now to be ascertained if the blood of such fowls is also incapable of infecting the fly .
This would constitute additional evidence against the fact that fowls act as a reservoir of Trypanosoma gamhiense .
Cages of laboratory-bred and laboratory-infected Glossina palpalis , which were known to be infective , were fed on fowls for a varying number of days .
Next , clean laboratory-bred flies were fed on these fowls for several days .
The flies w ?
ere then fed on normal susceptible animals ( monkeys ) , in the endeavour to infect such animals with Trypanosoma gambiense , and so prove that the blood of the fowl was infective .

Remai'Tcs.\#151 ; It will be seen that 400 laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis fed on the three fowls , Experiments 1927 , 1926 , and 2087 , subsequently failed to infeet monkeys with the virus of Sleeping Sickness , and that all the 283 Glossina dissected throughout these experiments were negative for flagellates .
This absence of flagellates in the flies is interesting , because Fowl 1927 and Fowl 1926 were both found to be naturally infected with a large avian trypanosome .
It would thus seem that this fowl trypanosome does not undergo development in Glossina palpalis .
Conclusion .
The Uganda fowl cannot act as a reservoir of the virus of Sleeping Sickness .
