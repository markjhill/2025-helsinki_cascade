A Meteorological Journal , principally relating to Atmospheric Electricity ; kept at Knightsbridge , from the 9th of May , 1789 , to the 8th of May , 1790 .
By Mr. John Read ; communicated by R. H. A. Bennet , Esq. F. R. S. Read April 14 , 1791 .
A DESCRIPTION of the instrument for collecting atmospheric electricity , used in the following journal .
Tab. V. represents the apparatus .
AA is a round deal rod , 20 feet long , 2 inches diameter at the lower , and one inch at the upper end .
Into the lower end of it is cemented a solid glass pillar B , 22 inches long ; the lower end of the glass stands in a hole made for it in a pedestal of wood C , which slips on the fore-part of an iron bracket D , which is driven into the wall , and supports the whole .
About 13 feet above the bracket D , is fixed to the wall a strong arm of wood E , which holds perpendicularly a strong glass tube F , through which the rod is slided gently upwards , till the glass pillar B may be lowered into the hole made for it in C. It is thus fixed , and stands 12 inches from the wall .
The tube F is of sufficient width to admit a case of cork , which is fastened in the inside of it , at the part where the tube is sustained by the arm of wood E , so that the rod , when bent by the wind , cannot touch the tube or break it .
The upper extremity of the rod is terminated by several sharp-pointed wires G. Two of them are of copper , each one-eighth of an inch thick ; and , in order to stiffen the rod , as well as conduct more readily the electric fluid , one of those wires is twisted round the rod to the right hand , and the other to the left , as low down as the brass collar at the vertex of the lower funnel H , to which they are soldered , in order to render their contact perfect .
The tin funnels HH serve to defend the glasses B and F from the weather , which glasses are also covered with sealing-wax to render their insulation more perfect .
At a convenient height from the floor , a hole is bored through the wall at I. This hole receives a glass tube covered with sealing-wax , through which a strong brass wire proceeding from the rod is conveyed into the room , where just at the end of the glass tube it passes through a twoinch brass ball L , and proceeding a little farther , keeps suspended at its extremity a pith ball electrometer K , so that the electrometer may be about twelve inches distant from the wall .
On the outside of the wall there is a wooden box M , to keep that end of the glass tube dry .
At two inches distance of the above-mentioned brass ball L , a bell N is supported by a strong wire , which passing through another hole made in the wall , is made to communicate , by means of a good metallic continuation R , with the moist ground adjoining to the house .
A brass ball , three-tenths of an inch in diameter , is suspended between the bell N and ball L , by a silk thread fastened to a nail O. This ball serves for a clapper , by striking between the ball and bell , when the electrical charge of the rod is sufficiently strong .
P is a small table fixed to the wall under the bell and ball , at a convenient height above the floor , upon which Leyden bottles and other apparatus are occasionally placed .
Any person versed in the science of electricity , will easily understand that this apparatus is calculated to show the various degrees of atmospherical electricity , and at the same time to avoid the pernicious effects which may be occasioned by thunder-storms , or in short by any great quantity of electricity in the atmosphere .
The whole perpendicular height of both parts taken together , from the moist earth to the uppermost point at the top of the rod , is 52 feet .
Finding , however , that , notwithstanding all the precaution I had taken to procure a good insulation , the moist vapour of the atmosphere , fixing upon the insulating parts of the apparatus , rendered it imperfect in moist weather ; I have lately ( 15th of Sept. 1790 ) altered the situation of the same rod , so that all the insulating parts are now within the roof of the house .
This I have effected by a hole through the roof of my house ; by which means I now obtain a considerably more constant electricity ; which , however , must not be solely attributed to the superiority of my present mode of insulating , but to the rod 's being also elevated to the additional height of nine feet ; so that I consider its pointed part to be at present 61 feet above the moist earth .
This improvement of the apparatus , having been made after the conclusion of this journal , will be particularly described in the next , which I am now carefully continuing .
It will be necessary just to mention the method I have pursued in forming the journal of atmospheric electricity .
This has been principally by means of the signs exhibited by the pith balls K , connected with the rod .
When I find these closed , and not attracted by my finger , I then write no signs of electricity .
When attracted on the approach of my finger , yet not sufficiently charged to repel each other , I write weak signs of the fluid .
When I find the balls open , and , on the approach of excited glass , the balls close , I write they are electrified posiC c2 tively ; tively ; but , if the balls open wider , I write they are electrified negatively ; and the reverse when I use sealing-wax .
When the balls diverge one inch and upwards , visible sparks may be drawn at the brass ball L. When sparks are said to have been perceived in any observation , I have generally on that account omitted to note the variable quantities of divergency in the pith balls .
Their utmost limit of regular divergency seems to be about five or near six inches ; above that they are unsteady and disorderly .
The pith balls are near two-tenths of an inch in diameter , suspended by very fine flaxen threads ( in the state it is in from the heckle ) five inches long .
When I mention the distance of the balls in tenths of an inch , it is to be understood as nearly so as my eye can determine .
This apparatus requires a constant attention , especially during a disturbed state of the atmosphere .
From the room in which the apparatus is placed I am seldom absent one hour , excepting the time of sleep ; but , when I leave it , the last thing I do at night is to examine the state of the electricity , and , if I find the rod unelectrified , I then place the Leyden bottle on the table P , with its knob nearly in contact with the ball L. The next morning , if I find this bottle charged , I write the kind of electricity it is charged with against the day in the journal , and add , by the night bottle .
It is presumed , that the table is sufficiently obvious .
The two columns for positive and negative electricity are used only for the first observation of each day .
I use FAHRENHEIT'S thermometer , suspended on the north outside of a bow window .
The time of making the observation with it , and the barometer , and also of the direction of the wind , has usually been about nine o'clock in the morning .
Lastly , it may be useful to observe , that I have always found the lower though uninsulated part of the apparatus ( viz. the metallic connection of the bell N with the moist earth ) to be in a contrary state of electricity to the upper and insulated part , where the pith balls K are suspended .
See the 22d of Aug. Having made a memorandum of the several thunderstorms which have happened in divers parts of this island , according to the information by letters , and from newspapers , I thought it useful to insert them in this journal , in order to show whether some contemporaneous appearances in my apparatus might not be attributed to them .
This seems evidently to have been the case on the 3d of September .

A very cloudy morning , though at too great a height for my rod ; but in the afternoon the clouds approached much nearer , and the rod became charged pretty strongly positive , which continued about one hour and a quarter .
I charged some Leyden bottles with the fluid , some positive , others negative , for there were four gradual changes of the electricity .

Nine o'clock A. M. a heavy shower of rain fell , the rod became strongly charged with negative electricity , all the time the shower lasted , which was short and sudden .
One hour afterwards , the electricity changed to a strong positive , the bell suddenly began to ring , and continued to do so five minutes ; the pith balls then close slowly , and open negative , and continued weakly so the rest of the day .
At Edinburgh , some lightning and thunder this day , June 1 SW 29.71 53 strong pos .

The electric charge in rod was most beautiful this day .
In about six hours time I observed seven changes of the electricity ; five of those changes were gradual .
The balls opened from 3 to 4 inches , and remained so from 15 to 20 minutes each opening , then gradually closed ; the other two charged slowly , but closed very quick .

There were 12 changes of the electricity , all gradual , except one , which was instantaneous ; the balls sometimes exhibited a waving motion , and sometimes sudden jerks .
There were several showers of rain , and two of hail ; during the fall of hail , the rod was most powerfully electrified , the bell rang very strongly ; the effects and appearances were so awful , that I kept at a good distance from the rod .
A great deal of lightning on the east side of Kent and Essex this day .

This morning several heavy clouds passed over , coming from the SW , by which the rod became moderately electrified negatively .
Some rain fell , which increased the electrical charge .
But , in the afternoon , the wind and clouds put on a more ominous appearance ; near five o'clock , began a storm of wind , rain , lightning , and thunder ; but the main weight of the storm did not come near my rod .
Its dire effects must be east of London : nevertheless , I had those usual beautiful appearances which attend a strong charge in the rod .
The storm lasted one full hour , during which time there were five successive changes of the electricity , viz. four gradual ones , attended with sudden jerks or starts , which often diminished the divergency of the pith balls from 4 inches to 2 inches or less .
After those jerks the pith balls recovered their former degree of divergency , sometimes suddenly , and at other times slowly .
The other change happened instantaneously , the pith balls collapsing and opening so quickly , that the eye could barely see their motion .
There were two other instantaneous closings and openings of the balls , without a change of the electricity .

Three o'clock P.M. I saw a thunder storm approaching .
While the storm remained at a considerable distance , the rod was very highly charged with negative electricity , and continued so three quarters of an hour ; during which time distant thunder was heard .
Sometimes the balls were affected with a jerking , at others a waving , motion .
The wind now shifted to the SE , and a heavy rain soon came on ; the electricity now changed to positive , and the bell now rings briskly ; every appearance ( both within and without the room ) was tremendously awful .
I therefore seated myself upon a large insulated stool , where I could with safety observe the apparatus .

o ball L. This bottle charged and spontaneously discharged almost as quick as I could notice them ; and at the same time there was a continual flashing of dense sparks between the bell and brass ball L. These very grand appearances only lasted ten minutes , and the scene was terminated by a clap of thunder ; but the storm , and its effects on the rod , lasted near two hours .
I saw no lightning but what was in the apparatus .
There were nine gradual changes of the electricity , from negative to positive , &amp;c. I had purposely placed a large glass bowl , upon an insulated table , in the open air , to catch the falling electrified rain .
As soon as the bottom of the bowl was well covered with the rain water of the above storm , to my great satisfaction , a pair of linen threads I had placed for the purpose diverged near two inches ; the water remained electrified near ten minutes after it was taken into the house .

There were several showers of rain , and one of hail ; during the latter , the electric charge in the rod was most intense ; the sparks darted between the ball and bell extremely sharp and quick .
I found the moisture in the air of the room was now electrified , also the bell , and its metallic connexion with the earth , and even the bricks in the wall to which the metal is fastened were all electrified with an electricity contrary to that in the insulated part of the apparatus .

Though every circumstance was favourable for a strong electrification , yet the charge in the rod was but weak .
My suspicion led me to try the state of the uppermost end of the rod , and I found it to be a contrary state of electricity to that at the lower end of it ; the middle part of the rod was in its natural state , that is , showed no signs of being electrified ; therefore the rod was only ( at this time ) influentially electrified .

o five o'clock appearances were dreadful ; in five minutes time the strong gale of wind became a storm from SE .
This storm of wind ( for there was but little rain ) carried the huge black clouds to the NW , for there I saw abundance of red lightning a little above the horizon , and I once heard a rumbling of thunder .
The rod before the storm was positive , but by it was changed to negative , and continued so during the whole time .
The electricity of the rod often varied in strength , sometimes weak , sometimes strong , without change of kind .
At Amersham , in Berkshire , and at the same time at the Earl of Aylesford 's park , near Packington , in Warwickshire , was a most tremendous storm of hail , rain , lightning , and thunder , from 4 to 6 o'clock P.M. Sept. 4 SE 29.50 68 small neg .

P.M. This was obtained in the following manner .
Soon after sunset I perceived a light-coloured dewy vapour arise 20 or 30 inches above the ground in the park ; the evening being serene and fair , I stood upon an insulated stool , and waved my exploring rod among the dew * , and with my finger touched a sensible electrometer , which instantly opened with positive electricity .
As the evening advanced , a strong fog filled the air ; when it was of sufficient height for the high or fixed rod , this also became electrified with the same kind of electricity which I had received near the earth 's surface .

However , it is the first day it has wholly failed me .
A moist air * When I find that the moisture in the air has so far injured the insulation of my high-pointed rod , that it will not retain the electric fluid ; in that case , I make use of a small rod which I hold in my hand , and project through an upper window ; having first warmed the stool legs , I place myself upon it , &amp;c. I find this method to be a good substitute in damp weather .
The rod is about the length and strength of a fishing-rod , with plenty of small wire twined round it .

Remarks on the phenomenon exhibited by the rod on the 31st of August .
I was for a long time extremely puzzled to account for the rapid changes which the pith balls on some days so frequently exhibited ; being positive one minute , then negative for another , and the next returning again to positive .
From often considering this apparently whimsical changeableness in nature , I was at length induced to suspect , what indeed was afterwards confirmed by actual experiment , viz. that some of these changes are only apparent , and not real , they being occasioned not by the actual communication of a different sort of electricity , but merely by the action of electrical atmospheres ; thus , when an electrified cloud comes within a certain distance of the rod , and before it comes near enough to impart to it some of its own electricity , the electrical atmosphere of the former , agreeable to the well known laws of electricity , will disturb the electric fluid naturally belonging to the rod , and will consequently occasion several apparent changes in the electrometer , which changes an unexperienced observer would attribute entirely to the change of electricity in the clouds .
This observation was evidently confirmed by the phenomenon observed on the 31st of August ; and thence it appears , that the real number of changes from positive to negative , or from negative to positive electricity , cannot be so great as it is shown by the electrometer affixed to the rod .
I cannot help lamenting with Signor BECCARIA , that there are so few high pointed rods erected to ascertain the electrical state of the earth and atmosphere at all times ; but more particularly during thunder storms .
If there had been pointed rods , for instance , at Whitehaven and Lancaster on the 6th of October , and well attended to at the time of the storm of lightning and thunder , which happened at both places nearly at the same time , it would then have been known , whether the apparatus might not be positive at one place when it is negative at the other .
