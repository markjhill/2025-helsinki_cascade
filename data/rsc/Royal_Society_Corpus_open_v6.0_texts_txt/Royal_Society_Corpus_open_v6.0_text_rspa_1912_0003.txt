Magnifiea- Note on the Monatomicity of Neon , Krypton , and Xenon .
By Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , E.R.S. ( Received November 13 , \#151 ; Read November 23 , 1911 .
) The monatomicity of neon , krypton , and xenon has been taken for granted oil somewhat insufficient evidence .
When the memoir on Argon and its companions* was written it was stated that no experiments with the pure gases had been carried out on the ratio between the specific heat at constant volume and constant pressure , but that measurements made with impure samples indicated the ratio 1*67 ; and it was remarked that such a ratio could not have been found had any considerable portion of the mixture consisted of a polyatomic gas .
Having now at my disposal relatively large quantities of pure neon , which had served Mr. Watson , and of pure krypton and pure xenon , which had served Prof. Moore , for determining the densities of these gases , it appeared advisable to fill the gaps in our knowledge of their specific heat ratios .
The apparatus was similar to the one described in the memoir on Argonf ; the wave-length of sound in neon wTas compared by Kundt 's method with that in air ; and the krypton and xenon , previously frozen and purified by pumping them free of any possible content of air , were also investigated in the same manner .

1*642 7 for krypton ... ... .
1*689 7 for xenon ... ... ... 1*666 These numbers approximate within the limits of experimental error to the theoretical ratio 1*667 , and it therefore follows that neon , krypton , and xenon , like helium and argon , must be regarded as monatomic .
Their molecular and their atomic weights are identical .
