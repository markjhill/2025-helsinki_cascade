39 I circle , on the north brow of the hill , the zenithal direction is disturbed to-1 wards the north and the astronomical latitude is too great .
There is only one point in this investigation upon which a doubt can be I suggested as possible , namely the evaluation of the micrometer-scale .
It I was thus conducted:\#151 ; The micrometer-plate contains 26 wires , and the fixed part of the instrument contains 25 crosses , each interval being nearly 256 " .
With this arrangement every wire-interval is measured with great ease , and the whole series of 25 intervals is accurately obtained in terms of the micrometer .
By placing the instrument in a proper position , the same intervals are obtained in time of the star 's transit , which is easily converted into arc .
The comparison of these gives the value of micrometer-divisions which has been employed .
The following verification , of somewhat inferior accuracy , has been made by measures of the instrument .
It appears that the ray of light passes through 0 9 inch of glass , 35*3 inches of water , and 0*8 inch of air , nearly ( the measure of the last being slightly uncertain ) .
Remarking that the dividing surfaces are horizontal and plane , it is easily seen that the micrometer-scale ought to be such as is due to an air-telescope whose length in inches = + -fUj + 0*8 \#151 ; 27*8 inches .
And from this , with observation of transit of the star , it was found that the measure of 25 intervals of wires ought to be 0'8693 inch : as measured with a pair of compasses , it was found sometimes 0'871 , sometimes 0'8/ 5 .
The agreement is fully as close as can be expected from the rudeness of the operation , and shows distinctly that there can be no error of principle in the method of evaluing the micrometer-scale .

( Abstract .
) This paper contains the results of a series of magnetic observations taken in the east of France during the months of August and September 1869 , and is a continuation of the paper on the survey of the west of France , published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1870 , p. 33 .
No change was made in the observers , nor in the methods of observation , during the two surveys ; and the only alteration in the instruments was the substitution in 1869 of a Jones theodolite in lieu of the small altazimuth by Cook used in 1868 .
Observations were made at twenty-one stations in the following order:\#151 ; Paris , Rheims , Metz , Strasbourg , Issenheim , Dole , Mont Rolland , Dijon , Lyons , Avignon , Marseilles , Monaco , Montpellier , Grenoble , N. D. de 40 Magnetic Survey of the East of France in 1869 .

The yearly acceleration will therefore be \#151 ; 0'"00082 for the dip in 1863*5 , the value found by General Sabine for the epoch 1780 to 1830 being -0'*00085 .
As regards the horizontal force , the secular variation in the east of France is considerably less than in the west ; but the change for the whole of France is almost identical with that deduced by Dr. Lamont for 1858 , the yearly acceleration being less than 0*000007 .
A comparison of the lines of equal dip , declination , intensity , and horizontal force , deduced from the observations taken in the east and west of France , leads to the following conclusions .
The isoclinals are found to be rather further apart and more inclined to the geographic meridian , but receding less quickly from it , in the east than in the west ; the isogonics are more distant from each other , but make a less angle with the meridian , in the east than in the west ; but the results obtained from the declination observations of 1869 are less trustworthy than those for 1868 , on account of the unsteadiness of the new theodolite .
The distance between the isodynamics does not sensibly vary for east 1871 .

" On the Behaviour of Supersaturated Saline Solutions when exposed to the Open Air .
" By Charles Tomlinson , F.R.S. Received July 26 , 1871 .
It is a remarkable proof of the difference between the air of a room and that of a field or garden in the country , that supersaturated saline solutions , which crystallize the moment they are uncovered in a room , may be kept uncovered in an open space during many hours without crystallizing .
During the last three years I have made many experiments to confirm this conclusion in the little garden at the back of my house at Highgate .
I have no doubt that in a more open space further in the country the results would have been more perfect ; but still I venture to think they are sufficiently striking to merit a place in the * Proceedings/ The following were conducted during the spring of the present year .
A solution of two parts of sodic sulphate and one part of water was boiled and filtered into 3- and 4-ounce flasks , of which the opening of the short cylindrical neck is just three-quarters of an inch .
The filtered solutions were reboiled and the flasks covered with watch-glasses .
One flask was placed on a stool in the middle of a gravel-walk and the watch-glass removed .
I now proceed to quote from my note-book some results iu the order of time , and then to summarize them .
1871 , March 17 .
Put out flask containing cold solution at 12.30 p.m. ; temp. 56 ' Fahr. ; clouds , and afterwards sun , 60 ' and upwards .
At 2.50 , therm. 50 ' .
At 4.30 found the solution solid , and upon it a speck of soot which had evidently acted as a nucleus .
At 5.30 put out flask ; temp. 43 ' , with slight wind ; 6.30 , 41 ' ; 7.30 , 42 ' , with a good deposit of the seven-atom salt .
At 9 , temp. 40 ' , and deposit much increased .
At 11 , solution solid , and the seven-atom deposit chalky white .
March 18 .
2.15 , put out flask and uncovered it under clear sky .
At 4 , temp. 57 ' , fine crop of crystals , evidently due to evaporation , which was so powerful that a round patch immediately below the opening of the neck was white and pulverulent from the formation of anhydrous salt .
In this case the crystallization took place , as in the case of a saturated solution , in an open dish , only much more quickly , on account of the much larger quantity of salt in the supersaturated solution .
There was no formation of the seven-watered salt* .
