332 A Case of Regeneration Polychcete Worms .
By Arnold T. Watson , F.L.S. ( Communicated by C. S. Sherrington , F.R.S. Received October 23 , 1905 , \#151 ; Read January 18 , 1906 .
) The facts recorded in the following note were ascertained in the course of my observations made upon a marine rock-boring polychsete worm found at Tenby in the spring of the present year .
This worm , a species of Potamilla , is living in limestone rock , in which another species of the same genus , Potamilla reniformis , is also burrowing .
It differs from the latter in various particulars , amongst which may be noted the absence of eyes on the branchial filaments , the colour of the blood ( which is red instead of being sometimes green ) , the form of the setae , and the character of the external tube , which is largely covered , especially at the tip , with minute pieces of shell attached edgewise , imparting to it a white , rugged appearance , somewhat similar to that of the tube of Owenia .
The worm is sometimes as much as 3-^inches long , and is seldom extracted entire from the rock , fragments only , of varying length , usually being obtained .
It occurred to me that this material might be utilised for the study of the regeneration of the lost parts , and my experiments in that direction succeeded beyond my expectations .
Not only did the fragments renew these parts ( both anterior and posterior ) but they demonstrated the existence of a power to economise labour in this respect , by changing the arrangement of certain of the old parts , so as to complete the model of the original animal .
The body of the worm in question consists of a large number of segments , all of which , with the exception of those at the two extremities , are endowed with a set of hooks ( uncini ) and bristles ( setae ) on either side , and it is one of the characteristics of the Sabellidae , the family to which this worm belongs , that the character and arrangement of these appendages in the anterior or thoracic portion differs from that in the posterior or abdominal part .
The setae in the former are situated dorsally and the uncini ventrally , whilst in the abdominal portiou the uncini are dorsal and the setae ventral .
This arrangement , besides enabling the worm to rotate on its long axis in either direction at will , also facilitates the bringing of its thoracic ventral glandular plates and collar-lobes into contact with the inner surface and top of the tube , and is probably connected with the tube-forming habits of the worm .
Some of the fragments which I have had under observation were without head and thorax , and consisted of abdominal segments only , the setae and uncini consequently being ventral and dorsal respectively , from end to end .

A Case of Regeneration in Polychcete Worms .
333 In cases of regeneration my experience has been that new segments are much more freely produced at the posterior than at the anterior extremity of the body , and the problem which occurred to me was , , and in what length of time , the thoracic segments ( about eight in number ) , with the inverted arrangement of chsetal appendages , which is needful to the life-work of the worm , would be reproduced .
The answer came in the nature of a surprise .
Beside the cephalic plume-bearing segment , one new setigerous thoracic segment only was formed , but the chaetal plan of the succeeding five or nine abdominal segments was changed ; the dorsal uncini in these segments first disappearing gave place to setae , and later the ventral setae were replaced by uncini ; the new setae and uncini , moreover , were changed to the forms characteristic of this part of the body .
In other words , so far as the chaetal plan is concerned , a new thorax had been constructed from the abdominal segments .
How far the internal structure has been affected by the change remains to be ascertained .
The observations extended over a period of five weeks , and were made upon two portions of apparently one and the same worm .
One portion ( comprising the two parts marked a and c on the figure ) , about f inch long and consisting of 69 abdominal segments , being minus head and thorax , as well as the anal , and numerous preanal segments ; the other part , \#163 ; inch long ( probably the hinder portion of c ) , consisting of 36 preanal and the anal segment .
In order to expose a large surface of water to the air and bring the animals as near thereto as possible , the experiments were carried on in watch-glasses , fresh sea-water being supplied twice daily .
The first fragment , ac , in course of a day or two , attached itself to the watch-glass by means of a narrow cord or loop which it secreted , and which served , by a constant twisting movement of the animal , to sever the portion , c , | inch long , and consisting of 18 of the posterior segments .
The number of parts available for observation was thus increased to three .
Each was placed in a separate watch-glass , to which it attached itself slightly by a secretion from the ventral surface , and each part succeeded in changing the chaetal arrangement of certain abdominal segments into that of thoracic ones , as follows\#151 ; in a , nine segments became thoracic ; in c , five ; and in b , nine .
The normal number of thoracic segments in the few adult specimens which have passed through my hands is eight ( in one case it is nine ) , but the number appears to vary considerably in any given species of Sabellid .
The number of abdominal segments transformed is possibly , to some extent , regulated by the total number of segments contained in the fragment undergoing repair , but it may also be dependent upon the number of thoracic A Case of Regeneration in Polychcete Worms .

] In the winter of 1903 we presented to the Royal Society a preliminary account of the results of our investigations on the cytology of malignant or cancerous growths , in which we stated that we had recognised a certain type of nuclear division , known as the heterotype , to occur in the cells of these pathological tissues .
Hitherto , this peculiar kind of mitosis , characterised by a reduction to one-half of the normal number of the somatic chromosomes , together with highly characteristic forms of their bodies themselves , had only been known to occur in connection with the so-called reduction division , that , in animals , immediately precedes the formation of the sexual elements .
These reduction divisions constitute a well-knowm phase in the life cycle of all higher animals and plants , consisting invariably of two consecutive stages , which are distinguished as heterotype and homotype mitoses respectively .
As these two mitoses constitute so well-defined a stage in the cellular life history of the higher organisms , we have proposed to emphasise this fact by the introduction of the term " maiosis , " designating the stage itself as the maiotie phase .
Thus the heterotype and homotype mitosis form respectively the first and second maiotie division .
We propose , in the present paper , to deal more fully with the cytological details of malignant growths , in so far as we have been able to investigate them , and we shall endeavour briefly to point out the conclusions that we think may legitimately be drawn from them .
In doing this we desire , as far as possible , to confine ourselves to a consideration of the evidence we have been able personally to obtain , and we propose to avoid a general discussion of the numerous theories as to the aetiology of the disease , and especially of those that are based on clinical experience , except in so far as our own 336 Prof. Farmer , Messrs.
