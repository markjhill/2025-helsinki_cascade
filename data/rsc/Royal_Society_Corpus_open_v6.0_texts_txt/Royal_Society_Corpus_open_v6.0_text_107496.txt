X. Observations on the Dip and Variation of the Magnetic Needle , and on the Intensity of the Magnetic Force ; made during the late voyage in search of a North West Passage .
By Captain Edward Sabine , of the Royal Regiment of Artillery , F. R. S. and F. L. S. Read February 25 , 1819 .
1 HE dipping needle used in these observations is the property of HENRY BROWNE , Esq. ; it was made by Messrs. NAIRNE and BLUNT , and is similar in construction to one made by the same artists , and described by the Hon. HENRY CAVENDISH in the 66th volume of the Philosophical Transactions , as used in the house of the Royal Society .
Previously to delivering it into my charge , Mr. BROWNE had adjusted the balance of the needle by means of the screws on the cross of wires attached to its axis ; so that no alteration took place in the indication of the dip , on reversing the poles .
The instrument was placed in the direction of the magnetic meridian , by a compass stationed at a sufficient distance , and suffered to remain during the observations for the purpose of occasional verification .
When time admitted , the correctness of adjustment was also proved , by observing the minimum of dip .
An equal number of observations were made with the face of the instrument towards the east and towards the west ; the arcs indicated at both ends of the needle were read .
In determining the intensity of the magnetic force , the needle wwas drawn to an horizontal position by a magnet , and being released at an observed moment of time , was suffered to oscillate until the arcs became too small to be readily distinguished the first arc was thus equal to the dip , and at every tenth vibration both the arc and time were noted .
The observations in the magnetic meridian were repeated with the face of the instrument towards the east and towards the west .
It is highly satisfactory to notice the agreement of the results which were obtained in London and in Shetland , at different periods , and by different observers ; showing that the adjustment of the balance of the needle was preserved during the voyage , notwithstanding the accidents to which it was liable : and as a testimony of the excellence of the instrument , and of the confidence which may be placed in observations made with it .

ts w__ 51 31 70 33 It is probable that the needle was affected by local attraction either on the gth or on the igth of June ; but on which day it is difficult to say .
On the gth the ships were anchored to an iceberg of very considerable size , on which the observations were made , the instrument being removed as far as possible from the ships .
On the igth it was used in the observatory which was erected on Hare Island ; every fastening of this ingenious and useful building was of brass , and the greatest care was taken to prevent the needle being disturbed by local or accidental causes .
But there were several basaltic columns on the face of a hill which rose immediately from the observatory , which may have had an influence ; as these columns on Hare Island are said , by Professor GIEsECKE , * to have a powerful effect on the needle .

Observations to determine the variation of the needle , in Davis 's Strait , and Baffin 's Bay .
The azimuth compasses used in these observations were constructed on an improved plan , the invention of Captain KATER .
It is thus described in the " Instructions for the use of the Instruments furnished to the Northern Expeditions , " printed by order of the Royal Society : ( " The compass is five inches diameter ; by means of an inclined mirror and lenses , the degrees are seen by reflection considerably magnified ; a line drawn on a piece of ivory is viewed at the same time , and serves as an index by which the degrees are to be read off .
' At the opposite side of the box is a sight on which slides , in a frame , the segment of a glass cylinder , ground to a radius of five inches .
By means of this , a fine line of light is thrown on the index , and may be seen at the same time as the degrees on the card .
The degrees on the card are read from the north towards the east , and are carried round to 860o , in order to obviate the possibility of error in this respect .
" The observations were made either on shore or on the ice , sufficiently distant from the ship to be beyond the influence of her attraction .
The compass was placed on a copper fastened stool , and was carefully levelled by means of a spirit level , to ensure the perpendicularity of the sight vane .
Each altitude and azimuth is a mean of several observations , the compass being removed and , levelled afresh between every one , thus making each faithfully distinct .
The mean Greenwich time is given , as it determines the amount of the sun 's polar distance .
The latitudes and longitudes are of the spot , deduced by the ship 's log from the nearest observed .
The altitudes are corrected for index error only , the letters or signs annexed denote the limb , and whether by reflection or by the natural horizon .
The observed azimuths are of the sun 's centre cleared of index error ; the compasses used were No. i and 2 , supplied to the Isabella , and No. 3 to the Alexander ; the true azimuths deduced from the elements contained in the preceding columns , are expressed in a corresponding manner to the reading of the compass , for the purpose of comparison .
The observations were made on ice , except when otherwise noted in the column of remarks .
When due consideration is given to the greatly diminished power , with which the earth 's magnetism acts on the horizontal direction of the needle , when the dip becomes so considerable as it was found in Davis 's Straits and Baffin 's Bay , namely , from 83 ?
to 869 ; the satisfactory results which have been obtained , even under such extreme circumstances with Captain KATER'S compasses , afford the best testimony of their excellence , and of the precision which maybe expected from them in the ordinary course of observation , It may also be remarked , that a difference in the result of azimuths observed at different hours of the day may not be altogether an error of observation , since it is probable that as the directive power of magnetism diminished , the causes which produce the hourly change in the variation itself may act with increased effect .
Should the amountof this change be considerably augmented in high magnetic latitudes , careful observations on the direction of the needle at different hours of the day , on all convenient occasions , might be serviceable towards a more certain knowledge of its causes , than has been hitherto obtained from observations made where the effects are so inconsiderable .
The influence of the ship 's iron on their compasses increasing , as the directive power of magnetism diminished , produced irregularities that rendered observations on board ship of little or no value towards a knowledge of the true variation ; a few azimuths which were observed in the Isabella , have been selected for the purpose of exemplifying this remark .
They will also show , how essential it is to navigation in high latitudes , that the nature of the errors which the ship 's attraction produces in her compasses , should be understood .
