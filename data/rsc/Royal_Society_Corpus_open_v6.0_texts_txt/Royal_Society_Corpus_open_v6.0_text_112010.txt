" Results of a Comparison of certain traces produced simultaneously by the Self-recording Magnietographs at Kew and at Lisbon ; especially of those which record the Magnetic Disturbance of July 15 , 1863 .
" By Senhor CAPELLO , of the Lisbon Observatory , and BALFOUR STEWART , M.A. , F.R.S. Received January 14 , 1864 .
The National Portuguese Observatory established at Lisbon in conuexion with the Polytechnic School , and under the direction of Senhor da Silveira , has not been slow to recognize the advantage to magnetical science to be derived from the acquisition of self-recording magnetographs .
Accordingly that institution being well supported by the Portuguese Government , despatched Senhor Capello , their principal observer(one of the writers of this communication ) , with instructions to procure in Great Britain a set of selfrecording magnetographs after the pattern of those in use at the Kew Observatory of the British Association .
These instruments were made by Adie of Londoni , and when completed were sent to Kew for inspection and verification , and Senihor Capello resided there for some time in order to become acquainted with the photographic processes .
The instruments were then taken to Lisbon , where they arrived about the beginning of last year , and they were forthwith mounted at the Observatory , and were in regular operation by the beginning of July last .
It had been agreed by the writers of this paper that the simultaneous magnetic records of the two observatories at Kew and Lisbon should occasionally be compared together , and the opportunity for such a comparison soon presented itself in an interesting disturbance which commenced on the 1 5th of July last .
The curves were accordingly compared together , and the results are embodied in the present communication .
We shall in the first place compare the Kew curves by themselves , secondly the Lisbon curves in the same manner , and lastly the curves of the two Observatories together .
Compare ison of IKew Curves .
The disturbance , as shown by the Kew curves , commenced on July 15thg at 91 13.5 ' G.M.T. , at which moment the horizontal-force curve recorded an abrupt augmentation of force .
The vertical component of the earth 's magnetic force was simultaneously augmented , but to a smaller extent ; while only a very small movement was visible in the declinationi curve .
The disturbance , which began in this manner , continued until July 25th , if not longer ; but during the period of its action there was not for any of the elements a very great departure from the nlormal value ; probably in this respect the declination was more affected than either of the other components .
While frequently there is an amount of similarity between the different elements as regards disturbances of long period , yet there is often also a want of likeness .
If , however , we take the small but rapid changes of force , or peaks and hollows , as has been done by one of the writers of this paper in a previous communication to the Royal Society ( Phil. Trans. 1862 , page 621 ) , we shall find that a disturbance of this nature which increases or diminishes the westerly declination at the same time increases or diminishes both elements of force .
This will be seen more distinctly from the following Table , in which + denotes an increase and a diminution of westerly declination , horizontal , and vertical force respectiv , ely , and the proportions are those of the apparent movements of the elements on the photographic paper .

1 +2'0 +I Ot From this Table it will be seen that the signs are always alike for the different elements , and also that the small and rapid movements of the horizontal force are double of those of the vertical force-a result in conformity with that already obtained by one of the writers in a previous communication .
On the other hand , the declination peaks and hollows do not bear an invariable proportion to those of the horizontal and vertical force , bnt present the appearance of a daily range , being great in the early morning hours , and small in those of the afternoon .
Indeed this is evident by a mere glance at the curves , which , it so happens , present unusual facilities for a comparison of this nature .
Comparison of Lisbon Curves .
1 .
Declinationand vertical-force curves.-The peaks of the waves , or the elevations in the curve of declination , are always shown in hollows or depressions in the vertical-force curve , and vice versa .
We have never seen an instance to the contrary either in the curves under comparison or during the whole time of the operation of these instruments .
This curious relation is exhibited in a Plate appended to this communication , from which it will be seen that we have not only a reversal , but also a very nearly colnstant ratio between the ordinates of the two curves .
At Lisbon therefore an increase of westerly declination corresponds to a diminution of vertical force , and vice versa ; also an alimost constant proportion obtains between the corresponding changes of these two elements .
2 .
Bifilar and Declination Curves.-July 15 .
A great disturbance , which at 8 ' 37'l Lisbon mean time , or 9h 13mI 5 Greenwich mean time , abruptly and suddenly augmented the horizontal force .
The curve of the declinationi continues nevertheless nearly undisturbed for about 30 minutes after this , and only at 9h 41 5 G.M.T. it commences to descend very slowly .
July 16.-At about 13h 6m G.M.T. , a very regularly shaped prominence of some duration occurs in the declination , but is quite invisible in the horizontal force .
July 17.-We see in the bifilar curve half-a-dozen small peaks reproduced in the declination in the same direction , but to a smaller extent .
July 18.-One or two accordant peaks .
A large prominence of some duration in the declination at about 17 " 56'n G.M.T. is reproduced as a slight depression in the horizontal force .
July 19.-A reproduction in the declination of several small peaks of the horizontal force ; nevertheless there are others also small -which one does not see there , or only reproduced to a small extent .
Not much accordance between the great and long-continued elevations and depressions .
July 20..-An accordance between the small peaks .
July 21.-The same .
July 22.-The curve is well marked with small peaks .
Coincidence of several small peaks , but a want of agreement between the more remarkable peaks .
The , peaks of the horizontal force more developed than those of the declination .
July 23.-The same appearance of the horizontal-force curves .
One remarks on 22nd and 23rd that the small peaks of the declination and horizontal-force are more numerous and more developed in the morning hours .
July 24.-Agreement between the small peaks .
A strong disturbance about 1O2 G.M.T. , no agreement between the waves .
A well-marked promiaence of declination ( 1 5kh ) does not alter at all the horizontal-force curve .
We derive the following conclusions from the comparison which we bhave made between the Lisbon curves:1 .
The waves and the peaks and hollows of declination are always reproduced at the same instant in the vertical force , but in an opposite direction ; that is to say , that when the north pole of the declination-needle goes to the east , the same pole of the vertical-force magnet is invariably plunged below the horizon , and vice vers4 .
During five mouths of operation of these instruments , there has not been an example of the contrary .
2 .
The more prominent disturbances of the horizontal force do not in general agree with those of the declinationi or vertical force either in dulration or time .
It is certain that when one of the two elements ( bifilar or declination ) is disturbed , the other is also ; and sometimes one appears to see even for several periods of one of the curves , an imitation of the general march of the other ; but when this is examined a little more milnutely , and rigorous measures are attempted , one easily perceives that the phases do not arrive at the same time , but sometimes later and sometimes earlier , without any fixed rule .
In the same curve one generally sees contradictions of this kind .
Nevertheless it is certain that the agreement in direction and time is more complete when the elevationis or depressions are of shorter duration .
3 .
The small peaks and hollows are generally simultaneous for the three curves .
The direction of these is the same for the horizontal -force and declination , while that for the vertical force is opposite .
The ratio in size of the peaks and hollows is generally variable between the horizontal force and the declination , while it is always constant between the latter and the vertical force .
Our next deduction requires a preliminary remark .
It has been shown by General Sabine , that if the disturbances of declination at various places be each divided into two categories , easterly and westerly , these obey different laws of daily variation , this difference not being the same for all stations .
This would seem to indicate that for every stationl there are at least two simultaneous disturbing forces acting independently , and superposed upon one another .
This interesting conclusioni , derived by General Sabine , appears to be verified by the behaviour of the Lisbon curves .
From the relation , always invariable , between the waves of declination and vertical force , as well as from the almost total absence of agreement between these two curves and the horizonital force , one has a right to conclude1 .
That there is approximately only one indepenident force which acts at Lisbon , if we consider the vertical plane bearing ( magnetic ) east and west .
Now the ratio of the disturbing forces for the vertical force and declination is , in units of force , between 26 : 48 and 26 : 36 .
This would give the inclinationi of the resultant between 29 ?
and 360 .
2 .
The absence of agreement in time , and the variability in direction , between the waves of the horizontal force and those of the declination and vertical force , appear to lead to the conclusion that there is another disturbing force besides that already mentioned , which acts in the direction of the magnetic meridian and almost horizontally .
Comparison of the Kew and Lisbon Ourves ( 14-24 July ) .
l. florizontal force ( north and sotuth disturbing force).-The curves of the horizontal force atKew and at Lisbon exhibit a very great similitude * , as will be seen at ornce from ' the Plate appended to this communication .
Almost all the waves and peaks and hollows are reproduced at both places .
At the same time one does not see the same resemblance during the great disturbance of 15th July .
In the commencement , and for the first four hours , there is a resemblance for all the waves , but from that time until 2 9k " G.M.T. one remarks little agreement between the different elevations and depressionis .
But from 19h intil the end of the disturbance the likeness reappears .
There are , however , one or two cases of small resemblance in the other curves , but these are of short duration .
In order to demonstrate the similarity between the two curves , reference is made to Table TI .
, in which the principal points are comparedtogether with respect to time ; that employed being the meali time for both stations .
From this Table it will be found that the average difference between the local times of corresponding points is 34mn3 , while that due to difference of longitude is 35rn3 .
We attribute this apparent want of simultaneity to various causes ( 1 ) Loss of time in the commencement of movements of the registering cylinder .
( 2 ) Difficulty in estimating precisely the commencement of certain curves .
( 3 ) It was only in the month of August that the exact Lisbon time of the astronomical observatory was obtained by a telegraphic connexion .
( 4 ) To these must be added the uincertainty in estimating the exact tairning-point of an elevation or depression of a blunt or rounid d form .

2 .
Declination ( east and west disturbing force).-The declinationcurves for Kew and Lisbon are very like each other , and the waves as well as the peaks and hollows are for the most part simiultaneously produced in the two collections of curves .
Since , however , at Kew the waves are greater , one does not always easily perceive the resemblance .
Certain peaks or waves very prominent at Kew , are reproduced but slightly at Lisbon ; but a careful scrutiny shows that all , or very nearly all , of the Kew waves and peaks occur at Lisbon also .
In Table IV .
we have a comparison of the principal points of the decliniation-curves with respect to time .
From this Table it will be found that the average difference between the local times of corresponding points is 34m.0 , that due to difference of lolngitude being 35Ifl3 .

This ratio is not , however , quite so great as that for the horizontal force .
3 .
Vertical disturbing force.-The curves of vertical force are nearly quite dissimilar .
Sometimes the general march of the curves appears to coincide during some time ; but in these cases we do not find an appreciable general agreement for the majority of the various points of the wave .
On the other band , the small peaks and hollows of the Kew curves are generally reproduced in those of Lisbon , but in the opposite direction , that is to say , a sudden augmentation of the vertical force at Kew corresponds to a sudden diminution of the same at Lisbon , and vice versed .
In Table VI .
we have a comparison of the principal points of the verticalforce curves with respect to time .

, while for the horizontal force this was 34 ' 3 , and for the declination 34'-O , the mean of the three being 33m-8 .
The measurements from which these numbers were obtained were made at Lisbon independently for each element : another set of measurements , made at Kew , but of a less comprehensive description , gave a mean difference in local time of 33mr 7 , which is as nearly as possible identical with the Lisbon determination .
We have already observed that we attri bute the difference between 33m8 and 351fl.3 , the true longitude-difference of local times , to instrumental errors , and not to want of simultaneity in the correspon-ding points .
In Table VII .
we have a comparison in magnituide and sign of the peaks and hollows at the two stations .
From this Table it will be seen that the magnitude of these is generally greater at Kew than at Lisbon .
The curious fact of the reversal in direction of the vertical-force peaks between Kew and Lisbon has been already noticed .
We shall now in a few words recapitulate the results which we have obtained .
1 .
In comparing the Kew curves together for this disturbance , the peaks and hollows of the horizontal force always bear a definite proportion to those of the vertical force , the proportion being the same as that observed in previous disturbances .
On the other hand , the declination peaks and hollows do not bear an invariable proportion to those of the other two elements , but present the appearance of a daily range , being great in the early morning hours , and small in those of the afternoon .
The peaks and hollows are in the same direction for all the elements .
2 .
In comparing the Lisbon curves together , the elevations of the declination-curve always appear as hollows in the vertical-force curve , and vice versed , and there is always a very nearly constant ratio between the ordinates of the two curves .
The horizontalforce curve , on the other hand , presenits no striking likeness to the other two .
We conclude from this that there are at least two independent disturbing forces which jointly influence the needle at Lisbon , but that the declinatiori and vertical-force elements are chiefly itifluenced by one force .
The peaks and hlollows are generally simultanieous for the three curves .
The direction of these is the same for the horizontal force and declination , while that for the vertical force is opposite .
The ratio in magnitude of the peaks and hollows is generally variable between the horizontal force and the declination , while it is always constant between the latter arid the vertical force .
3 .
When the Kew and Lisbon curves are compared together , there is a very striking likeness between the horizo-tal-force curves , onie perhaps somewhat less striking between the declination-curves , and very little likeness between the vertical-force curves .
It is perhaps worthy of note that This Table has been constructed with the following values of K , the coefficient for one inch .

Corresponding points occur at the same absolute time for both stations .
The disturbanice-waves for the horizontal force and declination are greater at Kew than at Lisbon .
The Kew peaks and hollows are simuiltaneously produced at Lisbon in all the elements , but to a smaller extent than at Kew ; also the direction is reversed in the case of the vertical force , so that a sudden small increase of vertical force at Kew corresponds to a diminutioni of the same at Lisbon .
The writers of this paper are well aware that before the various points alluded to in their communication can be considered as established , a more extensive comparison of curves must be made .
But as the subject is new and of great interest , they have ventured thus early to make a preliminary communication to the Royal Society .
They will afterwards do all in their power to confirm their statemenits , which in the meantime they submit to this Society as still requiring that proof which only a more prolonged investigation can afford .
Note regarding the Plates .
Increasing ordinates denote increasing westerly declination , and also increasing horizontal and vertical force .
The following are the scale coefficients applicable to the different diagrams : Horizontal force , Kew .
