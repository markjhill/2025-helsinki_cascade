325 that moonlight is 44 times brighter than starlight when unabsorbed by more than 1 atmosphere , and if uniformly distributed , though , for illumination of a horizontal screen , it is 175 times brighter so far as photographic action is concerned .
If we take the visual quality of the two lights to be the same , these figures should bear the same proportion for visual observation .
If moonlight be O'Ol candle at 1 foot distance , starlight will be 0 000057 candle at the same distance , that is , the visual value of one candle at nearly 132 feet distant from a screen .
With an intensity of about 6/ 1000000 of candle placed at 1 foot from a screen , or about 10 times less illumination than the above , the screen would be invisible .
It follows that the actual illumination given by starlight will be less than that stated .
Addendum .
March 25 , 1896 .
I ought to have drawn attention to the fact that though the above comparison of moonlight with starlight was taken from actual observations , it would not have been unfair to have deduced the value of moonlight as observed at Wimbledon with the moon in the zenith .
From the observations made and recorded in my paper on the " Transmission of Sunlight through the Earth s Atmosphere , the coefficient of absorption fi for the rays affecting the bromo-iodide of silver can be shown to be 0'340 , under the very favourable circumstances under which the exposures were given .
As the rays of the moon had to traverse 1'45 atmosphere , and then showed a photographic illuminating power of 0'266 S.C. ; had they only had to traverse a thickness of 1 atmosphere , this number would have been 0-308 S.C. This last value would have been equivalent to a visual estimation of moonlight of closely 0'012 S.C. at 1 foot .
Starlight would have then been rather more than 200 times less bright than the light of the full moon .

In the original notice of this gas ( 'Proc .
Roy .
Soc. , ' vol. 58 , p. 81 ) , it was stated that the gas obtained from cleveite contained some , but not much , nitrogen , and no hydrogen .
I have since prepared samples from broggerite , samarskite , and fergusonite , and I tind that in all eases the gas evolved on heating the mineral in a vacuum is rich in hydrogen ; the amount of nitrogen is in all cases Prof. W. Ramsay .
, a Gaseous [ Mar. 19 , infinitesimal .
This was easily ascertained from experiments made on the spectra of mixtures of gases by Dr. Collie and myself .
About 0 01 per cent , of nitrogen is still visible ; and the higher the pressure the more easily is the spectrum of nitrogen seen when it is mixed with helium .
With these new samples of gas , the nitrogen spectrum was just visible at a pressure of 4 or 5 mm. ; and that implies that only the minutest trace can have been present .
It doubtless comes oft the glass tubes m which the powdered minerals were heated , or it may have adhered to the surface of the powdered mineral .
I think it may be safely assumed that nitrogen is not a normal constituent of these minerals .
There was always a considerable amount of carbon dioxide evolved , and , as the carbon spectrum persisted even after the gas had been passed through soda-lime , probably a hydrocarbon , but this only in minute amount .
S 2 .
The yield from these sources was very variable .
Whereas 1 gram of cleveite yielded 7 2 c.c. of helium , 1 gram of brciggerite yielded somewhat less than 1 c.c. of helium ; the yield from samarskite was still less , about 0*6 c.c. per gram ; and from fergusonite l'l c.c. per gram , the last by heating alone ; with the other minerals , the residue after heating was fused with hydrogen potassium sulphate .
There can be no doubt that cleveite is far the best source of the gas , but unfortunately it is very scarce .

31*2 99*8 Ho hydrocarbons were pi*esent , for , after explosion with oxygen , no contraction occurred on admitting potash ; the residue gave a spectrum free from nitrogen flutings even when the pressure was comparatively high .
The carbon dioxide was absorbed by soda-lime , and the remaining mixture was then circulated over the usual purifiers\#151 ; red-hot copper oxide , soda-lime , phosphoric anhydride , and red-hot magnesium .
Although no nitrogen was preseut , magnesium was introduced as a precautionary measure .

The density of the gas extracted from broggerite was first determined .
The precautions taken and the methods of weighing were similar to those described in the paper on argon , in the ' Phil. Trans. ' for 1895 .

weighings were trustworthy to one or two hundredths of a milligram .
The contraction of the globe on exhausting it of air amounted to 0*0212 c.c. The weight of the empty bulb was therefore increased by 0*000026 gram .
The concordance between the mean of the determinations of the density of argon , 19 941 , made with this bulb , and that found by Lord Rayleigh with one of 2 litres capacity , 19 94 , shows that it is possible to obtain accurate results by its use .

A quantity of helium extracted from samarskite by fusion with hydrogen potassium sulphate , after all gas which would come off by heating in a vacuum had been removed , was circulated as usual .
It was difficult to get a sample of gas which did not show a trace of the hydrogen spectrum ; many hours of circulation over red-hot copper oxide , however , finally removed all hydrogen .
It was weighed , with the following results :\#151 ; Samarskite gas , from mineral exhausted by heating with HKSO4:\#151 ; Temperature , 18*60 ' ; pressure , 771*4 mm. Weight of 162*843 c.c. of gas ... ... ... . .

The density of helium extracted from samarskite by heating m vacuo was determined .
Here no nitrogen was visible in the spectrum , but , as before , the removal of all hydrogen was a long operation .
Indeed this sample showed the red line of hydrogen distinctly .
This , however , does not imply that it contains more than a trace , for one volume of hydrogen in 100,000 volumes of helium is still visible in the spectrum .

Gas was prepared from 500 grams of fergusonite .
This time no drying tubes or tubes filled with soda-lime were interposed between the tube containing the mineral and the pump .
There was a vacuum tube , as usual , on the way to the pump , into which samples of the gas could be introduced and examined at any desired pressure .
The object of this was to make sure that no unknown gas was being rejected owing to its absorption by soda or anhydride .
The result proved the precaution to have been quite unnecessary .
Every line visible was identified as belonging to hydrogen , carbon , carbon dioxide , the oxygen of water vapour , or helium .
It may be taken as certain that no gas capable of absorption is evolved from this mineral , and it is exceedingly improbable that any gas has been overlooked which finds its source in other minerals .
The gas from fergusonite was treated with caustic soda to remove carbon dioxide , and circulated over the usnal absorbent till the hydrogen spectrum disappeared , and its density was determined .

It appears to me that these numbers furnish some ground for the 330 Lord Blythswood .
On the Refle [ Mar. 19 , supposition that , as suggested by Lockyer and by Rung and Paschen , the helium from various sources is not quite homogeneous , but that different samples differ slightly in density .
I think that these numbers point to a possible division into groups .
The gas from brog-gerite appears to have the density 2*18 , that from samarskite 212 , and that from fergusonite 214 .
But the evidence is slender .
It is not impossible that the gas from cleveite is lighter ; it is unfortunate that the sample of cleveite gas was lost ; but its mixture with that from broggerite weighs less than the gas from broggerite alone .
It has not , I think , been noticed that the light emitted from a vacuum-tube containing cleveite gas has a richer orange-yellow shade than is shown by gas from broggerite , samarskite , and fergusonite .
This is doubtless due to a greater intensity of the red line ; but there is another difference .
The cleveite gas shows , in addition to the usual strong lines , a set of fairly strong lines between the very strong green , and the strong blue .
These lines have never been observed in samples of gas-from broggerite , samarskite , or fergusonite , no matter how high or low the pressure in the tube , or the intensity of the discharge .
But the difference of colour is so marked that it is easy , at a glance , to say whether any tube contains cleveite-helium , or helium from another mineral .
Taking the two lines of evidence together , they undoubtedly strengthen each other , and I am at present engaged in an attempt to fractionate the mixed gases from broggerite , samarskite , and fergusonite into two or more portions .
Mention should perhaps be made , in conclusion ; of Langlet 's determination of the density of cleveite-helium ( ' Zeit .
anorg .
Chem. , ' 10 , 287 ) .
The number he obtained , weighing in a globe of 100 c.c. capacity , was 2,00 .
His sample was examined spectroscopically , and appears to have been free from nitrogen and hydrogen .
It is unlikely that he can have made an error of 1'3 milligrams in weighing , especially as he determined the density three separate times .
It is not impossible , therefore , that he had under his hands gas much richer in some light constituent than it has been my fortune to fall in with .
Whether this is the case or not , further research must show .
