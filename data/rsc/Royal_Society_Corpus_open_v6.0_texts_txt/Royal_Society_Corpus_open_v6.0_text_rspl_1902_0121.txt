] Relative Amounts of Krypton and Xenon " An Attempt to Estimate the Relative Amounts of Krypton and of Xenon in Atmospheric Air .
" By Sir William Ramsay , K.C.B. , F.R.S. Received March 9 , \#151 ; Read March 26 , 1903 .
When Dr. Travers and I isolated krypton and xenon from air , we had very little idea of the total amount of liquid air from which , hv its evaporation , these gases had been obtained .
And we were then more concerned with the isolation of the gases in a pure state than in the determination of the proportion in which they exist in the atmosphere .
Our knowledge of the composition of the air , however , is not 'Complete until the total yield of krypton , xenon , neon , and helium has been determined .
An estimation of the two last is being undertaken by Dr. Travers .
In our experiments on these gases* we did not measure the total quantity of air evaporated .
We used liquid air for various purposes , and for some months we collected the dregs , allowing them to evaporate into a large gas-holder .
We guessed ( but it was only the roughest estimate ) that we had accumulated in this manner the residues from about thirty litres of liquid air ; and on this assumption we thought the following estimates not improbable :\#151 ; Helium , 1\#151 ; 2 parts per million of gaseous air ; neon , 1 per 100,000 ; krypton , 1 per million ; xenon , 1 per 20,000,000 .
But they rested on a very insecure foundation of fact .
The first preliminary experiment was made to ascertain how much of the air which passes through the Hampson liquefier is converted into liquid .
The results , however , were inaccurate , and I would rather cite the conclusions given by later experiments on a much larger scale .
The compressor was run for several hours every morning and afternoon during six and a half days ; the liquefied air was weighed after each run ; and the escaping air passed through a large gas-meter , where its volume was registered .
The air escaping had a somewhat lower density than ordinary air , owing to the partial removal of oxygen and argon ; but the experiments were not sufficiently accurate to make it worth while to take this into account .
The volumes given are , however , corrected for alterations of pressure and temperature .
In all , 179-7 kilos , of gaseous air passed the meter , and 10'8 kilos , of liquid air were collected .
During the collection , about 6 per cent , of the liquid air evaporates ; adding this , 11-4 kilos , must have been the total weight of air liquefied .
The total weight of air taken in by the compressor , therefore , and delivered to the liquefier was conse-\#166 ; quently 179-7 + 11-4 = 191T kilos , and the percentage liquefied a little under 6 per cent. The number may be taken without sensible -error as 6 per cent , liquefaction .

Estimate of the Relative [ Mar. 9 , During these runs the pressure was kept at 190 atmospheres ; and the delivery of air through the escape valve of the liquefier remained fairly uniform .
Separate readings , taken at different times , of the amount of air passing the meter gave 0*244 , 0*230 , 0*258 , 0*261 , 0*248 , .
and 0*239 kilos , per minute ; these figures testify to fairly uniform working .
It was of interest to see whether argon concentrated itself in the liquefied portion of the air , or whether most of it escaped as gas .
The boiling points of the principal atmospheric gases are , on the absolute scale:\#151 ; nitrogen , 77'*54 ; argon , 86'*90 ; oxygen , 90'*5 ; the differences are 9'*36 and 3'*6 respectively ; it was therefore to be expected that the argon would concentrate in the liquid .
An experiment was therefore made in which 12*73 grammes of freshly collected liquid air was allowed to boil in a double-walled vacuum-tube , and the gases were led directly over metallic copper and magnesium lime ; the resulting argon measured 165 c.c. at 0 ' and 760 mm. pressure .
The weight of this argon was 0*2943 gramme , or from 1 gramme of liquid air , 0*02312 gramme .
Now 1 gramme of atmospheric air contains 0*0129 gramme of argon ; hence the process of liquefaction nearly doubles the content of argon in the air .
It is , , therefore , very advantageous to prepare argon from air which has been liquefied .
Acting on this suggestion , it appeared a , fortiori probable that if tho percentage of argon in air were doubled by liquefaction , the krypton and the xenon would be practically wholly removed and liquefied .
And by submitting liquefied air to a Second liquefaction , by boiling-it off through the compressor , it appeared to hold that a concentration , of the krypton and xenon would result , and that they would be found wholly in the liquefied portion .
An experiment was therefore begun in which about 100 kilos , of gaseous air were passed through the liquefier ; the liquefied portion , amounting to about 6 kilos .
, was again passed through the liquefier , somewhat added to by gaseous air , drawn in by the compressor .
By an unfortunate accident , however , nine-tenths of the air collected during the second liquefaction was lost ; .
and the amount of xenon and krypton in the remaining tenth , representing about 10 kilos , of gaseous air , did not appear to justify repetition of the troublesome experiment .
I have no doubt , however , that had these experiments not had for their object the determination of quantity , but only the preparation of krypton and xenon , they would have effected the separation well .
The liquid air , resulting from the liquefaction of 6 per cent , of 191*1 kilos , of gaseous air , was sucked , several litres at a time , into a large glass balloon of about 5 litres capacity , fitted with an india-rubber cork , through which a wide tube passed , connected with a , double-acting Fleuss pump , driven by an electric motor .
Through 1903 .
] A mounts of Krypton and Xenon 42 ; \gt ; another hole in the cork there passed a siphon which could be closed by means of a brass stop-cock ; this tube served to admit liquid air to the balloon .
A manometer was also connected with the interior of the flask so as to register the pressure under Avhich the liquid air was boiling .
The air boiled at a pressure of about 250 mm. , corresponding to a temperature of about -195 ' .
The boiling was quite quiet , without bumping ; it was sometimes necessary to warm the balloon gently in order to accelerate the evaporation .
The object of distilling at a low temperature was to lower the vapour-pressure of the krypton and xenon in the liquid air , and so to lessen , or in great part to prevent their evaporation .
The total liquid air was thus reduced to about 200 c.c. The balloon containing this air was coupled with a large iron tube , holding about 20 kilos , of reduced copper heated to bright redness .
The liquid air residue , naturally , consisted largely of oxygen , for the more volatile nitrogen had in great part evaporated .
After passing over the copper the volume of gas was about 50 litres .
It may be contended that during the evaporation of the air , even at - 195 ' , a large portion of the krypton and xenon may pass away as gas .
It is not possible to estimate the amount lost in this manner ; .
but at - 195 ' , the vapour pressure of krypton is 2'8 mm. , and that of xenon 0-02 mm. These figures have been arrived at in the following manner .
Relying on the vapour pressures of mercury by Rainsay and Young , given in the Trans. Chem. Soc. , 1886 , p. 50 , and on the measurements made by Ramsay and Travers* of the vapour pressures of krypton and xenon , ratios were found between the absolute temperatures of mercury on the one hand , and of krypton and xenon respectively on the other , between the pressures 300 and 3000 mm. , with two additional data\#151 ; the temperatures of krypton corresponding to pressures of 9 and of 17*4 mm.

Estim of tlic [ Mar. 9 , These ratios were mapped against the absolute temperatures of mercury , and were found , as usual , to give straight lines .
The lines were extrapolated to lower temperatures , and the vapour pressures required were calculated from the extrapolated curves .

It may be mentioned here that the melting point of krypton is about - 169 ' , and that of xenon - 140 ' ; and the boiling points at atmospheric pressure are , krypton - 151'-7 , and xenon - 109'-1 .
The nitrogen was removed from the 50 litres of gas by passing it over red-hot magnesium-lime mixture .
The resulting crude argon measured 12-5 litres at 16 ' and 770 mm. ; its weight is calculated from its known density as 21-3 grammes .
This argon was liquefied in a bulb immersed in liquid air , boiling under reduced pressure , so as to reduce the vapour pressure of the krypton and xenon ; and the major part was re-transferred through a Topler pump to the gas-holder from which it had passed to the liquefying bulb .
About 1500 c.c. of the last portions to distil away were collected in five mercury gas-holders , each of a capacity of 300 c.c. The argon was now methodically fractionated according to the accompanying scheme .
The 1200 c.c. , numbered ( 1 ) was , as described , distributed in five gas-holders .
The contents of the first\#151 ; the one first filled is termed A \#151 ; were liquefied , and half the amount replaced in gas-holder A. The contents of E were liquefied , and A was filled , by allowing the liquid argon to evaporate under reduced pressure .
The contents of C were liquefied along with what remained of B ; and B was filled in like manner .
D was liquefied , and C filled ; and , finally , E , and D filled .
The residue in the liquefying bulb , which evaporated very slowly after the argon had boiled away , was removed through the pump , and collected in a tube over mercury .
The contents of A , B , C , D , and E are labelled ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) .
The process was repeated and with this explanation the scheme can be understood .

No. 41 was mixed with the residues , which contained much xenon , , along with krypton .
Nos. 38 , 39 , and 40 were mixed , and the fractionation continued in a small apparatus .
The gases were now sparked with oxygen over soda , so as to remove traces of air ; for the operations had now to be conducted with great care , and the spectra of the two samples showed traces of nitrogen .
After withdrawal of oxygen from both sets of gas , by means of phosphorus , the krypton mixture was fractionated into three portions ; 42 , containing much argon ; 43 , rich in krypton ; and 44 , a nonvolatile residue .
The xenon residues , 41 , w'ere also solidified with liquid air , and placed for a few seconds in connection with the vacuum of the Topler pump .
The gas which was pumped off was added to-43 , and the residue to 44 .
The bulb was now left for a quarter of an hour , so that equilibrium might be restored , and the stop-cock opened a second time .
A bubble or two was removed with the pump .
On making communication with the , pump a third time , no gas escaped ; .
and this is not remarkable , for the vapour pressure of xenon is little over 0T mm. at that temperature .
It was therefore assumed that the final residue was pure xenon ; and , indeed , its spectrum showed no trace of the krypton lines .
And it may also be taken for granted that very little xenon was added to No. 43 .
The densities of Nos. 42 and 43 were determined ; and from the known densities of argon and krypton , their relative proportions were calculated .
The density of 42 was found to be 2T31 , corresponding to the percentage composition , argon , 93*5 per cent. , krypton , 6*5 per cent. ; the density of 43 was 39*43 , implying a mixture of argon , 6*6 per cent. , krypton , 93*4 per cent. The volume of No. 42 , reduced to 0 ' and 760 was 22*0 c.c. ; it therefore contained T43 c.c. of krypton ; that of No. 43 was 6*5 c.c. , and it contained 6*1 c.c. of krypton .
The total volume of krypton was therefore 7*5 c.c. , and its weight 0*0028 gramme ; the volume of the xenon , reduced to 0 ' and 760-was 0*87 c.c. , and its calculated weight , 0*0005 gramme .

As befoie remarked , it is not maintained that all the krypton and all the xenon have been separated ; it is likely , however , that the separation of the xenon was more perfect than that of the krypton .
The results are merely brought forward as the result of a careful -experiment to quantitatively isolate these gases .
I have to express my cordial thanks to Mr. E. C. C. Baly and to Mr. Inglis for aid in carrying out part of these operations .
As a quantity of pure krypton , sufficient for determination of .density , had been collected , occasion was taken to redetermine the .density of that gas .
It was submitted to careful fractionation ; a .considerable portion was rejected as possibly containing argon , and the dregs were set aside as possibly having contained xenon .
The substance weighed had a low vapour pressure , \#151 ; about 15 mm. at the temperature of the liquid air used in fractionating .
The separation of the lighter and heavier portions was repeated four times , the density having been determined on each occasion , with only small differences .
Finally , a very careful determination of density was carried out , with .the following results:\#151 ; Volume of density-bulb ... ... ... ... ... . .

Hence density , compared with 0 =16 ... 40*81 .
Previous determinations with two samples of gas , one fractionated .from argon , the other fractionated from xenon , gave 40*82 and 40*73 respectively as the density .
The result given above is in perfect concordance with these figures .
The chief cause of error is in the weight ; I think it would be fair to regard two units in the fifth place as the limit of error , which gives a possible divergence of about 1 part in 1200 .
* The atomic weight of krypton would accordingly be 81*62 ; the mean of former determinations is 81*28 .
This is in accordance with its position in the periodic table , which lies betweep bromine , 80 , and rubidium , 85 .
