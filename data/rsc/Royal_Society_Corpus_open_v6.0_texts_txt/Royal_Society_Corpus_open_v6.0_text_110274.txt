A paper was read , " On the Tides in the Port of London .
" By J. W. Lubbock , Esq. , V.P. , and Treas .
R. S. This paper contains a discussion of observations of the tides made at the London Docks , and registered in various Tables , showing the time and height of high water , not only at different periods of the moon 's age , but also for the different months of the year , for every minute of the moon 's parallax , and for every three degrees of her declination .
The tables themselves were registered by Mr. Dessiou of the Admiralty : but the arrangement of the tables and the methods employed are due to the author .
The tides in the river Thames are extremely regular 3 and as the rise is considerable , the observations on them are easily made .
Those at the London Docks present an uninterrupted series from the opening of the Docks in 1804 to the present time : which is more extensive than any extant , with the exception only of that made at Breast by order of the French Government .
Some observations are also given of the tides made during one year at the East India Docks , under the superintendence of Captain Eastfield , and which were undertaken at the suggestion of the author , and made with extreme care .
The author gives an account of the mode by which the several tables were constructed 3 and enters at length into the various mathematical considerations which the subject involves .
The author was enabled , by the kindness of the Chairman and Directors of the London Dock Company , to present to the Society the books containing the complete series of original observations on the tides referred to in this paper .
