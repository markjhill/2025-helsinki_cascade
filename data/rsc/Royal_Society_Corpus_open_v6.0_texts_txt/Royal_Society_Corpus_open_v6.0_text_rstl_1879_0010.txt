M. J. Berkeley , M.A. , F.L.S. [ The Fungi collected in Kerguelen Island amount to 9 or 10 ( the tenth being still an undetermined form).* Dr. Hooker obtained 2 species in the winter ( May and June ) 1840 ; Mr. Moseley 3 in addition to the same , during summer ( December and January ) 1873-4 ; Mr. Eaton , also in summer , 5 determinable species , and 1 that could not he identified ( see footnote ) , besides the species found by Dr. Hooker .
Until a few days before Midsummer ( iChristmas ) no Fungi were seen in the vicinage of the English Observatory Bay .
The first to appear was the common mushroom , a single specimen of which was found on an island in the sound by some officers from H.M.S. " Volage .
" Later in the summer the other four species came up in a few places on the mainland .
They were not by any means of frequent occurrence , and probably scarcely any of them would be found at the time of year corresponding with the date of Dr. Hooker 's visit to the island.\#151 ; F. 1 .

Amongst moss in a bog on the eastward portion of the base of a promontory E. of Vulcan Cove , January 1875 , Eaton .
Csespitose , attached by abundant mycelium .
Pileus -J- inch across ; stem nearly 1 inch high , J to f line thick ; principal gills about 12 in number , shortly but truly adnate , and not in the least decurrent .
It is far more fleshy than any variety of A. , to which species no doubt it is closely allied ; and while agreeing with A. embolus in possessing comparatively few gills , it differs from that species in the mode of their attachment .

" It was common on the sides of hills in the neighbourhood of the observatory towards the end of December , and a series of examples was preserved in spirit , but they could not be worked out .
