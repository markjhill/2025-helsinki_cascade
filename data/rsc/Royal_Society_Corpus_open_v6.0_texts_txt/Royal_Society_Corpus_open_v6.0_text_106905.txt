HESE tables are founded on the experiments of which the results were given in the Report andSupplementaryReport on the best method of proportioningwthe excise on spirituous liquors .
They are computed for every degree of heat from o ' to 80 ' , and for the addition or subtraction of every one part in a hundred of water or spirit ; but as the experiments themselves were made only to every fifth degree of heat , and every five in the laundred of water or spirit , the intermediate places are filled vIp by interpolation in the usual manner , with allowance for second differences .
Every table consists of eight columns , and there are two tables for every degree of heat .
In the first column of the Jirst of the two tables , are given the proportions of spirit and waterby welght , loo parts of spirit being taken as the constant number , to which additions are made successively of one part of water from 1 to 99 inclusively .
The first column in the second table has loo parts of water for the constant number , with the parts of spirit decreasing successively by unity , from xoo to X incIusiveiye It must be obwrved , that each of these tables occupying one page , is divided in the middle for adapting it more conveniently to the si\#163 ; e of the paper ; but the whole of each page is to be c-onsidered as one continued table .
The second column of all the tables gives the specific gravities of the corresponding mixtures of spirit and water in the first column , taken from the table of specific gravities in the Supplementary Report , the intermediate spaces being filled up by interpolation .
In the third columll loo parts by measure of pure spirit , at the temperature marked orl the top of every separate table , is assumeel as the tonstant standard number , to whicIl the respective quarltlties of water by measure , at the same temperature , are to be proportioned in the next column The fourtlacolumn , therefore , contains the proportion of water by meastlre , to loo measures of spirit , answering to the proportions by weight in the same horizontal line of the first column .
The fifth cDlulun shows the number of parts which the quantities of spirit and water contained in the third and fourth columns would measure when the mixture has been compieted that iSn the bulk of the whole mixture after the concentratIons or mutual penetration , has fully taken place .
The sixth column , deduced from the three preceding ones &gt; gives the effiect of that concentration , or how much smalIer the rolume of the whole mixture is , than it would be if there was no such principle as the mutual penetlation .
The seventh column shows the quantity of pure spirit by measure , at the temperature in the table , contained in loo measures of the mixture laid down in the fifth columri .
Lastly , the eighth column gives the decimal multiplier , by mearls of which the quantity by measure of standard pure spirit , of,8ss specific gravity at sOQ of heat , may at once be ascertained , the temperature and specific gravity of the Iiquor being given ; pursuant to the idea suggested in the Report , that 4 ' the stmplest and most equitable " method of Tevying the duty on spirituous liquors would be , g ; to consid ; er rectified splrit as the true qnd only excisable 6C matter- } It may be proper to add a shot account of the method pur sued in computing some of the columns of vthese tables .
CColumns I. II .
and III .
require no other\explanation than hsls been already given .
Col. IV .
is obtained thus : divide the specific -gravity of the pure spirit , at the temperature in the table , by the specific graxtity of water at the same temperature : then , for theJirst of the two tables for each degree of heat , the proportion is , as 1oo is to the quarstity of water by weight in the first column , so is the quot- &lt; ent of the abovementioned diarision to the quantity of water by measure sought ; for the second of the two tables the proportion is , as the quantity of spirit iby weight in the first colarmn is to 1oo , so is that same quotiont to the quantity of water by measure sought .
Co1 .
V. requires more calculation .
The first step is to con* ptlte what the specific gravity of the mixture ill question would be if no concentration tooli place ; to obtain which , the constant numtber ooo ( indicatingthe quantityl)ymeasure3 of pure spirit , is tc ) be multiplied by the specific grarrity of pure spirit at th !
e temperature in the table , and the corresponding measure of waterin the fourth column is also to be mlll-tiplied by its specific gravity at the given ternperature ; these two products being added together , their sum is to be divided by the sum of the absolute quantities of spirit and water by measure in the same lzorizontal line of the third and fourth columnso then the proportion is , as this quotient ( or what the specifis gravity would be without concentration ) is to the real specific gravity as found in the same horizontal line of the second column of the table , so is the sum of the quatltities of spirit and water in the third and fourth columns inversely to the bulk of the mixture .
Col. VI .
is obtained by subtracting the real bulk of the lnixture in col .
V. from the sum of the quantities of spirit and water in col .
III .
and IV .
the difference between them being the diminution occasioned by the concentration on that whole quantity .
Col. VII .
is obviously to be computed by the following proportion : as the bulk of the whole quantity of the mixture in col .
V. is to loo ( the constant quantity ) , so is loo to the quantity of pure spiritper ceNt .
at the temperature of the table .
Col. VIII .
is formed by reducing the volume of the spirit per cent. at the temperature of the table , to itsvolume at 60 ' , by the following proportion : as,8245 ( the specific gravity of pure spirit at 60 ' ) is to its specific gravity at the given temperature , so is the number in the seventh column to the volume of pure spirit , at 60 ' of heat , contained ill 1oo parts by measure of the mixture at the temperature of the table : this divided by loo is the decimal multiplier sought f the product of which into any vmeasure of a spirituous liquor of the corresponding specific gravity and temperature , will be the true quantity of standard pure spirit , at 60 of heat , contained in that liquor .
It may very probably be thought right , for the future use of the revenue , to compute another set of tabies , in whiclS the degree of heat standing at the head of each table , the first column of it shall be evetl numbers of specific gravity .
This would be proper for lookingout at once the quantities of spirit and water in a mixture , from its heat and specific gravity , as immediately determined by experiment .
For scientific purposes also , tables should be constructed to show the regular incremess and decrements of the concentration , by equal variations in the proportions of spirit and water : but these , and others of a similar nature , which might be suggested , do not belong to the present subject .

In order to which , we must know the heat , the specific gravity , and quantity of spirit which the vessel contains .
EXAMPLE .
Suppose the heat to be 35o , the specific gravity,909 , and the quantity of spirit 138,99 measures .
Under 35o of heat , and in Column II .
of specific gravity , find,909 ; and in the same horizontal line , take out from Column VIII , the decimal multiplier,7297 , by which multiply 138,99 , cutting off as many figures to the right as there are decimals in both factors ; then we shall have 101,421003 for the measures of pure spirit , of the specific gravity,825 at 60o of heat .
Now a mere inspection of the Columns in the Tables will show that a spirit of that strength was obtained , by adding 51 parts of water by weight to 100 parts of spirit , as in Column I. which produced the specific gravity found in the same horizontal line , Column II .
It will as readily be seen , that the same specific gravity results from adding together their equivalents in measure , Columns III .
and IV .
and that Column V. contains the quantity , which the two quantities really measure after the mixture has been made .
