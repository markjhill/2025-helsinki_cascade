] Theoretical investigations of the origin of spectra in relation .
to the structure of the atom have concentrated especially on the spectrum of hydrogen , on account of the supposed simplicity of the hydrogen atom .
They have , however , been confined almost exclusively to the Balmer series , and have ignored the difficulties which arise from the fact that hydrogen possesses another spectrum , usually known as the secondary spectrum , which is of great complexity , and the co-ordination of whose lines into recognised bands or series of lines is still in a very unfinished state .
The investigations of Buisson and Fabry , * in which the physical widths of spectrum lines were measured with the interferometer , refer at least a part of the lines of the secondary spectrum to the hydrogen atom , and the complications introduced into theoretical investigations cannot therefore be impartially waived by the assumption that the molecule is concerned in the production of the secondary spectrum .
As regards the relation of the two spectra , there is abundant evidence of a fundamental difference in their origin .
In many celestial spectra the lines of the Balmer series constitute one of the most prominent features , whilst the identification of lines of the secondary spectrum is at least extremely * 'Journal de Physique , ' vol. 2 , p. 442 ( 1912 ) .

383 doubtful .
In the laboratory it has long been known that the relative intensity of the secondary spectrum is greatly reduced by the presence of impurities , notably oxygen , in vacuum tubes containing hydrogen , and by the passage of powerful condensed discharges .
On the other hand , under conditions in which an uncondensed discharge from an induction coil is passed through very dry and pure hydrogen at a reduced pressure , the lines of the secondary spectrum may rival those of the Balmer series in intensity .
It would appear that little progress is to be looked for in the co-ordination into series of the lines of a spectrum of such complexity without recourse to physical methods which are capable of showing that certain lines or groups of lines are related , by the fact that their relative intensities alter in the same way , or that they vary in the same way in some other respect , under different physical conditions of excitation .
Dufour , * has shown that many of the lines can be separated into , the categories of those which do and those which do not show the Zeeman effect , but a complete segregation of the spectrum into two classes by this method would seem to be very difficult , owing to the intrinsic faintness of many of the lines , which must of course be examined under a high dispersion in experiments of this kind .
Dufour has also pointed out that the frequency differences of some of the weak lines are constant .
We owe an important advance in the elucidation of the spectrum to Fulcher , f who has shown that in low potential discharges the lines of the Balmer series become weaker , and that certain fines of the secondary spectrum can be seen to stand out very prominently under these conditions , whilst others are very faint , in comparison with their relative intensities , when the spectrum is examined of vacuum tubes excited by the uncondensed discharge from an induction coil .
Fulcher showed that the differences in wave-length between many lines in the red and yellow regions were constant , and that they could thus be arranged into groups resembling bands , these " band " lines being the lines which were relatively enhanced in the spectrum of the low potential discharge spectrum , whilst ( with two possible exceptions ) the lines which were weaker in the low potential spectrum belonged to the class for which Dufour ( loc. cit.)had observed the Zeeman effect .
Measurements of the wave-lengths of the lines of the secondary spectrum have been made by Watson , J Hasselberg , S Porlezza , and Porlezza and Norzi.|| A number of other observers have given measurements of a few of the lines .

The marked variations in the intensities given by different observers , which seem in many cases quite outside the range of personal error , at once suggest that the relative intensities vary in a manner which is controlled by physical conditions which have not been precisely specified .
As an example , Frost* has measured the wave-lengths of a number of the stronger lines between X = 4723 A. and X = 4358 A. in the spectrum given by tubes containing a mixture of helium and hydrogen , and the intensities which he gives differ very conspicuously from those given by other observers .
It was intended to make an attempt to resolve the spectrum into groups of lines which showed a similar behaviour under different physical conditions , by investigating in the first instance the changes in the relative intensities of the lines which accompany a change of pressure in the discharge tube , the intensities being measured by means of the wedge method , which has been described in previous communications , !
and a number of experiments have been conducted on these lines .
The pressure in the vacuum tubes which were used was controlled by means of a short length of palladium tube , closed at one end and welded at the other to a platinum tube , the open end of which was sealed into a glass tube connected to the vacuum tube .
The pressure of pure hydrogen in the vacuum tube could be raised , without introducing any impurities , by heating the palladium tube either in a current of hydrogen or in the centre of a flame of burning hydrogen , or lowered until the walls of the vacuum tube showed a bright green fluorescence , by heating the palladium in the highest point of the flame of a Bunsen burner , where the partial pressure of hydrogen is very low .
The results were promising in many respects , since they showed that the Fulcher bands become relatively brighter at low pressures , and at the same time there is a marked enhancement of the lines in the region of about X = 5700 A. to X = 5000 A. In the more refrangible region there is no conspicuous change in the relative intensities , but the intensity of the continuous spectrum is reduced at low pressures .
It is probably on account of this continuous spectrum , which seems to increase in intensity in a regular manner towards the more refrangible region of the spectrum , that the difference in the spectrum at high and low pressures appears rather striking when the spectra are examined visually under a low dispersion ; but the spectrograph which was available for measurements made in this manner was of somewhat too low a dispersion to afford the prospect , in view of the complexity of the spectrum , of a very complete segregation of the lines into different classes , though there is no doubt that results of some value would * ' Astrophys .

be obtained with a spectrograph which was better suited to the investigation .
This line of attack has been for the present postponed , owing to the discovery of a more potent method of altering the physical conditions by which the secondary spectrum can at once be sharply segregated into definite groups of lines .
It has been found that when hydrogen at a partial pressure of less than a millimetre is present in helium in vacuum tubes filled at a pressure of about 40 mm. , the spectrum is remarkably different from that of pure hydrogen .
As seen visually under a small dispersion , the effect is not very striking , but an examination with higher resolving power shows that the changes are of a fundamental character .
The spectra have been photographed in the first order of a concave grating of 4 feet radius of curvature and ruled with 20,000 lines to the inch , which was mounted according to Eagle 's method , the dispersion on the plate being almost exactly 10 A. per millimetre .
With this instrument , photographs in juxtaposition were taken of the spectrum of a high-pressure helium-hydrogen tube and of a tube containing pure hydrogen at a pressure of a few millimetres , which was filled and regulated in the manner described above .
The tubes were excited by the uncondensed discharge of an induction coil .
In the more refrangible parts of the spectrum there is little difference , but in the red and yellow regions it is found that a large number of lines are greatly enhanced in the tubes containing helium , some of these being extremely faint in the spectrum of pure hydrogen , and that a number of new lines appear .
There is another class of lines whose relative intensities are unaffected by the presence of helium , whilst a third class are affected in the sense that they become very weak or disappear .
Small changes of intensity under different physical conditions would not constitute a safe criterion for the segregation of lines into classes , for it is known* that lines belonging to the same series may undergo changes in their relative intensities under different conditions of excitation , but the changes which occur in the secondary spectrum of hydrogen , as a result of the presence of a large quantity of helium , are of a magnitude which leaves little room for doubt that a separation of the lines into physically related groups has been effected .
It has been mentioned above that the spectrum of a mixture of hydrogen and helium has been examined by Frost ( .
cit. ) , but his observations were confined to regions of the spectrum where the changes which occur are very slight , and it is likely that the pressure in his tubes was too low to show the phenomena .
There seems little doubt that the new lines observed are to be assigned to hydrogen .
They certainly do not occur in the spectrum of pure * Of- Merton and Nicholson , cit. Dr. T. R. Merton .
helium , and nearly all of the strongest lines from the high-pressure helium-hydrogen tubes are visible in pure hydrogen .
Of the lines which are especially characteristic of these tubes , it is only ( with a few exceptions ) some of the weaker ones which are not seen at all in the spectrum of pure hydrogen .
There is naturally some ambiguity as to the correct exposures to be given for the purpose of dividing up the lines , but a plate in which the line Ha of the Balmer series appears somewhat more strongly in the spectrum of the helium-hydrogen tube seems to exhibit the phenomena very favourably , and this plate has accordingly been selected for the estimation of intensities .
An examination of the spectrum of hydrogen reveals the fact that with long exposures a large number of lines , hitherto unrecorded , can be seen on the plate .
Long exposures of the spectrum of the mixture of helium and hydrogen also show an immense number of faint lines .
This is only to be expected in a spectrum which may be supposed to consist ( at least in part ) of bands , but it does not appear likely that the measurement of these very faint lines will be of much assistance at present in the elucidation of the structure of the spectrum .
It is believed that the results can best be seen in the reproduction ( Plates 6 and 7 ) , in which the two spectra are shown in juxtaposition , with a wave-length scale adjoining the spectrum of hydrogen ; the wave-lengths can be read with sufficient accuracy for identification in Watson 's ( i loc. cit. ) Tables .
The principal helium lines are , of course , visible in the spectrum of the mixture .
It will be seen that the most conspicuous changes occur in the less refrangible regions .
In the green and the more refrangible parts of the spectrum all the lines are greatly reduced in intensity in the spectrum of the mixture , but apart from this , and a few lines which seem abnormally weak , there is no conspicuous difference .
The subjoined Table gives a list of lines which are either enhanced or unaffected in intensity by the admixture of the helium .
These have been measured , using Watson 's lines as standards , and it is believed that on his scale the values given are correct to a few hundredths of an Angstrom .
All lines not recorded in the Table are weaker in the helium-hydrogen mixture .
My own measurements of the few of these lines which occur in Watson 's list are given ; they have been derived from an error curve drawn through the readings of a number of lines measured by Watson and , excepting a few lines for which he found very low intensities , the results are in close agreement ; 0 indicates that a line is just visible , and \#151 ; that it is absent ; a ?
is added in cases in which it is doubtful whether the line in the helium-hydrogen mixture corresponds with a line in the spectrum of pure hydrogen .

It will be of interest to discover whether the changes in the spectrum of hydrogen which are observed when helium is added , can be reproduced in any other way .
Hitherto all attempts involving a change in the conditions of electrical excitation have failed , but it is not unlikely that other elements of the group of inactive gases will be found to resemble helium in their effect .
At present there seems to he no explanation of the phenomena , but it is hoped that the experimental results may be of use in theoretical investigations of the secondary hydrogen spectrum , the interpretation of which must constitute an important advance in our knowledge of the structure of the atom .

) In a previous investigation* a comparison was made of a number of lines in the spectra of ordinary lead and of lead of radio-active origin .
The wavelengths of seven lines in each case were measured from plates taken with a concave grating , and were found to be identical for the two varieties of lead within the limits of experimental error , which was about 0*03 A. A further examination was made in the case of the line \ \#151 ; 4058 A. , which is the brightest line in the spectrum , by measurement of the interference fringes obtained by means of a Fabry and Perot , and it was concluded that any difference between the wave-lengths of this line in the two varieties of lead was less than 0*003 A. , which was the mean error in these measurements .
Aronbergf has recently made a comparison of the wave-length of the line \ = 4058 A. in the spectrum of ordinary lead , and of lead obtained from Australian carnotite , and from measurements made on plates taken in the sixth order of a 10-inch Michelson grating , has found that the wave-length of this line in the spectrum of the lead of radio-active origin is less refrangible than the line in the spectrum of ordinary lead by 0*0043 A. I have recently made a new series of measurements by a procedure greatly superior to that adopted in my previous investigations , and it now appears that my previous estimate of the accuracy with which the two wave-lengths were identical was somewhat too great , and that there is in fact a small but * ' Roy .
