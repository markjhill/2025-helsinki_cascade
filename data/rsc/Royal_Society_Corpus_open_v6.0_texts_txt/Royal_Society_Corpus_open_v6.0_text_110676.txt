A paper was also read , entitled , " An account of the Shooting Stars of 1095 and 1243 ; " by Sir Francis Palgrave , K.H. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The author gives citations from several chronicles of the middle ages , descriptive of the remarkable appearance of shooting stars which occurred on the 4th of April , 1095 , on the testimony of independent witnesses both in France and England .
One of them describes them as " falling like a shower of rain from heaven upon the earth : " and in another case , a bystander , having noted the spot where the aerolite fell , " east water upon it , which was raised in steam , with a great noise of boiling .
" The Chronicle of Rheims describes the appearance as if all the stars in heaven were driven , like dust , before the wind .
A distinct account of the shooting stars of July 26th , 1293 , is given by Matthew Paris .
