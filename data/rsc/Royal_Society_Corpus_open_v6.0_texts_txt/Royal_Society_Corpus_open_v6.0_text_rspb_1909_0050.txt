On the Supposed Presence of Carbon Monoxide in Normal Blood and in the Blood of Animals ancesthetised with Chloroform .
By G. A. Buckmaster and J. A. Gardner .

) While engaged in the study of the gases of the blood during the various stages of anaesthesia by chloroform , we found after absorption of the carbon dioxide and oxygen extracted by the blood pump an amount of residual gas far in excess of any amount that could be regarded as nitrogen remainder plus leak of apparatus.* We have found as the result of many experiments , carried out to determine this particular point , that practically all the chloroform present in the blood of anaesthetised animals comes off with the gases .of the blood when these are extracted at 40 ' C. , so that the excessive residual gas is in large part chloroform vapour , or its decomposition products .
The exact method of procedure of analysis of these gases and the effects of the presence of this chloroform on the methods of analysis will form the subject of a forthcoming paper , but we quote the following experiments to show what percentages of chloroform may be present : Cat , weight 3 kilos .
; chloroformed for one hour with an air-chloroform mixture 2\#151 ; 3 per cent. , 54 c.c. of dark blood withdrawn from carotid artery .
The gases extracted with the pump at 40 ' C. were mixed with excess of pure moist oxygen and passed through red-hot spiral platinum tubes .
The products of combustion were collected in ammonia .
This was exactly neutralised with nitric acid and titrated with silver nitrate ( 1 c.c. = 0*001 Cl ) ; 17 c.c. of silver nitrate were required = 0*01986 gramme CHC13 = 3*7 c.c. of chloroform vapour at 0 ' and 760 mm. * The blood pump employed was the Toepler as modified by Barcroft ( 'Journal of Physiology , ' vol. 25 , p. 265 ) , with certain modifications for this particular work .
These will be described in our paper on the blood gases in chloroform anaesthesia .
Messrs. Buckmaster and Gardner .
Supposed [ Aug. 12 , The blood therefore contained 0-0348 gramme of chloroform per 100 grammes of blood , so that the blood gases evolved contain about 10 per cent , by volume of chloroform vapour .
To quote another experiment:\#151 ; Cat , weight 3'5 kilos .
; chloroformed with an air-chloroform mixture of 2 per cent. , 54 c.c. of dark blood withdrawn from carotid artery for analysis of gases .
Immediately before and after withdrawing this , two extra samples were taken of 10 c.c. each for analysis by the method which we call the method of Nicloux.* Volume of gases extracted = 30'53 at 0 ' and 760 mm. This gas was analysed as in former experiment ; 19'9 c.c. of silver nitrate were required ( 1 c.c. = 0-001 Cl ) , which corresponds to 0-0223 gramme of chloroform = 4-15 c.c. of chloroform vapour at 0 ' and 760 mm. = 0-0419 gramme of CHCI3 in 100 grammes of blood .
Sample I ( Nicloux method ) gave 0-0396 gramme of chloroform per 100 grammes of blood .
Sample II ( Nicloux method ) gave 0-0403 gramme of chloroform per 100 grammes of blood .
The blood gases were always evacuated from blood at 40 ' C. , and at this temperature and under the conditions we employed for ansesthetisation it is clear that practically all the chloroform which is calculated to be in blood can be recovered as chloroform vapour .
In 1894 Grdhantf recognised the presence of a combustible gas in the blood .
This he considered to be carbon monoxide .
The amount of this in blood he determined with his grisoumetre , an instrument by means of which he could measure the quantity of carbon monoxide fixed by haemoglobin in an atmosphere which contained one part in 60,000 .
As the result of experiments carried out on dogs in Paris , Desgrez and NiclouxJ stated that carbon monoxide is not only a normal constituent of the blood gases , but that the blood of these animals , when anaesthetised by chloroform , contained an augmented quantity of this gas : " Les animaux sounds a l'anesthesie par le chloroforme nous ayant fourni un sang notable-ment plus riche en oxyde de carbone que leur sang normal .
" This conclusion is drawn from their experiments , which we summarise in the following table .
Their method of estimating carbon monoxide consisted in passing the * " Dosage de Petites Quantites de Chloroforme , " ' Extraits du Bulletin de la Sociuto Chimique de Paris , ' 3rd series , vol. 33 , p. 321 , 1906 .

blood gases over iodine pentoxide at 150 ' C. , and estimating the iodine liberated by the method of Babourdin .
Beyond the fact that carbon monoxide decomposes iodic anhydride under these conditions , whereas neither hydrogen nor methane will do this , Desgrez and Nicloux bring forward no evidence whatever that the liberation of iodine in their experiments is due to carbon monoxide from the blood .
They explain the production of carbon monoxide in chloroform angesthesia , in the light of observations of Desgrez , * that chloroform is decomposed by a solution of potash 1 : 8 with production of carbon monoxide according to one of the following equations :\#151 ; CHC13 + 2K0H = 2KC1 + H20 + HC1 + C0 ; CHCls + KOH = KC1 + 2HC1 + CO. But the blood is certainly not an alkaline fluid in the sense that even an extremely dilute solution of potash is : the blood is both alkaline and acid according to the indicator chosen .
This reaction cannot therefore be regarded as lending support to their conclusions .
The statement that carbon monoxide is contained in blood was apparently confirmed by Saint-Martin.f This observer worked with large quantities of blood , 500 c.c. being taken for an experiment .
The blood was mixed with oxalate of potassium solution in the proportion of 1 gramme of the salt to 500 grammes of blood .
The gases evacuated from this mixture at 45 ' C. by the blood pump were rejected , and on the subsequent addition of 250 c.c. of saturated tartaric acid solution a further liberation of 30 to 40 c.c. of gas occurred .
This proved to be a complex mixture of gases among which was carbon monoxide , which he absorbed with ammoniacal cuprous chloride .
In two papers , Lepine and BouludJ state that in 25 c.c. of dog 's blood they could find no carbon monoxide , though working with the apparatus devised by Desgrez and Nicloux .
In blood taken 'post mortem of severe cases of aummia , carbon monoxide is present , whereas in control cases which were non-anaemic the presence of this gas could not be detected .
After injections of oxalate of calcium or tartaric acid into the circulation as much as 04 c.c. of carbon monoxide per 100 c.c. of blood was found .
Practically no experimental details however are given in their papers .
Binding all these results difficult to understand , we incidentally , during the course of some other experiments , made an examination of a sample of the blood of a cat which had undergone a prolonged anaesthesia , both spectroscopically and by Haldane 's method , without being able to detect the * 'Comptes Rendus , ' November 15 , 1897 .

] Presence of Carbon Monoxide Normal , etc. 519 presence of any carbon monoxide ; and without denying the conclusions of Desgrez and Nicloux , stated in a paper published in 1906 , * that " we were unable to accept the view that the combustible gas appearing during chloroform-narcosis is carbon monoxide , a product of the decomposition of chloroform within the organism .
" This led Prof. Nicloux , in his work ' Les Anesthesiques Generaux/ f to make an attack on us and represent that we had denied the accuracy of his results on the strength of a single experiment by a spectroscopic method on a cat , whereas his experiments , he remarks , were performed on dogs .
In reality our observations wTere made by the admittedly delicate method of Haldane , in which weak solutions of blood arc examined in long glass tubes .
We were therefore led to examine the conclusions of Desgrez and Nicloux in more detail .
Is there any carbon monoxide in the gases of the blood can be detected by passing the gases through solutions of ?
It will be seen from the table we have given that Desgrez and Nicloux state that normal blood contains 1*6 c.c. of carbon monoxide per litre of blood .
In that of anaesthetised animals they find amounts of 2'6 c.c. , 24 c.c. , and 6-9 c.c. On the assumption that a litre of blood yields 600 c.c. of mixed gases at 0 ' and 760 mm. , then the CO-content of normal blood is 0'27 per cent. , which in chloroform anaesthesia may reach 1*15 per cent , by volume .
The actual quantities of gases these observers examined were about 15 c.c. We have minutely followed the directions contained in Haldane 's papers , using mixtures of air and carbon monoxide .
In the first experiments 500 c.c. of air with 4 c.c. of carbon monoxide = 0'8 per cent. CO were used .
Measured volumes of this mixture were slowly bubbled through 1 : 100 solutions of freshly defibrinated cat 's blood .
The tubes so treated were compared with control solutions , the two solutions being compared either undiluted or equally diluted .
Long columns of these solutions were examined in long glass tubes , with the following results:\#151 ; Volume of mixture Series .

Supposed [ Aug. 12 , In another series of experiments mixtures of 500 c.c. of air and 1 c.c. of carbon monoxide = 02 per cent , by volume were used .
Volume of mixture employed in c.c. 50 Hb + CO recognised readily : 0-4 c.c. of the blood in water compared with control similarly prepared .
25 Equally well marked : 04 c.c. of blood in water compared with control similarly prepared .
10 Difference from control quite noticeable .
From these results it is clear that the quantities of carbon monoxide stated by the French observers to be present in blood gases should be readily recognisable by this method , for half the amounts stated to be present in normal blood are recognisable .
In order to ascertain whether carbon monoxide was present in the blood of anaesthetised animals the gases of cat 's blood , never less and generally more than 60 c.c. in volume , were evacuated from 108 c.c. or more of blood at 40 ' C. , without the addition of any acid , until no further trace of gas could be obtained .
The chloroform used for ansesthetisation was chloroform puriss .

On examination as before , no differences whatever could be detected .
These experiments , we submit , conclusively show that when the blood of anaesthetised animals is evacuated at 40 ' C. until no further gas is evolved , the gas obtained contains no recognisable trace of carbon monoxide , and , therefore , if this is present it is present in far smaller quantities than Desgrez and Nicloux state to be the case in normal blood gases .
Therefore , chloroform is not decomposed in the organism or in the blood with production of carbon monoxide .
If there was any carbon monoxide really present in their experiments , this must have been due either to the acid which they added before evacuation of the gases , a view from which they explicitly dissent , or have been produced in their experiments .
It now became necessary to arrive at some explanation for the iodine evolved in the experiments of Desgrez and Nicloux , and the most obvious line of research was to study the effect of chloroform vapour on iodic anhydride at various temperatures , and also the effect of heat alone on this substance .
For this purpose the following apparatus was employed .
The gases of the blood , mixtures of air and chloroform or other gases under investigation were swept over the iodine pentoxide by a current of oxygen aspirated at a rate varying from 1 to 2 litres an hour .
This plan was adopted to obviate the entrance of air of the laboratory , which might contain traces of carbon monoxide ; and as a further precaution the oxygen was passed through a long combustion tube filled with red hot copper oxide .
522 Messrs. Buckmaster and Gardner .
Supposed [ Aug. 12 , The general arrangement of the apparatus is shown in the accompanying figure .
The oxygen current passes from left to right through ( 1 ) combustion tube , ( 2 ) bulbs containing 40 per cent , potash , ( 3 ) bulb containing the gas under examination , ( 4 ) a U-tube containing powdered potash , the proximal limb of which was slightly moistened , ( 5 ) a calcium chloride drying tube , ( 6 ) tube containing iodic anhydride , ( 7 ) absorption vessel containing 10 c.c. of a 10 per cent , potassium iodide solution to absorb any liberated iodine ( this was kept cool during the experiment ) , and ( 8 ) aspirator .
3 4 The bulb ( 3 ) was either one of Waller 's densimeter bulbs of 255 c.c. capacity for mixtures of chloroform and air , or , in the case of blood gases , a 200 c.c. ' tube with stopcocks at either end .
Effect of Heat on Iodine Pentoxide .
Dr. Wade , of Guy 's Hospital , who has for some time past been engaged in studying the methods of estimation of small quantities of carbon monoxide , kindly informed us , when we commenced these experiments , of the fact which he had observed that iodine pentoxide invariably gave off iodine when first heated , and that this evolution of iodine never actually ceased , although the rate eventually became steady if the temperature was maintained constant .
This we can entirely confirm .
We used iodine pentoxide tubes of a special kind devised by Dr. Wade , a full description of which , along with his results , he is about to publish .
For this reason we give no further account of our experiments in this direction .
Effect of Chloroform , Vapour on Iodine Pentoxide at various Temperatures .
The above-mentioned tubes were thoroughly cleaned and filled with 28 to 30 grammes of powdered iodine pentoxide and heated for a short time in aniline vapour , but in no case was any considerable quantity of water vapour evolved .
The oxide was then heated in a current of purified oxygen for 24 to 48 hours or longer , the tube being placed in the vapour of a suitable liquid , boiling at the temperature we desired to use in an actual experiment , until the 1909 .
] Presence of Carbon Monoxide Normal Blood , etc. 523 rate of evolution of iodine per hour became approximately constant .
Different specimens of iodine pentoxide , and even different tubes made from the same sample , were found to differ considerably in this respect .
These differences may in part have been due to traces of impurity in the iodine pentoxide , or more probably to different states of physical aggregation .
A specimen obtained from a French source kindly recommended to us by Prof. Nicloux , which qualitative tests showed to be pure , after prolonged heating at 157 ' 0 .
evolved iodine equivalent to 1 c.c. of N/ 1000 sodium thiosulphate in two hours , but we never reduced the amount below this value .
We hoped at first to be able to determine for each tube the constant loss of iodine per gramme per hour at the temperature employed in our particular experiments , but experience soon showed that , in addition to the difficulty of keeping all conditions sufficiently constant , when chloroform vapour had been passed through a tube the " constant " underwent change .
It was therefore found more satisfactory to make a blank determination of the iodine liberated in a given time by heat alone before each experiment and sometimes also after .
The temperatures we employed were 100 ' C. , the boiling point of xylene ( 137 ' C. ) , the boiling point of bromobenzene ( 157 ' C. ) .
The chloroform used in our experiments was made from acetone and carefully purified for us by Dr. Wade .
It boiled at 61'T4 to 61'T5 C. at 760 mm. and had a specific gravity P5008 15/ 15 .
Experiment I.\#151 ; 0'0588 gramme of chloroform , weighed in a thin bulb , Was placed in the vessel ( 3 ) and the bulb broken .
The chloroform vapour was swept over the iodic anhydride in a current of oxygen at the rate of 1 to 1-|~ litres per hour .
The current was maintained for 81 minutes .
Iodine equivalent to 102'9 c.c. N/ 1000 sodium thiosulphate was liberated .
In a control experiment which had previously been made under similar conditions in 104 minutes , iodine was liberated equivalent to 1#5 c.c. N/ 1000 sodium thiosulphate .
Thus each gramme-molecule of chloroform liberated 2'6 grammes of iodine , i.e. about 1/ 100 of a gramme-molecule of iodine .
In the following experiments , mixtures of air and chloroform vapour ( amounting to 255 c.c. in each case ) , the concentration of which was determined by Waller 's densimetric method , were passed through the apparatus at different temperatures .
A few of the results are given in the following table ( Table II ) .
A very large number of experiments were made , and it was found that the quantities of iodine liberated varied markedly with different tubes and with alteration of the conditions of the experiment .
This was particularly the case in experiments conducted at 100 ' C. 524 Messrs. Buckmaster and Gardner .

When iodine pentoxide is boiled under a reflux condenser with pure chloroform the action is very slow .
One gramme of pentoxide boiled with 5 c.c. of pure chloroform for three hours only gave iodine equivalent to 18'7 c.c. of N/ 1000 sodium thiosulphate .
At higher temperatures the action does not appear to proceed much more rapidly , as the following results of experiments in which iodine pentoxide and chloroform .were heated in sealed tubes at temperatures of 100 ' C. and 137 ' C. respectively indicate :\#151 ; ( 1 ) Weight of I2O5 .

It was clear from these results that although iodine pentoxide reacts with pure chloroform with the liberation of iodine , the amounts so produced are 1909 .
] Presence of Carbon Monoxide Normal , etc. 525 insufficient to account for some of the quantities found in the experiments quoted in Table II .
It is known from the experiments of Desgrez* , and of Thiele and Dentf , that chloroform is decomposable by aqueous potash in the cold with the production of carbon monoxide , and it seemed not unlikely that in this reaction an explanation was to be found for the comparatively large amounts of iodine evolved when U-tube ( 4 ) was in the circuit .
That this was the case is proved by the following experiments:\#151 ; Effect of Solid Potash Chloroform .
Experiment I.\#151 ; Two stout test-tubes filled with mercury were inverted in a bath of mercury .
Into one a piece of dry solid potash was introduced , and into the other a piece of potash , the surface of which was moistened with water .
A few* drops of chloroform were then passed into each tube .
In both cases a slow evolution of gas commenced at once , and after standing overnight 3\#151 ; 4 c.c. of gas had collected above the mercury .
This gradually increased in quantity until at the end of three days the tubes were almost full of carbon monoxide .
Experiment II.\#151 ; In this experiment a comparison was made between the quantities of iodine liberated when a 5 to 6-per-cent , mixture of chloroform and air was passed over iodine pentoxide ( A ) with the U-tubes 4 and 5 in the apparatus figured above filled with calcium chloride , ( B ) with the U-tubes 4 and 5 filled with roughly-powdered potash , that in the first limb of 4 being slightly moistened .

After passing through these tubes the gas was allowed to bubble slowly through two small wash bottles , each containing 30 c.c. of a freshly prepared dilute solution of human blood .
The apparatus was so arranged that the gas passed through the parallel U-tubes and thence through the wash bottles at the same rate .
At the end of the experiment it was found that the blood through which the gas from tube A ( calcium chloride ) had passed contained no trace of carboxy-hsemoglobin , but that in connection with tube B ( potash ) was almost wholly converted from oxyhaemoglobin to carboxyhsemoglobin .

It seems clear , therefore , from all these experiments , that the iodine liberated by the blood gases of an animal anaesthetised by chloroform is due partly to the vapour of chloroform and partly to the carbon monoxide produced by the action of chloroform vapour on the potash in U-tube 4 , but not to the carbon monoxide that might be liberated in the In order to obtain further confirmation of this , experiments were made in 1909 .

[ October 12 , 1909.\#151 ; " Finally , in order to settle the question quite conclusively , we made the following experiment:\#151 ; A cat weighing 3-6 kilos , was anaesthetised by means of carefully purified ^chloroform for 1 hour 15 minutes ; 108 c.c. of blood were withdrawn in two lots of 54 c.c. from the carotid artery .
The gases were completely pumped out of this blood at 40 ' C. , and divided into two portions .
The one half was slowly bubbled through 1 :100 blood solution , and examined by Haldane 's method in the manner described in the earlier part of this-paper .
No trace of carboxyhaemoglobin could be detected .
The other half of the blood gas was allowed to stand for 45 minutes in the laboratory tubes of the gas analysis apparatus in the presence of a few lumps of moistened potash .
It was then transferred to the measuring tube , and thence bubbled through 1:100 blood solution as before .
The presence of carboxyhaemoglobin was obvious in this without dilution .
The results were confirmed spectroscopically in both samples before and after the addition of reducing agents .
" ] Conclusions .
1 .
Our experiments lend no support to the view that carbon monoxide is a normal constituent of the blood gases .
We think that the small quantities of iodine found in Desgrez and Nicloux ' experiments are due to the decomposition .of iodine pentoxide at the temperature ( 150 ' C. ) of their experiments .

[ October12 , 1909.\#151 ; " The iodine liberated in the experiments of Pesgrez and Nicloux on anaesthetised animals was due to some extent to the direct decomposition of the iodine pentoxide by the chloroform vapour contained in their blood gases , but mainly to the carbon monoxide produced by the action of this chloroform on the potash over which they passed the blood gases in order to free them from carbon dioxide .
This explanation is quite in accordance with their observations that the amount of iodine liberated increases with the duration of the anaesthesia .

The Ilexosephosphate formed by Yeast-juice from and Phosphate .
By W. J. Young ( Biochemical Laboratory of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine ) .
( Communicated by A. Harden , F.R.S. Received July 30 , 1909 .
) It has been shown by Harden and Young* that\#151 ; ( 1 ) the rate of fermentation of glucose by yeast-juice is greatly increased by the addition of a soluble phosphate ; ( 2 ) this rate soon diminishes until a constant rate is attained , which is only slightly greater than that of the original yeast-juice and glucose ; ( 3 ) during this period of increased fermentative activity , the phosphate undergoes some alteration , and at the end of the period is no longer present in a form precipitable by magnesium citrate mixture .
1 he authors suggested in the first paper that a combination of the phosphate with the sugar , to form a phosphoric acid ester , had taken place , and more recent lyt embodied this suggestion in the form of an equation\#151 ; 2C6H1206 + 2R'2HP04 = 2COs + 2C2H60 + CeHjofMPChR^a + 2H20 .
It has also been shown that the same phenomena occur when fructose or mannose is used in place of glucose .
