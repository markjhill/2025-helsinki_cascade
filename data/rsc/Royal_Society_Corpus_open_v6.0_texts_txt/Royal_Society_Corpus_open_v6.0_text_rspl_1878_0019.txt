81 comparison with the Kew standard thermometer No. 515 , the property of the Royal Observatory .
If the readings of the thermometer be corrected for index errors .only , as is the case under ordinary circumstances when observations are made , the difference between the Greenwich and Kew standard barometers is reduced by the amount of ( 0'*5 X 0*0027 = ) *0013 inch , and the two barometers differ only by the amount \#151 ; 0*0001 inch , that is to say they virtually agree .
In conclusion I would beg to express my thanks to the Astronomer Royal and Messrs. Ellis and Nash for the courteous manner in which they afforded us every facility and assistance in carrying out these comparisons , and to Messrs. Baker , Foster , and Constable for the assistance they have given in the reduction of the observations , as well as in the actual comparisons .
The tables containing the detailed observations are preserved at the Kew Observatory for reference .
Note.\#151 ; Since the effect of the gas burners upon the Greenwich barometer has had attention called to it , Mr. Ellis has fitted opal glass screens between the gas-jets and the barometer .
By this means the temperature is rendered much more equable round the instrument .

" On the Diurnal Range of the Magnetic Declination as recorded at the Trevandrum Observatory .

The Observatory at Trevandrum was supported by His Highness the Rajah of Travancore , and its Director was Mr. J. A. Broun , F.R.S. , who has recently published the first volume of the results of his labours , giving the individual observations of magnetic declination , and deducing from them conclusions of great scientific value .
Among the other results published by Mr. Broun , are the diurnal ranges of the magnetic declination at Trevandrum , for each civil day in the eleven years , 1854 to 1864 .
( Table LVIII , page 163 .
) In one respect the treatment of the declination observations at Trevandrum differs from that pursued at the Kew Observatory , inasmuch as in the former place , where disturbances are little felt , the diurnal ranges are from all the observations .

It will be noticed from this table that the annual variation of the declination-range at Trevandrum is very different in character from its annual variation at the Kew Observatory .
The chief feature of the annual variation at Kew is the small value of the range at the time of the winter solstice .
On the other hand , the chief features of the annual variation of declination-range at Trevandrum are two minima , nearly corresponding in time to the two equinoxes , and two maxima , one large , some time in August ( after the summer solstice ) and a smaller one about the time of the winter solstice .
These features have been already remarked by Mr. Broun , who has likewise pointed out that the character of the diurnal variation of the declination at the summer solstice is at Trevandrum the opposite of its character at the winter solstice\#151 ; the change from the one type to the other taking place about the equinoxes .
He has likewise pointed out , as a result of this Declination at 1878 .
] change of type , that about the times of the equinoxes there is not only a small average value of the range , hut likewise an uncertainty about its character , as it sometimes appears to be of the one type and at other times changes to the other type .
B. Variations of Long Period .
4 .
In order to investigate the long-period variation of the Trevandrum declination-range , I have treated these observations precisely in the way in which the Kew declination-ranges were treated ( Proc. Roy .
Soc. , March 22,1877 ) .
By this method proportional values of the declination-range at Trevandrum have been obtained corresponding to weekly points for each year , and it is believed that these values are freed from any recognised inequality depending either on the month of the year or on the relative position of the sun and moon .
If this method should be found to furnish nearly the same results in the case of two observatories so widely apart as Kew and Trevandrum , and with such marked differences in the annual variation of the declination-range , we may conclude that this separation of inequalities has been successfully accomplished. .
The proportional values of the Trevandrum declination-range are given in Table II .
Table II.\#151 ; E^ibiting monthly means of declination-range for weekly points , the mean value of the range for the whole series for each point being reckoned = 1,000 .

The results of Tables III and IV are exhibited in the diagram which accompanies this paper .
In fig. 1 we have a curve representing the nine-monthly values of spotted area .
In fig. 2 we have the Kew and in fig. 3 the Trevandrum declination curve represented by nine-monthly values of the proportional numbers .
In fig. 4 we have a curve representing the mean between the proportional numbers of Kew and those of Trevandrum .
From these figures it will be seen that a lagging behind the sun is a feature both of the Kgw and the Trevandrum curves , while generally the prominent points in the Kew and Trevandrum curves agree well together in point of time .
On the whole it would appear that by taking the mean of the proportional numbers for the two stations , we get a curve that represents the solar curve better than one derived from a single station .
The whole period compared together represents both for the solar curve ( fig. 1 ) and the mean curve ( fig. 4 ) , a series of three smaller periods , one extending from B to 0 and embracing the maximum j another extending from C to c , and a third from c to and this is as far as the observations common to both stations allow us to go in point of time .
7 .
It may be of interest to compare , by means of the tables , the period between the solar minimum of 1855 and that of 1867 , with the period between the corresponding declination-range minima .
The first of these declination minima occurred at Trevandrum ( the Kew observations not having then begun ) on February 15 , 1856 , and the second of * The numbers for the years 1858-64 are given in Proceedings of Royal Society , March 22 , 1877 , page 109 .

] them occurred at Kew ( the Trevandrum observations having been discontinued ) on August 15 , 1867 .
The period is thus one of eleven years and six months .
On the other hand , the sun-spot period is that between September 15 , 1855 , and March 15 , 1867 , being likewise eleven years and six months .
Variations which seem to depend on Planetary Configurations* 8 .
Ia a paper on the Kew declination-range already alluded to , it was shown that the planetary periods of most frequent occurrence appear to be well indicated by the results of sixteen years ' observations .
Indeed , for the two periods of shortest length\#151 ; that of Mercury about the sun , and that of Mercury and Jupiter , it was found that half of the observations gave a result of the same character as the whole sixteen years .
From this we might conclude that these periods will probably ( if they have a real existence ) be indicated by the Trevandrum observations .
It will be seen from the following tables that the Trevandrum declination-ranges give results for these two planetary periods very similar to those given by the Kew observations .

" By Professor J. C. Adams , M.A. , F.R.S. Received December 6 , 1877 .
In the " Proceedings of the Royal Society , " vol. xix , pp. 521 , 522 , Mr. Glaisher has given the values of the logarithms of 2 , 3 , 5 , and 10 , and of Euler 's constant to 100 places of decimals , in correction of some previous results given by Mr. Shanks .
In vol. xx , pp. 28 and 31 , Mr. Shanks gives the results of his re-calculation of the above-mentioned logarithms and of the modulus of common logarithms to 205 places , and of Euler 's constant to 110 places of decimals .
Having calculated the value of 31 Bernoulli 's numbers , in addition to the 31 previously known , I was induced to carry the approximation to Euler 's constant to a much greater extent than had been before practicable .
For this purpose I likewise re-calculated the values of the above-mentioned logarithms , and found the sum of the reciprocals of the first 500 and of the first 1000 integers , all to upwards of 260 places of decimals .
I also found two independent relations between the logarithms just mentioned and the logarithm of 7 , which furnished a test of the accuracy of the work .
