] In this communication Sir Everard gives an account of a repetition *of his former experiments upon the effect of dividing the nerves that supply the velvet of the deer 's horns , and in which some sources of error have been avoided .
The general results are the same as those formerly obtained ; the temperature of the horn , the nerves of which were divided , was diminished to the amount of 70 ; and , as before , the disparity of temperature gradually decreased until , after the lapse of about twelve days , the temperatures of the two horns were the same .
Upon examining the structure of the parts after the animal 's death , it was .
found that the interval between the divided ends of the nerves was filled up by a newly-formed connecting substance , capable of restoring their action .
In further illustration of the effect of the nerves in producing heat , independent of mere circulation of blood , the author mentions a case of aneurism , in which the femoral artery was tied without occasioning any diminution in the temperature of the foot .
