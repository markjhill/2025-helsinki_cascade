) Experiment 1.\#151 ; White Goat .
To note the effect of feeding goats on material containing Micrococcus melitensis\#151 ; 1904 , Sept. 15.\#151 ; Examined blood for agglutination .
Negative .
18.\#151 ; Fed this goat , adding the contents of an agar tube culture of M. melitensis .
Dec. 3.\#151 ; Blood has reacted in dilutions of 1 in 20 to 1 in 100 , but the temperature curve shows no rise .
Fed again in the same way .
23.\#151 ; Blood reacts 1 in 300 .
1905 , Apr. 29.\#151 ; Blood reacts 1 in 100 .
Goat still alive .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; Red Goat\#151 ; 1904 , Dec. 3.\#151 ; Blood reaction negative .
Fed as in Experiment 1 .
5.\#151 ; Fed again .
15.\#151 ; Blood reaction negative .
23.\#151 ; Blood reacts 1 in 20 ; 1 in 50 after half an hour .
1905 , Apr. 29.\#151 ; Blood reacts 1 in 50 .
These two experiments led me to the belief that goats are susceptible to Malta fever , and that the disease may be spread to human beings by goats .
Experiment 3.\#151 ; Examination of the blood of goats suffering from naturally acquired Malta Fever by the agglutination test1905 , June 14.\#151 ; Examined the blood of six goats which were bought out of two different herds on the 12th inst .
Goat No. 1.\#151 ; Strong immediate reaction , in dilution of 1 to 20 .
Goat No. 2.\#151 ; Strong immediate reaction , in dilution of 1 to 20 .
Goat No. 3.\#151 ; Strong reaction , after half an hour .
Goat No. 4.\#151 ; No reaction .
Goat No. 5.\#151 ; Strong reaction , after half an hour .
Goat No. 6.\#151 ; Strong immediate reaction .
On June 15 the bloods were again examined , with identical results .

Goats as a [ July , June 18 about 5 c.c. of blood was taken from Goat No. 6 and distributed in six broth-tubes .
On June 25 passages from the broth-tubes were made on to agar slopes , and the M. melitensis recovered in pure culture .
This micro-organism was also recovered from the blood of Goat No. 5 .
Blood was also taken from Goats Nos. 1 , 2 , and 3 , but so far the melitensis has not been recovered .
Material from Abattoir.\#151 ; Dr. Caruana Scicluna having suggested that possibly infected goats might be met with in the abattoir , I have examined 46 spleens , and have recovered the M. melitensis from one .
The blood of seven of these goats gave a positive reaction to the agglutination test .
Preliminary Note on Goats as a Means of Propagation of Mediterranean Fever .
By Major W. H. Horrocks , B.A.M.C. , Member of the Mediterranean Fever Commission .
( Communicated by Colonel Bruce , C.B. , F.R.S.\#151 ; Received July , 1905 .
) With the object of ascertaining , by experimental inoculation , whether goats could be infected by the M. melitensis , six goats were bought on June 12 , 1905 , from two different herds , and placed in the lazaretto .
On June 14 Dr. Zammit , as a preliminary step to our experimental work , took blood from each of these goats , and proceeded to test the action of the serum on the M. melitensis .
He found , to his great surprise , that the serum of five of the goats , when considerably diluted , caused agglutination of this microbe .
On June 15 similar results being again obtained , Dr. Zammit brought specimens of the bloods to the Public Health Laboratory , and asked me to confirm his observations .
I obtained the following results :\#151 ; Goat No. 1.\#151 ; Blood serum diluted 1 to 10 and 1 to 40 caused immediate agglutination of the M. melitensis , visible to the naked eye .
When diluted 1 to 100 , however , the serum gave no reaction .
Goat No. 2.\#151 ; Blood serum diluted 1 to 10 and 1 to 40 caused immediate agglutination of the M. melitensis .
A dilution of 1 to 100 produced a complete reaction after 15 minutes .
