" On the Influence of the Gulf-stream on the Winters of the British Islands .
" In a Letter from Professor HENNESSY to Major-General SABINE , V.P. and Treas .
R.S. Communicated by Major-General SABINE .
Received May 24 , 1858 , 35 Upper Leeson Street , Dublin , May 19 , 1858 .
MY DEAR SIR , In your work on 'Pendulum Experiments , ' and subsequently in a paper printed in the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for April 1846 , you have directed attention to the influence of the Gulf-stream on the winters of the British Islands .
You have been led to attribute the remarkably mild winters which we sometimes experience , to an abnormal extension of the warm waters of that stream towards our latitudes .
' In this view I entirely concur , and beg to submit the following additional proof of its correctness .
An abnormal extension of the Gulf-stream in the direction of the British Isles necessarily implies that the waters bathing our coasts acquire a temperature which exceeds their mean temperature for the season of the year at which the extension takes place .
The temperature of the air over the sea , and finally of the air over the islands , becomes sensibly increased .
The entire temperature at any point will thus depend chiefly on what it gains from sunshine , and from the warm sea-air , and on what it loses by radiation .
If the excess of what it gains from sunshine over its losses by radiation be considerable compared to its gain from the influence of the sea , the temperature will depend principally on the latitude .
If , on the contrary , the thermal influence of the sea be very considerable , places at different latitudes may possess nearly equal temperatures .
It follows that during cold winters we should expect a greater difference between the temperatures of the southern coasts of Great Britain and Ireland , and the remainder of their coasts , than during mild winters .
It also follows , that during warm winters the difference of temperature between stations situated on coast and inland stations having nearly the same latitude , should be greater than during cold winters .
Although I have not yet finished all the calculations necessary for the complete illustration of these conclusions , I have been enabled to show that during some recent winters the observed results as to temperature entirely conform to these laws .
The mildness of the winter which has just passed away , has been universally remarked , and Mr. Glaisher 's returns for the meteorology of England and Scotland during December 1857 fully illustrate the matter .
I have not yet received the returns for January and February , but I feel assured that they will exhibit corresponding results .
During December 1857 the temperatures of the coast stations were as follows : South Coast .

4'35 47'0 1-6 3-9 3'0 The December of last year , which was much warmer than the Decembers of the two preceding years , appears thus to comply with such conditions as to temperature as would lead to the conclusion that a greater extension of the Gulf-stream had existed about the end of 1857 , than towards the close of 1856 or 1855 .
Isothermals of the British Isles* .
It will be interesting to compare the mean temperature of a southern inland station , where the observations may be depended upon as being of the best class .
The mean temperature of Oxford during the December of 1857 was 45'0 ; in December 1856 , 40 ?
5 ; in December 1855 , 37 ?
'2 .
All the stations on the west coast are situated in higher latitudes , yet their mean temperature was in excess of that of Oxford in December 1857 by 2 ?
'l ; in the colder Decembers of 1856 and 1855 , by 0 ?
'5 and 1 ?
04 respectively .
During the warmest month , the mean of all the coast stations exceeded the temperature of Oxford by 2 ?
'0 ; and during the other two Decembers by 1 ?
03 and 1 ?
'6 respectively .
I propose to make more complete calculations , which will embrace the other months belonging to the winter ; and by comparing the results during different years , it is probable that corresponding inferences will be suggested regarding the variations of mean temperature which are incapable of explanation by changes of solar radiation alone .
I was induced to select December at first , because the amount of sunshine received in our hemisphere being least during that month , it was natural to expect that the comparative effects of the other thermal influences would be most distinctly manifested .
Having been for some time occupied in studying the distribution of heat over islands , I have been led to the general proposition , that the isothermals may be represented by curves having some relation to the coast-line , and that the positions of the centres of these curves depend upon the relation between solar influence and oceanic temperature .
At seasons when the latter becomes important , compared to the former , the isothermals tend to assume re-entrant shapes similar to the mean annual isothermals of Ireland .
When the isothermals of a mild winter month , like December of 1857 , shall be laid down , I anticipate that they will distinctly exhibit the increased thermal influence of the ocean by presenting such an appearance .
