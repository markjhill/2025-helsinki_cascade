53 International Polar Commission.-The magnetic ob^rvatmns made during the year September , 1882 , to August , 1883 , at Fort Rae , Noith America , by the expedition under Captain Dawson , R.A. , have been fully reduced and prepared for publication , on the plan adopted by the International Polar Commission at their Meeting at Vmnnain 1884 , by the Observatory staff during extra office hours , and t e work is at present passing through the press .
The readings of the Kew Mao-netographs have also been reduced on the same plan at the cost of the Polar Committee of the Royal Society , and copies forwarded to Dr. H. Wild , President of the Commission .
Special scales were constructed for the tabulation of the Kew curves on the C.G.S. system by Mr. Baker , the magnetic observer .
Krahatoa Eruption.-The Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society having entrusted to the Kew Committee the data which they have collected relating to electrical and magnetical phenomena which occurred about August 27 , 1883 , the date of the eruption of Krakatoa , the curves of the magnetographs of the Observa ones Report of the Kew Committee .
Batavia , Colaba , Lisbon , Mauritius , Melbourne , Paris , Stony burst , and Zi-ka-wei have been carefully compared with each other , and a report thereon will shortly be submitted to the Committee .
II .
Meteorological Observations .
The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registration respectively of atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity , wind ( direction and velocity ) , bright sunshine , and rain , have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year .
In February the barometer tube was removed for a short time from the barograph , and a carefully divided glass scale substituted in its place , which was then photographed with the view of re-deter-mining the scale value of the instrument , and also of measuring the amount of distortion the curve undergoes by shrinkage of the gelatinized paper during the photographic operations , to which it is subjected , subsequent to its reception of the luminous image .
In September the action of the barograph was observed to be somewhat sluggish , and an examination of the instrument showed an obstruction of the air-vent in the cistern due to an accumulation of dust .
This was removed , and there has since been no want of sensitiveness on the part of the barometer .
The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records have been duly registered during the year , together with the daily observations in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system .
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix II .
The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly carried on , and copies of these , as well as of the eye observations , with notes of weather , cloud , and sunshine have been transmitted as usual to the Meteorological Office .

317 In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council to the Committee , Mr. Whipple visited Falmouth in May in order to superintend the removal of the meteorological instruments from the old Observatory to the new building recently erected near that town by the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society ; he has since inspected the instruments at the Aberdeen , Stonyhurst , and Glasgow Observatories , and the Anemographs at Yarmouth and Sandwick .
Mr. Baker visited the Valencia and Falmouth Observatories for the purpose of inspection during his vacation .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to , and published by " The Times " and " The Torquay Directory .
" Data have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society , the editor of " Symons 's Monthly Meteorological Magazine , " the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers , Messrs. Gwilliam , Rowland , and others .
The cost of these abstracts is borne by the recipients .
JEJlectrograph.\#151 ; The difficulty of maintaining the potential of the charge of this instrument constant , mentioned in last year 's Report , having greatly increased , in spite of all measures of precaution which were taken , the Meteorological Council were in July informed of its unsatisfactory condition .
They accordingly gave instructions to discontinue its working , and it is intended to draw up a report on the results which may be obtained from the eleven years ' curves of variations of atmospheric electricity now available for discussion .
III .
Solar Observations .
The sketches of Sun-spots , as seen projected on the photoheliograph screen , have been made on 170 days , in order to continue Schwabe 's enumeration , the results being given in Appendix II , Table IV .
Transit Observations.\#151 ; 320 observations of solar and 102 of sidereal transits have been taken , for the purpose of keeping correct local time at the Observatory , and the clocks and chronometers have also been compared daily .
The Observatory Chronometer , Breguet 3140 , has been cleaned and readjusted .
The following clocks , French , Shelton K. O. , and Dent 2011 , and the chronometers , Molyneux No. 2125 , and Breguet No. 3140 , are kept carefully rated as time-keepers at the Observatory .
IV .
Experimental Work .
Photo-nephograph.\#151 ; The experiments with the photo-nephographs having proved satisfactory , and a report to that effect having been presented to the Meteorological Council , it was decided in June to Report of the Kew Committee .
take frequent pictures for the purpose of determining the rate of motion of clouds .
Accordingly the telegraph cable uniting the two stations was buried in the ground ( permission having previously been granted by the lessee of the Old Deer Park ) , and the stands and electrical fittings were made fixtures .
A quantity of photographic plates , prepared in accordance with Captain Abney 's formula , were also obtained from a manufacturer , and certain arrangements made in the photographic laboratory of the Observatory for their convenient manipulation .
Blank forms for the computation of the cloud positions and motions were also drawn up and printed .
Between July 6th , when the installation of the apparatus was completed , and the date , when the experiments were brought to a close , in accordance with the instructions of the Meteorological Council , 168 cloud negatives were obtained on 23 days , from these 62 approximate determinations of the rate and direction of motion of clouds at heights varying from 3,000 feet to 50,000 feet have been secured .
A detailed report of the work is being drawn up for presentation to the Meteorological Council .
Solar Radiation Thermometers.\#151 ; The Committee * have made a great number of experiments on the construction and exhaustion of the solar radiation thermometers , and the Superintendent is engaged on a report to be communicated to the Royal Society .
The general result would indicate that solar radiation as measured by the black bulb thermometer in vacuo has hitherto been considerably underrated .
Baily 's Wind Integrator.\#151 ; This instrument , after working successfully with electrical counters for some time , was simplified by the inventor by the substitution of mechanical counters .
These being found to work satisfactorily , Mr. Bailey removed the instrument in May for the purpose of exhibiting it at the International Inventions Exhibition .
The spare Beckley Anemograph to which it was attached has been dismounted , and together with the de la Rue recorder ( see report for 1879 ) has , by direction of the Meteorological Council , been forwarded to Mr. Munro to be reconstructed as a Beckley recorder of the original type .
Electrical Anemograph.\#151 ; The Meteorological Council having granted a sum of money for experiment , and placed at the disposal of Mr. W.Preece , F.R.S. , Superintendent of Telegraphs , an old Beckley Anemograph of the 1858 model , that gentleman had it fitted up by Mr. Kempe , of the Chief Engineer 's Department , Gr .
P.O. , so as to record electrically , and it was erected on the Experimental House of the Observatory .
The velocity attachment has worked most satisfactorily for the past six months , neither batteries Report of the Kew .
nor connexions having needed the slightest attention .
The direction gear has , however , occasionally required readjustment of its orientation after strong winds have blown , and is now undergoing alteration .
Hand Anemometers.\#151 ; A number of these instruments , intended to show the velocity of the wind during a brief period of observation , have had their scale values determined by direct comparison with the Standard Anemograph of the Observatory .
Rany e~finders.\#151 ; .Facilities have been afforded to Dr. Riston , F.R.A.S. , by the employment of the Cooke apparatus , for the purpose of graduating some new range-finders invented by Mr. Nordenfeldt , and constructed by Mr. Casella , the cost of the experiments being defrayed by the inventor .
V. Verification of Instruments .
The following magnetic instruments have been verified , and their constants determined:\#151 ; 2 Unifilar Magnetometers and an Inclinometer for Elliott Brothers , London .
1 Unifilar Magnetometer with two Collimating Magnets , and an Inclinometer for the Admiralty , London .
1 small-pattern Fox Circle for the Bureau of Navigation , United States Government , and an ordinary Inclinometer for Dover , Charlton .
3 pairs of Inclinometer Needles have been purchased on commission and verified for I)r .
Wild and the Mauritius Observatory .

1 Evaporation Gauge , 4 Thermograph Thermometers , 1 Sunshine Recorder , 2 Gauge Barometers for comparing Aneroids , 1 Electrical Anemometer , and 1 Richard Thermograph were also tested .
There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , 2 Barometers , 222 Thermometers , 100 Hydrometers , 24 Sextants , and 1 self-recording Aneroid .
Sextant .
Testing Apparatus.\#151 ; In consequence of the increasing number of sextants sent to the Observatory for examination it was found desirable to provide a special accommodation in the building for the work .
As the room known as the Pendulum room was unoccupied , and the masonry pier fitted up in it as a support for pendulum apparatus was no longer required , it was resolved to convert the apartment into a sextant room , and accordingly the pier was removed , and the Cooke testing apparatus dismounted from the South Hall and re-erected on its site .
Four careful redeterminations were then made of the angles between the collimators , and they were found to have been unaffected by the transfer of the apparatus to the new position .
VI .
Rating of Watches .
The arrangements for rating watches mentioned in previous Reports have been continued during the year with great success , and Report of the Kew Committee .
up to the present 367 watches have been tried , of which 39 were submitted by the owners , and 328 by the manufacturers or dealers .
The 302 watches received during the year were entered for testing in the following classes:\#151 ; For class A , 254 ; class B , 38 ; and class 0 , 10 .
Of these 72 failed to gain any certificate ; 6 passed in 0 , 60 in B , 110 in A , and 6 others obtained the highest possible form of certificate , the class A especially good .
Owing to numerous requests from manufacturers and others , a system of awarding marks to class A watches , indicating the degree of relative efficiency exhibited during trial , was adopted , being based upon plans already in use in the Geneva and Yale Observatories .
In it the number of marks awarded to a watch that only just succeeds in obtaining an A certificate is 0 , but to an absolutely perfect watch would be 100 , made up as follows:\#151 ; 40 for a complete absence of variation of daily rate , 40 for absolute freedom from change of rate with change of position , and 20 for perfect compensation for effects of alteration of temperature .
As , however , the trials already in use do not comprise a test for the going of travellers ' or explorers ' watches , experiments are in progress with a view of constructing apparatus to test the behaviour of watches when kept in motion , as in the case of daily wear and travelling , in order to make a special examination on this point for watches submitted for trial by the Royal Geographical Society .
A series of tests for pocket chronographs has also been introduced by special request of the Cyclists ' Union .
In Appendix III will be found a table giving the results of trial of the watches which have gained the highest certificates in each class .
The following table will indicate the nature of the trials to which ordinary certificates refer:\#151 ; Position of watch during test .

APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " Long. Oh lm 15s l W. , for the year October 1884 to September 1885 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same Magnetometer , Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^ inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Eorce , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log tt3K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient / i is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature tQ to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0-0001194(\#163 ; o\#151 ; 35)+0-000,000,213(\#163 ; 0\#151 ; 35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1-0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction \#153 ; =\#151 ; ( 1-Z\ is -0-00129 .
X X'V r0V In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker .
