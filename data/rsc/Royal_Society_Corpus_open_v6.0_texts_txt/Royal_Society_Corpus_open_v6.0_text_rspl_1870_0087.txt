524 Sir W. Thomson'"s Amended Ride for working [ June 15 , Postscript .
Received June 14 , 1871 .
After the completion of the above paper , the author found that Mr. Shanks had , in second , third , and fourth supplementary papers on the Constant* , extended his calculations so as to determine from #=2000 , 5000 , and 10,000 .
The values so obtained all differ in the sixtieth decimal ; in fact the higher x is taken , the further from the truth are the results , as the errors in the logarithms are multiplied by larger factors .
The calculation for #=2000 affords a verification of the error of log 2 ; for on subtracting the value of y ( #=1000 ) from y ( #=2000 ) , we obtain ( after correcting B1S ) a result agreeing with E to 80 decimal places ( which is as far as Mr. Shanks has calculated the latter value of y ) , with the exception of a difference of a unit in the 73rd figure\#151 ; an error probably in the summation of the harmonic series from 1000 to 2000 .
The values for #=5000 and #=10,000 are ( besides the errors previously noticed ) inaccurate from the 62nd figure .

( Abstract .
) This paper exhibits an analysis of the principal disturbances recorded by the horizontal and vertical force self-recording magnetometers of the Kew Observatory in the years 1859 to 1864 , showing the progressive diminution in the number and value of the disturbances from a maximum in 1859 to a minimum in 1863 , being the first moiety of the " decennial period and showing also the distribution of the disturbances , increasing or diminishing the respective forces , in the several years , months , and hours .

In my previous communication on this subject ( anted , p. 259 ) I described a plan according to which , in the first place , two auxiliary lines were to be drawn on the chart , from two sets of numbers taken out of a proposed Table , and then Sumner 's line ( the line on which the observation shows the ship to be ) was to be interpolated , dividing the space between them in the proportion of the differences of the sun s decli* Proc.
