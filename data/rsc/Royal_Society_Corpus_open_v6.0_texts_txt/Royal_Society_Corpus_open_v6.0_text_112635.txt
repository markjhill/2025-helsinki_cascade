( Abstract .
) It is near the conclusion of my " Memoir on Caustics , " Phil. Trans. vol. cxlvii .
( 1857 ) , pp. 273 , 312 , remarked that for the case of parallel rays refracted at a circle , the ordinary construction for the secondary caustic cannot be made use of ( the entire curve would in fact pass off to an infinite distance ) , and that the simplest course is to measure off the distance GQ from a line through the centre of the refracting circle perpendicular to the direction of the incident rays .
The particular secondary caustic , or orthogonal trajectory of the refracted rays , obtained on the above supposition was shown to be a curve of the order 8 ; and it was further shown by consideration of the case ( wherein the distance GQ is measured off from an arbitrary line perpendicular to the incident rays ) , that the general secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of the refracted rays was a curve of the same order 8 .
The last-mentioned curve in the case of reflexion , or for t , =-1 , degenerates into a curve of the order 6 ; and I propose in the present supplementary memoir to discuss this sextic curve ; viz. the sextic curve which is the general secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of parallel rays reflected at a circle .
