] When copper sheeting , however pure the metal may be , is exposed to sea-water , a green rust is formed upon it ; which , when washed off , is replaced by a similar substance , till the whole of the metal is thus destroyed by corrosion .
To prevent this effect , the President avails himself of the modification of chemical affinities , derived from electrical power ; and in pursuing his researches in relation to this subject , he found the above-mentioned action upon copper counteracted by any weak negative electricity easily excited in it by the contact of a surface of tin not exceeding T-Ig-th that of the copper , and made part of an electric circuit in sea-water .
Other metals may be substituted , but the facility with which a perfect contact is made by solder with tin , and the facility with which its submuriate detaches from the metal , induce Sir Humphry Davy to regard it as best adapted to the purpose .
He observes , further , that the cause which prevents the oxidation of the copper will also probably prevent the adhesion of marine animals and of vegetables .
After adverting to the unequivocal and satisfactory results of his experiment made upon a small scale , the author states that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have enabled him to make arrangements for pursuing them upon a very extended plan .
