] In previous memoirs we have given the results of investigations of the thermal properties of ethyl-alcohol , acetic acid , and ethyl oxide ( ether ) .
The subject of the present paper is the vapour-pressures , vapour-densities , and expansion of methyl-alcohol ; and from these results the heats of vaporisation have been deduced .
The range of temperature is from \#151 ; 16 ' to the critical temperature 240 ' ; and the range of pressure from 11 millims. to 60,000 millims. Preparation of pure methyl-alcohol.f\#151 ; A finely crystallised sample of methyl oxalate was distilled with ammonia ; the distillate was rectified , and when partially freed from water was distilled with quicklime .
The distillate was again distilled from barium oxide , and then allowed to stand for some weeks over anhydrous copper sulphate ; but the boiling-point was found to be by no means constant .
It was then distilled six times over small quantities of sodium ; and the rise of temperature during the last distillation was less than 0T ' .
The boiling-point was 64'85 ' at 76P9 millims. A series of determinations of vapour-pressure at low temperatures was then made , and it was decided , before employing the alcohol for determinations of vapour-density , to re-distil it .
It boiled at 64,95 ' , under the same pressure , 761'9 millims. Preliminary experiments were then carried out , with a view to determining the critical temperature and pressure ; but the volume-tube burst , and the experiments were delayed until a new volume-tube had been calibrated .
As the boiling-point of the alcohol was not absolutely constant , it was repeatedly fractionated , and the * * Parts I. and II .
are published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1886 ( Part I. ) ; Part III .

14.11.87 greater part was obtained , boiling at 647 ' , under 760 millims. pressure .
The rise of temperature did not exceed 0*05 during the complete distillation .
The boiling-point of methyl-alcohol has been a subject of much dispute .
Kopp found , with three separate samples , 65 ' , 65'-65*2 ' , 64*6'-65*2 ' ; Pierre , 66*3 ' ; Mendeli\amp ; eff , 66 ' ; Delffs , 66'5 ' ; Dumas and Peligot , 66*5 ' ; Landolt , 66*3 ' ; and Dittmar and Stewart , 64T ' .
Pebkin , who dried his alcohol with copper sulphate , found 65*8'-66 ' ; but we found that several weeks ' standing over copper sulphate produced little effect .
Begnault , who dried his alcohol over lime , found 66*78 ' ; and Schiff found 64*8 ' at 763 millims. pressure .
There can be little doubt that the last is correct .
Apparatus employed.\#151 ; The apparatus for determining vapour-pressures at low temperatures was that described in the 'Phil .
Trans./ 1884 , p. 37 ; and in the 'Chem .
Soc. Trans. , ' 1885 , p. 42 .
The vapour-densities at low temperatures were determined by a modification of Hofmann 's apparatus , whereby pressure , volume , and temperature could be altered at will .
This apparatus has been described in our memoir on ether ( 'Phil .
Trans. , ' 1887 , A , p. 59 ) .
The constants at high temperatures were determined by a modified Andrews ' apparatus , of which a description is to be found in our paper on ether .
Experimental results.\#151 ; Before giving experimental results , it should be noted that in every case the temperatures are those of an air thermometer ; the pressures refer to the latitude of University College , Bristol ( 51 ' 2 25 , y N. ) , and to 226 feet above sea-level ; they are corrected according to Amagat 's experiments ( ' Comptes Bendus/ yol , 99 , p. 1153 ) , and are measured in actual millimetres of mercury .
Vapour-pressures at low temperatures.\#151 ; The thermometer employed for temperatures below 40 ' was graduated in tenths of a degree .
By reduction of pressure an apparent fall of temperature of 0*25 ' for 760 millims. was observed .
This apparent fall is proportional to the pressure , and correction was applied accordingly .
The thermometer was standardised by a determination of the vapour-pressures of water above 0 ' ; and it was assumed that the graduation below 0 ' was equally regular .

The first two series were determined with substance boiling at 64*85 ; and the third , with the alcohol after fractionation .
Vapour-densities at low temperatures.\#151 ; -The weight of the methyl-alcohol taken was not determined directly , hut was ascertained from vapour-density determinations at the boiling-point of chlorobenzene under a pressure of 718*95 millims. , coiresponding to the temperature 130 ' .

i The vapour-pressure at 60 ' is 625*1 millims. ; and at 40 ' , 260*47 millims. The vapour-densities at 40 ' appear to be too high ; this would be caused by the presence of dust particles , which may cause condensation at low temperatures and at pressures considerably below the vapour-pressure .
Constants at high temperatures.\#151 ; Three different amounts of methyl-alcohol were employed for these experiments .
The first quantity , which we shall call A , was comparatively large , and was employed for the determination of the orthobaric volumes # and of the vapour-pressures .
Its volume was ascertained by direct measurement , and its weight from determinations of the specific gravity of methyl-alcohol at low temperatures .
The weight of the second quantity , B , was calculated from a comparison of its volumes when gasified with those of the third quantity , under similar conditions of temperature and pressure .
That of the third quantity , C , was ascertained from its density at 240 ' , at large volumes , when p.v remained constant during considerable change of volume .
In the course of the experiments the quantity C was slightly increased by rise of liquid from the lower portion of the tube .
The increased weight , which we shall term ( T , was ascertained by a comparison between the volumes of this portion and those given by the former .

The specific gravity at 22*94 ' was found to be 0*78909 ; hence the weight of portion A was 0-21858 gramme .
The volume-tube was a new one , 35 centims. long , and about 1*1 millim. internal diameter ; the external diameter was about 8 millims. It was carefully calibrated by weighing with mercury at a known temperature .
The following corrections were applied :\#151 ; For volume.\#151 ; Meniscus of mercury and of liquid .
Expansion of glass by heat .
The expansion of the tube owing to internal pressure was not allowed for , as no data are available .
It is probable that any correction would have been within the limits of error of reading .
For pressure.\#151 ; A low-pressure and a high-pressure manometer were employed ; where possible , readings on both were taken .
The manometers were calibrated by weighing with mercury , and contained air dried over phosphorus pentoxide .

were employed .
No correction was necessary except that the pressures under which the standard liquids boiled were read at the temperature of the room instead of at 0 ' , and altered accordingly .
The temperatures are those of an air thermometer .
The vapour-pressures at each temperature were determined at widely different volumes .
The extreme volumes are as a rule about 0*91 and 0*46 cub. centim. A. Jacketing vapour .

No meniscus was visible at 240 ' .
On lowering the temperature to 239*9 ' the meniscus appeared after a short time .
The apparent critical temperature , therefore , lies between 239*9 ' and 240 ' .
Only one reading is given at high pressures .
The reason for this is that the alteration of level of the mercury in the volume tube altered the level of the mercury in the gauge by only 0*1 mm. B. The weight of this portion was ascertained by a comparison of its volumes in the gaseous state with those of C under similar conditions of temperature and pressure .
It was found to be 0*02565 gramme .
With this portion vapour-densities at high temperatures , and vapour-pressures , were determined .

The weight of this portion was 0'00221 gramme .
It was ascertained from measurements of the volume occupied by the vapour at 230 ' and 240 ' .
At 230 ' the change of volume was from 1*0245 cub. centim. to 0'6019 cub. centim. ; the product of pressure and volume was constant , and gave for the weight 0*002211 gramme ; at 240 ' , with the same change of volume , the weight was 0*002206 gramme .
The value taken was 0'00221 gramme .
The error can hardly be more than 0'5 per cent. The following determinations were made :\#151 ; Pressure of brbmo-naphthalene .

The number of observations with quantity A was large , and the mean pressure given lays due stress on this fact .
As with alcohol and ether , the formula expresses the observations very closely ; the greatest divergence expressed in temperature being only 0'38 at 236 ' .
The constants employed were calculated from observations at 0 , 55 , 110 ' , 165 ' , and 220 ' .
To obtain the best values at these temperatures , portions of the curve were smoothed by .
the method of ratios ( see 'Phil .
Mag./ vol. 20 , 1885 , p. 516 et seq.y The constants for the formula given were\#151 ; a = 22*307096 , log a = 1-99988416 , log 6= 1-2649587 , log = 1-99599796 , log c = 0-3855770 .
b and c are both negative .
ON EVAPORATION AND DISSOCIATION .
It will be remarked that Kegnault 's vapour-pressures are in every case much lower than ours .
On reference to his memoir ( ' Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences , ' vol. 26 , p. 456 ) , it is evident that his low results are to be accounted for by insufficient drying of his specimen ; it was only rectified several times over quicklime .
He states , also , that the fluctuations of his thermometer when the dynamical method was employed were so great as to interfere with the accuracy of his results .
Kegnault , moreover , did not think it worth while to convert the readings of his mercury thermometer into those of an air thermometer .
The orthobaric volumes of 1 gramme of methyl-alcohol were read from a curve drawn so as to pass through the experimental points .
We have not constructed a formula to represent these relations .
They are given in the Table which follows :\#151 ; Orthobaric Volumes of 1 gramme of Liquid .

The values of dp/ dt were calculated by means of the formula : log = + ; pressures were calculated for one-tenth of a degree above and below the required temperature , and the difference was multiplied by 5 to obtain the value for 1 .
The pressures were reduced to grammes per square centimetre , and the value of J was taken as 42,500 .

The former found 263'7 calories , and the latter 263*86 calories .
At the boiling-point our results give 266*7 calories ; this is a satisfactory agreement .
From the foregoing account of our experiments with methyl-alcohol it is evident 2 u M DCCCLXXX V11 .
\#151 ; A. that the views which we have already expressed regarding alcohol and ether are substantiated ; there is no tendency towards the formation of complex molecules at low temperatures .
This research is not so complete as the former two .
We have made no attempt to determine the compressibility of the liquid .
The cause of this omission is the very high pressure exerted by the vapour of methyl - alcohol at high temperatures .
During these experiments we lost a volume-tube and a gauge by bursting ; and , as the labour involved in replacing them was very great , we did not choose to risk further breakage .
The approximate critical pressure of methyl-alcohol is 59,700 , the approximate temperature 240 ' , and the approximate volume 3*683 cub. centims. It is noticeable here that the difference in temperature between the boiling-points of methyl- and ethyl-alcohols is by no means the same as the difference between their critical temperatures .
In Plate 14 the relations between pressure , temperature , and volume for saturated and unsaturated vapour are shown ; the orthothermic constants for the liquid are also given .
The small diagram shows these relations between the pressures 1600 millims. and 60,000 millims. The critical isothermal is also given .
The large diagram represents the higher temperatures observed ; the circles are actual experimental points .
Plate 15 shows the densities , compared with hydrogen , of the saturated and unsaturated vapour mapped against pressure .
It is here noticeable that the density of the saturated vapour becomes normal at low pressures and corresponding low temperatures .
Plate 16 shows the orthobaric densities of the liquid and vapour mapped against temperature , and their approach towards identity at the critical point .
Plate 17 gives the vapour-densities of the saturated vapour , and the heats of vaporisation , mapped against temperature .
Again the rapid increase of density and the rapid decrease of latent heat as the critical point is approached are noticeable .
Addendum .
( Added Jily28 , 1887 , ) The value of such work as the foregoing evidently depends on the purity of the substance employed ; and , as it appears that our paper is deficient in this proof , *we adduce further evidence of the purity of the sample of methyl-alcohol employed in experiments on its thermal constants .

It is almost certain that every one of these observers has dried the sample of alcohol used over lime .
Those marked with a X used either lime or gave no account of the method of drying , or we have not been able to verify the reference in Bristol .
Grodzki and Kramer specially state that sodium is preferable to barium , oxide .
Their results are close to ours ( 65'G to 66*2 at 764'8 mms , not corrected to 0 ' , with the stem of their thermometer in vapour up to 30 ' ) .
Schiff distilled once over sodium , and obtained a number practically identical with ours ( 64'8 at 763 mms .
) .
The other results are all higher ; that of Delffs is probably a misprint .
( Perhaps not : see Kopp .
) b. Specific gravity .
As Dr. Perkin has recently determined the specific gravity of methyl-alcohol , taking all precautions , and as the same method has been followed by ourselves , it is striking that the agreement is absolute .

Such a close coincidence , however , must be regarded as accidental .
It is specially to be noticed that Begnault did not obtain coincident results by the statical and dynamical methods .
He says ( vol. 26 , p. 461 ) : " La courbe graphique que j'ai tracee sir la planche V , d'apres les elements de cette Table , represent parfaitement les observations de la Serie 1 , et celles de la Serie 3 , qui d^passent 100 .
Mais toutes les experiences par ebullition , qui correspondent des temperatures inferieures k 100 ' , donnent des points qui sont tres-inferieurs la courbe , comme si la vapeur du liquid bouillant avec soubresauts etait sir ( 3chauffee .
Je nai pas jugd utile de calculer un second formule pour laquelle les temperatures seraient prises sir le thermometre k air .
" He evidently did not consider his results very trustworthy ; and this is borne out by the fact that he did not determine the specific heat of the liquid , or its heat of vaporisation .
In conclusion , we append a Table of comparative results , including recent determinations by Dittmar , as well as those by Perkin , Regnault , Schiff , and Ramsay and Young .
