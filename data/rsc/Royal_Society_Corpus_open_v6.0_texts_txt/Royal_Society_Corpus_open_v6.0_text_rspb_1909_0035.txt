B.\#151 ; Further Experiments .
Rats treated with Lithium AntiTartrate , 1 per cent. A further series of experiments has been carried out with this substance on a large number of rats , giving four doses of 4 to 5 minims ( according to weight ) of a 1 per cent , solution subcutaneously , a dose being given every other day .
Practically by this method every rat can be cured .
They have lived for varying periods , up to 249 days , and in no case have trypanosomes been found after death in the blood or in the organs .
No rat has died of the disease , and in no case thus treated has there been a recurrence .
The results have therefore been more constant than those attained with sodium or potassium antimonyl tartrates .
The treatment was begun on the third or fourth day after inoculation ; it will be seen below that when it is left until the number of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood is very great , although they may be driven out of the blood , it does not cure : so that the time at which treatment is commenced is of considerable importance .
It lias also been given intravenously in rabbits , but with far less effect than when given subcutaneously .
The elimination in this case is very rapid , to which fact we attribute its comparatively feeble action .
Rats treated with Lithium Antimonyl Tartrate on the Fifth or Sixth Day the Disease .
The blood at this period of the disease is swarming with trypanosomes , and experiments were made in order to see what effect this salt of antimony would have upon the disease at this period .
If one dose of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution be given the rats die on the seventh day , so that little or no effect is produced .
If two such doses be given , one on the fifth and one on the sixth day , the average time of death in 10 rats was 19-|- days , and living trypanosomes were found in the blood at death .
When four doses were given , one on each day from the fifth to the eighth , the time in three rats was lengthened to 81 to 86 days : in one of these even living trypanosomes were found in the blood after death .
By comparing these results with those mentioned in the former section it will be seen that the time at which the administration of the drug is begun is of importance , as well as the number of doses .
The animals stand the best chance of cure when no recurrences take place , and this is best ensured by the method described in the previous section .

Further Results of [ June 28 , Further experiments made with Rats treated with Antimony in order to find out in what Organs the Trypanosomes are latent .
Following on the experiments made on rats treated with sodium-antimony 1 tartrate , with the view of finding out where the trypanosomes are latent , and recorded in the last paper , * a further series of experiments has been made on rats inoculated with Surra , which is more amenable to treatment with antimony than the Nagana used in the former series , and completely treated ( that is , given a curative series of doses ) with lithium antimonyl tartrate : this , as stated in the paper referred to , appears to be the most active of this variety of salt .
Seven rats were treated with four doses of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate , and they were killed in succession , one on the 6th , 7th , 10th , 14th , 16th , 22nd , and 30th days after the last dose .
The livers and bone-marrows were made into an emulsion with the minimum quantity of 089 per cent , salt solution , and 1 c.c. of the emulsions of these organs and 1 c.c. of heart 's blood was injected separately into other rats .
The results were entirely negative .
Microscopic preparations were made of the material injected and no organisms were seen , and none of the sub-inoculations gave a positive result .
Experiments made in order to see if any Protection was afforded by Initial Treatment with Antimony .
A series of six rats was treated with four doses of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate , one dose every other day in the same manner as when given for curative purposes .
They were then inoculated with Surra , one on the first day after the completion of the treatment , and one on the 2nd , 4th , 5th , 9th , and 10th days after .
They all died on the 5th or 6th days after inoculation , just as untreated rats would have done , so that antimony in this very soluble form is of no protective use in rats , owing most probably to its rapid elimination .
The blood of an uninfected rat treated as above has also been used in the in vitro experiments recorded below .
Rats treated with Sodium Antimony Lactate and with Antimony Sodium Calcium Lactate .
Through the kindness of Messrs , von Heyden we have been enabled to make some experiments with the above compounds .
The sodium antimony lactate contains 26 per cent , of antimony , and the antimony sodium calcium * 'Roy .

lactate 17 per cent. , so they are both much weaker in antimony than the tartrates which we have used .
By the addition of a small quantity of lactic acid we were able to get a 1 per cent , solution of both salts , and in this ; strength the solutions were not very irritating , but neither with rats nor with larger animals are they as effective as the tartrates or the metal .

A similar experiment made with a rat treated with antimony sodium calcium lactate yielded practically the same result .

Experimen made with Antimony { Metal in state of finest Division ) suspended in various Oily Media .
Since the curative results following treatment with the metal antimony* suspended in Colonel Lambkin 's medium seemed promising , many trials have been made with the metal suspended in other oily media , such as olive oil , cod liver oil , lanolin , egg-yolk , etc. , in order , if possible , to obviate , or at any rate reduce , the extremely irritating properties of the metal , which seriously interfere with its practical use .
In olive oil a 5 per cent , suspension was used : with one dose of 3 minims Surra rats lived for 15 days , and died with living trypanosomes in their blood .
Seventeen Surra rats were given one dose of 5 minims on the fourth day of the disease , and they lived from 41 to 133 days : in these there were no recurrences , nor were trypanosomes found after death , and sub-inoculations were in every case negative .
Six Surra rats were treated with the same dose in order to observe the time taken for the complete disappearance of the trypanosomes from the blood .

] Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
Two Surra rats were taken on the fifth day , when the blood was swarming with trypanosomes , and 6 minims were given .
Two and a-half hours after the rats were killed , and smears were made from the lungs , liver , spleen , kidney , bone-marrow , heart 's blood , and brain .
In none of the specimens could a trypanosome be found after prolonged examination .
This oil was also given to several rats upon recurrences after treatment with small doses of the lactates mentioned above : in these cases the effect was much less marked , even although the number of trypanosomes in the blood was much less than in the rats treated for the first time .
This accords with our general experience that recurrences are much more difficult to deal with than the initial infection , and this applies to all the drugs we have tried .
A suspension in cod liver oil took four hours to drive the trypanosomes out of the peripheral blood .
The suspension in egg-yolk appeared to act in rats better than any other ; in dogs , however , the results were variable ; sometimes strikingly good , at others no better than the other mixtures : sometimes causing great irritation and sloughing , sometimes not causing any irritation at all .
We have rats alive for more than 120 days after inoculation , with no recurrences , after one dose .
An experiment was made to see how long one dose took to drive the trypanosomes out of the blood .
A Surra rat on the fourth day was treated with 5 minims of a 5 per cent , suspension .
Blood was taken f hour after injection ... 1^ hours " \#187 ; " and showed the following : Trypanosomes much affected , but not decreased .
Many " battledore " forms .
Trypanosomes reduced in numbers : all swollen and " battledore " forms : very little movement .
No trypanosomes found .
Experiments with Quassia .
Dr. Guillemard , of Cambridge , suggested that quassia , on account of its known poisonous effects on some of the lower forms of life , should be tested for its trypanocidal qualities .
A series of experiments was therefore undertaken on rats .
Six Surra rats were treated on the third and following days of the disease with a 5 per cent , solution of the pharmacopoeal extract of quassia : they were given three doses subcutaneously\#151 ; 5 minims on the third day , 10 minims on the fourth , and 10 minims on the fifth day .
The trypanosomes were entirely unaffected , and the animals died on the sixth\#151 ; seventh day .
360 Mr. Plimmer and Capt. Fry .
Further Results of [ June 28 , Another series of 12 Surra rats was treated with a two hours ' decoction of quassia-wood made with the minimum amount of water .
Of this three doses were given\#151 ; 5 minims on the third day and 10 minims on the fourth and fifth days .
The trypanosomes in these rats were also entirely unaffected , and the animals died on the sixth\#151 ; seventh day .
It was also tried intravenously in rabbits in doses of SO minims of the decoction : no effect was produced , and .the rabbits died on or about the 42nd day .
Experiments made in vitro correspond with these results , and will bS described later .
Experiments withA Professor Ehrlich kindly sent some of this substance to Dr. Bagshawe , the Director of the Sleeping Sickness Bureau , with which we have made some initial experiments upon rats .
Ehrlich found that Eagana mice could be 'Cured , in practically every case , with this substance .
But the effects on larger animals , so far as we have gone , are not quite so satisfactory , and it \#166 ; compares in this undesirable manner very well with the antimony tartrates , with which we can cure practically every case of Surra in rats , but which do not have anything like the corresponding effects on rabbits , guinea-pigs , and .dogs .
It is not only in the question of practical dosage that difficulties arise : \lt ; each kind of animal has a personal equation , and their reaction to a given drug is not similar .
This , and the relatively larger dosage in bigger animals , present considerable practical difficulties in the treatment of trypanosomiasis .
Our experiments have given the following results .
Out of eight Surra rats of 180 to 200 grammes weight which were given one dose of 25 minims of a 1 in 80 solution of arsenophenylglycin , four died on the 19th day with living trypanosomes in their blood , the recurrences having taken place on the 16th\#151 ; 17th day .
Two were given three and five doses respectively of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate on the 17th and following days , and they lived 59 and 51 days .
Of the two which are still living ( 95 days ) , one has had five doses of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of- lithium antimonyl tartrate , beginning on the 17th day , and the other had one similar dose given on the day before the recurrences occurred in the other rats .
The following experiment shows the effect of this substance upon the trypanosomes in the blood , and how much longer it takes than the antimony salts to produce its effects .
A Surra rat on the fourth day of the disease was treated with 1 c.c. of a 2 per cent , solution of arsenophenylglycin ( practically the same dose as given to the other rats ) .

On the Effects of the Drugs used upon the Trypanosomes in the Living Body .
In studying the therapeutic effect of the various drugs tried , including metallic antimony in a state of finest division , repeated observations of the peripheral blood were made in order to observe the effect of the drug upon the trypanosomes , and to ascertain when the trypanosomes entirely disappeared from the blood .
The first stage noticed of the effect of the drug was a great increase in the motility of the trypanosomes , followed by a gradual slowing down to movements slower than normal .
At this stage there is a tendency for the whole trypanosome to swell , and to become bloated in appearance .
The swelling of the trypanosome continues until it becomes almost spherical in form , or oftener " battledore " shaped ; the protoplasm becomes indistinct , and the flagellum appears to be attached to only one side of the periphery ; the macro-nucleus is fairly distinct , but it eventually breaks up , and then the swollen mass disintegrates .
The .
spleen at this time is full of these broken up masses of trypanosomes , and as the nuclei will still stain , a plasmodial appearance is seen in films of bits of nuclei dotted about in a granular ground .
These stages can be observed after treatment with all the salts of antimony used , and are well marked after the administration of the metal , in which case , however , the stages are slower .
The soluble salts , lithium and sodium antimonyl tartrates , effect the total disappearance of the trypanosomes in about one hour .
Metallic antimony , when given in the various media tried ( Lambkin 's medium , olive oil , cod liver oil , heavy paraffin oil , egg-yolk ) , brings about this disappearance in from two-and-a-half to four hours , according to the medium used : the first noticeable effects being produced in about half an hour .
In the case of egg-yolk and olive oil the blood is free from trypanosomes in two-and-a-half hours .
This would seem 362 Mr. Plimmer and Capt. Fry .
Further Results of [ June 28 , to show that some portion of the metal introduced must be changed into some soluble form very rapidly ; but apparently after the reaction of the tissues occurs the antimony becomes more or less shut off , and absorption must take place very slowly , as traces of the metal , apparently unaltered , have been found as late as six to seven weeks after the injection .
Sodium antimony lactate and antimony sodium calcium lactate were found to act rather more slowly than the above ( see Table above ) , the time at which the trypanosomes had completely disappeared varying from three to four hours .
It was noticed in these experiments that ' trypanosomes , though obviously drug-affected when the blood was taken , remained alive on the slide outside the body for a long time after all forms had disappeared from the circulating-blood .
Further details of the time taken for the various drugs to act will be found in the sections upon sodium antimony lactate , antimony oil , antimony egg-yolk , and arsenophenylglycin .
On the Action of Trypanocidal Substances in vitro .
Experiments have been carried out with a view of throwing light on the more exact nature of the changes which are produced in trypanosomes when they are brought into contact with trypanocidal substances .
The general principles we have observed in these experiments have been : 1 .
To dissolve the drug in some fluid so that when it is added to the infected blood it will not cause osmosis to occur in the cellular elements of , or trypanosomes contained in the blood .
( The various substances were dissolved in a 089 per cent , salt solution , isotonic with rat 's blood which was used in these experiments .
) 2 .
To use always equal volumes of the solution and of the affected blood .
3 .
To use blood at the time when the trypanosomes are just becoming very numerous , so as to avoid the presence of old , feebly moving forms , which are always present in the later stages of an acute infection .
The method of observation has been to watch the behaviour of the trypanosomes when in contact with the various solutions of the drug under the microscope .
A measured drop of blood and of the solution are mixed on a slide with care : the mixed drop is then covered with a sufficiently large cover glass , and this is sealed with vaseline .
It has been found possible in this manner to exactly determine the dilutions at which the various drugs used cease to have an instantaneously trypanocidal action ; further , in higher dilutions , by carefully watching the changes taking place in the trypanosomes , it is possible to determine the dilution at which no effect is produced , and between these two points 1909 .
] Experimental Treatment of Trypanosomiasis .
the periods of time necessary to ensure immobility and death of the trypanosomes can be ascertained .
By a comparison of the results obtained a very good estimate of the probable action of any drug when given to an affected animal can be arrived at .
For instance , sodium and lithium antimonyl tartrates were found to act , in the same dilutions , in a manner fairly comparable to their antimony content , and to their action on the trypanosomes in an affected animal .
Again , with atoxyl a much higher concentration of the drug was necessary\#151 ; it had to be about ten times stronger\#151 ; in order to obtain the same destruction pictures , results corresponding with the rapidity of the disappearance of trypanosomes from the peripheral blood of affected animals when treated with the above drugs .
In the case of the two new lactates mentioned above , their therapeutical value was accurately foretold by a preliminary study of their action vitro in the manner described .
In all these experiments controls have been carried out : it has been found that trypanosomes will live and retain their activity for hours when infected blood and the diluting fluid alone are mixed together .
The various changes taking place in trypanosomes on coming into contact with a dilute trypanocidal drug , commencing with their preliminary extraordinary increase of activity , and their subsequent swelling up , immobility , and disintegration , can be watched in all their different stages in this manner .
These effects resemble very closely the changes which take place in the trypanosomes in the peripheral circulation of an animal treated with antimony .
The following tables show the effects produced by the different substances in their various dilutions .

Further Results of [ June 28 , Experiments in vitro performed with the Blood of Normal Rat which had , been treated with Antimony .
Experiments were made in order to ascertain whether the blood of a rat which had been treated with antimony would show any active trypanocidal powers in vitro .
Although in the case of an infected animal all the trypanosomes in the peripheral blood would have been destroyed in about an hour , no noticeable trypanocidal effects were shown by the blood of a treated rat in the following experiments .
A normal rat had 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate injected subcutaneously : its blood was taken at 15 , 30 , 60 , and 70 minutes after the injection , and was mixed with an equal quantity of blood from a Surra rat containing many trypanosomes ; the mixed bloods , taken at the times mentioned , were examined under the microscope at various intervals from 5 to 30 minutes after the mixing , and the trypanosomes were found to be entirely unaffected , so that the blood of the treated normal rat did not have any trypanocidal effect added to it by the dose of lithium antimonyl tartrate .
The Surra rat , whose blood was used for this experiment , was then given 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate :\#151 ; Blood was taken and showed the following : 10 minutes after injection ... Trypanosomes affected : movement very rapid .
20 " " ... Many " battledores .
" 40 " " ... Trypanosomes greatly decreased in number all " battledores .
" 60 " " ... Blood quite free from trypanosomes .
A normal rat was given four doses subcutaneously , one every other day , of 5 minims of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimonyl tartrate : 24 hours after the last dose a drop of its blood was mixed with a drop of blood from a Surra rat in which trypanosomes were plentiful .
The mixture was watched under the microscope for half an hour , but no effect was produced : the blood of the treated animal behaving just as the blood of the control , an untreated rat .
A normal rat was given subcutaneously 10 minims ( a lethal dose ) of a 1 per cent , solution of lithium antimony 1 tartrate , and its blood was mixed at half an hour , one hour , and one-and-a-half hours after the injection with an equal part of an emulsion of trypanosomes prepared from the lungs , liver , and heart 's blood of a Surra rat just dead .
Each of the mixtures was examined up to 30 minutes , but no effect whatever was produced on the 1909 .

These experiments may he compared with those recorded on p. 356 .
Experiments with Antimony upon Dogs .
Since the date of the last paper a large number of experiments have been made with antimony in various forms upon dogs suffering from Surra .
Of the five dogs mentioned there one remains alive and well at the present date , more than a year after inoculation .
Our experiences with dogs show that they are extremely susceptible both to the disease and also to antimony : they are therefore not quite suitable animals for these experiments , although they have all lived many times the length of the untreated disease , that is 14 days .
Five of the dogs were treated with small doses of sodium antimonyl tartrate in their drinking water , but the disease is so acute in dogs that this method of giving the drug , although it appeared to have some effect in postponing the reappearance of the trypanosomes in the blood , did not produce results sufficiently encouraging to warrant further experiments .
With regard to the experiments made with metallic antimony suspended in egg-yolk , the initial experiment was so encouraging as to make a further trial necessary .
In this case the dog at the first relapse was given 20 minims of a 2^ per cent , suspension : there was no local reaction , which in dogs is of frequent occurrence after the administration of antimony in any form , and the trypanosomes , which were very numerous , were entirely absent from the blood in 24 hours ; the dog remained quite free from them for 48 days , and gained 3 lbs. in weight , and appeared perfectly well .
The recurrence was very sudden , as the dog was perfectly well up to the moment when he was seized with a series of fits which ushered in the recurrence , from which he did not recover .
A rat treated at the same time as this dog with 5 minims of the same suspension is alive and well more than 100 days after this one dose .
Many of the dogs mentioned in the table below have died withi fits and paralyses and other nervous symptoms , hut we are not certain whether these are due to the disease or to the antimony .
In certain of the dogs the treatment has appeared to alter the acute disease into a chronic one , and in one of these more chronic cases there was a considerable excess of cerebrospinal fluid and a cellular exudation around the vessels in the brain , very similar in incidence and extent to that described and figured by one of us in rats dead from infection with Trypanosoma There is a curious uncertainty in the local effects produced in dogs by * ' Roy .

Further Results of [ June 28 , antimony , whether injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly , and they vary from time to time in the same dog ; sometimes little or no effect is produced , and sometimes the suppuration and necrosis produced are sufficient to kill the animal .
We have recently given 24 injections of lithium antimonyl tartrate subcutaneously to three dogs in the greatest possible dilution : of these three places have suppurated slightly , although the conditions under which they were given were similar to those under which the 21 other doses were given .
( These dogs are now living and well 53 days after inoculation , and they have had no'recurrences .
