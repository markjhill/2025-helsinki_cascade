The following communications were read I. " On the Durability and Preservation of Iron Ships , and on Riveted Joints .
" By Sir Wiljliam Fairbairn , Bart. , F.R.S. Received March 5 , 1873 .
( Abstract .
) The disaster which happened to the * Megaera ' is first discussed , as showing the need of constant inspection of iron structures .
That vessel was built by the author of the paper in 1849 , and , in his opinion , would have been perfectly sound at the present time if her interior had been freely open to inspection , and if such inspection had been regularly carried out .
Some years ago an 'alarming report was circulated as to the Sir W. Fairbairn on the Durability and [ Apr. 24 , corrosion of the Menai Bridge .
The author on that occasion visited the bridge , and found that no corrosion had taken place , careful attention to \gt ; proper means of prevention having been sufficient to preserve the structure .
The proved value of periodical inspections in the case of steam-boilers is then alluded to , and the author urges the importance of similar 1 inspections of iron ships by the Admiralty and by private shipowners .
As respects riveted joints , the author first discusses the relative merits of machine- and hand-riveting , and points out that in machine-riveting there is much greater security that the rivets properly fill the rivet-holes .
The rate at which riveting can be done is given as 16 rivets per minute with a lever riveting-machine , 10 rivets per minute with a steam riveting-machine , and 0*66 rivet per minute when the riveting is done by hand .
Experiments on Riveted Joints .
The author alludes , first , to the series of experiments on riveted joints which were communicated by him to the Royal Society in 1850 .
Those experiments showed that , taking the strength of a solid plate at 100 , the strength of an equal width of riveted joint would be 70 if the joint were double riveted , and 56 if the joint were single riveted : in other words , 30 per cent , of strength is lost in a double-riveted joint , and 44 per cent. ; in a single-riveted joint .
Since that time it has appeared to some engineers that the process of punching was injurious to the plates , and in many cases recourse has been had to drilling to form the rivet-holes .
On this point the author was of opinion that with good iron no sensible injury resulted from punching the rivet-holes ; on the other hand , with rigid and bad plates , the plate would crack between the rivet-holes , and the plate would have to be discarded .
He regarded it as a distinct advantage of the punching-process that it thus tested the quality of the iron .
It had been found in certain cases that the rivets sheared across with a less force when in drilled than when in punched holes , and this had been attributed to the sharpness of the edges of the drilled holes .
This point seemed to require investigation , and experiments to elucidate it had , therefore , been made , the results of which are narrated in the paper .
The theory that the sharp edges of drilled holes induced a cutting action , which diminished the strength of the rivets , had suggested to Colonel Inglis , R.E. , to try whether a greater resistance in the joint could be obtained by purposely rounding the edges of the rivet-holes^ Some experiments had been made for Colonel Inglis by Mr. Kirka y\gt ; from which it appeared that the resistance of the rivet was increase per cent , by this rounding of the edges of the rivet-holes .
The aut or has also experimented on this point , and the results of his experiment\#174 ; are given in the paper .

A series of tables of experiments are then given , each resu fully discussed .

( This rivet did not shear .
The plate broke away .
) The general conclusions drawn by the author from his experiments are as follows:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Joints with drilled holes are weaker and elongate less before fracture than joints with punched holes .
The average of four experiments on joints with drilled holes , compared with the average of four experiments on joints with punched holes , shows that the rivets in the former are 1*36 ton per square inch , or 6^ per cent. , weaker than the rivets in the latter .
The elongation is also 26 per cent , less with drilled than with punched holes .
( 2 ) Hand-riveted joints are somewhat stronger than machine-riveted joints .
The mean of three experiments on hand-riveted joints , compared with the mean of three experiments on machine-riveted joints , shows an excess of shearing resistance in the rivets in the hand-riveted joints amounting to 1*495 ton per square inch , or 7| per cent. The hand-riveted joint also elongates 26 per cent , more than the machine-riveted joint .
( 3 ) There is a decided increase in the strength of the rivet when the edges z 2 262 On the Preservation of Iron Ships , [ Apr. 24 , of the rivet-holes are rounded , so as to diminish their cutting action .
The mean of three experiments on joints with rounded holes , compared with the mean of three experiments on joints with unrounded punched holes , and with the mean of three experiments on joints with unrounded drilled holes , gives the following results:\#151 ; Shearing resistance of rivet .

As regards the apparent superiority of hand-riveting as compared with machine-riveting , the author observes that this is due to the fact that in hand-riveted joints the rivet is slightly hardened by being hammered after it is cold .
In small experimental joints hand-riveting has therefore a slight advantage in strength ; but the defects of hand-riveting are not likely to be exhibited in experiments on a small scale .
The experiments seem conclusive as to the inferiority of joints with drilled holes ; and the author reiterates his conviction that the force used in punching plates is a valuable practical test of their quality , and tends to prevent the use of inferior iron .
Appendix I. In this Appendix are given the results of Colonel Inglis 's experiments on joints with rivet-holes the edges of which are rounded .
These experiments agree with the author 's in most respects ; they show the superiority of punched to drilled holes , but the difference of the strength of the rivets in Colonel Inglis 's experiments is only 2\#163 ; per cent. On the other hand , in Colonel Inglis 's experiments the superiority of the joints with rounded holes is much greater than in the author 's , amounting on the average to 29 per cent. Appendix II .
On the Theory of the Resistance of Riveted Joints .
In this Appendix the ordinary theory of the resistance of riveted joints is discussed , and some points in which it is defective are pointed out .
It is shown that a riveted joint may give way either : ( 1 ) by the tearing of the plates from the rivet-hole to the edge of the plates , ( 2 ) by the tearing of the plates from rivet-hole to rivet-hole ; ( 3 ) by the shearing of the rivet .
When the plate gives way by tearing^ from the rivet-hole to the edge of the plate , a bending stress is induced in the 1873 .
] On determining the best Course for a .
part of the plate in front of the rivet .
The amount of that bending stress is approximately estimated , and a rule found for the distance of the rivet-hole from the edge of the plate .
When the plate gives way by tearing from rivet-hole to rivet-hole , it is commonly assumed that the stress on the part of the plate between the rivets is a uniformly distributed stress .
This is shown to be not strictly correct , and the want of uniformity of stress will cause the plate to give way with a lower average intensity of stress than that which corresponds to the ultimate resistance of the plate to tension .
How much the plate may be weakened by the want of uniformity in the distribution of the stress it is impossible to calculate .
Probably the loss of strength due to this cause is in ductile plates very small ; but it is pointed out that this weakening may account , at least in part , for the apparent loss of strength of the plates at joints as compared with the same plates broken in an unperforated condition .
This loss of strength has been hitherto ascribed entirely to injury done to the plate in the punching-process .
When the rivet gives way by shearing , the stress on the section is also not uniform .
In consequence of the great deformation of the rivet before fracture , it is subjected to bending as well as shearing action .
The friction between the plates induced by the contraction of the rivets in cooling has been supposed sometimes to add to the apparent resistance of the rivet to shearing .
It is shown that a considerable displacement of the plates takes place before ultimate fracture , and that the deformation of the rivets is so great that it can hardly be supposed that they exert any tension , holding the plates together at the moment of fracture .
The friction should therefore be entirely neglected in estimating the ultimate resistance of riveted joints ; and this , indeed , has been done by most English writers .
The question of the resistance to deformation is then discussed , and a limit fixed for the safe intensity of the pressure on the bearing surface of the rivet .
The practical considerations affecting the diameter of the rivet are then stated ; and joining these to the considerations given above , a series of rules for proportioning riveted joints are drawn up , and some Tables of the proportions of rivets and joints are given .

If we desire to estimate which of two alternative passages between the same ports would be performed most quickly on the average of many voyages , no knowledge can be more immediately useful than that of the distance which the ship could accomplish at various points of the routes
