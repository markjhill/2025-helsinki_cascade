104 On Iodide of Silver and its Alloys .
[ June 15 , The third lung-bearing segment is supplied by the ganglion which lies in that segment .
The fourth , lung-bearing segment has no ganglion lying in it , and appears to depend entirely for its nerve-supply on the median nerve given off by the ganglion which , as in Androctonus , is placed in the next following segment .
These relations can only be understood by the aid of drawings .
The woodcut shows diagrammatically in three figures , fig. 2 the disposition in Androctonusfunestus ( agreeing essentially with Newport 's description ) , fig. 3 the disposition in Scorpio of Ceylon , fig. 4 the disposition described by Dufour .
This last diagram has been constructed from Dufour 's drawing .
It is without doubt erroneous in important particulars relative to the large ganglion of the prosoma , and is very probably erroneous in regard to other particulars .
It is worthy of attention as tending to associate the European scorpions of the sub-genus Euscorpius with those of the type of Buthus afer , to which Sc. cyaneus of Ceylon belongs , that in Scorpio Italicus and Scorpio Carpathicus , I have found the same disposition of the ganglia and of the primary branches of the ventral nerve-cord as that drawn in fig. 3 .
The only difference observed was that the ganglia in these European species are all a little further forward , so as to lie close to the anterior limit of the segments in which they occur .
We thus find that an important anatomical difference obtains between the Scorpions with triangular sternum ( Androctoni ) and the Scorpions with pentagonal sternum ( Euscorpii , Buthi , \amp ; c. ) .
Whether the Scorpions with band-like sternum ( Telegoni ) differ from or agree with either of these types in respect of their nervous system , has yet to be discovered .

( Abstract .
) The authors ' calorimetric investigation refers to substances which have been already studied by Mr. G. F. Rodwell ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. " vol. 32 ) as to their expansion and contraction by heat .
After having detailed the method of experimenting and tabulated the results of determinations for each substance , the authors recapitulate the results in the following table:\#151 ; 1882 .

In this table 0X and 02are the temperatures at which the structure change commences and finishes , according to Mr. Rodwell 's results , c denotes the mean specific heat of the substance between t and 1 for temperatures below is the specific heat for temperatures beyond 02 ; and X- is the heat absorbed by the unit weight of the substance in consequence of modification of structure .
The relative accuracy of certain results and some probable conclusions are finally discussed .

The following theorems will be established :\#151 ; ( A. ) The product of the perpendiculars drawn from all the cusps in each of these roulettes on any tangent is a function of the perpendicular only , which is drawn on the same tangent from the centre of the fixed circle , on which the roulette is generated .
Consequently ( B. ) The sums of the cotangents of the angles which any tangent to the roulette makes with the vectors drawn from the cusps to the point of contact is a function of the cotangent of the angle made by the vector drawn from the centre with the same tangent line , and of the perpendicular drawn from the centre .

These propositions are extended to spherical geometry , and their dual forms stated both for planimetry and spherics .
