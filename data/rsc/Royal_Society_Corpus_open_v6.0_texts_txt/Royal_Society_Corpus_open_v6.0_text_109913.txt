] The object of this paper is to show that the purple substance obtained by heating a mixture of the lithic and nitric acids , is a compound of ammonia with a peculiar acid principle , which the author proposes to call Purpuric Acid , a term suggested by its peculiar tendency to form red or purple compounds .
The purpuric acid is obtained by digesting pure lithic acid in dilute nitric acid , neutralizing the excess of the latter by ammonia , and evaporating till granular crystals , consisting of purpurate of ammonia , separate .
The ammonia is removed by sulphuric or muriatic acid , and the purpuric acid thus obtained in a free state .
The author next points out the characters of this acid .
It is very sparingly soluble in water , and insoluble in alcohol and ether .
In the mineral acids , and in the alkalies , it readily dissolves .
It is insoluble in dilute sulphuric , muriatic , phosphoric , oxalic , citric , and tartaric acids .
When heated it neither melts nor sublimes , but becomes purple , from the production of ammonia , and then burns gradually without any particular odour .
It unites with the metallic oxides ; and when aided by heat , expels carbonic acid from the alkaline carbonates .
It does not unite with any other acid .
Upon these characters the author thinks that its properties , as an acid , are sufficiently established .
Dr. Prout then proceeds to describe its compounds with different bases , which , with few exceptions , are of a purple or reddish colour : he thinks that some of them might be used as pigments , or employed in the art of dyeing .
