Glossina brevipalpis as a Carrier of Trypanosome Disease in Nyasaland .
By Surgeon-General Sir David Bruce , C.B. , E.R.S. , A.M.S. ; Major A. E. Hamerton , D.S.O. , and Captain D. P. Watson , R.A.M.C. ; and Lady Bruce , R.R.C. ( Scientific Commission of the Royal Society , Nyasaland , 1912-14.)* ( Received March 25 , \#151 ; Read April 30 , 1914 .
) [ Plate 1 .
] Introduction .
Glossina brevipalpis ( Newstead ) is found at many spots along the west shore of Lake Nyasa .
The nearest point to the Commission 's camp at Kasu where they were at all common was at the mouth of the Lingadzi river ( 13 ' 27 ' S. lat. , 34 ' 19 ' E. long .
) .
This was 50 miles away , but with the aid of a motor-cycle specimens of these flies were brought up to the camp .
It is proposed in this paper to give : ( I ) a short account of the habits of this tsetse fly ; ( II ) the results of the dissection of the flies ; ( III ) the infectivity of the wild flies ; and ( IV ) the result of various transmission experiments .
One of the members of the Commission camped on the Lake-shore from April 26 to May 10 , 1913 , to superintend the catching and sending to the camp of these flies .
He has supplied the following account of their habits:\#151 ; * Major D. Harvey , R.A.M.C. , took part in the work described in this and the four following papers ; but , having left the Commission in September , 1913 , before the reports were drawn up , his name does not appear in the titles .
Carrier of Trypanosome Disease in Nyasaland .
I. Habits of G. breyipalpis .
G. brevipalpis is found frequenting the roads in a small area of country around Markho village on the west shore of Lake Nyasa , at the mouth of the Lingadzi river .
This tract of country , which may be roughly estimated at about 5 square miles in extent , is broken up by swampy hollows and streams forming the delta of the Lingadzi .
It is covered with palm forest and a dense undergrowth of high grass and bush , and is traversed by two main roads , one between Markho and Lingadzi estate running east and west , and another running parallel to the Lake-shore and about 1 mile to the west of it .
The roads are hoed tracks about 3 yards broad , cut through the palm forest and walled in by high grass and almost impenetrable bush .
G. brevipalpis is crepuscular in its habits and quite unlike other Nyasaland tsetse flies .
During the daytime , from dawn till about an hour before dark , one may pass along the roads or wander in the surrounding jungle without encountering a single fly of this species .
But as evening approaches odd flies suddenly appear sitting motionless in the middle of the hard-trodden path all the way along the road between Markho and Kasache , a distance of 2 miles , and for about 2 or 3 miles up the Lingadzi road .
They do not follow or settle upon passers-by like other tsetse flies , and they would pay no attention to a dog which was repeatedly walked through their haunts in the evening .
In the dim light they are difficult to see , and resemble little bits of earth on the path , but the searcher 's attention is attracted by the sound of them buzzing up as they are disturbed by his footsteps .
They immediately settle on the path again and are easily caught , for if missed by the first stroke of the .net they at once resettle near the same spot .
The hard-trodden surface of the path seems to have an irresistible attraction for them .
They do not move about in search of food or chase each other , but remain motionless for several minutes , and when they move it is only to fly up and immediately settle again in the middle of the path .
They were never seen on the roads at dawn , as the mornings at this time of the year were invariably cold and misty .
Out of the 500 flies caught and examined on the spot all were males .
Some of them were found on dissection to contain mammalian blood .
Game , such as buffalo and several species of antelope , is common in the district .
Flies kept in captivity remain dormant on the sides of their cage during the day .
At night they are very active and buzz incessantly in their efforts to escape .
If the side of the cage be applied to the skin of a goat or a dog they will feed with avidity at any time of the day or night .
A few wild flies were dissected in order to ascertain their natural food .
22 Sir D. Bruce and others .
G. brevipalpis as a In 50 flies seven contained recognisable blood .
This in six cases was antelope blood , in the seventh probably human .
It is curious the great preponderance of males over females .
It seems to be a habit of the former to frequent paths in the evening , while the females presumably hide in the thick jungle .
The same thing obtained to a lesser extent with G. morsitans .
Among all the G. brevipalpis dissected at the laboratory , amounting to several hundreds , only four females were found .
II .
Dissection of Wild G. brevipalpis to Ascertain with what Species of Trypanosomes , if any , they are Infected .
Four hundred and ninety-six wild flies were examined ; 44 of these were positive and 452 negative .
Table I gives the result of the dissection of the positive flies .
Among the 44 flies which contained flagellates , it was possible to make a more or less correct guess at the species in 19 .
These are vel rhodesiense , 1 ; T. pecorum , 9 ; T. simice , 1 ; and grayi , 8 .
In 10 flies the flagellates were considered to belong to a pathogenic type , species unknown .
No opinion could be expressed about the remaining 15 .
It is curious that G. brevipalpis should contain flagellates resembling T. grayi , which is so often found in G. palpalis .
Now one thing common to G. brevipalpis and G. palpalis is that they both live alongside water .
This would point to the vertebrate host of grayi , if there is one , being some water animal , such as the crocodile or iguana , or some water bird .
Conclusion .
Wild G. brevipalpis are naturally infected with T. brucei vel rhodesiense , T. pecorum and T. simice .

Transmission Experiments .
Several experiments were carried out with , to ascertain if this species of tsetse fly can act as a carrier of the various pathogenic trypanosomes found in Nyasaland .
These experiments were made , not with laboratory-bred but with wild flies , and this of course takes away much of their value .
It was found impossible , on account of the distance from the Lake-shore and the scarcity of flies , to attempt the breeding of G. brevipalpis , in order to obtain laboratory-bred flies .
The species of trypanosomes experimented with were : ( 1 ) brucei vel rhodesiense , the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland ; ( 2 ) T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 ; ( 3 ) T. pecorum ; and ( 4 ) T. caprce .

Two hundred and thirty-two wild G. brevipalpis were used in six experiments , but in no case with a positive result .
Only fifty-three flies were dissected and eight infected flies found .
If all had been dissected probably about 30 to 40 infected flies would have been found .

\lt ; ( c ) Result of the Dissection of the Infected Flies .
As will be seen from Table III , eight infected flies were found among the ( jt .
hrevipalpis which had fed on animals infected with the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland .
The following Table gives the result of the dissection of these eight flies:\#151 ; 26 Sir D. Bruce and others .

One of these appeared to be infected with T. grayi , the other with a trypanosome of a pathogenic type .
In Experiment 2213 there were also two infected flies .
In one the development was restricted to the proboscis and the alimentary tract ; in the other the salivary glands as well as the intestine were found to be swarming with trypanosomes .
This fly , which was dissected 33 days after it had fed on an infected monkey , had the whole lumen of the glands filled with active motile trypanosomes , which came pouring out of the broken end of the glands .
It was thought at the time that these must be infective forms of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland , but a part of the salivary glands and contents of gut injected into a white rat failed to infect it .
In spite of this negative experiment , however , it is probable that this represents a true development of the Nyasaland trypanosome in G. brevipalpis , the development not having reached the infective stage .
A. fuller description of the morphology of these salivary forms will be given , under the next heading .
It may be noted here that salivary glands infected by T. brucei vel rhodesiense or by T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , seem to be more crowded with trypanosomes than in the corresponding infection of G. palpalis by T. gambiense .
The salivary glands in the former case appear to be swollen and bursting with the flagellates .
In Experiment 2232 there were four infected flies found , but in none was there any invasion of the salivary glands .
( d ) Morphology of the Trypanosomes found in the Salivary Glands of a Wild G. brevipalpis which had fed on a Monkey infected with the Trypanosome causing Disease in Man in Nyasaland .
This fly , as described above , was found in Experiment 2213 , and failed to infect the clean Bog 2237 which it had been fed upon .
Part of the salivary Carrier of Trypanosome Disease in " lands and contents of the intestine also failed to infect Eat 2234 .
It would .
\#169 ; appear , then , that this fly had not yet reached the infective stage .
It is now proposed to describe the different forms of the trypanosomes found in the salivary glands of this fly somewhat in detail , and to bring forward a theory in regard to a stage which seems to occur in the final development of this trypanosome in the salivary glands .
The different forms and apparent stages in their development could be more easily made out in G. brevipalpis than in G. morsitans , on account of its greater size .
On Plate 1 this evolution of the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland in the salivary glands is represented .
Figs. 1 and 2 represent the long , slender developmental forms of trypanosomes found in the intestine of the fly , from the mid-gut to the proventriculus .
It is this type of trypanosome which invades the salivary glands .
Fig. 3 shows the change in shape which the intestinal forms undergo on entering the salivary glands .
The posterior extremity lengthens somewhat and the micronucleus and flagellum pass forward .
This appears to he the commencement of the change to the crithidial type .
Fig. 4 represents the fully developed crithidial form of the parasite .
The micronucleus and flagellum have passed further forward until they lie anterior to the nucleus .
The anterior portion of the parasite has broadened out ; the posterior has become attenuated .
Fig. 5 , the parasite is still crithidial in form .
The anterior half has become still broader , the posterior half elongated and further attenuated .
Fig. 6 , the attenuated posterior portion has shortened .
Figs. 7 , 8 and 9 represent further stages in the evolution .
The long attenuated posterior extremity has disappeared and the parasite has become contracted and thickened .
Fig. 10 shows the last phase of the crithidial stage .
Here the parasite has-assumed a rounded form and the flagellum is folding on itself .
Fig. 11 represents a group of parasites in the encysted stage .
In this form they are found massed together in the lumen of the salivary glands .
Fig. 12 , in this group the encysted forms are just unfolding .
Fig. 13 shows a single encysted form breaking open .
The micronucleus is-now posterior to the nucleus ; the crithidial has become the trypanosomah Figs. 14 , 15 , 16 , and 17 demonstrate further stages in the unfolding of the encysted form .
The parasite is now assuming a trypanosome shape .
Figs. 18 and 19 show the fully developed salivary-gland form of the trypanosome .
This constitutes a reversion to the " blood form " from which the cycle of development began and is the only infective form .
On comparing these figures with the developmental forms of the 28 Sir D. Bruce and others .
G. brevipalpis as a trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland in G. morsitans* or with the same forms of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , f it will be apparent that in all probability this is a true development of this trypanosome in G. brevipalpis .
It is true wild flies are being dealt with , but in this district it is only trypanosomes of this type which invade the salivary glands , so that T. pecorum , T. simice , and T. caprce are excluded .
It is very unlikely that T. grayi invades the salivary glands .
Conclusion G. brevipalpis is capable of acting as a carrier of brucei vel rhodesiense , the trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland .

Carrier of Trypanosome Disease in Nyasaland .
20 Two hundred wild G. brevipalpis were used in three experiments\#151 ; one positive , two negative .
Only twelve flies were dissected , one of which was found to contain in the intestine long , ribbon-like trypanosomes of apparently a pathogenic type , but it was not possible to place it .
It is to be regretted that all the flies had not been dissected as was the rule in these transmission , experiments .
Dog 2276 became infected 58 days after the flies had fed on the infected ' animal .
This would point to the development of T. brucei , Zululand , in the flies .
If there had been a fly in the cage naturally infected with the Nyasaland strain , then the animal fed upon ought to have shown trypanosomes in its blood earlier than 58 days .
It may therefore be held as highly probable that Dog 2276 was infected by a G. brevipalpis in which a development of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , had taken place .

The Development of T. caprse G. brevipalpis .
( a ) Feeding wild G. brevipalpis , first on Animals infected with T. caprae , and then on Healthy Animals , to ascertain if this Species of Trypanosome passes through a Cycle of Development in this Species of Tsetse Fly .
Three experiments were carried out with wild flies .
One was negative and two positive .
On examining the positive experiments , they were found to be T. pecorum infections , and not T. caproc .
The animals were probably infected by naturally-infected G. brevipalpis .
No infection by T. took place , but one of the flies , on dissection , was shown to have an undoubted development of T. caprce in the labial cavity and hypopharynx .

2071 2199 9 45 + + + + + + + + In Experiment 2071 there is evidently a development of T. caprce in the fly found infected .
The intestine and salivary glands are free , whereas the hypopharynx is crammed with numerous short trypanosomes of the T. type .
In the labial cavity one large colony of large flagellates of a crithidial type was seen .
In Experiment 2199 the intestine and labial cavity of the infected fly were|found to have a heavy infection of trypanosomes .
As the intestine was also involved , this is probably a natural infection of the fly with T. The animal the flies were fed on was found to be suffering from a T. infection .
In the third experiment\#151 ; 2277-^none of the flies were dissected , but , as the animal the flies were fed on became infected , as in the last experiment , G. brevipalpis as a Carrier of Trypanosome .
with T. pecorum , and not with T. caprce , it is probable that no complete development of the latter had taken place .
Conclusion .
G. brevipalpis is capable of acting as a carrier of T. caprce .
General Conclusion .
G. brevipalpis is capable of acting as a carrier of T. brucei , Zululand , 1913 , T. pecorum , and T. caprce .
