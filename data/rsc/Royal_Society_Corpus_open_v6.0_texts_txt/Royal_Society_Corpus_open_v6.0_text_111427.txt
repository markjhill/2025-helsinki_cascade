Summary of a paper ( to be presented ) on the resemblance between the effects of the section of the Sympathetic Nerve in the Neck and of a transverse section of a lateral half of the Spinal Cord .
" By E. BROWN-SEiQUARD , M.D. Communicated by JAMES PAGET , Esq. , F.R.S. Received June 25 , 1857 .
I will merely indicate here the principal points of similitude between the effects of these two experiments .
Some of the results here mentioned as observed after the section of the sympathetic nerve in the neck , have been discovered by Prof. Bernard ; the others have been found by myself .
As to the effects of the section of a lateral half of the spinal-cord , I have discovered all of them .
Section of the cervical sympathetic nerve ; its effects on the corresponding side of the face .
1 .
Blood-vessels dilated ( paralysed ) .
2 .
As a consequence , more blood .
3 .
Elevation of temperature .
4 .
Sensibility slightly increased .
5 .
Ditto lasting longer there than on the other side , when the animal is chloroformized .
6 .
Sensibility lasting longer there than on the other side during agony .
7 .
Many muscles contracted .
Section of a lateral half of the spinal cord in the dorsal region ; its efects on the posterior limb , on the corresponding side .
1 .
The same effect .
2 .
Ditto , ditto .
3 .
Ditto , ditto .
4 .
Very much increased .
5 .
Lasting longer than anywhere else during chloroformization .
6 .
Lasting longer than anywhere else during agony .
7 .
A state of slight contraction in many muscles .
8 .
Absorption more rapid .
9 .
Increase of sweat and other secretions .
10 .
Reflex movements last longer there than elsewhere , after death .
11 .
After poisoning by strychnia , the first convulsions take place .
12 .
A galvanic current too weak to excite contraction elsewhere , may act there .
13 .
The motor nerves , after death , remain longer excitable there than on the other side .
14 .
The muscles , after death , remain longer contractile there than on the other side .
15 .
The contractility of blood-vessels is greater and lasts longer there .
16 .
The galvanic muscular current ( as ascertained with the rheoscopic frog ) is stronger and lasts longer there than on the other side .
17 .
Cadaveric rigidity appears later there than on the other side , and it lasts longer .
18 .
It is easier to regenerate there than on the other side the vital properties of nerves and muscles by injections of red blood , a short time after they have disappeared .
19 .
Putrefaction comes on later , and seems to progress more slowly there than on the other side .
8 .
The same effect .
9 .
Increase of sweat .
10 .
The same effect .
11 .
The same effect .
12 .
The same effect .
13 .
The motor nerves , after death , reremain notably longer excitable there .
14 .
The muscles , after death , remain much longer contractile there .
15 .
The same effect .
16 .
The same effect ( more marked ) .
17 .
Cadaveric rigidity appears notably later there than elsewhere and lasts longer .
18 .
The same effect ( more marked ) .
19 .
The same effect ( more marked ) .
All these effects , in the two cases , seem to be produced in the following manner:-There is a paralysis of the vascular nerves and therefore a paralysis of the blood-vessels ; in consequence of this paralysis , the blood arrives in larger quantity and therefore the temperature is higher ; nutrition is increased , and , in consequence , the vital properties of nerves , muscles and blood-vessels are augmented .
Other causes contribute to the increase of the vital properties of nerves and muscles in the posterior limb after section of a lateral half of the spinal cord ; among them I mfay point out the influence of the oxygen of the atmosphere on the spinal cord , the paralysis of the blood-vessels of this organ , and the state of rest of the muscles and motor nerves of the limb .
If we compare the side of the face where the sympathetic has not been divided , with the posterior limb on the uninjured side of the spinal cord , we find that they also have a great many points of resemblance .
They both receive less blood than usual , their temperature diminishes , their nutrition is less active , and their vital properties also diminish .
