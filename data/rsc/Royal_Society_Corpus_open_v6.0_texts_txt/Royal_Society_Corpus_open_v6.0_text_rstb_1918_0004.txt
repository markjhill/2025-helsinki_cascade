Introduction .
In the present paper some additions are made to our knowledge of the fossil floras of the South Staffordshire Coalfield .
The plant remains here described belong to two distinct horizons , the Red Clay Series , part of the Transition Coal Measures , and the Productive Group , or Middle Coal Measures .
In the past four years , during which my attention has been particularly engaged by this coalfield , I have received much help , both as regards geological information and the collection of fossil plants , from many residents in the district , and this aid I desire to acknowledge here .
I am particularly indebted to my friend , Mr. Henry Kay , F.G.S. , of Birmingham , who has not only placed his unique collections of fossil plants at my disposal , but has , in the kindest way , always been ready to help me by his remarkable knowledge of the geology of the district .
My obligations to Mr. L. Jackson , also of Birmingham , are hardly less complete .
Mr. Jackson has devoted much time over a long period to searching the northern part of the field for further examples of fossil plants for the purpose of this paper .
To both these gentlemen I return my grateful thanks .
By their aid , the specimens which I have been able to collect myself , during my visits to the district , have been very greatly extended .
Both Mr. Kay and Mr. Jackson have also very generously presented the best examples from their collections to the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge , including those figured in the present memoir , in order that we may have there a representative collection from this coalfield .

For the loan or presentation of other specimens or for a special search for fossils I also desire to thank , among others , Mr. W. H. Hardaker , M.Sc .
, Mr. W. H. Foxall , F.R.G.S. , both of Birmingham , and Mr. L. J. Read , of Wolverhampton .

The Flora of the Red-grey Unproductive\#174 ; of the Red Clay Series ( Old Hill Marls ) .
The u Red Coal Measure clays " of Jukes , # which now appear to be more widely known as the Old Hill Marls , or even as the Oldbury Marls , are a series of red rocks which immediately overlie the grey productives of the Middle Coal Measures , over a wide area in South Staffordshire .
These beds , which are about 300 feet thick , contain many bands of characteristic " Espley Rocks , " which only occur on this horizon in South Staffordshire .
Hitherto no plant remains , with the single exception of a curious thalloid growth described by Miss Wills t quite recently , have been known for certain from this lithological horizon in South Staffordshire .
The beds as a whole are undoubtedly very unfossiliferous .
As I announced , however , in a preliminary note| published in 1913 , Mr. Kay has unearthed a very fine suite of specimens from this horizon at Old Hill and elsewhere , while the same gentleman and also Mr. Hardaker have obtained further specimens from West Bromwich and Oldbury .
S M.any of these plants are extraordinarily well preserved .
Mr. Hardaker has also kindly given me examples of the plants occurring in an Espley rock proved in the sinking of the shafts of Hamstead Colliery .
It is true that the occurrence of the Red Clay series was not mentioned in the published record of these shafts , || nor is there any information as to the depth at which the specimens were obtained .
As , however , Espley rocks are entirely confined to this group in South Staffordshire , I here include a list of the species of plants represented .
The following are the localities of the fossils recorded here from this horizon .

The Flora of the Grey Productive Measures .
The fossil flora of the productive measures of this coalfield has , for some unaccountable reason , been much neglected until quite recently.* As late as 1913 , only some 28 plants had been recorded from this division .
In the following year , however , the publication of Dr. Kidston 's !
memoir , which was entirely confined to the Middle Coal Measure flora , did much to remedy this neglect .
Kidston recorded 141 species ( not including many other incomplete determinations ) from these beds .
Of these , however , 34 species were made known from one locality only , and 28 were represented by unique specimens .
The chief interest of this paper is the account which it contains of an extremely rare set of Middle Coal Measure fossils , all from one bed at Clay croft , Coseley , just above the Thick Coal .
The specimens from other localities are quite of secondary interest .
I may , perhaps , first of all add a few words with regard to the distribution of fossil plants in these measures .
With the exception of one or two long famous localities , from which literally enormous collections have been made from time to time , it is , speaking generally , difficult , in comparison with many other coalfields , to obtain good specimens from these beds at the present day .
There appear to be several causes which will account for this scarcity .
The coals , and especially the Thick Coal , have been worked out over a large area , and the visible field is reaching a stage of senile decay .
The thickness of the measures , especially in the southern portion of the field , is small .
The general vertical section of the field , given by J ukesJ , has recently been recapitulated by Dr. KidstonS , and thus need not be restated here .
It is true that a number of large collieries still exist , especially in the south of the field , near or over the eastern and western boundary faults , and in the Cannock Chase district , but these are far outnumbered by pits long since abandoned .
Again the methods of working the coals result in very little roof material or " dirt " being brought above ground as a rule .
Thus the " tip-heaps , " which form the great collecting grounds for fossil plants in most coalfields , and on which the palaeobotanist relies largely for his specimens , do not help him in South Staffordshire to the same extent as is usually the case .
It would appear also that the roofs of many of the seams worked in South Staffordshire are not , as a rule , rich in well-preserved fossil plants .
Further , the natural and artificial exposures of any size are , on the whole , few , as might be expected in a district so densely populated and overgrown with buildings as the Black Country .
In certain areas also the * The only literature on the plant impressions of this horizon is found in Kidston ( 18881 ) , ( 1894 ) , ( 1905 ) , Horwood ( 1912 ) , Arber ( 19141 ) , and notes on individual specimens by Kidston ( 18883 ) , Smith ( 1905 ) , Thomas ( 1912 ) , and Arber ( 1914s ) .

ground is much obscured by drift .
In fact , on the whole , some of the unproductive measures , already discussed , are better exposed than the Middle Coal Measures .
With the aid of several gentlemen resident in the district , who have kindly helped me in the task of collecting , I have devoted much time to an examination of nearly all the districts of the visible field for the purpose of obtaining plant remains .
The Cannock Chase area , which I understand had not been examined for this purpose hitherto , has not been overlooked .
The results of this work , however , for the reasons above mentioned , have proved to be exceptionally unprofitable palseo-botanically .
Plant Petrifactions.\#151 ; It has long been known that petrifactions , of more than one type , occur in the South Staffordshire field .
Certain ironstone nodules occasionally contain a very limited variety of plants , the more resistant tissues of which are frequently well preserved .
Such specimens were first described by the late Sir Joseph Hooker , * as long ago as 1848 .
According to Hooker the species in question were : Stigmaria Jicoides Sternb.* Lepidostrobus ornatus L. and H.f L. sp. J The record of the particular locality and ironstone from which these specimens were obtained has long been lost , and doubt has hitherto existed on this point .
In 1871 and the following year , Binney| also described a very well preserved Lycopod stem , from the neighbourhood of Dudley .
This was redescribed by SewardS as Lepidophloios fuliginosus ( Will .
) The sections of this plant are now in the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge .
|| Here again there is no precise record as to the ironstone or locality .
I have made some enquiry into these matters , with the following results .
The ironstones or ironstone nodules in question do not appear to differ in any important respect from those containing plant impressions , and , further , both types of preservation occur in much the same way .
The variety of plants preserved in the petrified state is very small .
Only three or four types are known\#151 ; Lepidophloios fuliginosus ( Will .
) .

See also ( 1910 ) , p. 141 , etc. || Slides 1-4 , Binney Coll. So far as I can ascertain , the majority of the ironstones do not contain such petrifactions , which are distinctly rare .
I am not aware , for instance , that any such have been found in the famous Ten-foot Ironstone of Claycroft , Coseley , though they occur in closely associated shales in that locality .
I have only observed them in the Poor Robin ironstone , between the Bottom and Fireclay coals of Pendlebury Colliery , at Bentley , but they are also occasionally met with in the Gubbin ironstone between the Heathen and Thick coals , and in the Whitestone below the Heathen coal .
Mr. Hughes possesses part of one of the original specimens figured by Hooker , * and he tells me that this was derived from the Gubbin ironstone at Russell 's Hall Colliery , Dudley .
Other Lepidostrobi in the same collection , similar to certain specimens also described by Hooker , !
were derived from the Whitestone in the same locality .
The Gubbin ironstone of Claycroft has also yielded specimens .
The explanation of the lack of variety among these petrifactions is no doubt to be sought for in the fact that the shale beds , which now contain the ironstones , were laid down in a region bordered by forests , which consisted of an almost pure association of Lycopods , as also appears to have been the case at Pouk Hill , near Walsall .
I have , unfortunately , not discovered any examples of the other type of petrifaction which is only known , as far as South Staffordshire is concerned , in the case of Cordaites Brandlingi ( With.)J This no doubt was a petrifaction of the isolated log type , and was derived from Rowley Regis ; but the exact locality and horizon are unfortunately not recorded .
Impressions in Clay-ironstone Nodules.\#151 ; Speaking generally , plant remains are not well distributed in the ironstones of South Staffordshire .
A few examples are known from the Gubbin ironstones , between the Heathen and Thick coals , and from some others ; but , with the exception of the Coseley ironstones , they appear to be decidedly rare .
The fact that very few ironstones are to-day worked in this coalfield may , however , account in part for this seeming poverty .
On the other hand , the Ten-foot Ironstones , above the Thick Coal at Claycroft , near Coseley , have furnished one of the most remarkable plant assemblages known from the Coal Measures .
These specimens occur there in extraordinary abundance , and during the many years when these beds were mined as an open work , the supply of nodules was unlimited .
They can still be collected to-day , though with increasing difficulty , since the workings have long since been abandoned .
Abundant examples from this locality are to be seen in every collection in South Staffordshire , and in most museums in England .
Collections numbering many thousands of specimens have been formed by numerous collectors during the last half-century , some of which still remain in private hands .
That of my friend , Mr. H. W. Hughes , F.G.S. , of Dudley , is the most valuable of * Hooker ( 3 8482 ) , Plate 9 , fig. 2 , Plate 10 , fig. 7 .

these .
Others , such as the Lewis collection in the Sedgwick Museum , Cambridge , and the Henry Johnson , Sen. , collection in the British Museum ( Not .
Hist. ) , are among the largest ever made in this district .
They were formed at a time when the abundance and beauty of the fossils of the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley and the plant nodules of Claycroft made the western margin of the South Staffordshire field a particularly noteworthy collecting ground .
A great feature of the Claycroft flora is that , in addition to an abundance of good specimens of the commoner plants , there is also a considerable variety of species which are extremely rare or unknown elsewhere .
This remarkable assemblage forms the chief theme of Dr. Kidston's* recent paper , which is quite an exhaustive account of the flora of these beds .
Impressions in Other Sediments.\#151 ; Impressions occur in the shales and other sediments throughout the measures , though they are often ill-preserved , and never so abundant as in many other coalfields .
Lycopod remains are the most frequent .
Among the artificial exposures of the measures , which are but few , the three pits\#151 ; at Salt wells and Netherton\#151 ; belonging to Messrs. Doulton and Co. , and the famous quarry at Pouk Hill , near Walsall , are the most noteworthy .
Further specimens collected from these localities are described here .
The Pouk Hill quarries , which furnish large exposures of a brittle , thinly-laminated black shale , overlying the well-known dolerites , and intermediate -between the Bottom and Fireclay coals , contain an abundant and remarkable flora , almost entirely composed of Lycopod remains .
It would seem that , in Coal Measure times , this region was surrounded by a forest country , the vegetation consisting of an exceptionally pure association of Lycopods , especially Lepidodendron obovatum Sternb .
, and L. lycopodioides Sternb .
, of which the rhizophores , stems , leaves , $nd cones abound , with an occasional Calamite , and a still rarer Sigillarian stem .
Elsewhere plant remains are usually only to be obtained from the very limited amount of unweathered material on the small waste-heaps of the collieries .
These , however , especially in the Cannock Chase district , are often very barren , and where several seams are worked together at a single pit , it is manifestly impossible to ascertain the exact horizon of any of the specimens collected .

THE COAL MEASURES OP SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE .
The Horizon.\#151 ; There is no doubt that , as Dr. Kidston has already shown , the whole of the productive measures of South Staffordshire belong to the Middle Coal Measures .
The following flora from below the Bottom Coal , at Doulton 's Old Pit , Netherton , need only be instanced as a proof of this conclusion :\#151 ; Catamites approximatus Brongn .

Kemarks on the Figured Specimens .
Catamites Cannoctcensis sp. nov .
Plate 4 , fig. 18 .
Diagnosis.\#151 ; Pith-cast of medium width .
Internodes of unequal length , ribs numerous , narrow , not very prominent ; branch-scars on every node , two or more on each node , small .
Description of the Specimen.\#151 ; The only known example of this pith-cast , collected in Cannock Chase , is shown on Plate 4 , fig. 18 .
When found the specimen was somewhat more perfect .
In order to secure it , however , it had to be detached from a large block of shale in small pieces , owing to the irregular splitting of the rock in which it occurred .
These fragments were afterwards mounted on a bed of plaster-of-Paris by Mr. L. Jackson , who by this method has preserved many good examples of the flora of this coalfield , which would otherwise have perished .
The specimen shows four nodes , separated by internodes , which in the original condition measured as follows:\#151 ; Lowest internode 2'25 cm .
, second internode 3*5 cm .
, third internode 5 cm .
, fourth internode 3 cm .
, highest internode 2*5 cm .
The ridges are narrow and flatr the grooves narrow and shallow .
The infranodal canals are not well seen .
They appear to be very small and narrowly oval in shape .
The scars which occur on every node , and which are probably branch-scars , are small , about 3 mm. in diameter .
Two are seen on most of the nodes , and perhaps the same number would be found to occur on the other side of the flattened cast .
Thus probably four or more occur above each node .
On the highest node two scars are clearly seen .
On the next node below , two scars may have occurred , though only one is now visible , perhaps owing to the fracture of the specimen .
Two scars again occur on the node below , but on the lowest node only one is seen .
This , however , is probably due to the obvious imperfection of the specimen in this region .
Remarks on the Specimen.\#151 ; This type of pith-cast is quite unknown to me , and obviously differs from the British Eucalamitean species , Calamites ramosus ( Art .
) ' and C. cruciatus ( Sternb .
) , in the number of the branch scars in the whorl , their size , and the characters of the internodes .
With Calamophloios Britannicus ( Weiss .
) there is no comparison , since the present species is a pith-cast , and Britannicus is the external surface of a stem .
It is conceivable , however , that might be the pith-cast of C. Britannicus , though this is by no means certainly the case .
It is at present impossible to prove or disprove this possibility .
There are but few foreign examples known to me with which any comparison can be made , and these are all from rocks of much younger age .
There is some similarity to the Calamites distichusof Benatjlt , from the Commentry Coalfield.* The length of the internodes and the shape of the infranodal canals are , however , different in the Stephanian specimen .
The Staffordshire specimen also appears to be quite distinct from the Calamites ( cruciatus ) quinquenarius , var .
Dohlensis of Sterzel , !
from the Lower Permian of Saxony .
In view of these facts , and especially the great difference in the age of the Continental specimens , I prefer to regard the present plant as a new species , C. Cannockensis .

Diagnosis.\#151 ; External surfaces of the stems and branches of Calamites .
Nodes with or without branch-scars , internodes smooth or longitudinally striated .
Remarks.\#151 ; Hitherto it has been customary to refer to the genus Calamites both pith-casts and casts or impressions of the external surfaces of stems and branches .
These fossils are naturally of an entirely different nature , and most of the features which they present are of dissimilar origin .
This convention , however , has not hitherto proved inconvenient , for the reason that specimens showing the external surface of the stem have been but rarely discovered , and quite 90 per cent , of all Calamite stems hitherto recorded have been obviously pith-casts .
In the most recent monograph of the Calamites by Dr. Jongmans , J for instance , no attempt is made to discriminate between these two entirely dissimilar types of cast .
Specimens showing the external surface are now , however , becoming less rare , and the time seems to have arrived when it will be wise to distinguish such fossils from the pith-casts , until it is possible to correlate the two types of evidence .

THE COAL MEASURES OF SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE .
In proposing the new term Calamophloios , as a general designation for specimens showing the external surfaces of the stems of all Calamites , I am aware that a very similar term , Calamodendrofloyos , was instituted many years ago by Grand ' Eury , # and was also adopted later by Renault , f This term was also used in much the same sense , but as applying more particularly to the external surface of Calamites cruciatus Sternb .
If objection be raised to the present term on these grounds ( which is perhaps possible under certain rules of nomenclature to which I do not adhere ) , the present name may be regarded as an emendation of Grand ' Eury 's genus .
It is very unlikely that the term Calamodendron itself wdl survive , as applied to impressions , or in any other sense than to denote a particular type of anatomical structure presented by certain of the later Calamites .
I do not , therefore , think that any confusion is likely to arise between the new and the old term , which was a distinctly cumbersome name , of less general application than that proposed here .
If the older name ' is retained , it should be as a subgenus of Calamophloios .

Description of the Specimen.\#151 ; The specimen figured on Plate 3 , fig. 9 , natural size , consists below of part of a long internode , while a node is seen above .
The surface of the internode has a peculiar granulated appearance , due to the presence of a large number of very small shallow pittings .
The surface is also very finely striated longitudinally .
Remarks on the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; This specimen is clearly an impression of the external surface of a Calamite stem or branch .
The pith-cast is not seen , however , as it is in some of the examples recently figured by Jongmans and Kukuk ( see above ) , which seem to me to furnish adequate proof of the correlation of this type of stem-cast with the pith-casts known as Calamites ramosus .
The name proposed here may prove convenient in such cases as the present , in which the external surface is alone seen .
The features presented by the bark of this specimen were , however , common to other species of Calamites , e.g. C. paleaceus Stur , J which is very similar as regards the stem-cast , but distinct as regards the foliage and fructification .

Remarks on the Specimens.\#151 ; This Renaultia appears to me to agree more closely with Stur 's species S. ( R. ) Schwerini than with any member of the same genus hitherto recorded from this country .
I am not convinced , however , that the specimens more recently attributed to this species by Gotham* are identical with the fronds figured by Stur and by Zeiller .
The present examples constitute the first British record of this species , so far as I am aware .

, and S. lenis Zeill .
, with which , however , I am not convinced that it is identical .
I therefore prefer for the present to regard it as a distinct species .

Remarks on the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; The portion of a frond shown on Plate 4 , fig. 22 , natural size , is admittedly very imperfect , in that the distal extremities of most of the lobes of the pinnules are wanting .
I think , however , that the size of the pinnules , the broad wedge-shape form of their lobes , and the sub-parallel course of the branched nerves in each , are sufficient to support the identification .

Remarks on the Specimen.\#151 ; Several detached pinnules are seen on Plate 2 , fig. 8 , enlarged between two and three times to show the nervation more clearly .
These seem to me to be identical with the specimens which I have recently described from a lower horizon in the Wyre Forest ; the very fine , slender , much branched and slightly arched nervation being the chief characteristic of this species as I interpret it .
The pinnules are always lanceolate , and often somewhat falcate .

Description of the Figured Specimens.\#151 ; Part of a pinna 7 cm .
in length is seen , natural size , on Plate 2 , fig. 7 .
The pinnules on the right-hand side are broadly elliptical , in one case exceeding 11 mm. in breadth .
On the left-hand side the pinnules are much narrower and longer .
The midribs are very stout in all cases .
Part of another pinna , in which all the pinnules are of the narrow lanceolate type , is seen on Plate 2 , fig. 4 , natural size , and on fig. 2 of the same plate , a portion of a pinnule is shown enlarged between three and four times to exhibit the lateral nervation .
The essential characters of this plant lie in the relatively large size of the pinnules , their variable shape even in the same pinna , the very strong median nerve , and the very close , oblique lateral nervation , the nerves of which are scarcely arched , and only once or twice forked .
The shape of the pinnules varies from elliptical , broadest midway between the base and apex , to elongately lanceolate , broadest at or close to the base .
Remarks on the Figured Specimens.\#151 ; The fronds with lanceolate pinnules figured here appear to me to agree closely with the Silesian Neuropteris , described by Potoni^ , and figured by Gothan as Kosmanni .
This is a Neuropteris which I have not previously seen , and , if I am correct in the determination , a species new to Britain .
It somewhat resembles the Neuropteris rectinervis of Kidston , !
but the pinnules are larger and the lateral nerves less frequently dichotomised .

Remarks on the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; Since the occurrence of this frond on this horizon is of some importance , I have figured a specimen , natural size , on Plate 3 , fig. 10 , and part of the same example is shown , four times enlarged , on fig. 11 of the same plate , to exhibit the lateral nervation .
The widely separated branches of the " tuning fork " lateral nervation leave , I think , no doubt as to the specific determination .

tortuosa of Lindley and Hutton , t As is usually the case , the leaf-bases are much decorticated , but Mr. Jackson has found a specimen , part of which is figured in Plate 4 , fig. 25 , twice enlarged , in which the leaf-scars are well preserved , and are clearly of the Lepidophloios laricinus type , like that first figured by Carruthers ( see above ) .
The question arises whether these slender Halonial branches , with small tubercles , are identical with the stouter axes with much larger tubercles , of which the Halonia tubercidata of BrongniartJ and the Halonia regu\aris of Lindley and HuttonS are the earliest described specimens .
The latter appear to be the commoner type , and further specimens have been figured by Binney , Williamson , Benier and others .
It may , of course , be a matter of age or of mere size , but for the present , however , I am inclined to regard this correlation as still an open question .

THE COAL MEASURES OF SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE .
3-4 cm .
in length , overlapping one another .
The median nerve is only faintly indicated in one or two cases .
The sporophylls have , in addition , a number of slender striae or ?
nerves , radiating from the base towards the margin , and some of these arch towards the margin at the broadest part of the sporophyll , and do not extend to the apex .
These ?
striae are not , however , very clearly marked in the present specimen , and I have not been able to satisfy myself that they branch .
Remarks on the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; The sporophylls of this cone are well known in the detached state under the name Lepi intermedium ( L. and H. ) .
I have also seen , from other coalfields , several specimens of similar cones , some of which I hope to describe on a future occasion .
The present example is , I believe , the first to be figured showing the sporophylls still attached .

Figured Specimen in Mr. L. J. Beade 's collection , Wolverhampton .
Lepidostrobus Jacksonisp .
nov .
Plate 4 , fig. 19 .
Diagnosis.\#151 ; Cone of medium size , stalked , more or less club-shaped .
Lower portion of sporophylls , broad , scale-like , distal extremities prolonged as very narrow , elongated appendages , 4 mm. or more in length .
Description of the Specimen.\#151 ; The single known example has a length of 6T cm .
It is broadest near the apex , where it measures 2 cm .
across .
It contracts very suddenly at the base .
A small portion of the stalk , 7 mm. long , is shown below on Plate 4 , fig. 19 .
The sporophylls are clearly seen , their proximal portions being broad , while above they suddenly contract into long awii-like , distal prolongations , which are , however , not very distinctly shown in the photograph .
Remarks on the Specimen.\#151 ; This cone , both in its shape and in the form of the sporophylls , obviously differs from the common variabilis L. and H. type .
Further , the sporophylls do not agree with any of the British varieties of detached sporophylls , known as Lepidophyllum , such as L. lanceolatum L. and H. In shape the sporophylls somewhat recall those of certain species of Sigillariostrobus , notably , S. nobilis Zeill .
, and S. ciliatus Kidst .
, especially in the broad scale-like lower portion , suddenly contracted above into a very narrow , elongated terminal portion .
There is , of course , no close comparison with the members of this genus , for the cones are obviously quite distinct .
The small fragment of the stalk of this cone shows a number of leaf-bases , which unfortunately are not clearly preserved .
They , however , suggest that this may be the cone of Lepidodendron obovatum Sternb .
, which is so abundant in the same locality .
The evidence is , however , not sufficient to justify a confident attribution to that stem species .
In this connection a Belgian specimen , figured some years ago by Renier , * and attributed by him to Lepidodendron obovatuSternb .
, is of interest .
This cone approximates more closely to the present specimen than any other of which published figures are known to me , with the exception perhaps of an unnamed and imperfect cone figured by Brongniart .
f It does not , however , agree precisely in shape , and the features of the sporophylls cannot be made out clearly from Renier 's figure .
While admitting that the Belgian specimen may eventually prove to be identical with the British , and , further , that the attribution to Lepidodendron obovatum may later be more firmly established , it has seemed to me to be the best policy for the present to refer the English plant to a new species .
I have much pleasure in naming it after Mr. L. Jackson , of Birmingham , who collected this as well as many other examples of the South Staffordshire flora .

Remarks on the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; This is a rare species in Britain , not at present to be distinguished with as much clearness as might be desired from S. rugosa , and perhaps other species .
The present specimen ( Plate 4 , fig. 17 ) differs from Brongniart 's figure ( see above ) in the upper margin of the leaf-scar being markedly emarginate , and in the fact that the lateral grooves , arising from the lateral angles of the leaf-scar , disappear a short distance below the scar , and are not continued downwards as far as the scar below , as is the case apparently in Bkongniart 's specimen .
Neglecting Goldenberg 's figure , we have next that of Zeiller ( see above ) , in which the same differences are observable .
I am , nevertheless , inclined to regard the present specimen as a variety of S. Deutschi Brongn .
, and I base this conclusion chiefly on the small size and shape of the leaf-scars , which are very widely separated .

Description of the Figured Specimens.\#151 ; Part of a cone , the axis of which exceeds 8 cm .
in length , is shown , natural size , on Plate 3 , fig. 12 .
Most of the sporophylls have fallen off , and thus the axis is laid bare .
Several sporophylls are , however , seen still attached on the left-hand side .
Another specimen ( Plate 3 , fig 16 , also natural size ) shows the axis above , and the bases of the broken sporophylls below .
' Remarks on the Figured Specimens .
\#151 ; This cone is much more slender than the type specimen , or any other examples known to me .
Yet the shape of the sporophylls , which are well seen at the top of Plate 3 , fig. 12 , appears to me to agree very closely with those of the French and British species of and I therefore regard these specimens as a slender variety of that cone .
So far as I am aware , the present is the first record of this genus from the British Transition Coal Measures .

'Description of the Figured Specimen.\#151 ; The portion of a specimen figured on Plate 3 , fig. 14 , natural size , shows an area of bark with a conspicuous ornamentation of sinuous vertical ridges , among which occur a number of small oval scars , usually very indistinctly seen .
One of these is shown on the enlarged portion of the same specimen figured on Plate 3 , fig. 15 .
Remarks on the Figured Specimens.\#151 ; This fossil appears to be a very rare type .
I have not previously seen specimens of it , but the two examples collected in South Staffordshire appear to me , so far as I can judge , to be identical with the Stigmariopsis anglica of Kidston .
The present specimens are from a higher horizon than that from which the type was recorded .

Remarks on the Specimen.\#151 ; This seed differs from Cardiocarpus Gutbieri Gain .# in its larger size , and in its greater breadth in proportion to its length .
So far as I am aware it has not been previously described from Britain .
Among the innumerable seeds from the Continent and America , which have figured in one or other of the many memoirs dealing with Coal Measure plants , I have not been able to find any which agree at all exactly with the specimen here figured .
Some of the seeds , referred by Grand ' Eury !
to the genus Cordaicarpus , from the Stephanian of France , are similar in type , especially C. major and the much larger C. , but neither of these appear to me to be identical with the South Staffordshire specimens .

Summary .
A flora of 58 records is described from a new plant horizon in South Staffordshire , the Bed Clay Series or Old Hill Marls , of Transition Coal Measure age .
A new genus Calamophloios and new species of Sphenopteris and Cardiocarpus are included , as well as several species new to this horizon .
Ten new records are added to the known flora of the Productive Series ( Middle Coal Measures ) , including new species of Calamites and Lepidostrobus .
A large number of additional records from new localities , or horizons , are added in respect to fossil plants already known from these beds .
