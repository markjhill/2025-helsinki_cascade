" By WILLIAM SPOTTISwooDE , M.A. , F.R.S. Received March 21 , 1863 , ( Abstract .
) In treating the equations of rotation of a solid body about a fixed point , it is usual to employ the principal axes of the body as the moving system of coordinates .
Cases , however , occur in which it is advisable to employ other systems ; and the object of the present paper is to develope the fundamental formule of transformation and integration for any system .
The integrals found areP-=:a l_ O cos am ( , / ( S+ ) ^O co .
sin am ( 7k'-(S+O)h t+f ) ; = / S2)H0 am ( , --/ C1 k_-(s + )h t +f ) where 0 , 01 , 02 are the roots of the cubic ( S +0)3S(S+0)2+S(S+0)-v=0 , V being the determinant of the system A , B , C , -F , --G , -H , S the sum of A , B , C , and S that of the corresponding inverse quantities .
Moreover P1 , q1 , r1 are linear functions of p , q , r ( the components of rotation about the axes for which A , B , C , &amp;c. are calculated ) , the coefficients of which are determined in the paper itself .
