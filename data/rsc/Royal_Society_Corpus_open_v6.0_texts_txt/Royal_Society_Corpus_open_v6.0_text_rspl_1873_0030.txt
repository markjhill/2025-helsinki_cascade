" Note on Displacement of the Solar Spectrum .
" By J. H. N. Hennessey , F.R.A.S. Communicated by Professor Gr .
G. Stokes , Sec. R.S. Received December 15 , 1873 .
The following experiments were made with the ( new ) spectroscope ( three prisms ) of the Royal Society to ascertain for this instrument the amount of displacement in the solar spectrum from change of temperature .
The spectroscope was set up on a pillar within a small tent at a time of the year when the thermal range is considerable : the collimator was placed horizontal , and directed through a window in the tent to a heliostat , which was made to reflect the sun 's image when required .
On closing the window darkness prevailed in the tent , so that the bright sodium lines were easily obtained from a spirit-lamp .
Before commencing , the slit was adjusted and the spectroscope clamped ; and no movement of any kind was permitted in the instrument during the experiments .
The displacement was measured by means of a micrometer in the eye-end of the telescope , reading being taken ( out of curiosity ) successively to both dark and bright lines , i. e. to K 1002*8=Dr and K 1006*8=DW .
A verified thermometer was suspended directly over and almost touching the prisms .
The meteorological observatory referred to was some fifty yards north of the tent .
Rejecting observation 5 ( in the following Table ) because the thermometer was evidently in advance of the prisms , we deduce O By Dark lines , displacement equal D rto Dv is produced by ... .
