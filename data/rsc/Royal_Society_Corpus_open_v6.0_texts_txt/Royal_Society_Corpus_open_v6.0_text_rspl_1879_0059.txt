( Abstract .
) The isomeric monochlorides , obtained from the normal paraffins existing in petroleum , yield by the abstraction of hydrochloric acid a mixture of olefines , one portion of which readily combines with hydrochloric acid in the cold , whilst the other unites with it only on heating.* The chlorides formed in the cold boil with partial decomposition and at a lower temperature than the others , which distil without undergoing any change , and have the general formula CH3\#151 ; CHC1\#151 ; C\#171 ; H*\#187 ; +1.t They are therefore derived from the olefines of the series CHcjZiCH\#151 ; C"H2*+1 .
Similar results have been obtained by Le Bel .
J The constitution of the olefines combining with the acid in the cold is not yet known .
They are possibly not derived from normal paraffins , but from isomerides , which cannot be separated from the former by distillation .
On the other hand their formation can also be explained without making this assumption .
This question can only be decided by using an absolutely pure paraffin .
S For this purpose , normal hexane from mannite was selected , which possibly might yield three isomeric monochlorides : ( i. ) ch3\#151 ; ch3\#151 ; ch3\#151 ; ch3\#151 ; ch3\#151 ; CH3C1 ( 2 .
) CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CHC1\#151 ; CH3 ( 3 .
) CH3\#151 ; CH3-~CH3\#151 ; CHC1\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3 The formation of the first two has already been proved .
|| The following seemed capable of determining whether the third is also produced .
By the abstraction of hydrochloric acid three hexylenes might be formed :\#151 ; Butylethylene . . . .
CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CHzzCH3 Methylpropylethylene . .
CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH~CH\#151 ; CH3 Diethylethylene . . . .
Cil3\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CHzzCH\#151 ; CH3\#151 ; CH3 The first of these does not combine with cold hydrochloric acid ; the second is the hexylene obtained from secondary hexyl iodide .

] Mr. F. Galton on th Geometric .
365 Le Bel and Wassermann have found that cold hydrochloric acid has no action on it , from which it follows that , if normal hexane from mannite yields a hexylene combining with hydrochloric acid in the -cold , it could he only diethylhexylene , which could be easily identified by conversion into ethylpropyl carbinol and oxidising it , when only propionic acid should be formed .
This was my programme ; the results were , however , quite unexpected .
The hexylene obtained by decomposing the hexyl chlorides was left in contact with cold fuming hydrochloric acid for some weeks .
The whole of it combined and the hexyl chloride thus formed boiled constantly and without the least decomposition at 124\#151 ; 125 ' .
It was converted into the alcohol , which on oxidation yielded only acetic acid and butyric acid , and consequently is methylbutyl carbinol .
We have , therefore , the remarkable fact , that two hexanes exist , which must be regarded as normal compounds , and therefore according to our present theory , to be identical .
This is , however , not the case .
I have already in my first paper pointed out some other differences existing between the two hexanes , but left the question open , whether these are caused by impurities contained in the hexane from petroleum , or whether we have here a case of fine isomerism , for which an explanation has to be found.* I believe the results of my present research speak strongly in favour of the latter view .
For several reasons I am inclined to believe that petroleum consists chiefly of an inextricable mixture of isomeric and homologous paraffins , in which , however , the normal hydrocarbons preponderate .
This would certainly explain why it is so difficult to isolate from it bodies having a constant boiling point , f but not the differences exhibited by the two hexanes .
A continuation of these researches has already been commenced .
My friend Thorpe , who has made the most interesting discovery that the terebinthinate exudation of Pimis Sabiniana contains a large quantity of normal heptane , J has kindly offered me to join him in the chemical investigation of this hydrocarbon .
At the same time we shall compare it with other " normal " heptanes from different sources .
