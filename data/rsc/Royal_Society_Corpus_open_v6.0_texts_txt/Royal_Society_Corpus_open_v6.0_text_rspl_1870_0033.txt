" Measurement of the Internal Resistance of a Multiple Battery by adjusting the Galvanometer to Zero .

The following method of taking the internal resistance of a battery will be found to give excellent results when several cells are to be tested .
Take one element from the rest of the cells and arrange the circuit as in the annexed figure .
Connect the poles of the battery under observation by a shunt S , and adjust the resistance of the latter till zero is obtained on the galvanometer .
Let E be the number of cells tested , e number of cells opposed , S = resistance of shunt , R= internal resistance of E. Then R=S\#174 ; -S .
e In practice I usually returned the detached cell to the battery when S X E gave the internal resistance of the whole within a fraction of a unit .
It is assumed that the electromotive force in e equals that of the whole c battery multiplied by -j ?
; the chance of error on account of this not being exactly the case would be lessened by detaching a larger number of cells than one when the internal resistance of the remaining portion would be given by the first formula .
