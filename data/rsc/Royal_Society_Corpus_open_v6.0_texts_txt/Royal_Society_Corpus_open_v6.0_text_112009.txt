It is sufficient to consider the case in which f is an indefinite form of a determinant different from zero .
We may also suppose that f is primnitive , i. e. that the six numbers a , a ' , a " , 6 , 6 ' , 6 " do not admit of any common divisor .
We represent by aI the greatest common divisor of the minors of the matrix off , by AUQ the determinant off , and by &amp; F the contravariant off , i. e. the form &amp; 2 will then be the determinant of F , and Af its contravariant .
By &amp; 2 , A , and UA we denote the quotients obtained by dividing S2 , A , and S2 A by the greatest squLares contained in them respectively ; co is any uneven prime dividing 2 , but not A ; a is any unleven prime dividing A , but not Q , ; and 0 is any uneven prime dividing both a2 and A , and consequently not dividing &amp; 2A .
We may then enunciate the theorem " The equationf 0 will or will not be resoluble in integral numbers different from zero according as the equations included in the formule ( a ) ( a ) ( v ) ( fifi ) ( 0 )/ ( lt ( are or are not satisfied .
" The symbols ( nd , ( ) , and ( IA ) are the quadratic symbols of Legendre ; the symbols ( X ) ) ( f ) , ( L ) ( / )are generic characters off ( see the Memoir of Eisenstein , " Never Theoreme der hoheren Arithmetik , " in his 'Mathematisehe Abhandlungen , ' p. 185 , or in Crelle 's Journal , vol. xxxv .
p. 125 ) .
The theorem includes those of Legendre and Gauss on the resolubility Proc.yASoc .

It is equally applicable whether the coefficients and indeterminates off are real integers , or complex irntegers of the type p+ qi .
It will be observed that iff , f ' , f'i ... are forms contained in the same gelnus , the equationsf0 , f -0 , f"= 0 , &amp;c. are either all resoluble or all irresoluLble .
