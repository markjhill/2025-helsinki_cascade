( Abstract ) .
Continuing my researches in the calculus of symbols , I have been led to investigate the most general case of division , viz. that wherein a function of any degree n in r is divided , ( 1 ) internally , ( 2 ) externally , by another function of any other degree m in ~r .
The investigations here subjoined give ( 1 ) the various terms of the quotient , together with their laws of derivation both by actual division and otherwise ; ( 2 ) the final remainder , and thence the conditions that the divisor may be a factor , internal or external as the case may be , of the dividend .
An example has been added in each case by way of illustrating the processes .
A remarkable reciprocal relation subsisting between the functions ( D ) , of the coefficients ( 6 ) of the dividend , and the corresponding functions ( AP ) of the coefficients ( 4 ) of the divisor is exhibited , at the end of the paper .
I have confined myself throughout to that branch of the calculus wherein the functions treated of are arranged according to powers of r ; that wherein they are arranged according to powers of p has been already more fully discussed by Mr. Russell .
