THE TrIigonometrical Survev of the United Kingdomn commtnenced in the year 1784 , under the immtnediate auspices of the Royal Society ; the first base was traced by General Roy , of the Royal Engineers , on the 16th of April of that year , on -Iounslow Heath , in presence of Sir JOSEPH BANKS , the then President of the Society , and some of its most distinguished Fellows .
The principal object which the Government had then in view , was the connexion of the Observatories of Parlis and Greenwich by means of a triangulation , for the purpose of determining the difference of longitude between the two observatories .
A detailed account of the operations then carried on is given in the first volume of the 'Trigonomletrical Survey , ' which is a revised account of that which was first published in the 'Philosophical Tr1ansactions ' for 1785 and three following years .
At the time when these operations were in progress , the Survey of several counties in the south-east of England , including Kent , Sussex , Surrey , and Hampshire , was also in progress , under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance , for the purpose of naking military maps of the most important parts of the kingdom in a military point of view ; and it was then decided to make the triangulation which extended from Hounslow to Dover the basis of a triangulation for these surveys .
It is extremely to be regretted that a more enlarged view of the subject had not then been taken , and a proper geometrlical projection made for the miap of the whole kingdom .
As it is , the south-eastern counties were first drawn and published in reference to the meridian of Greenwich , the Devonshire in reference to the meridian of Blutterton in that county , and thirdly the northern counties in reference to the meridian of Delamere in Cheshire ; but there is a large intermediate space , the maps of which are made of various sizes to accotnrmmodate them to the convergence of the meridian .
In 1799 the Royal Society gave furttler proof of the interest it took in the progless of the Survey , by lending to the Ordnance its great 3-foot Theodolite , made by RAMSDEN , for the purI pose of expediting the work of the Survey ; and I have great pleasure in stating , that alttough this instrumrient has been in altlmost constant use for the last sixty-seven years , during which time it has been placed on the highest chlrch towers and the loftiest mountains in the kingdom , form the Shetlands to the Scilly Islands , it is at this day in perfect working order , and probably one of the very best instruments that was ever made .
The great Trigonometrical operations of the Survey have been catrried on under so many officers , from te the eof their collmencement under General Roy down to the present time , that it wonld be quite impossible , in this short notice , to mention nor than the namnes of several Superintendents who have succeeded Genelal Roy , viz. Colonel WILLTAMS , Major-General MUDGE , Major-General COLBY , and Colonel HALL ; but in justice to the highly meritorious body of non-commissioned officers of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners , I should state , that wthilst in the early part of the Survey the most irportant and delicate obselvations were entrusted solely to the commissioned officers , these duties have of late years been performed by the noncommissioned officers with the greatest skill and accuracy .
In the Historical sketch of the Survey which I purpose publishing shortly , I hope to be able to do justice to the individual merits of all employed .
The computations connected with the corrections of the observed angles , to make the whole triangulation as nearly as possible perfectly consistent , have been most volurninonu , and have been iade under the direction of Lieut.-Colonel YOLLAND , Captain CAMERON , and Captain ALEXANDER R. CLARKE ; but I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to acknowledge the great and important assistance and advice which , both as regards the instrunents and the calculations , we have at all times received afom the Astionorner Royal .
TIThe triangulation by the methods which will be explained , is now made consistent in every part , so that any side of any triangle being taken as a base , the same distance will be reproduced when it is computed throughl any portion or the whole series of triangles ; and when the five measured bases on which ) we rely are incorporated in this triangulation , the greatest difference between their measured and conputed lengths is not as muilch as 3 inchies , and yet some of the bases are upwards of 400 milles apart .
Several bases of from five to seven miles long hliave been measured , bu.t those upon which the chief reliance has been placed are the Lough Foil and Salisbury Plain bases , which were measured with General COLBY'S comnpensation bars .
The difference between the measured and computited length of the one base fromin the other through the triangulation is 0'4178 ft. , or about 5 inches .
This difference has been divided in proportionr to the square root of the lengths of the measured bases , by which ) we have obtained the mnean base which has been used in the triangulation ; there is therefore a difference of + or -02 ft. , or 2A inches between the measured and computed length of these bases from the mean base .
The Hounslow Heath base was measured with RAMSDEN'S 100-ft .
steel chains , and only differs 0 173 ft. , or about 2 inches , from its computed length from the mean base .
T'he Belhelvie base in Aberdeenshire , also measured with the steel chains , differs only 0 24 ft. , or less than 3 inches , from the computed length .
The difference between the measured and computed length of the Misterton Carr base , neat ' Doncaster , also measured with the steel chains , is only 0'191 ft. , or about 2 inches ; and it will be observed that the difference between the comnpute(d an(I measured lengths of these three bases ( neasured with chains ) is not greater than the difference between the measured and conputed length of the Lough Foil and Salisbury Plain bases ( easured with the compensation bars ) , from which it may be inferred that bases measured with steel chains are deserving of the greatest confidence ; and when the great sinmplicity , portability , and cheapness of the chains is compared with the cormplex , heavy and expensive apparatus of the compensation barls , I should anticipate that they wouldc be more generally employ ( d than they have been of late years , especially in the colonies , and in countries where the transport of heavy articles is effected with difficulty .
The length of the base on Rhuddcllan Marsh in North Wales , which wa(s mteasured with steel chains , differs 1*596 ft. from the computed length ; but from the circumstance that the extremities of the base are very batly situated with reference to the surrouinding Trrigonotinetrical stations , the angles being very acute , and not well observed , we have placed little confidence in the result of the comparison of its computed and measured length .
One of the first practical results arising from the coinpletion of the triangulation is , that we are now able to engave the latitde and longitude on the marginal lines of the old sheets of the 1-inch map of England , and this is now being done .
The following account of the Trigonometrical operations and calculations has been drawn up by Captain ALEXANDER R. CLARKE , R.E. : this account may be consideled as an abridgement of that more detailed account which is now in the press , and will be shortly published .
It will be seen that the equatorial diameter of the earth , as derived ftomn the Ordnance Survey , is 7926*610 miles , or about one mile greater than it is given by the Astronomer Royal in his ' Figure of the Earth , ' and that the ellipticity is ' 9-3 , or as the Astronomer Royal conjectured , something " greater than -30 , " which he gives in the same paper .
The mean specific gravity of the earth , as derivetl from the observations at Arthur 's Seat , was statedi in a former paper to be 5a14 ; the calculations have since been revised , and we now find it to be 5*316 .
The mean specific gravity of the earth , as derived from the only other observations on the attraction of mountain masses on which any reliance has been placed , viz. the Schehallien observations , give , as finally correctedt by HUTTON , -9- , or almost 5*0 .
Frorn the experiments with balls we have the following results : By CAVENDISH , as corrected by BAILEY ... , 448 By BALY ... . .
567 By REICH ... ... ... ... .
5'44 4L2 609 Fromn the pendulutm experiments at a great d(epth and on the surface , the Astronomer Royal obtained 6'566 .
I have recently received , through the Astronomer Royal , two copies of the new National Standard Yard : it is obviously necessary that our geodetic mteasures should be given in reference to the standard ; but not knowing from what scale the standard has been taken , I amr unable to say at present in what way the reduction is to be made ; that is , whether by reference to the comparison of the old standards which have been already made , or by the mechanical process of a direct comparison of the Ordnance Standard with the new National Standard .
HI .
JAMEs , Lieut.-Colonel R.E. The Principal Triangulation of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and Ireland , extending from the Scilly Isles , in latitude 49 ? ?
53 ' to the Shetland Isles , in latitude 60 ? ?
50 ' , and embracing at its widest extent aboutt 12 ?
of longitude , consists of aboutt 250 stations .
The observations for the connexion of the trigonometrical stations have been made with four large theodolites , two of 3 feet , one of 2 feet , and the other of 18 inches in diameter .
The first two instruments ( one of which is the property of the Royal Society ) , and the 18-inch theodolite , were constructed by RAMSDSN at the cornmencement of the trigonometrical operations in England in 1798 : the 2-feet theodolite was constructed by Messrs. TROUGHTON and SIMMS at the comnmencement of the Irish Survey in 1824 .
The latitudes of thirty-two of the stations of the principal triangulation have been determined by observations made with RAMSDEN'S zenith sector , and since the destruction of that instrument in the great fire at the Tower of London , with AIRY 's zenith sector .
All the observations made with these instruments have been published in detail* .
The mode of obserlving with the theodolite may be shortly described as follows : The instrument being first placed very carefully over the precise centre of the station , an object having a fine vertical line of light , with a breadth of about 10 " , is set up in a convenient position within a mile or two of the station ; this object , called the " referring-object , " serves as a point of reference from which all angles are measured .
The lower limb of the instrument being clamped , the observer intersects the referring-object and then each of the principal points in succession , concluding with a second observation of the referring-object , which should be identical , withtlin the limnits of errors of observation , with the first reading of that object : the instrument is then unclamped and the bearings read again on different parts of the divided circle .
The method by which these observations are reduced to the tmost probable results , is an approximate solution of the equations resulting from the method of least squares .
The direction of the meridian has been determined by observations of the elongations of a , , X Urs .
min. and 51 Cepllei ; at six of the stations at which these observations have been made , the probable error of the result is under 0"'40 , at twelve under 0'50 , at thirty-four under 0`'70 , and at fifty-one under 1"'00 .
Measured Base Lines .
The account of the rmeasurement with RAMSDEN'S steel chain of the base lines on Hounslow Heath in 1791 , on Sallisburt y Plain in 1794 , on Misterton Carr in 1801 , and on Rhuddlan Marsh in 1806 , will be found in the ' Account of the Trigonometrical Survey .
' These base lines are all expressed in terms of RAMSDEN'S brass scale at the temperature of 62 ?
FAHRENHEIT .
The chains were compared with RAMSDEN'S prismatic bar ( 20 feet in length ) , which was laid off from the brass scale at the temperature of 54 ?
FAHRENHEIT .
By a series of comparisons of the Ordnance 10-foot standard iron bar ( designated O , ) with RAMSDEN'S 20-foot standard , m-ade at Southampton , it was found that RAMSDEN'S bar-20'0007656 feet of O1 , so that any measurement expressed in terms of feet of RAMSDEN'S bar at 620 must be multiplied by 1 0000383 to give feet of O , at the same temperature .
Also to reduce a measurement expressed in terms of RAMSDEN'S brass scale to the same in terms of RAMSDEN'S bar , it must be increased by a quantity corresponding to the difference of the expansions of brass and iron for 80 ; and taking these quantities as used in the reduction of the bases , it will be found that the multiplier is 1-0000328 , and hence to reduce the old bases to feet of , , they must be multiplied by 1P0000711 .
In 1816 a base line of five miles in length was measured by Major-General COLBY on Belhelvie Sands , Aberdeenshire : the measurement was effected with RAMSDEN'S steel chains , and in precisely the same manner as the previous bases .
The chains were conmpared with RAMSDEN'S bar by Mr. BERGE both before and after the measurement .
In 1826-27 the Lough Foil Base was measured in the north of Ireland with MajorGeneral COLBY'S compensation bars .
Of this measurement a description in detail has been published* .
In 1849 the old base line on Salisbury Plain was remeasured .
This measurement exceeded the old mteasure when reduced to the same standard by a foot .
The guns marking the extremities of the old line were found imbedded very firmly in the earth , and in all probability in exactly their original positions .
By a series of comparisons instituted in 1834t between the Royal Astronomical Society 's Scale and the Ordnance Standard O , it was determined that Ord .
Standard Oi= 1 19 997508 mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society 's Scale ; also from Mr. BAILY'S comparison of this scale with the standard metre he determined Standard Metre =39*369678 mean inches of the centre yard of the Royal Astronomical Society 's Scale .
From more recent observations , it appears that the Royal Astronomical Society 's scale has undergone a permanent alteration of length ; the interval however between the two series of observations above quoted was not sufficiently long to vitiate the connexion thus established between the Ordnance Standard and the metre .
The resulting value of the metre in terms of O , is therefore Standard Metre =3-2808746 mean feet of 1 , , and hence since the metre =443-296 lines of the toise of Peru , Toise -6*3945438 mean feet of O , .
Reduction of the Triangulation .
If u represent the true ratio of the distance between any two points in a network of triangulation to the base line ; AB C ... A ' ... the true angles , whose observed values are A+ca .
B+P , C+y ... A'+ ' ... , then if u , be the calculated value of u obtained by using the series of observed angles ABC ... , u ' the value obtained by using the series of observed angles A'B'C ' ... .
u =f(ABC ... ) =(A'B'C ' ... ) ... .
u1=u-+ac.a +b +cr + ... ul =u+ at + b ' + c'y'+ ... .
and so on .
Each different calculation of u will therefore give a different value for that quantity .
In the necessary existence of these discrepancies among the calculated values of u , it becomes of much importance to obtain the most probable value .
In ordinary calculations this has been generally effected by assuming it to be the mean of all the calculated values uulu'u ' ... . .
This might be improved upon by assigning to each value of u its proper weight by means of the weights of the observed angles , but the method would still be imperfect and discrepancies would still exist in other parts of the work .
From the above equations , though we cannot determine the precise value of u , vet we can obtain some precise information respecting the errors of observation ; for we have evidently , since the quantities abc ... a'b'c ' ... are numerical , certain equations of condition between the unknown errors .
But the number of such equations of condition for the whole figure being necessarily less than the actual number of errors , an indefinite number of systems of corrections might be obtained that would satisfy all the geometrical relations of the triangulation .
The question then is to determine that system which is the most probable , and the soluton derved frm the y of probabilites is , that the most probable system of corrections xx1 ... is that which makes the function 2(wx2)* a minimunm .
If n be the number of observed angles in a network of triangulation , n the number of points , then 2(m-2 ) will be the number of angles absolutely required to fix all the points , consequently the geometrical figure must supply n-2m+4 equations of condition amongst the true angles or amongst the corrections to the observed atgles : we have therefore n-2+4 equations of the form 0 -a+ bl1x+ c1x+d , lx+ 1 ... .
0=a2+ b2+c,2x+dc2x"+*. .
which are to be deterimined so that the quantity U =x2+W'xI2 + W1X ... .
shall be a minimum .
Multiplying the equations of condition by unknown quantities AIX2 , ... .

Substituting the values of wxx ... in terms of X12 ... .
as obtained from these equations , in the equations of condition we get a system of equations from which 1X2 ... may be determined , ; and havinrg obtained the numerical values of these quantities , the last set of equations will give the numerical values of the required corrections xx ' ... In order that the results of the triangulation as applied to the determination of the figure of the earth might have the greatest weight possible , the most probable system of corr ections has been calculated according to BESSELSs method , shortly described above .
The principal and only objection to the application of this method of obtaining the most trustworthy results , is the extremely voluminous and tedious natule of the calculations .
The total number of equations of condition for the triangula. .
tion is 920 ; if therefore the whole were to be reduced in one mass , it would involve as a small part of the work the solution of an equation of 920 unknown quantities .
The following method of approximation therefore was adopted : the triangulation was divided into twenty-one parts or figures , each affording a not unmanageable number of equations of condition ; four of these parts , not adjacent , were first adj usted by the method just explained .
The corrections determined in these figures were substituted , so far as they entered , in the equations of condition of the adjacent figure , and the sum of the squares of the remaining corrections in that figure made a minimum .
Thus each division of the triangulation , with the exception of the four specified above , is dependent upon one or more of the figures to which it is adjacent .
The average nuniber of equations in each figure is about 44 ; the greatest number of equations in any one figure is 77 .
Each figure was worked by two independent computers .
This of itself alone would have been insufficient to secure freedom from error , but the final working of every possible triangle , after the corrections were applied to the observed angles , secured perfect accuracy .
Corrections to all the observed bearings having been obtained in the manner explained , it is clear that since all the geometrical relations of the figure are satisfied , no discrepancies can present themselves between the calculated values of the distance between any two points by whatever series of angles it may be obtained .
The triangles are calculated by LEGENDRE'S theorem .
This theorem may be applied to triangles of any magnitude , up to two or three hundred miles , without fear of error .
The greatest errors that can result in the values of the sides a , b of a spheroidal triangle as calculated from the side c by spherical trigonometry , using the geometric mean of the principal radii of curvature of the surface for the mean latitude of the triangle as the radius of the sphere , are ( the position of the triangle in azimuth being the variable quantity with respect to which the errors are the greatest possible ) , -==~f(412 +m+4n2)j tb= 1 4(l2+4m+4 n24n ) e2 cos2. .
abc / ~-12R " ~/ 1 --n~2 ' where R is the radius of the sphere , e the eccentricity of the earth 's surface , Imn the cosines of the angles of the triangle opposite abc respectively , and X its mean latitude .
Comparison of Bases .
5The absolute length of any side , or ' the linear scale of the trliangulation , is made to depend on the bases measured with the compensation bars at Lough Foil and on Salisbury Plain .
The discrepancy between the measured and calculated length of these bases is about 5 inches ; this discrepancy is divided so that each of the two bases shall exhibit an error proportional to the square root of its length : the comparison of all the bases is then as follows : Length in terms Length in terms Lenth in Date .

For short distances the ordinary formulae are sufficient , but in the case of distances above 80 or 100 miles the following formula are used , A being the given point , and B that whose latitude and longitude are required : Let s =-distance AB measured on the surface of the earth v =normal to minor axis at Ao =angle subtended at the foot of this normal by the curve sa= azimuth of B at A cJ=azimuth of A at B , both measured firomt the north ; =latitude of A ; Z=90-'= latitude of Bw =difference of longitude =radius of curvature of the meridian for the latitude 1(x4+x ' ) tan i(d+~-i-o)=siln ( +- ) cot sin ( x 0 ) tan -( ' + =6+W ) cot pl O=-.^-r--+ I cos2 ( x co s2 ta/ _x = os 1+ cs " 0v ' 6(1e2 ) 4(l_ e2 ) COS2 X sin 2 a , 4 being a minute angular correction here expressed , as also 0 , in angular measure .
In the calculation of latitudes and longitudes we must suppose all the points to be projected on a regular spheroidal surface ( A ) , very nearly agreeing with the actual surface covered by the triangulation , then by equations of condition between the observed and calculated latitudes , longitudes and azimuths , small alterations to the elements of the assumed spheroid and its position must be determined : this new spheroid ( B ) will be that most nearly representing the actual surface under consideration .
For the first spheroid , that determined by the Astronomner Royal as most nearly representing the earth 's surface ; namely , a=20923713 feet b=20853810 feet was used as the spheroid of reference ( A ) .
If we resolve the inclination of the actual surface at any point to that of the spheroid ( B ) at the same point , or rather its projection , into two inclinations , one north and the other east , and call these inclinations a , and gn , these quantities being positive when the actual surface , as compared with that of the regular surface , rises to the north and to the east , and if we put { and a for the same quantities at Greenwich , from which point the calculations of latitude and longitude and azimuths had their commencement , then each point at which the latitude has been observed will give an equation of the form.=ta+ bf+q c+mnsa+ne , and each point at which the longitude ot direction of the mneridian has been determined will give an equation of the form 7= a ' + bf + da +c m'a + n'e , in which so and be are the increments to the semiaxis major and eccentricity of the spheroid ( A ) .
In consequence of the smallness of the coefficients n n ' in the latitude of Great Britain , the quantity be would have very little weight as determined from these equations .
Surface of Great Britain .
The approximate results derived from the above equations are , assuming 6e=0 , a= 2536 =0 -t =+-1"'4 , so that the semiaxes of the spheroid most nearly representing the surface of Great Britain are a=209262491 &gt; 2feet of Ordnance Standard 01 .

Figure of the Earth .
In obtaining the spheroid most nearly representing the measured arcs of meridian , we shall follow the method given by BESSEL in his determination of the figure of the earth in Nos. 333 and 438 of the 'Astronomische Nachrichten ; ' substituting for the English arc as used by him , the data of the present results , and for the Indian arc as used by him , the data contained at page 427 of Colonel EVEREST'S I Account of the Measurement of Two Sections of the Meridional Arc of India .
' Colonel EVEREST'S measurements are expressed in terms of his standard 10-foot iron bar A , and the standard 6-inch scale A , twenty parts of any linear result being in terms of feet of the iron standard and one part in terms of feet of the 6-inch scale .
By means of the comparisons contained at page 436 of Colonel EVEREST'S work and at pages 101 and [ 40 ] of the 'Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foil Base , ' it will be found , that to ieduce the results contained in the former work to feet of O , , they must be multiplied by 99999026 .
There is , however , some uncertainty in the unit of measure of the earlier portion of the second East Indian Arc. Peruvian Arc.-The data are a mean between the reduced results obtained by DELAMBRE and ZACH ( Base du Syst. Metr .

where g is the length of a mean degree of the meridian determined by the relation g--= a(l n)(l -n2)N .
Hence if s be the mneridian distance of two points whose latitudes are,1+xl , and X2+x2 , we must substitute in this equation p+x2-xl for p , neglecting the influence of the small quantities x on the mean latitude of the arc ; after this substitution we obtain x--x =p~ i18i-----+20 sin cos 2X-- ' sin 22 cos 4X ) p= I+ 2a cos p cos 2X .
Now let g1 ac be approxim-ate values of g and a , so that 1 1+i gg'= a=l(l+k ) .

Had the point Evaux in the French Arc , at which there is obviously some peculiar local disturbance , been omitted , we should have obtained p= -1'65000 , q= +'09341 : these values would have increased tte values of the semniaxes as obtained above by about 200 feet each , and increased the compression to a-b 1a --297*72 The corrections in the French Arc would then stand thus : Formentera +..-1'319 Mountjouy. .

The corrections for the other arcs are not materially altered , but are in general diminished : the mean error of the 625 equations is +2*05 , which would diminish the probable error of the results in the proportion of 5 : 4 .
