413 graphs , taken with the spectroscope in different positions , failed to show the smallest trace of shift from flexure .
The only suggestion we can make in explanation is that the piece of solid radium bromide accidentally shifted in its cell , so as no longer to be directly under the slit , and in consequence the collimator lens was not wholly filled with light .
The results of the experiments described in this paper would appear to show generally , if analogy with electric stimulation may be assumed , that the radium stimulation , whether we take the operative cause to lie in the / 3 rays , or in the encounters of nitrogen molecules with the active molectdes of radium\#151 ; by which , for the first time , a spectrum of bright bands in the ultra-violet region has been obtained at ordinary temperatures , and without the intervention of an electric discharge\#151 ; from the very circumstance of its being of such a nature as to give rise to the band spectrum of nitrogen , is not of a kind which can elicit from either the molecules of bromine , or of radium their characteristic line spectra .
The question suggests itself whether or not the same inability may hold in respect of the helium molecule , which is easily stimulated by an electric discharge ; we have not as yet made experiments on this point .

The faint line 3961'624 , described* as a radium line , is due to aluminium , being one of the strongest lines in the A1 spectrum .
Its wave-length , recently measured on a special aluminium photograph , shows the identity ; moreover , with a pure salt of radium it is found to be absent .
