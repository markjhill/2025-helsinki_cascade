On the Calculus of Symbols.--Second Memoir .
By W. H. L. RUSSELL , Esq. , A.B. Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY , jEs .
, F.R.S. Made up of two Memoirs : one received January 7 , -Read January 30 , 1862 ; the other received June 18 , -Read June 19 , 1862 .
TTHIS Memoir is a continuation of one on the Calculus of Symbols which I had the honour to lay before the Society in December 1860 , and which has since been published in the Philosophical Transactions .
I commence this paper with some extensions of the method given in the former memoir for resolving functions of non-commutative symbols into binomial factors .
I then explain a method , analogous to the process for extracting the square root in ordinary algebra , for resolving such functions into equal factors .
I next investigate a process for finding the highest common internal divisor of two functions of non-commutative symbols , or , in other words , of finding if two linear differential equations admit of a common solution .
After this , I give a rule for multiplying linear factors of non-commutative symbols , analogous to the ordinary algebraical rule for linear algebraical factors .
I then resume the consideration of the binomial theorem explained in the former memoir .
Two new forms of this binomial theorem are here given ; and the method by which these forms are proved identical will , I hope , be considered an interesting portion of symbolical algebra , and as exhibiting in a remarkable manner its peculiar nature .
In the next place , I proceed to calculate the general values of the coefficients which occur in the form of the binomial theorem given in the first memoir ; I then obtain an expression for the symbolical coefficient of the general term of the multinomial theorem as previously explained ; and also a theorem for the multiplication of symbolical factors emanating from each other after a given law ; lastly , I investigate a binomial theorem reciprocal to the binomial theorem already considered .
In the former memoir I explained a process by which the symbolical function gnpn(1r ) ?

I shall now give a method by which the same symbolical function may be resolved into factors of the form ( repralf to,7()+ , the bal8-l)q Jthe rem(n(alread cn)+siere By pursuing methods similar to those employed in the preceding paper , we find the following equations as the condition that i24o2(z)+4o( ) may be an internal factor of IDCCCLXII .

We may also find in like manner the conditions that g34,3(Q)+ ?
0(r ) , g4l4()+4o@r ) may be internal or external factors of the given symbolical function : in every case the number of equations of condition will be equal to the degree of ( g ) in the given factor .
By applying the method of divisors , as explained in the former paper , we may ascertain the forms of,2(r ) , 4to(r ) in order that q2 % , ( r)+ S-o(r ) may be an internal factor of the given symbolical function .
In the present case , however , 2(7r ) must be a divisor both of ( ( 7r- ) and cp , ,-_(r ) , A0(r ) a divisor both of q , ( 7r ) and 0(7r ) , --a consideration which will greatly simplify the process .
We proceed , in like manner , should there be no internal factors of the form g%2 + v+7r , g22(7 ) + foC(7r ) to ascertain if there are any of the form g32(r ) + 0o(r ) , &amp;c. ; and continuing the investigation as before , we are able , in all possible cases , to resolve the given symbolical function P.(7r ) + nf- ' &lt; P-_1(r ) ++ +o(7r ) into binomial factors .
Hence , in any linear differential equation , dru dr-lu d"-2u Xr r +Xr-l dX-rlX-r-2 dar-.2+ For this purpose , let us assume g2n"(7 ) +2n-12_(7r)+ 2-2,2n-2(7r ) + ... + ( pr ) =(gn4 , ( f )+ -11(7r)+ n2 -2-2(7r)+ * Take g2+e--r2 for a divisor , and proceed as follows:g"+_-X9g2+g^(X+a+1)-H ( T2 + r ) 3 5+ 2+ 2+It is easily seen that the remainder may be written z('r--)(g- ) .
Hence , taking g--T as divisor , g(5r+1)-i ?

Hence , taking g-+5r2 for a new divisor , gr+z2 ) r+fQ2++ ) +2 ( g+ Hence g-+--2 is the highest common internal divisor of 2(0 + l ) + g(3 +X2 ) + X2(X 1 ) and 3--2 24+g(5 +)+ : 4 .
It is evident , as was mentioned in the introduction to this memoir , that this process is equivalent to finding the conditions that two linear differential equations may have a. common solution .
I shall next proceed to find the general term of the continued product ( + 01r)(g + 25r)(g + %3 ) ... ( g + On ) .
256 : This product , when developed , will be of the form Then 0.(r ) is given by the following rule : Write down the following symbolical product : O6(rn+m)r2 +n( +*+m ) +m ) ... . .
( +m ) ; take every possible combination of the quantities 1 , 2 , 3 , ... n taken ( n--m ) at a time , and substitute them as the weight* of 0 in this continued product , diminishing ( m ) in each factor by the increment of the weight of the factor ; add all the results together , and we obtain the value of &lt; ( r ) .
The truth of this rule will be manifest to every one who will consider the following result obtained by actual multiplication:(g +O ( + rg+ )+ 3X)( +( +)( + 5)= g5 + e4{0j(.+4 ) +02(+ 3)+03(+2 ) +4 1)+1 ) } +g3 ' { OK(+ 3)2('r+ 3)+1(r+ 3 ) +3(r+2)+ 02(7+2)A3( &amp; +2)+ O , ( z+ 3)04(r+1 ) + 02( ?

It is evident , in the first place , that in multiplying any binomial ( f2+pO(r ) ) " by 2++g6(r ) , the result in this case will be the same whether we employ internal or external multiplication .
Let ( " +g( ?

E.d ; -(~ E ' '- " ~ a-We shall now investigate another form of this expansion , by which we shall be able to obtain a remarkable expression for the general term .
We shall express the unknown functions by a notation slightly differing from that which we have just employed .
The reason for so doing will be easily seen by the reader .

As there are some peculiarities connected with this form , I shall calculate its value at length for the values r=1 and r=2 .
First , let r=1 .

It is proper to add that the same method of investigation applies to all binomials of the form ( ?

In the following investigation , it is proper to remark that 0 , ( r ) , ,(7r ) , O3(7r ) ... are any rational and entire functions of ( r ) whatever .
To find an expression for the general term of the multinomial theorem , by which ( ga +2--l 1(7r ) + ga-2 )2(7 , ) +g-303(7r)+ ** * ) is expanded in powers of ( g ) .

Hence ( n+ ' 1 )7 ^ )((r +1 ) =X+1(7r+2n+2)+n+l 7r , whence ddd { )1^ ( )=ยงยง % dr(E(n l ) ( + I ( 1 ) ) , and also 92+ ( 7 ) -_()(=+ l)=()(7+l ) l(X , +7 2n+l ) +9'1 ( 7 ?
