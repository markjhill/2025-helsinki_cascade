General Conclusions .
The final result of the discussion of the spectra of stars of the Cephei class is to show that they must be placed on the ascending arm of the temperature } , at a stage higher than stars like Tauri , in which the mean temperature is not very different from that of the sun .
Stars of equal tempernture on the descending side of the , of which Castor may be taken as a type , show precisely the same lines , the enhanced and cool lines having the same relative intensibies , but with inverted intensities of the hydrogen and metallic lines , and with some what less continuous absorption in ths ultra-violet .
The difference between like Cephei and those of tho sun is therefore partly due to a difference of temperature and partly due to a difference of physical condilion such as is demanded by the meteoritic ) lesis .
This result enables us to understand why some members of the Cephei class should show such a very special kind of } Cygni also finds a natural place on the arm of the tempcrature , at a stttge higher than Cephei , and all the culties met in to cJassify ib on view of decreasing temperature alone are removed .

The probability that the value of exceeds is . . . . . . . . . . . .
If the higher coefficients , \amp ; c. , are treated in the same manner , the same expression is found to hold .
Onr final result may now be expressed as follows:\mdash ; If a number of disconnected events occur within an interval of time , all times being equally probable for each event , and if the frequency of occurrence of these is expressed in a series of thoe form , the that any of the quantities has a value lying between and is and the expectancy for is In proving this proposition it was assumed that the number of intervals into whioh the is subdivided is very lalge , but this condition is not essential .
To suit accurately the process employed by Mr. Knott , we should have to consider the vectors , \amp ; c. , to be confined to fixed directions forming ] with each other .
But it follows directly from the method employed by Lord eigh that his results must apply to this case also , if is a multiple of four .
It is further not necessary to enquire whether ( 7 ) holds in the mosb general case , when , for instance , is an odd number , because the process employed by Mr. Knott and others is justified only on the assumption that the number of intervals into which the period is subdivided is so large that a further increase of it would not alter { he relative value of the coefficients of the Fourier 3 .
Unfortunately .
Knott has adopted a common but in my opinion mischievous practice , which renders some further reductions necessary before we can apply expressions ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) .
Instead of basing his calculations on the number of earthquakes which took place in any parbicular lunar honr , he first takes overlapping means put down for five consecutive hours .
This practice has its legitimate use , when it is desired to make periodic.ities apparent to the eye by plotting down a serles of numbers which by themselves may be too irregular to bring out the iarities which it is eIlded to sbow .
Tho averaging of a On Solar Periodicitics of Earthquahes .
certain nnmber of successive figures eliminates to some extent the shorter periods , and therefore emphasises the longer ones .
Bub this elimination is done in a much better and more complete manner by Fourier 's analysis , when it is therefore intended to submit the figures to that process of calculation , the s1lloothing down of the original numbers , represents waste of arithmctical work , uncompensated , as far as I can see , by any advantage .
To judge of .
Knott 's results it necessary therefore to trace the effect of the process of calculation employed by him .
The problem to be solved for that purpose may be stated thus:\mdash ; A number , , of , is essed in terms of the periodic series ( 1 ) .
A second series is formed by taking the sum of successive llumbers , the two members of the ser es being and The original series is supposed to itself , so that the nember of the derived series becomes It equlred to find the relation between the coefficients of the ourier ension for the two series .
It will bc sufficient to find the tion of this problem for the case that the original series represellb equidistant ordinates of the curve , so that The -lution of this case really includes the general one , for the original series is supposed to } ) reprcsented by a number of terms , of which is simply pol.iodic , and to ch of wLich the result of the spccial case may be separately ) plied .
rrho first term of the derived may ined by a proccss , .
The subsequent terms are obtained simply by altering the value of rfhe derived \amp ; c. , represel1ts erefore the equidistant ordinates of the curve .
It is a having the same period as the original one , but having an amplitude reduced in the ratio Applylng this result to the separate terms of the series ( 1 ) and ltlg that represents the difference in phase between success ve Prof. Sclrustcr .
tcrms of the original series , it is seen that the coefficients and are both educed in the ratio .
This result has to be divided to fit it to the case that the derived series is not for1ned by taking tho of successive numbers , bub by king $jheir mean The eifect of smoothing down the of the observed numbers has therefore the effect of reducing the qth coefficients of Fourier series in the ratio In the case nder d , so that the amphitudes of the first four coefficients of the series are reduced respecin the ratios The lmber of earthquakes taken into account was 7427 , so that .
expectancy the amplitude of any one of the coeflicients , irreof the smoothing process , would be If this number is multiplierl by above fractions , and then by 1000 in order to make the ullits with those .
Knott 's paper , we obtain the numbers placed in the first row of Table I ; the second row gives by comparison the coefficients actually found .
Knott .
Table I. The numbers in this table do not support Mr. Knott 's contention but seem to me rather to be a striking confirmation of the probability .
It must remembered that the " " expectancy\ldquo ; only ives the average value of a great many cases , ) individuaJs of which may diffel .
considerably from that average .
Thus it may be calculated with the help of expression ( 9 ) that in about one case out of evel .

In second part of lJis paper , Mr. Knott of the monthly and fortn ightly periodicities .
He expl.esses himself very guardedly as to the results of this part of , chiefly the ound that the amplitudes found for the period of the on " " montb are quite as ss thosc found fo " " tropl\ldquo ; or " " synodic\ldquo ; months .
As there is no couceivable why the nodical lllonth ifect earthquakes , the conclusion will bly be drawu this , that any period chosen at raudom vould similar results .
I think we must take it , default of evidencc , ) lment is valid and llot which seem to to your the reality of these lunar periods , spite of the kness of the to which nself dttcnbion .
The number of eartl into consideration ) this would give all for each of the cocfficients to has to applied differs for the difforeut as has explained in the of the periods lunal da I obtain in this the llnlbers s II .
For of complcteness , I amplitndes by the Vtl'ious months , also the mean runplitudes of the monthly periods .

tho thy , ] , and points so much to the nlity of to some common causo which has led to too low { on of the ectancy .
The latter quantity has been culated undcl the Schustel assumption that the earthquakes are altogether independent of each other and take place at random .
Auy regularity would be contrary to this assumption and might affect the expectancy .
Thus , for instance , ib is known that earbhqnakes take place in groups , a large earthquake being generally followed by some minor shocks .
Mr. Knott states that the : ' obvious " " aftershocks were left out of account in his calculation ; but there may be aftershocks which are not obvio1zs , and it seems quite likely that every earthquake is followed by a period during which another is more likely to happen than at other times .
If there is such a tendency it is easy to see , that our calculated numbers for the expectallcy will be too low .
Take the case , for instance , that all earthquakes happen in groups of two , or , what comes to the same thing , each earthquake in the investigation of S2 count as two .
The quantities I have called will Ilot bo affected by this change , bub the total number of earthquakes being doubled , the expectancy ] ated according to our is reduced in the proportion of to 1 , and wouId therefore be too small in thab ratio .
It seems to me to probable that the discrepancy between Mr. Knott 's coefficients and the calculated expectancy is explained in .
Apart from this possible explanation it would nob be safe to any certain conclusions from any instance in which the calculated amplitude has double the of the expectancy , for expression ( 9 ) shows that the amplitudes will turn oub to bs even .
than that on in one case out of every twenty.three .
matter to be explained is not that any one of Mr. Knott 's is , ghly speaking , twice as great as the expectancy , but that all coefficients show this tendency towards higher values in nob very different proportions .

It is interesting to disc , from the point of view of this paper , the periodicities of earbhquakes which apparently depend , ectly or indirectly , on the position of the sun .
We owe to Mr. Davison a very complete discussion of the annual period .
* The method employed by him ( in determining the amplibudes of the periodic , though neither direct nor very accurate , is sufficient for our purpose .
Taking as an example the record of 5879 earthquakes in the northern hemisphere , given by Mr. R. Mallet , the esults of this paper show that if they were distributed indiscriminately over the year the expectancy for the amplitude would be , or , while Mr. Davison , in S 18 of the quoted , gives for the amplitude .
Similarly , the discussion of 8133 rthquakes , or which the expectancy , yields the number for the amplitude .
Here , then , we have the amplitude in one case equal to fi ve times , and in the other equal to fourteen times , the expectancy .

46$ is in the first case only 1 in , and in the second almost infinitesimally small .
The reality of the period would be thercby established beyond reasonable doubt , unless the peculiarity of earthquakes occurring in groups , as discnssed in the prev ous tion can be shown to raise the expectaucy sufficientl.y .
The act , ow he fact however , that in each hemisphere the phase of the periodicity found is near identical in a great nunlber of cases disposes of all doubt hich might remain on that point .
In some of the details Mr. results would seem to : further contirmation .
The ence , instance , that the strong and weak ocks follow diffel .
Cllt laws is not strong when examined by means of the theoly of probability .
Mr. Davison classifies Japanese earthquakes into three oups , according tcy their intensity , and finds that the maxima of the annual period agree in the stronger and take place in winter , the maxima for the weakest group occur 111 summer .
The magnitude of the alnplitude for the former , while the expectancy is and respectively .
Hero the excess of amplitude over the expectancy is not sufficiently ked to allow of any cer tain conclusions being drawn .

The reality of the daily period must be consl ere dered established , nnless the evaluation of the expectancy is faulty , owlng 464 On Lunar and Solar Periodicities of to the fact that tremors occur in ( S 5 ) .
The good agreement between the phases of the periodicity disposes of that doubt .

The expression for the oxpectancy deduced in S 2 may with advantage be employed in simiIar investigations to decide the number of events which it is necessary to take into account in order to establish a pericdicity of given amplitude .
It follows from the laws of probability that , to be certain , the amplitudes found should be least equal to three times the expectancy .
Hence , if be the amplitude looked for , , or Thus , for iIlstance , Mr. Knobt deduces for his supposed lunar period a range of 6 per cent. , or an amplitude of .
In order to establish with cerlainty such an amplitude , it would be that the number of earthquakes taken into account should at least be equal to 30,000 , or over four times tlJe number actually used in the calcuiations .
9 .
The discussed in S5 would seem to limit in many cases the applicability of the results found .
There are , indeed , nearly every case actually in nature , certain regularities in the manner in which events happer ] , and this egularity always favours higher valuc-s of the Fourier coefficicnts .
As it will not be possible to estimate in cases the elect of the expectancy , some other form of treatment will often be called for .
The theorem ] , I think , prove useful in these investigations:\mdash ; Let be a function of , such that its values are regulated by some law of probability , not necessorily exponential one , but acting in snch a manner that if a large number of values of be chosen at andom there will always be a deiinlte fraction of that number on only , which lio veen t and , where is any given time interval .
