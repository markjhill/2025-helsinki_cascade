A paper was also read , entitled , " An Inquiry into a new Theory of earthy Bases of Vegetable Tissues , " by the Rev. J. B. Read , M.A. , F.R.S. The author , after briefly noticing the results of some of his experiments described in two papers which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for July and November , 1837 , and also those of Mr. Ro ?
bert Rigg in a paper read to the Royal Society , next adverts to the theory of M. Raspail , detailed in his Tableau Synoptique , and Nouveau Systeme de Chimie .
In opposition to some of the views entertained by the latter , he finds that in the bark of the bamboo and the epidermis of straw the silica incrusting these tissues is not crystal ?
lized , but , on the contrary , exhibits , both before and after incinera ?
tion , the most beautiful and elaborate organization , consisting of an arranged series of cells and tubes , and differing in its character in different species of the same tribe , and in different parts of the same plant .
The observations of Mr. Golding Bird , contained in the 14th number of the Magazine of Natural History , New Series , are then referred to ; and the author states in confirmation , that , by employ ?
ing caustic potash , the siliceous columns may be removed from the leaf of a stalk of wheat , while the spiral vessels and ducts , which form the principal ribs of the leaf , as well as the apparently metallic cups which are arranged on its surface , remain undisturbed .
He proposes , therefore , to substitute , in the description of vegetable tissues , the term skeleton , instead of that of bases , whether saline or siliceous , of those tissues .
