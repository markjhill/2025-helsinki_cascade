I. Experiments to determine the relative Magnetic Forces soliciting a Magnetic Needle , suspended horizontally .
THE forces were determined by a comparison of the number of vibrations made by several needles at each place .
They were vibrated in a box , in the vertical sides of which were fixed narrow strips of glass , having on each of them a fine vertical line drawn by means of a diamond ; by the coincidence or parallelism of these lines with the silk fibres by which the needles were suspended , also by making their extremities coincide with two fixed points on the bottom of the box , their horizontal position was insured .
The first semiarc of vibration was ten degrees , and the last two .
As the magnetism of needles is increased as the temperature is diminished , and vice versa , it becomes necessary to reduce the experiments to the same standard .
But since the law or relation existing between the changes of temperature and the corresponding increments and decrements of the magnetic intensity is not precisely known , and will moreover in some degree vary with the shape , size , &amp;c. of the needles employed ; it is better to avoid as much as possible the necessity of any correction , by making the experiments atnearly the same temperature .
The principal objection to the use of horizontal needles for the purpose of determining the comparative magnetic forces in the direction of the dipping needle , arises from a knowledge of the dip being required .
For although they admit of great delicacy of suspension , yet in high latitudes this objection is , for obvious reasons , insuperable , and their use inadmissible for this purpose .
The determination of the forces in the direction of the dipping needle was also effected by direct experiment , with three needles attached to an excellent dipping instrument made by DOLLOND .
The first semi-arc of vibration in this instrument was 40 ?
, and the last 10 ?
; and the number of vibrations between these limits was generally about 80 with each needle .
Many observers , I am aware , are in the habit of observing the vibrations of their needles in much smaller arcs , for the purpose of obtaining a greater number of vibrations , as well as making the times of vibrations approach nearer to isochronisrn , and thereby rendering corrections for the circular arcs less necessary .
Desirable as these objects are , yet considerable experience in the use of these instruments has convinced me , that very little reliance can be placed on the vibrations of needles when the total arcs described are less than about 20 ? .
Such , at least , has been the case with those which I have used , which have been very numerous , and of the best construction .
To those much accustomed to experiments with dipping instruments and other instruments for magnetical purposes , it may be needless to state the necessity of ascertaining by experiment , that the metal of which they are constructed exerts no assignable influence on the needle ; at least such influence as may cause it to deflect from its true dipping position , or in any way affect the time of its completing a given number of vibrations .
This can be readily ascertained by placing the instrument , with the centre-work removed if necessary , in a horizontal position , and by suspending within it either one of the needles belonging to it , or another of the same length , by means of a long fibre of raw silk .
If it be found that the time of performing a given number of vibrations of the needle when thus placed within it , is the sale as when the instrument is detached from it , we may infer that no such influence exists .
To avoid the objection arising from the influence of metal upon the needles , several dipping instruments have been constructed of late years of wood and card , some of which are of the usual form , and in others ( in order that the friction which arises from the transverse axes of the needles when vibrating upon agate edges may be removed , ) the needles are supported by fibres of silk , 238 secured at each end of the axes by means of a small hook or notch , which having the degree of tension necessary for its support , and also by an arrangement of the instrument resembling the equatorial movement of astronomical instruments , the needles are made to vibrate in any plane at pleasure .
Ingenious as these contrivances are , they are subject to several inconveniences ; and a very material one arises from the effects of temperature and humidity upon the frame and centre-work of the instrument .
That which I had of this construction was in Levant and Siroc winds perfectly immovable from this cause ; which , together with the effect of torsion , rendered it little better than useless for the general purposes of a dipping instrument ; and I could confirm these objections by the testimony and experience of an indefatigable observer employed on the coast of Africa .
I have been led to these remarks by having witnessed a considerable degree of disappointment expressed by several persons , who in visiting foreign countries have lauldably endeavoured by their exertions to add somewhat to the present stock of information upon this subject , and who have foundl upon their freturin , that they havy in a ire t measure failed n the4r endeavours , either from sorme imperfection in the construction of their instrutrscts or in the methods of using them : and I cannot but considler , that an unqualified commendation of any instrument whatever , intended for foreign service , particularly for those places which , from many circumstances , can rarely be visited , without thoroughly examining its merits , to be productive of considerable mischief ; since it is not only the cause of error , but tends to damp that zeal for the interests of science which travellers have it often in their power to promote .
As experiments of this nature are most frequently made at some of the principal sea-ports immediately before the embarkation of the needles , and at the same places upon their return , in order that the intervals of time may be as short as possible , which is desirable on account of the great variations which their intensities are subject to from rust and other causes ; and as other experiments have generally been referred to London , it becomes necessary to know the relative forces between these places , that the requisite reductions may be made .
For this purpose a series of experiments were made during the last summer by Captain Sir EVERARD HOME , Bart. F.R.S. near London , and at South Sea Castle near Portsmouth .
With a similar view , another series had 22 239 been previously made by myself at London and at Ride ( four miles from South Sea Castle ) in 1830 .
The mean between both results is probably nearest the truth ; from which the horizontal force at London is to the same at Portsmouth as 1 to 1P01755 ; and the forces in the direction of the dipping needle , as 1 to 1-00416 .
The dip at each place being 69 ? ?
40 ' and 69 ? ?
23 ' respectively .
Had the needles maintained precisely the same degree of magnetism during the whole period of these experiments , the forces might be at once obtained by comparing those made at each place with corresponding ones made in London ; but as this was not the case , and moreover from the causes just mentioned will seldom happen in long voyages , it was necessary in this case to compare the experiments made at Gibraltar with those made at Lisbon ; and also those made in the various places in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor with corresponding ones at Malta , obtained by means of short runs from this latter place .
It is necessary to mention this , since by otherwise combining the experiments different results may be obtained , without attending to this circumstance .
Table I. contains the comparative horizontal forces by a mean of four needles at each place , with a small correction applied for difference of temperature .
The last column of this Table contains the same , taking the horizontal force at London equal to unity .
Table II .
contains the comparative forces in the direction of the dipping needle determined by the experiments made with the horizontal ones ; and also the results obtained by direct experiment with the dipping needles .
The detail of the latter is omitted , since they are of less authority than the others , in consequence of their poles being constantly inverted for the purpose of obtaining the dip ; for though their magnetism was not interfered with between the consecutive experiments , there was not that satisfactory evidence respecting any alteration in their intensities that possibly might have occurred during the intervals which is desirable : the means of both methods are therefore omitted , as the results would be vitiated by the same cause .
The dips contained in the column for that purpose , are the mean results obtained with three needles ; -that at Malta , by a long series of experiments made in the years 1828-9 : these were made , not only for the purpose of determining the dip with all possible precision , since the greater number of the experiments made in other parts were necessarily compared with those made 240 at this place , but also for the sake of comparing the dip obtained by the different methods of vibration with that obtained in the usual way .
The experiments at Malta are given at the end of this paper .
In each of these experiments the poles are inverted ; a precaution as essential in deternmining the dip by the methods of vibrations as in any other method .
II .
Experiments on the diurnal vartation in the intensity of the Force solicitig a Magnetic Needle , suspended horizontally at Malta .
These experiments were first commenced on the 27th of November 1828 , with the horizontal needle No. 4 .
used in the foregoing observations , and having the usual silk suspension .
It was firmly fixed on a strong table constructed for the purpose , and placed in the centre of a large stone room in Valette , beyond the direct influence of the sun 's rays , and was vibrated in the box to which it was fitted .
The first semi-arc of vibration was 100 ?
and the last 2 ?
; and the time of completing one hundred vibrations was obtained by proportion .
The times of commencing the 1st , 3rd , and 5th vibrations , also the corresponding ones at the end of the experiment , were observed as before with a chronometer ; by which three intervals were obtained in the same experiment , and a mean of them taken for the result .
The experiments were continued without intermission until the 24th of January following , when I found upon examination , that I was unable to trace the least appearance of any progression in the results , as indicating a maxirnum or minimum , or indeed any change whatever , excepting what appeared to be the errors of experiment : still I was induced to continue them until I had completed three hundred sets of vibrations at different periods of the day and night , in hopes , that having made so great a number of experiments , and by taking a mean of all those made about the same time , the small errors of observation would be so far eliminated as to indicate some result of this kind .
In this I was again disappointed , as many of these means were nearly identical , that is , to the nearest tenth of a second .
It was evident , therefore , that the daily change of intensity , if any existed , was so exceedingly small as not to be apparent in experiments with this needle , much less the periods of riaximum and minimum .
On the 25th of March following , I began another series for the third time , 241 with a much larger needle ( one belonging to the dipping instrument ) , and suspended by a single fibre of raw silk eighteen inches in length ; the first semiarc of vibration was reduced to 5 ?
, and the last semi-arc to 2 ?
; and between these limits the number of vibrations was about two hundred and thirty .
In these the commencement of the 1st and every odd vibration to the 29th inclusive , were observed ; and at the end of the experiments , the commencement of the 201st , 203rd , &amp;c. to the 229th inclusive : by this means , the time of conpleting two hundred vibrations was obtained by a mean of fifteen independent observations .
In these , as in the former ones , very little progression appears in any one day 's experiments .
The differences indeed are so exceeding small , as to render them in some degree a test of the regular going of the chronometer , I will not , however , attempt to assign the degree of accuracy to which a chronometer will measure so small an interval , but merely observe , that every precaution was taken to insure accuracy , by using alternately one of three chronometers by ARNOLD ; which were wound up at different periods of the day , A very small correction for the daily rate of each was applied .
In one of them , which had the largest rate ( -12 " ) , the correction of the measured interval amounted to only one tenth of a second .
The following are the mean results , taken as before , about the same period of the day .

From these it appears that the least horizontal intensity took place about 2h A.M. , and the greatest about 2h P.M. , in April and May 1829 .
The variation is so very minute , that I offer this conclusion with some diffidence , though I have 242 but little doubt that it will be confirmed by the subsequent experiments of others .
I regret that my own were not more extensive .
I have now to mention a source of irregularity which may possibly arise during a series of experiments of this nature , and materially vitiate the results ; that is , storms of thunder and lightning .
They cause , as far as my experience goes , in general , a diminution in the magnetic intensity of the needles .
The observations just mentioned are fortunately exempt from this , from a continuance of fine weather during the experiments .
I had reason on several occasions to suspect this , but as I never had corresponding experiments made immediately previous to a violent storm , to compare with siinilar ones made subsequently , I was unable to assign with accuracy the period at which this diminution took place , and thereby identify the cause .
A violent storm which took place at Malta on the 7th of December 1829 , attended with considerable mischief , afforded me this opportunity .
I had fortunately , the day before , made a great number of observations with all the needles , for the sake of a comparison with similar ones that I intended to make in other parts of the Mediterranean to which I was about to proceed .
I availed myself therefore of the opportunity of ascertaining , during the storm , the effect produced upon the needles .
In the results which were obtained , it appears that all of them were affected in a similar way , that is , they all suffered a permanent diminution of their intensities .
III .
On the diurnal Oscillations in the direction of a Magnetic Needle , suspended horizontally at Malta .
The needle employed in these experiments was twelve inches in length .
Every precaution was taken to avoid the influence of iron ; and to secure the whole apparatus from damp , and to equalise the temperature around it , it was fixed , and the needle adjusted within it , six weeks before an observation was registered .
The radius of the arc described by the needle was increased from six to ten inches by light pieces of cedar attached to each end of it , and carrying upon their extremities small pieces of ivory , extending to about 4 ?
of arc , and subdivided to every 5 ' .
Opposite to each end of these divided extremities , were 243 placed three vertical hairs , at the distance of 1 ?
apart , and as near to them as could be without touching them .
The coincidence of these vertical lines , with the divisions on the white ground of the ivory behind , was observed with extreme distinctness by means of a compound microscope .
By this means , the subdivisions of 5 ' were again subdivided to single minutes , and by a mean of the six ( which constituted an observation ) , to within a few seconds .
The observations were commenced on the 5th of January 1829 , and carried on every hour , from 9h A.M. to 411 P.M. , to the 21st of the same month : during this period a maximum occurred in the westerly variation , at Ohl 30m P.M. nearly .
They were recommenced on the 24th of March following , and continued until the 31st , and the needle observed every half-hour , with a few exceptions , from 7h A.M. to 4h P.M. ; during this interval , the maximum occurred at about 1h 3O " P.M. , and the minimum at 911 30 " A.M. These results are obtained by taking the means of all the observations made at the same hour , and considering these means as representing the true variation at those hours .
They are contained in a Table at the end of the paper .
On the 1st of April , another series was commenced , and continued to the 15th .
They were made from 711 A.M. to 41 30m PoM .
, every half-hour , and as frequently during the night as could conveniently be done , considering the great labour and want of rest attending experiments of this nature , particularly as they were accompanied by corresponding observations of the times of vibration of another needle .
From these it appealrs that the maximum westerly variation takes place about Ih 45m P.M. ; from this period of the day , it gradually diminishes until about 10oh Om P.M. ; from about this time to about sun-rise , it is nearly stationary ; after this period a still further diminution takes place , and the minimum westerly variation happens at about 8h 45m A.M. , when it again increases to about 1h 45m P.M. , and reaches its maximum as before .
The difference between the mean maximum and minimum variation , or the mean amount of the diurnal movement of the needle , in April , was 10 ' 12 " .
During these observations , several oscillations , or tremulous motions in the needle were observed ; and as they are occasionally registered by others , I mention three days on which they were most apparent .
January 15 , 1829 , at 10oh 30mn A.M. , the north end of the needle moved to the westward about 2 ' 15 " in ten minutes ; the needle exceedingly tremulous ; from this period of the 244 day , it moved gradually back to the eastward until 3 P.M. , when it again moved suddenly 2 ' to the westward , and shortly afterwards back again to the eastward .
The mean variation on this day was less than usual .
On the 26th of March 1829 , at 311 P.M. , the needle was very tremulous , and on the 29th following , at 8h and 9h P.M. , oscillated considerably .
IV .
Experiments on the bases and edges of the craters of Vesuvius and Etna , and also on Gibraltar Rock and the neutral ground below .
It has been observed by Baron HUMBOLDT , in describing his experiments to determine the magnet dip , that the heights of the places of observation seem to have a sensible influence on the results ; and moreover , that the magnetic forces appear to be modified by the proximity of lavas .
He found at Cumana , the capital of New Andalusia , that the dip before the earthquake was invariably 430 ?
65 ( cent. div. ) ; but he was astonished to find three days after the violent shocks of earthquake , that it was no more than 420 ?
75 , and a year afterwards still 42 ?
080 , although the intensity of the magnetic forces had not varied the whole time .
With respect to the influence of height , he observes that BORDA is the only traveller who has compared in an accurate manner the dip at Santa Cruz with that determined at the top of the Peak of Teneriffe* , where he found it greater than at the bottom , which result Baron HUMBOLDT observes was exactly conformable to what he has several times obtained among the Andes ; and he suggests , that it probably depends upon some system of local attraction .
From whatever cause these differences proceed , wheter from the attraction of lavas containing iron ores , from the inflrence o height alone , or from both causes conjointly ; it is evident , that while such extraordinary discrepancies exist , either in the direction of the needle , or in the intensity of the force soliciting it , it will be impossible to reconcile the results of magnetical experiments by means of mathematical formulae .
With a view of observing these anomalies in experiments of this nature , as well as to gratify my own curiosity , I was induced to make similar ones on Vesuvius , Etna , aand Gibraltar Rock .
The experiments at Vesuvius indicate a remarkable difference in the variation , observed on the top and at the bottom .

12 25 By a great number of observations in the neighbourhood of Baia and Naples , the westerly variation , by the same instrument , was 15 ? ?
203 ' , differing 30 from that observed on the crater at the height of 3400 feet .
The magnetic force on the western edge of the crater was the same as that observed at Naples .
That observed half-way up the mountain , at the hermitage on the west side , was a little less .
Onthtatr the south-eastern edge o te crater of Etna , at the height of 11,000 feet , the westerly variation , by means of the sun 's azimuth , was 18 ? ?
35 ' west .
At Catania , on the southern foot of the mountain , it was 16 ? ?
28 ' ; and at Messina , on the north-eastern side , it was 170 12 ' , with the same instrument .
The magnetic force on the crater of Etna was much greater than either at Catania or at Messina , both with a horizontal needle , and one in the direction of the dipping needle .
At Gibraltar , the experiments on the summit , at the height of 1300 feet , indicate a greater intensity than on the neutral ground below ; though one of the needles , probably from some error of observation , appeared to give discordant results .
The different periods of vibration are given with the other experiments , in a Table , at the end of the paper .
246 Upon reviewing the observations made in different parts of the Mediterranean , contained in this paper , a great irregularity will be seen in the numerical results .
In proceeding from Malta to Naples , by way of Etna and Messina , it appears that an increase of the whole magnetic force took place in the first half of the distance , which we might have expected ; but from Messina to Vesuvius and Naples , a considerable diminution of the intensity was observed ; whereas , from their relative geographical positions , we might have concluded otherwise .
Upon the whole , as we proceed eastward as far as Constantinople , there appears to be a decrease in the intensities at places having the same dip , similar to what has been observed in the western hemisphere , if we except the observations at Naples and Vesuvius .
Whether these irregularities arise from any inequalities in the distribution of the terrestrial magnetism , or from any active agency of a volcanic nature , I dare hardly venture an opinion .
The deflections or deviations of the needle from the magnetic meridian , on the summits of Vesuvius and Etna , confirm the latter idea ; although , on the other hand , experiments made in several places in the neighbourhood of Vesuvius , from their near agreement with each other , indicate nothing of the kind .
It will not , however , appear very extraordinary that volcanic products should exert considerable influence on the needle , when we consider how very generally iron ores enter into the composition of the different lavas .
Upon submitting each specimen contained in a collection of lavas ( made by SALVADOR , the Vesuvian guide , ) to a light needle , suspended by a fibre of silk , I found that sixty-eight out of one hundred and twenty-four specimens exerted considerable influence upon it ; most of them attracting each end indiscriminately , while others had decisive features of distinct polarity .
Whether the difference between the intensity on the summit of Etna and that observed below , proceeds fromc the same cause , or from the influence of height alone , is alike difficult to determine .
