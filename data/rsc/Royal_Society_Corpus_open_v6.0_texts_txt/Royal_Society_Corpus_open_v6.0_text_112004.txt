sent them from my Sun-spot-ratios r in the same way that I had succeeded in doing with those obtained at numerous other stations ( see different Nos. of my " Mittheilungen fuber die Sonnenflecken " ) , and I obtained the formula vi=91 95+09056.r.+ 5. .
( I ) The comparison contained in the Table between the observed values and the values computed by formula ( I ) gave me , however , a strikingly less good accord than I had obtained for Munich , Prague , Christiania , &amp;c. and this induced me to try how it would be if I formed groups of the years " rich , " " medium , " and " poor " in sin-spots , and compared for each group the mean variation with the mean ratio .

It follows that the Greenwich observations also give on the whole a march corresponding to that of the sun-spots , but at the same time with materially greater deviations than appear in the continental stations which I have previously treated .
When I communicated to Professor Airy the unexpected resullt of my calculations , he called my attention to the circumstance that his variations were absolute ones , i. e. the means of the differences between the daily extremes , while the variations at other stations which I had employed were probably obtained from observations at definite hours ; and on my informing him that such was really the case , he gave me in addition the Means of the Declinations which corresponded at Greenwich to the prescribed hours of Gottingen time .
It is from these subsequently communicated values that I have derived the maxima and minima and their differences entered in the Table under v3 .
The calculation of the quantities in v ; then led me to make the formula v=-667+0039 . ?
;.(III ) and the comparison in the Table of the values computed by this formula with those derived from the observations does in fact show a much greater accord .
I was , however , further led to infer that the constaiits in the formula , which I had perceived to vary slowly with the lapse of time at other stations , must at Greenwich also have changed materially in the 17 years ( 1841-1857 ) , and thus I was finally led to construct the formula v2=6 66-0123(t1849 ) + [ 0038-OOO1(t-1849)].r , ( IV ) which , as the Table shows , suits very well with the observations .
For application to loniger periods it will still require some further modification , and , in particular ' , to be augmented by corrections from the term ( t1819)2 .
In conielusioni , I also comnputed the variations for the years 18158-1862 by all the four formulae , and have entered them in the Table for future comparison .
