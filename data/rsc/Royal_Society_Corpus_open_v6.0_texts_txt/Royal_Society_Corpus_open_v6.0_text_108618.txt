By the k-partitions of an r-gon , I mean the number of ways in which it can be divided by k-1 diagonals , of which none crosses another ; two ways being different only when no cyclical permutation or reversion of the numbers 12 3..r at the angles can make them alike : and by the k-partitions of an r-ace ( a pencil of r rays in space or a plane ) , I mean the number of ways in which it can be divided into k smaller pencils , by the introduction of k-1 connecting lines , of which none enclose a space ; two ways being different only when by no cyclical permutation or reversion of the numbers 12 3. .
r in the angular spaces of the r-ace they can be made identical .
The polygon here considered is the section of a pyramid , and its discussion includes that of the polyace .
The enumeration of the partitions of the polygon and polyace is indispensable in the theory of the polyedra .
In a memoir " On the x-edra which have an ( x-)-gonal base , and all their Summits Triedral , " in the Transactions of the Royal Society , 1856 , page 399 , I have investigated the ( r--)-partitions of the r-ace , or the r-gon ; for the number of x-edra there determined is exactly that of these ( r-2)-partitions .
What follows may be considered as a completion of the investigation in that memoir begun ; yet not properly a continuation , inasmuch as the results there obtained are here deduced by a different and more general method .
II .
A partition of an r-gon is reversible or irreversible : reversible , when it is symmetrical about a diameter or bisector of the figure , so that the configuration is unaltered by a semirevolution about that line , which is called an axis of reversion , of which axes there may be one or many ; and irreversible , when it is reversible about no axis .
An irreversible is about no axis its own reflexion .
An axis of reversion is always a bisector of the r-gon , and is agonal , monogonal , or diagonal , according as it passes through no angle , one angle only , or two angles of the r-gon ; and the polygon is said to be about that axis , agonally , monogonally , or diagonally reversible .
A diagonal axis may be drawn or undrawn ; a monogonal or agonal axis is always undrawn .
III .
A partition is said to be m-ly reversible when it has m axes of reversion .
The simple 2n-gon ( k=l ) is 2n-ly reversible , having n agonal and n diagonal axes ; and its sides may be so loaded with polygons , that this number of axes shall be either retained or diminished .
The simple ( 2n+1)-gon has 2n+1 monogonal axes , on which an r-gon may be built to have the same or a smaller number .
To help our conceptions , we may always suppose our r-gon regularly inscribed in a circle ; but it is evident that the syntypy of two identically-partitioned r-gons in no wise depends on such symmetry , but may remain after any distortion of either r-gon which does not change the angles on any diagonal .
So that , if we wish to build an r'-gon on an inscribed r-gon , we need not fear exceeding the limits of the circle by our additions , while we may suppose these all contained within it .
A partition is said to be m-ly irreversible , when it has an irreversible sequence of configuration m times repeated in the circuit of the r-gon .
This sequence will occupy r angles ; and , from whatever angle we begin to read , we shall see a sequence of sides m irreversible , such that through the mid-point of it no axis of reversion can be drawn .
Obs. 1 .
Hence a 2m-ly irreversible has an irreversible sequence , simple if m=l , and m-ple if m &gt; l , occupying half the circuit of the r-gon ; but a ( 2m+l)-ly irreversible has no repeated sequence occupying half its circuit .
IV .
THEOREM A. Every reversible ( 1+k)-partition of an r-gon has two reversible sequences of configuration which are bisected by alternate and equidistant axes of reversion , and has not more than two , whatever be the number of these axes .
For , first , let there be only one axis of reversion in the r-gon : there must be two aspects of configuration observable from opposite ends of that axis , otherwise the figure would be reversible about a perpendicular to that axis , i. e. there would be two axes , contrary to hypothesis .
Secondly , let there be more axes of reversion than one ; any axis .
a bisects an aspect A , because the figure is unchanged by a semirevolution about that axis ; and the axis b next in order to a along the circumference bisects an aspect B. This B is different from A ; for if not , the series of configurations read from a to b will be that read from b to a , and there will be either a vertex or a side centrally placed between a and b , having on both sides the same aspect , or an axis of reversion can be drawn between a and b ; but b is the next in order to a , which is absurd ; therefore B is not A. Now b bisecting the aspect B must have the axial termination a at the same distance on either side of it , and for the same reasons a must have the axial termination b at the same distance on either side of it ; so that the terminations of the axes must recur at equal distances in the order..a bab a ... bisecting the aspects. .
ABA B. .
And this series of aspects has as many terms as there are axial terminations , viz. 4m terms , if the number of axes is even , and 4m+2 if it be odd .
Wherefore no aspect different from A and B can be bisected by any axis , and A and B , different reversible aspects or sequences , are bisected by alternate equidistant axes .
Q. E. D. We may call A and B the two axial configurations .
V. Obs. 2 .
A reversible partition of the r-gon having more than one axis of reversion , : has both reversible and irreversible sequences repeated in the circuit of the r-gon , which occupy an interval equal to that between alternate axes ; those being reversible sequences which begin and end with a side or angle carrying an axial termination , and those being irreversible which begin and end at any other side or angle .
Obs. 3 .
But a singly reversible partition has no sequence repeated in the circuit of the r-gon ; for if it had a repeated sequence reversible as read from no point , the r-gon would not be reversible ; and if it had a reversible sequence repeated in the circuit of the r-gon , it would not be singly reversible .
Obs. 4 .
A 2m-ly reversible r-gon , if r &gt; 2m , has beginning at any angle of the r-gon which is not the termination of an axis , an irreversible sequence , simple , if m=l , and m-ple , if m &gt; 1 , occupying half the circuit of the r-gon , and repeated in the other half .
VI .
THEOREM B. When the number of axes of reversion is odd in any partitioned r-gon , none is perpendicular to another ; and when that number is even , every one is perpendicular to some other .
For when the number is odd , there is on each side of any one a an equal number of terminations of other axes , all equidistant from a and from each other .
And when that number is even , there is an odd number there of such terminations .
Whence the truth of the proposition is evident .
VII .
THEOREM C. When the axes of reversion are odd in any partitioned r-gon , each one bisects both axial configurations ; and when they are even in number , each bisects but one , read on it alike at either end , and half the axes carry one , and half the other , axial configuration .
This is very evident from what is proved in Theorem A , that the axial configurations present themselves alternately upon the axes in order .
Cor. 1 .
If there be both agonal and diagonal axes , there is an equal number of each kind ; and , as this number is even or odd , so is each axis perpendicular to one of its own or of the other kind .
Obs. 5 .
A ( 2m+1)-ly reversible partition never has an irreversible sequence occupying half the circuit of the r-gon and repeated in the other half ; for this would require that every axis of reversion should carry the same configuration at both ends , which are points in those two sequences .
VIII .
THEOREM D. If a diagonal be perpendicular to at axis of reversion in any h-ly reversible r-gon , it is one of a system of not fewer than h diagonals symmetrically placed about the centre .
And all diagonals not perpendicular to that axis form pairs making each an angle bisected by that axis , or that produced .
For if h be odd , every axis carries the same perpendicular ; and if h be even , at least Lh axes carry that perpendicular on opposite sides of the centre ; and these axes are equidistant from each other : whence the first part of the theorem is evident .
The second part follows from the definition of an axis of reversion .
Cor. The intersection of two produced diagonals equidistant from the centre , in any reversibly partitioned r-gon , is upon an axis of reversion .
IX .
THEOREM E. NO ( 2m+1)-gon has an agonal or diagonal , and no ( 2m)-gon has a monogonal , axis of reversion .
For a monogonal axis must have an equal number of vertices of the r-gon on each side of it , besides the vertex through which it passes ; hence r is odd .
And a diagonal axis must have an equal number of vertices on either side , besides the two through which it passes .
And an agonal axis , which passes through no angles , must have an equal number of vertices on either side .
Hence , in these two latter cases , r is even .
X. TIIEOREM F. If one axis of reversion is monogonal in a partitioned r-gon , all its axes of reversion are monogonal and odd in number .
For r is odd , and the r-gon cannot have either a diagonal or an agonal axis ; and as each axis bisects two aspects , A and B , A must be opposite to B in the circle..ABABAB. .
of axial configurations ; i. e. the number of its terms is 2(2h+ 1 ) , wherec fore the axes are odd in number .
XI .
THEOREM G. If there be a drawn axis of reversion , a , in a ( 1l+k)-partitioned r-gon , there cannot be more than one other axis .
If there be another , b , it is undrawn , and perpendicular to the former , a , and is either agonal or diagonal , as r=4m+2 , or r=4m .
For , if there be a second axis , b , it cannot meet the drawn one , and must be undrawn .
And all the k diagonals are symmetrically placed about or upon this b ; therefore a , meeting it and bisecting it in the centre of the r-gon , meets it at right angles ; otherwise ( Theorem D ) two diagonals would meet b in the centre , which is impossible .
And no line besides b can so meet a ; wherefore a and b are the only axes .
As a is not a monogonal axis , neither is b ( Theorem F ) .
If r=4m , a has on either side an even number of sides of the r-gon , and b , bisecting that system , is diagonal ; if r=4m+2 , a has on either side an odd number of sides of the r-gon bisected by b , which is therefore an agonal axis .
Q. E. D. XII .
THEOREM H. If there be more than one undrawn axis of reversion in a partitioned r-gon , the r-gon is built regularly on a polygonal tnucleus ( Q ) , which is reversible about all the axes of reversion of the r-gon , and has no drawn diagonal .
For consider the symmetry of the r-gon about any one of its axes , a , which are all undrawn ( Theorem G ) .
We see , on each side of a , f marginal faces , limited each by one diagonal d and certain sides of the r-gon , the 2f diagonals d forming pairs making angles bisected by a. Let these 2f faces be erased : the 2f lines d are now sides of an r'-gon ( r ' &lt; r ) , which is still reversible about a , for the symmetry about a is not disturbed by the erasures .
This r'-gon has also 2f marginal faces which can be erased , leaving an r"-gon ( r " &lt; r ' ) still reversible about a ; and thus by erasure of all the pairs of faces about a , the r-gon will be finally reduced to a polygon P , having no diagonals but what are bisected at right angles by a ( Theorem D ) .
Let Q be that portion of P which contains the centre of the r-gon , and Q , , Qg , &amp;c. the remaining portions of P limited by perpendiculars to a. Then Q has evidently no diagonals .
Next consider the symmetry of the r-gon about any other axis b. We can reduce it by erasure of pairs of faces about b to a polygon P ' , consisting of a portion Q ' about the centre and having no diagonals , and of portions limited by diagonals perpendicular to b. Q and Q ' are polygons about the centre having no diagonals ; they are therefore one !
polygon Q. The polygons Q , , Q2 , the remaining portions of P , have disappeared in the erasure of pairs of faces about b and Q ; that is , every one of them , Qm , is one of a set of two or more faces standing symmetrically about Q. Therefore Q is a nucleus , reversible about all the axes of the r-gon , free from diagonals , and having everything arranged symmetrically about it in the r-gon .
Q. E. D. XIII .
TIHEOREM K. If there be no axis of reversion in a partitioned r-gon except one undrawn , a , the figure is built symmetrically about a and about a polygonal nucleus P , which has either no diagonals , or only what are at right angles to a. This is established by the former part of the preceding demonstration .
But the polygon P , in this singly reversible r-gon , if it has diagonals perpendicular to the axis , is not properly a nucleus ; nor is there any reason why one portion of it , Q , should be called a nucleus rather than Q1 or Q2 ; for P can be constructed by loading opposite sides of any of them with proper polygons .
But if P is a simple polygon , it is properly the nucleus of the figure , which is made by loading opposite sides of it , on different sides of the axis , with the same polygons , thus preserving the reversibility about the axis .
XIV .
THEOREM L. If a diagonal axis of the ntucleus is an axis of reversion of the r-gon , it is a diagonal axis thereof .
For it passes through two angles of the r-gon .
THEOREM M. An agonal axis of the r-gon is an agognal axis of the nucleus .
For a diagonal or monogonal axis of the nucleus passes through a vertex of the r-gon , and cannot be an agonal axis of it .
THEOREM N. If an agonal axis of the nucleus is an axis of the r-gon , it may be an agonal , or a diagonal , or a monogonal axis of it .
For the sides of the nucleus through which that agonal axis passes may be sides of the r-gon , or they may be loaded with agonally reversible polygons having the same agonal axis : this will then be an agonal axis of the r-gon .
Or those sides may be loaded both with monogonally reversible polygons , having their axes in prolongation of that agonal axis : this makes it a diagonal axis of the r-gon .
Or one of those sides may be loaded with a monogonally reversible polygon , and the other either not at all , or with an agonally reversible : this , if the axes of the imposed polygon are in direction with that agonal axis , makes it a monogonal axis of the r-gon .
XV .
TIIEOREM 0 .
A monogonal axis of the nucleus may be either a monogonal or ca diagonal axis of the r-gon .
For the side of the nucleus which that axis bisects may be unloaded , or loaded with an agonally reversible polygon , so as to make it a monogonal axis of the r-gon .
Or that side can be loaded with a monogonally reversible polygon , so as to make the axis a diagonal one of the r-gon .
It is easily seen , and unnecessary to be formally propounded , how and how far the converses of these latter propositions are to be laid down .
Def. A clear axis of reversion meets no diagonal at right angles .
A scored or loaded axis of reversion meets one or more diagonals at right angles .
An e-scored axis of reversion meets e diagonals at right angles , of course bisecting them .
The clear and the loaded axis are both supposed undrawn .
XVI .
THEOREM P. If a clear axis of a ( 2m+3)-ly reversible r-gon be scored in any way by e diagonals at right angles to it , the r-gon becomes singly reversible about that scored axis .
For , let ABC. .
be the axes of reversion of the r-gon N. The scored axis A remains an axis of reversion , because the symmetry about is not disturbed by the perpendicular scores ; but none of the other axes BC ... is perpendicular to A ( Theorem B ) ; wherefore each meets singly all the scores upon A , and is no axis of reversion ( Theorem D ) of the scored r-gon N ' .
Let then , M , any other diameter of N ' not amongst ABC ... be an axis of reversion ; it meets all the diagonals to which it is not perpendicular in pairs whose angles it bisects ( Theorem D ) ; wherefore these are pairs of equidistants from the centre ; now the intersections of all these , except the newly-added scores upon A , are on the axes BC ... ( Cor. Theorem D ) ; wherefore M , passing through the centre and one of these intersections , is one of the lines ABC ... , contrary to hypothesis , which is absurd .
Therefore A is the only axis of reversion of N ' .
Q. E. D. XVII .
THEOREM Q. If any loaded axis ( A ) of a ( 2m+3)-ly reversible r-gon ( N ) be cleared by erasure of the diagonals perpendicular to A , the cleared figure ( N ' ) is singly reversible about that axis A. For , let ABC ... be the axes of reversion of N , on which are the diagonals at right angles to them abc ... forming a system of lines symmetrically placed about the centre ( Theorem D ) .
No one of these B , after the erasure of a from A , is an axis of reversion of N ' , because the diagonal b at right angles to B is not one of a system of lines symmetrically placed about the centre ( Theorem D ) .
Let then , M , any other diameter of N ' be an axis of reversion of N ' ; this line meets all the diagonals of N ' not perpendicular to it in pairs , whose angles it bisects , wherefore these pairs are equidistants from the centre of N ' ; but all the intersections of these pairs lie on the lines ABC ... ( Cor. Theorem D ) ; wherefore M is one of these lines ABC ... Q. E. A. Therefore A is the only axis of reversion of N ' .
Q. E. D. XVIII .
THEOREM R. If a clear axis ( A ) of reversion of a 2m-ly reversible partitioned r-gon ( N ) be scored by perpendiculars to it symmetrically about the centre , the figure is not made singly reversible about ( A ) ; but if it be so scored unsymmetrically about the centre , the scoredfigyure ( N ' ) is singly reversible about that axis ( A ) .
For there is an axis perpendicular to A ( Theorem B ) about which the symmetry is not disturbed by symmetric scores , i. e. pairs of parallels to it equidistant from the centre , or a diameter parallel with such pairs .
But when the scores are not such pairs , or a diameter and such pairs , the axis perpendicular to A is no axis of reversion evidently ; nor is any other diameter of N ' , for it meets all those scores singly .
Wherefore A is the only axis of reversion of N ' .
Q. E. D. XIX .
THEOREM S. If a clear axis A of a singly reversible partitioned r-gon N ' be scored by diagonals perpendicular to it , the scored figure N becomes sometimes singly , and at other times ( 2m+ 3)-ly reversible about the scored axis .
For the r-gon N ' being singly reversible has no axis of reversion perpendicular to A ; and no addition of diagonals parallel to the perpendicular diameter can make it an axis of reversion ; for that addition cannot alter its intersections with the diagonals of N ' ; wherefore N is not 2m-ly reversible ( Theorem D and B ) .
If N ' should be the N ' of Theorem Q , and the scores upon A should be those erased in that theorem , N will be the ( 2m+3)-ly reversible of that theorem : but if this is not the case in both these conditions , N will remain , like N ' unscored , singly reversible about A , since the scores do not disturb the symmetry about that axis .
Q. E. D. What precedes about singly reversibles with loaded axes is sufficient for our present purpose , which is to show that before we can determine the number of singly reversibles , with clear and loaded axes , it is necessary that we should know the number of ( 2m+1)-ly reversible ( l+k-e)-partitions of the r-gon which have a clear axis , i. e. which have clear axes ; for here the configurations about all the axes are alike ( Theorem C ) ; and also that of the 2m-ly reversible ( 1+k-e)-partitioned r-gons which have one configuration about clear axes , and also of those which have both their configurations about clear axes .
This matter will be more evident as we proceed .
XX .
Let R2^agd(r , k ) , , Rhag(r , k ) , , R^di(r , k)n , Rhm ?
( r , k)n denote the whole number of ( l+k)-partitioned r-gons built on the n-gonal nucleus ( &gt; 2 ) , which have ( Theorem C ) R2.agdi(r , k)n , h agonal and h diagonal , Rh.ag ( r , k ) .
, h agonal only , Rh.di ( r , k)w , h diagonal only , and Rha^m ( r , k ) , , h monogonal axes only , of reversion .
We shall denote those having all their axes clear by c subscript to R ; those having no clear axes by zero subscript to R ; those of the second and third classes which have half their axes , bearing one configuration , clear , by 1c subscript , and those of the first , which have half their axes clear , the agonal or the diagonal ones , by ac or dc subscript to R. We write hagdi(r , k)R=h agdi(r k)+Ea a a9i(r , +R ( r , k9Xi(r , k ) , , Rh ag ( r , k)n= ag ( r , k ) , +Rheag ( r , k)n+Rohag ( r , k ) , , R^.dZ ( r , k)-=Rh i ( r , k)f+R^di ( r , k)f+Ro d ' ( r , k ) , Rh^o ( r , k)n=-Rh ?
( r , k)n+RS^'no ( r , k)n .
In the second and third lines the second subclass is of course nothing when h is odd .
In the fourth class the number of axes of reversion is always odd .
And in all those equations we suppose n4c3 .
Before we can proceed to investigate formulae for the determination of these numbers , it is necessary , Problem a. Tofind the k-divisions of the r-gon or r-ace .
By the ( l+k)-divisions of an r-gon I mean the entire number of ways in which k diagonals can be drawn in it , none crossing another , all ways being different which occupy different angles 1 2..r of the r-gon .
Thus there are five 3-divisions , but only one 3-partition of the pentagon made by drawing a pair of diagonals .
And there are five 3-divisions of a pentace made by breaking it into three triaces , but these are all the same 3-partition .
If we call the number sought of ( 1-+k)-divisions of the r-gon D(r , k ) , we can express it in terms of D(r ' , k ' ) , r ' &lt; r , and k ' &lt; k. For consider any diagonal b , drawn from any angle 3 of the r-gon , dividing it into a ( 3+h)-gon and a ( r-h---)-gon .
This line b will be drawn in the ( l+k)-divisions along with every ( l+s)-division of the ( 3 +h)-gon , combined with every ( ks)-division of the ( r-h--l)-gon , e diagonals being drawn on one side , and k--E 1 diagonals on the other side of b. That is , ,D(3+h , )X D(r-h-1 , k-s-1 ) taken from s=0 to s=k--1 , is the number of ( 1 +k)-divisions in which that line b will be seen .
If , now , we give to h every value from h= 0 to h=r4 ; we shall have counted every ( 1 +k)-division in which any line b appears that can be drawn from that angle j3 .
If we put for p each of the r angles in succession , that is , if we multiply by r , we shall have enumerated every ( 1+k)-division in which any line b appears , that is drawn from any angle 3 .
But we have thus handled twice , once from either extremity , every line in every set of k diagonals ; that is , we have counted every ( 1+k)-division 2k times .
Wherefore the correct result is 2k.D(r , k)=r.2,2e{D(3+4 , s).D(r-A-1 , k-s-1 ) } where every value of h from h=O to h=r-4 is to be combined with every value of s from , s=0 to s=k--1 .
If , then , we know these divisions for all values of r and k up to D(r-1 , k-1 ) , we obtain D(r , k ) by addition .
And as D(r+0)=l , and D(r , 1 ) =1r .
( r3 ) , D(r , 2 ) is given , and thence D(r , 3 ) , and so on , up to D(r , c ) , for any given values of r and k. XXII .
To find D(r , k ) in terms of r , for the general value of r , and for a given value of k , we write D(r , k)=Ar2k+Brk-'+. .
+Lr+M ; for we know that this number is not greater than { ( r.(r3))}ki- ' x IF+1- , that of all possible sets of k diagonals that cross or not .
Then , from the 2k+1 equations , D( k+3 , k)=A( k+-3)2k+-B( k+3)2k-l. .
+M , D( k+4 , k)=A( k+4)2k+B( k+4)2k+l+. .
+M , D(3k-+3 , k)=A(3k+3)2k+B(3k+ 3)2k+l +. .
+M , the left members of which are to be calculated by the preceding article , we can determine the coefficients A , B,. .
LM .
So far as I have pursued the inquiry , I find always one factorial form of the function D(r , k ) ; but in order to prove that this is always the form , it is necessary to show that , if ( 3+h ) , ~ ' ( 3+h-e-2)eI , ari D(3+h , x -2 and D( , r-.h-1 , k-- ) -(r---'-1 ( r-h-k+- ' rkIl ( r --k-2)kl ' D(rj k ) = 7(jD(3+h , ).D(r-h-l , { k-D--l ))1--}-= x ~ , _ from h=O to h=_r-4 , and from s-=O to s=k -1 ; which is the expression that I continually find .
This summation I must leave to the learned and industrious reader ; but , meanwhile , I shall venture to enunciate with the best demonstration , such as it is , that occurs to me , the following THEOREM T. The number of ( 1 +k)-divisions of an r-gon , i. e. of all the ways in which k diagonals can be drawn in it , none crossing another , is D(r , k~ ) =J ( r-k-2)kkl fk+2X k(kTi For first , let the r-gon be divided into triangles , i. e. let k=r-3 .
Here the ( 3+h)gon of the'preceding article can have only h diagonals , or g=h ; and the final result , the last equation of that article , becomes D(r , r--3)=2(r ) .
, { D(3+h , h).D(r-h-1 , r--h-4 ) } , from h-0 to h=r--4 , Hence we obtain for r=4 , r=5 , r=6 , &amp;c. , 44-31 D(4 , 1)=I.D(3 , 0).D(3 , 0)=2=4 , , ( 5 2)i { D(O)(41)+ f4-)I O ) } D(5 , 2)=5 .
{ D(3 , 0).D(4 , 1)+D(4 , 1).D(3 , 0 ) } 55-311 =5= 15-l D(6 , 3)=-{D(3 , 0)D(5 , 2)+D(4 , 1).D(4 , 1)+D(5 , 2)(D3 , 0 ) } 66-311 14= D(7 , 4)=-{D(3 , 0)D(6 , 3)+D(4 , 1)D(5 , 2)+D(5 , 2)D(4 , 1)+D(6 , 3).D(3 , 0 ) } =7{14+10+1014 } =42 77-311 and as we have demonstrated that D(8 , 5 ) is a sum of products of these continuous MDcCCLVII .
2 H functions , it is a continuous function , and has a permanent form : wherefore it is sufficiently evident that rr-311 D(r , r-3)= i. We know that D(r , k)= O , if k &gt; 0 , for every value of r from r=3 to r=k2 ; for no ( k--2)-gon has k diagonals none crossing another .
Hence ( r-k--2)1kl is a factor of D(r , k ) .

THEOREM U. Every m-ly irreversible kpartition of an r-gon occurs 2r:m times among the k-divisions , and every m-ly reversible k-partition of it is found r : m times among the k-divisions .
For any mn-ly irreversible k-partition has a different configuration about r : m successive angles ( III .
) , and is nowhere its own reflexion ; so that r:n more configurations the reflexions of the former are read on the reversed face of the r-gon .
And as all these configurations are found among the k-divisions separately enumerated about the same angle , this partition is counted 2r : m times among them .
And any m-ly reversible k-partition of the r-gon has r : m different configurations in the interval between the termination of any axis A and its repetition , that is , about r : m angles if A be an agonal axis , and about r : m sides if it be diagonal .
The central configuration of these r : m is about the axis alternate with A ; the others form pairs of configurations reflecting each other .
All these are constructed and counted separately among the k-divisions about the same point of the r gon ; ie .
this partition is counted r : m times among the k-divisions .
Q. E. D. Let Rm(r , k ) denote the entire number of m-ly reversible ( 1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon about all nuclei , and all kinds of axes , and let I(r , k ) stand for the complete number of m-ly irreversible ( I +k)-partitions .
The theorem U may be thus expressed : D(r , k ) = rRm(r , k ) + 2r(r , k ) } or , ( m &gt; 0 ) , L , * 2r.I(r , k)=D(r )n ( r , k)+2 I(r , ) which shows that , if we can find R !
( r , k ) and I+'(r , k ) for all values of m &gt; 0 , we can obtain the most numerous of all the classes , I(r , k ) , by a simple subtraction and division .
XXIV .
Our first step towards the actual solution of our problem of partitions , which , after all these tedious prolegomena , we may now think of taking , is to find the numbers in ( XX .
) .
We begin with 2zhagdi(r , h ; nI h. agd Rfg2adj(r .
k ) + ]R2 .
agdi(r , k ) -R2^agdi( kk ) R^ , ( r , k)=R .
( r , k~)+a r )+ '(r , +R0'( , )O Problem b. To find R^ gdi(r , k ) .
, the number of ( 1 -k)-partitioned r-gons , built on the n-gonal nucleus , and having h agonal and h diagonal axes of reversion , all clear .
There are , in every one of these , 2h equidistant terminations of diagonal axes , between nn which intervene h sides of the n-gon ; the central side of these h is bisected by an agonal axis , wherefore -2 is an odd number .
If we mark this central side as the nth of the n-gon , we see on either side of it i( -1 ) sides between it and a termination of a diagonal axis .
This nth side is one of 2h equidistant sides of the n-gon , bisected by terminations of agonal axes , namely the n 2n 3n nth sides , 2h ' 2h ' 2 ' " ' which are all unloaded , being sides both of the r-gon and the n-gon .
The 2 ( ^- ) sides on either side of the nth are loaded , the first and ( n-l)th with a certain el-partitioned ( 2+a^)-gon , so as to form a configuration bisected by the agonal axis between them ; the second and ( n-2)th by a e2-partitioned ( 2+ac)-gon placed in like reversible manner , and so on ; in such a way as to satisfy the equations following , r=n+4h(+a+^ ... ... +a ) ; .
( A. ) k=n-2A+4A(e1+e2+.* the ( 2+a))-gon , must make up the r summits of the r-gon .
And , supposing that a everywhere &gt; 0 , the n-2h loaded sides of the n-gon , with the em diagonals of every ( 2-+am)-gon 4h times laid on , must make up the k diagonals of the r-gon .
And if a.-=O , in which case the mth and ( n--m)th sides of the n-gon are unloaded , whereby 4h ides besdes the 2 above-mentioned rema ides common to the r-gon and the n-goi , the appearance of em=-l corrects the error made by counting those 4h sides for diagonals of the r-gon , and the second equation still remains true , however many of the numbers a , , a2 , &amp;c. =O0 .
But these equations are impossible , and Ragdi(r , k ) , = 0 , unless r-n , n-2h , and k-n+-2h are all multiples of 4h .
Consider any single solution of the equation ( A. ) , and let N be an r-gon bearing , on the wnth side everywhere reckoned in both directions from the one bisected by an agonal axis , a ( 2-+am)-gon having em diagonals .
Whatever be the posture of those em diagonals , and whatever be the character of the ( 2-+a , )-gon , the figure is reversible at least about h agonal and h diagonal axes .
And let C be the configuration read in N about the agonal axis through the nth side of the n-gon .
XXVI .
Let , next , any disturbance be made in the arrangement of the em diagonals in one or more of these imposed 4--f polygons , so that the reversible character about the 2h axes be preserved , and the diagonals of the ( 2+am)-gon on both sides of any axis shall form pairs making angles bisected by the intervening axis of reversion .
The solution before us of ( A. ) being undisturbed in both values and order of the numbers a , e , , a2 e , &amp;c. , we can combine every ( 1l+em)-division of the ( 2+am)-gon in the interval with every ( 1-+e)-division of the ( 2+a , )-gon , &amp;c. ; that is , we can make C take D(2+a , , e , ).D(2+a2 , e2 ) .
, D(2+a3 , e ) ... D(2+afn,2 , en-2 ==An-2h 4h 4h 4h different forms , by mere variation of arrangement of diagonals , the same variation being made about every agonal axis , and consequently the same variation occurring about every diagonal axis .
Of these An-2h configurations no two can be alike ; for the intervals of 4h n--2h 4sides between two adjoining axes are irreversible configurations , if we look at the axes which limit them , because one is an agonal and the other a diagonal axis ; so that , in fact , no disturbance of one or more diagonals of N can produce N ' a repetition of N. If the limiting axes were alike , it might possibly occur that N ' should be a reflexion of N , the configuration of one read from right to left in the interval being that of the other read from left to right .
It is to be observed here , and in all products that we may handle of the form of An-2h , that when am=O0 and consequently e , = =-1 , D(2+a , , em ) is either to be omitted , or counted unity , so that AO is always =1 .
XXVII .
Next , let us make a variation in our solution of equation ( A. ) , either by altering two or more values of a , a2 .
or of el e2. .
or of both ; or by exchanging the places of certain values without altering them .
It is evident that C ' , the result of such ]-ACE .
229 disturbance of the solution , must differ from every C that we have before regarded about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon ; for it has no longer the same polygons in the same places of the interval between the axes .
We have either changed the order of the imposed polygons , or we have in certain places put a ( l+ep)-partitioned ( 2+a)-gon which was not employed in the construction of C , for a ( 1l+em)-partitioned ( 2 +a )-gon , which was .
NVhatever be the solution we work from , we shall be able to produce from it , by mere disturbances of diagonals in the imposed polygons , A-2h distinct configura4h tions , all different from the An-2 counted before ; and all the r-gons thus produced will 4h have the property of being reversible about h agonal and h diagonal axes .
And it is evident , that every configuration about an agonal axis of any ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gon , having h agonal and h diagonal axes of reversion , will be produced from some solution of equations ( A. ) , and some arrangement of diagonals in the imposed polygons .
If , then , we denote by l. An-2h the sum of the products An-2h made from every solution of equations ( A. ) , every change , either in value or order , of a , e , a , e , &amp;c. being counted as a solution , we find that AN-2A_h , many terms of which will be equal numbers , 4h is the exact number of configurations about an agonal axis which can be seen on any ( 1-+k)-partitioned r-gon having h agonal and h diagonal clear axes of reversion .
Now no ago-diagonally reversible has two configurations about agonal axes ; and every ( l+k)-partitioned r-gon having ih agonal and ih diagonal axes , is reversible about h agonal and h diagonal axes , whatever positive number i may be ; for it has h equidistant agonal axes , and between every pair of these ( i1 ) more agonal axes , and it has h diagonal axes , because iht diagonal axes bisect the angles between the ih agonal ones .
Hence it follows that Z A/ n-2^h= 2FiRadt(fr , k ) , 4h .
n-2ih r-n k--n+2ih where i is every whole number giving 4ih , and --positiveintegers ; conditions necessary to the existence of equations ( A. ) .
XXVIII .
Consequently ( i &gt; 0 ) , aKgdi(r , k)n=-n-2A.(i)h.ae ( r , d , k ) 4h for all values of ( i+ 1)h=h ' , which make n-2h ' , r--n , and all multiples of 4h ' .
As r &gt; n , n-2h &gt; 0 in equations ( A. ) ; hence n &lt; z6h , and if 2h &gt; n , R==0 ; i.e. agdi Rn .
agdi ( r , k)n=R 2 , ( r , k =0 .
If n=6h , the equations ( A. ) become 2n r-n =3 a , 2n 2n k-=-e , Thus it is evident that we can register IRh.adi(r , k ) , , from h= to h=l , for all values that make r-n , n--2h , and k-n+2h , multiples of 4h .
For a simple and complete example , to be carried out through all our investigation , we may take the partitions of the octagon .
Here we are to seek Rhgdi(8 , k ) , .
Evidently n &lt; 8 ( if k &gt; 0 ) , and =6 or =4 .
When n=6 , 61 , the only value , gives h=l , and R2agdi(8 , k)=O0 whatever be k , 8-6 because is not integer .
h4 2h When n=4 , 4hhas no integer value &gt; 0 ; wherefore , since r &gt; n , R2"gdi(8 , k)4=0 , for all values of k. Hence R2^agdi(8 , k)=0 , whatever be the nucleus , except that Ragdi(8 , 0)8=1 ( art .

XXIX .
Problem c. To find R2hagdi(r , k)n , the number of ( 1 +k)-partitioned r-gons , built on an n-gonal nucleus , having h loaded agonal , and h clear diagonal , axes of reversion .
The investigation to be made differs from that in the five preceding articles in that the 2h sides of the n-gon , bisected by the agonal axes , are all loaded with a certain ( 1+s)-partitioned ( 4+2co)-gon Ao , having at least one agonal axis of reversion ( Theorem G. ) .
This must be so posited that its agonal axis shall be in a line with that of the n-gon ( Theorem N. ) , and must be placed alike on the 2h equidistant sides , since all agonal axes of the r-gon must bisect the same configuration at each end ( Theorem C. ) .
The remaining sides of the n-gon may be loaded , the mth from A0 , with any ( 1 +em)-partitioned ( or divisioned ) ( 2 +a)-gon so as to form a figure reversible about the 2h axes , and so that the equations following be satisfied:r==n+2h(2+2ao)+4h(al+a2+. .
+ an-2h ) } 4/ ' ^ ... ... ( Al .
) k=n+2Aso+4A+(eJe2+..-Le-2 ) ; where a , mO , emam-1 ; andem= - , if am=0 ; the numbers oco and So being any that we may select from our register of polygons having at least one agonal axis , which is supposed complete for values of ( 2+2c%o ) not greater rta n 2k than -k ' All that is said of the loading of the 4sides between the axes , and about the import and necessity of equations ( A. ) , applies to equations ( A ' .
) .
The sides being thus loaded , we have an r-gon which has only clear diagonal axes , and .
is reversible about 2h equidistant and alternate agonal and diagonal axes .
Leaving now the 2h agonally reversible ( -1 2ao)-gons undisturbed , we can vary the positions of the diagonals , exactly as in ( XXVI .
) , so as to produce about the agonal axis through the nth side of the r-gon D(2+a1 , el).D(2+a , e ) ... D(2+a-2h , en ^2h)= -2\ 4-h 4/ 4h different configurations , the numbers a , e , , &amp;c. here being those of a solution of equations ( A ' .
) .
And every one of these may be varied again by changing the posture of the ( 4+2c0)-gon , if it has a second configuration about an agonal axis , so that this axis shall come into a line with that of the n-gon , or by exchanging the ( 4+2ao)-gon for any other that is also ( 1+o0)-partitioned and has an agonal axis .
The number of variations in our power by disturbance of the ( 4+2a0)-gons alone , is 2 , { 2Rmag(4+2c.0 , o ) +R2mad }(4 + 20o g , ) =}H , because each m-agonally reversible has two configurations about agonal axes and thus admits of two postures , while each ago-diagonally reversible has only one ; whatever be the number m of agonal axes ( Theorem A. ) .
Thus we see , that for every solution of equations ( A ' .
) that we can write down , all values and orders of the numbers counting in the solution , we can make H. An-2h 4A1 different configurations about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon .
The proof that there are no two of them alike need not be repeated here from art .
XVI .
If then EH .
A_2 4h denote the sum of those products EHA made from every solution of equations ( A ' .
) , this number is that of the r-gons ( 1 +k)-partitioned , and having h agonal and A diagonal axes of reversion , the latter only being clear axes , which are constructible on the n-gonal nucleus .
This is shown exactly as in art .
XXVII .
And by the reasoning of that article we obtain .
H. An-2h_ =iR2hi .
agdi(r , k ) , , 4h hi being any number A ' such that n-2h ' r--n--2h.(2+2ao ) k-n--2h%o 4h ' 4hand 4h ' are positive integers , for some values of a , and e that are found in our register of ( 1+so)-partitioned ( 2+2ao)-gons , having an agonal axis of reversion .
Hence ( i &gt; 0 ) , R'gdr , jk)=.EII .

The highest value of h in equations ( A ' .
) gives 4h =0 , or 2h=n .
In this case Ao is the only imposed polygon , and the equations ( A ' .
) become r-3n k-n 2aon , n0nn -nT-^r+~ k-n + jn k -.n m{ ( -n n )+ ( -n n ) } which =0 of course if the fractions are irreducible , or if no such values are in our register of reversible polygons with an agonal axis .
An-2h=Ao is here to be considered 4h Problem d. To find RKa di(r , k ) , , the number of ( l+k)'partitioned r-gomn built on an n-gonal nucleus , to have h loaded diagonal and h clear agonal axes of reversion .
All the axes are agonal axes of the nucleus ( Theorems M , N ) .
There are 2h unloaded sides , carrying the agonal axes , and midway between each pair of these , a side loaded with a ( 1 + )-partitioned ( 3+2a !
)-gon , having at least one monogonal axis ( Theorem N ) , n 3n 2h-1I which is laid alike on the nth , T4th , t ... -nth sides of the nucleus ; ac and a. being 4h 4h numbers selected from our register of monogonally reversibles .
And on the mth side , counted from the unloaded one in both directions , is laid any ( l+em)-partitioned ( 2 +am)-gon , once in every interval between an agonal and a diagonal axis .
The equations to be satisfied are r=n +4h(al+a2+..+an-4+2h(2++1 ( A " .

XXV .
These cannot exist unless r-n-2/ 2i a+1 ) and k-n-2h(a.-1 are divisible by 4h .
Every r-gon constructed by loading the sides of the n-gon as above described will be ( 1+k)-partitioned and reversible about h clear agonal and h loaded diagonal axes .
Leaving now undisturbed the ( 3+2Mn)-gons , we can change the arrangements of dia4h gonals in the ( 2-+al)-gon , ( 2+a2)-gon , &amp;c. in D(2+a1 , e , ).D(2+a,2 e2 , )..D(2+n , -4h , en-4h = An-4h 4h 4h 4h different ways , without altering at all our solution of equations ( A " .
) .
And we can combine each of these arrangements of diagonals with every ( I+s )-partitioned ( 3+2an)-gon in our list of monogonally reversibles , of which there are M= 2Rmm70(3+2n , 6 n ) ; 4h 4h so that the entire number of ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gons , having not fewer than h clear agonal and h loaded diagonal axes , constructible from a single solution of ( A " .
) , is the product M'An4 ; and a similar product being formed from every solution of ( A " .

We proceed with our partitions of the octagon , by finding RagdE(8 , k)n .

R2hagdi(8 , k)-=0 , because the subindex 4h is not integer .

Problem e. To find R hagdi(r , k ) , , the number of ( l+k)-partitioned r-gons having an n-gonal nucleus and h diagonal and h agonal axes of reversion , of which none are clear .
The construction is like the preceding , with the exception that 2h equidistant sides , viz. the n 2n 2h-nth , 2th , 2hth , ... 2h 2th , are all loaded with the same ( 1+s0)-partitioned ( 4+2cao)-gon , having at least one agonal axis of reversion , so and oo being any numbers in our register of agonally reversibles , An and an being found as in XXXII .

2 2 An r-gon so constructed from any one solution has k diagonals , and is reversible about at least h agonal and h diagonal axes , all loaded .
We can , as before , make the product D(2+a , , el)D(2 + a , e , ) ... D ( 2 + a-4 , en-4h\ = -n-47i\ 4h 4h I 4h with the numbers a , , a , , &amp;c. in our solution of ( A " ' .
) , which is the number of variations of diagonals that can be made in the ( 2 +a , )-gon , ( 2+ a2)-gon , &amp;c. , while the 4h reversible polygons upon the axes are undisturbed .
We can also disturb these polygons alone , varying the 2h agonally reversibles , in m , ( 2Rmag(4+2aGQ So)+R2m , aIi(4+2a , , so)==H different ways , as in XXIX .
, and the 2h monogonally reversibles in sm Rhmo(3+ , n gn)=M 4h 4h different ways , as in XXXII .
, wherefore the entire number of r-gons ( I +k)-partitioned and having h equidistant agonal and as many diagonal axes of reversion all loaded , that can be formed by one solution of ( A " ' .
) , is the product H.M.An-_4h , ilM ; 4h all the numbers s , a,1 e , , &amp;c. appearing in the product being those found in that one solution .
The sum of these products , one for every possible solution of equation ( A " ' .
) , all orders and values of the quantities aG , a e , &amp;c. counting as solutions , is the total number of ( 1+ k)-partitioned r-gons , built on the n-gonal nucleus , to have h agonal and h diagonal axes of reversion none of them clear , i. e. ZiRo2hi agdi ( r , k ) , = EH .
M.An-4h ; 4h the number of products under Z on the right being that of the solutions of ( A " ' .

Wherefore R rh =gdi(r , k)-fH .

XXXV .
The highest value of h in ( A " ' .
) gives n-2h=0 , 2h= 2 .
The equations become in this case 2r-5n 2no+l 2k-2n which have of course no solution if the fractions are irreducible ; and 2Ao= 1 : wherefore Ragdi(r , k ) , =0 , n_agdi Ro ( r , k)= 2{ Im(2Rm(4+2ao so , 0)+R2nagd(4+ 2sxo , so ) ) Rj m(3+ , ) } = HMAo , a sum of products easily obtained from our register of reversibles , a different product for every solution of the two equations just written in ca , , s0 , eo .
n--4h 24an We next put n I=1 , or 2h=- , and find 4n agdi n agdi Ro4 ( r , k)-EHMA , -RE2 ( r , k)~ , H , M and A , being properly determined from the numbers that satisfy r=n+j ( 2 +2v &lt; )+ .

In like manner we can obtain R2h agdi(r , k)n for every value of 2h that gives , in equations ( A " ' .
) , n , r-6h , and k-n-2h(So+ , n ) 4h each divisible by 4h ; co , eo , c , and En being numbers in our register of reversibles .
4h7 4h It is easily seen that R2hagdi(8 , k)6= 0==R20hagdi(8 , k)4 , whence by what precedes we obtain , for k &gt; 0 , R2^agdi(S , k)=0 , or the octagon has no partition ago-diagonally reversible , except itself .
Thus we have determined the four numbers Rh.adi(r , +R ( k ) eadi(r , k ) + R2a agdi(r , k)n + Rh .
agdi(r k)n R2h gdi( k ) , .
XXXVI .
The next step is to obtain Ea(r , k=)n= kRc g(r , k)n + R+Eg(r,.k ) +R gr Problem f. To find Rh ag(r , k ) , , the number of ( 1 +k)-partitioned r-gons bttilt on the n-gonal nucleus , to be reversible about h agonal axes , all clear .
Whether n be odd or even , 2h sides of the n-gon , viz.the zth , th , 2n h-I the nth , th , th ... h nth sides , 'h kh and the ^th , 3th ... 2 nth sides , 2k 2k 2k which are equidistant from pairs of the preceding h , are unloaded , and the sides between the nth and ^-th are loaded , the mth with a ( l+e , ,)-partitioned ( 2+am)-gon , &amp;c. , the n2k2 configuration of this interval being reversed in the two adjoining intervals of 2k sides each , so as to make a figure reversible about all the axes .
And the equations following will be true : The configurations producible about the loaded agonal axis through the nth side of the n-gon , from any one solution of ( B ' .
) , are the product HAnn-h , of 2h H= m { 2Rt9(4+2o , 0o ) +R2adi(4+2oa , o ) } , and a_2h=D(2+a , , e , ).D(2+a2 , e2 ) ... .D(2+a2 , en-2h ) ; 2h\ 2h 2h / and the sum of these products , one for every solution of ( B ' .

loaded agonal axes of all ( I +k)-partitioned r-gons built on the n-gonal nucleus , to have Ih loaded agonal axes , and 4h clear agonal axes bisecting the equal intervals between the loaded ones .
Now the whole number of these r-gons is that of these configurations , since no such r-gon has more than one ; and these r-gons are in number exactly , ~.~(r , ~)~=2H.A^ , ( io0 ) ; 2k iR(2i + l)h .

But R2hafg(r , k ) is not in the number of these r-gons , because in the intervals of any 'h equidistant loaded axes of these , lies an even number of clear axes .
Wherefore , ( i &gt; 0 ) IRe(r , k)-= ( HAn2h ) c XXXVIII .

We shall now find R^ag(8 , k)n and Ra9(8 , k)n .

In any one of these there are 2h equidistant sides , the nth , the -th , the th , &amp;c. of the n-gon loaded , half with a ( 1+s0)-partitioned ( 4+2a0)-gon , and the rest , alternating with these , loaded with a ( 1+s ) -partitioned ( 4+2 2 )-gon , all having at least one agonal axis of reversion , which is also one in the n-gon .
The numbers a , , , , as well as ao , gn , 2/ l , / which may be the same or not with the former , are any that we choose from our register of agonally reversibles .
The intervals are loaded as before , so as to satisfy r=n+h(2+2ao)+2h(aj+a2+. .

Having chosen any solution of these equations , and posited the polygons , we can , without disturbing the first-named 2h polygons on the axes , make D(2+a , , el).D(2+a2 , e2)..D( 2+a2n-2 , en-2^= An-2h\ 2h 2h ]h2 variations of the e , , e ... diagonals , and produce about the axis through the nth side as many configurations .
And with each of these variations we can combine any ( 4+-2ao)gon in our register which has eo diagonals and an agonal axis , and also any ( 4+2ac)-gon having g_ diagonals and an agonal axis , and in any posture giving h agonal axes of the 2h r-gon .
That is , we can , without altering our , solution of ( B " .

ll.2h E 2k 2A 2h If then EHH'A denote the sum of these products made from every solution of ( B " .

Now two of these are found in each of R ( r , k ) ; one of them , namely , about the loaded axes , in each of Ri : ag(r , k)n , and these are among the configurations obtained with a0--_an and s , =n_ ; 2h 2h also one of them is in each of R2hiagdi(r , k)n , and one of them in each of Eia'(r , k ) .
; for both these have h equidistant agonal axes loaded , of course alike ( eo=_n and ~o= : ) .
2h 2h Nor is there anything to prevent the 2hi terminations of axes in some of R^ag(r , k ) , being loaded all alike ; for this cannot hinder the configurations about alternate axes from being different .

) .
We cannot find Rag(r , k ) , by this formula ( h=l ) , for there is no such division reducible to a nucleus ( K , XIII .

We have to investigate next , formule for Ro`(rW k)n+ic7di(r kn +Rc(r,.k)n= 1d(r k)n Problem i. To find Rhdi(r , k)n , the number of ( l +k)-partitioned r-gons having diagonal axes only of reversion , all loaded , and built on an n-gonal nucleus .
Each r-gon of this number has a ( 1 +o)-partitioned ( 3+2ao)-gon laid on h equidistant ?
n 2n sides , the nth , the hth , the -hth , &amp;c. of the r-gon , anda ( l+)n-partitioned ( 3+ 2a )gon laid on h sides each equidistant from two of the other h , all being polygons reversible about at least one monogonal axis , which is an agonal axis of the n-gon ( Theorem N ) , bisecting the side on which the polygon is placed .
The intervals of n2 sides being loaded as in the previous constructions , the equations of condition are r=n+h(l+2z0)+2h(a+a2+. .
+an2h+h(l+2)n ( C ) R=n+h. .
+2h(e +e2 ++e+e-2h+)+h J am O , em* am-1 , and both a , s are chosen from our register of monogonally reversibles .
Leaving undisturbed the 2h polygons on the axes , we have in our power , from any one solution of equations ( C. ) , D(2+a , , e)D(2+a2 , e2)*..D(2+ -,2 e=-2 =A-2h V 2h 24 2A variations of arrangement of the e , , e2 , &amp;c. diagonals in the intervals , producing as many configurations about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon , and all reversible about at least h monogonal axes .
With any one of these variations we can combine any polygon of the number M= M , R ' EmR ' ?
( 3+2 0 , o ) , and any one of M1=^R"Jm ?
{ 3+2^2 " n % ; \ 2h 2hJ so that we obtain MM'An-2^ configurations from this one solution of ( C. ) .
2h If we form this product for every possible solution , in every order of values of a a , se , &amp;c. , we shall produce about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon , 2MM'An-2h different configurations .

Problem k. To find R(r , k)n , the number of(l+k)i2artitioned r-gons built on an n-gonal nucleus , to have ih loaded and |h clear axes only , all diagonal axes .
A clear diagonal axis of the r-gon is a diagonal of the nucleus , evidently .
These 2 2 R-ACEr-gons will have only n sides of the n-gon loaded with ( 1+s)-partitioned ( 3+2o0)-gons monogonally reversible , namely the nth , the -th , the hth , &amp;c. sides .
And half the interval between the nth and nth , namely n-h sides , will be loaded , the mth with a ( 1 +e , )-partitioned ( 2 +a , )-gon , which will be placed also on the ( , -m)th side , so as to form a figure reversible about the diagonal bisecting that interval .
Our equations of condition are now r=n+A(l+2ao)+2h(aS+1+c + a.( ' .
k=n+Iie +ah( , ,+e,..+al , h am0 , ea --l , where eo and go are any numbers we select from our list of monogonally reversibles .
Reasoning as in the previous constructions , we deduce that the entire sum , made from every solution of ( C ' .

D(2+a , ^5 &amp; _ , 2A\ 2 2h is the complete number of configurations about a loaded axis , of r-gons having 2 equidistant loaded , and bisecting the intervals between these , 2 clear , diagonal axes of reversion .
Now one of these configurations about a loaded axis is seen in each of R+l^+'a(r , k)n ; for it has in the intervals of any equidistant loaded axis 2i+1 clear ones , one of them bisecting each interval .
But none of the class r1 -di(r , k)X has that configuration , because in the equal intervals of loaded axes it has an even number of clear ones , and none bisecting an interval .
And no ago-diagonally reversible can have this configuration , because the diagonal axes are in these all clear or all loaded .

where ( 2i+3)h is a value h ' that makes 2i ' integer .
XLIII .
The greatest value of h in ( C ' .
) is h=n , when there is no interval between the axes .
Then , r-2n k-n and RE(r , k)nX= LmR ( r+n k wn n It which =0 , if:r and k are not multiples of n. Next putting 2h =-1 , we find RIC ( r , k)~ , and so on for every even value of h &gt; 0 that makes n-h , r-n-h(1+2ao ) , and k-n--ho , , all divisible by 2h .
The greatest value of h in equation ( C. ) , XLI .
, is h=-.n .
Those equations become r-2n 2k2n n and Ao= 2o5 wherefore , Ro ( r , k)=0 , and because ( XXXIII .

From this R^(r , k ) , can be found for every value of h &gt; 1 in equation ( C. ) , XLI .
, that makes n , r , and k--h(/ oq ) divisible by 2h , conditions imposed by those equations .
But we cannot attempt by these formule to find Rf'(r , k ) , , ( h-=1 ) , because ( XIII .
) this subclass reduces to no nucleus .
X V. We proceed with our partitions of the the 8-gon , to find Ri(8 , k ) , and REd`(8 , k)n .
6-h In equations ( C ' .
) , n=6 or n=4 , for r=8 ; and =integer gives only h=2 .
Hence r=-8=6+2.(1+0)+4.0 , k=2=6+2.0+4 1 , the only value of k , because so &gt; -1+2a0-l .
Wherefore E|d(8 , 2)6=Rmo(3 , 0)Al-=1 .

only value of kc ; R4i(81 4)4=Rmo(3 , 0)Ao=l .
6-2h Next , in equations ( C. ) , r=8 gives n=6 , or n=4 , of which the first , putting --2=inte4-2h ger , , gives only Ah=1 , the value above forbidden .
But --h= integer=0 , gives h=2 ; whence k=4 , and by the formula for R'di(r , Jk ) we obtain ( ao=eo=0 ) , RBdi(8 , 4)- , ={R(3 0 ) .
R(3 , 0 ) -Er(8 4 ) } =i{1-1}=0 .

Problem 1 .
To find Rhdi(r , k ) , , the number of ( l+k)-partitioned r-gons built on the n-gonal nucleus , which have h clear diagonal axes of reversion , and none others .
In these all the axes are diagonal axes of the nucleus , and terminate at 2h equidistant angles of it .
The interval of sides between any two , as the 1st , 2nd,. .
-th sides of '~2h the n-gon , is loaded , the mth side with a ( 1+em)-partitioned ( 2 +a4)-gon , as in the previous constructions , so that all shall be reversible about every axis .
We have to solve r=n+2h(a , +a2+. .

The sum of products , one for every solution , all orders of the values counted among solutions , 2\n =ZD(2+ , , e , )D(2+a , , e , )..D(2+a , e " , 2h 2h 2h is the entire number of configurations about a clear diagonal axis , if r-gons have h equidistant clear diagonal axes , and built on this nucleus .
Now of these configurations two are seen on each of R'hidi(r , k ) , one is seen on each of R2ih.di(r , k ) , namely , that about the clear axes in these , one is seen on each of Ri ' .
agdi(r , k ) , and one on each of r'aidi(r , k ) , namely , that about the diagonal axes in these .
Wherefore ( i &gt; 0 ) , 2A = , R{2R di(r , k-rk))+ Ri , k)+Rih .

) , the greatest value of h gives 2 =1 .
Those equations then become r-n k-n n al , -e , A1 =D r-n k-n)= nd hence REdi(r , k)l= 0 , and since R.agdi(r , k)=0 ( XVIII .
) , R-iX(r , k)= = D(r , kE-)1D-R k ( ) , ,k-R^d , a given number , by XLIII .
and XXX .
And we can proceed to find Rh di(r , , for every value of h down to Al , which gives , in ( C " .
) , r , n , and c , divisible by 2h .
Thus we have completely determined Rhdi(r , k)n=Rdi(r , k)n+Rh di(r , k))+Rh'di(r .
k ) .
XLVI .
When r=8 in equation ( C " .
) , n=6 , or n=4 .
If n=6 , =3 and h=l are 8 the only values making 2 integer .
We have then the three solutions r=8=6+2(1+0+0)=6+2(0+1+0 ) 6+2(0+0+1 ) , k=2=6+2(0-1-1)=6+2(-1+0-1)=6+2(-1--1+0 ) ; As3=3D(3 , 0)=3 , and we obtain Rd ( 8 , 2)6 , ={3-1Rj ( 8 2 ) } =1 .
If n=4 , h=2 or h=1 ; for the first of which we obtain by the formula for Rind(r- , k)n , t(8 , 4 ) , = { D(3 , 0)-ER ( 8 , 4)4 =i ( 1 l ) =0 , k=4 being the only possible value .
If h=1 , we may have k=4 or k-2 ; for k=4 , we find the three solutions ( F=2 ) , 8-=4+2(2+2(20)4+2(02)=4+2(1+1 ) 4=4+-2(1-1)=4+2(-1+1)=4+2(0+0 ) ; 2A2=2D(4 , 1)+D(3 , 0)=4+1=5 , whence Rdi(8 , 4 ) , =-{5-R(8 , 4)4}=2 .
For k-=2 , there are two solutions , 8=4+2(2+0)=4+2(0+2 ) , 2=4+2(0-1)=4+2(--1+0 ) ; giving a , -=2D(4 , 0)=2 , and , R ( 8 , 2)4 , =(2-0)=1 ; for there is nothing in our list under R(8 , 2)4 to subtract in the formula for 2R , hdi(r , k)c .
XLVII .
Our next step is to determine RhnMo(r , k)n-=Rhm(r , mo X+Rk , mo(r kX , .
Problem m. To find Rh.mo(r , k ) , , the number of ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gons , built on the n-onal nucleus to have h clear monogonal axes of reversion , and none besides .
The h clear axes ( Theorem 0 ) are monogonal axes of the n-gon , bisecting h equidistant sides of it ; between which lie h vertices of the n-gon upon those h axes ; and n is odd .
The interval ofh sides between such a vertex and bisected side is loaded the mth from the vertex with a ( 1 +em)-partitioned ( 2 + are )-gon , so that all is reversible about the h axes .
The equations following are satisfied in the construction : r=n+ 2h(ai+a2+. .
+air1 .
) 2h ; ... ... ( D. ) kc=n-h+2h(e , +e424+ .

For every solution of these equations we can make D(2+aFl , e , )D(2 +2a , e2 ) X ... D(2 +an-h , -en-h An-h 2h 2h 2h different arrangements of the el , e2 , &amp;c. diagonals , giving as many distinct configurations about the monogonal axis through the nth side of the n-gon .
And , as before , we obtain 1A-h different configurations in all by adding together as many such products as there 2h are solutions of equations ( D. ) , every order of the quantities counted as a solution ; which sum is the entire number of configurations of ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gons built on this nucleus to have h clear monogonal equidistant axes of reversion .
Now one of these configurations is seen on each r-gon of the number R + ?
'J^ m(r , k ) ; for each has h equidistant monogonal axes , and on none besides , because if one monogonal axis is clear , all are clear ; otherwise there would be more than two axial configurations , and the axes are odd in number ( Theorem F ) .
Wherefore ; a , n-h-= iR(2i+1)h^m0(r , k ) , , 22 and ( iS0 ) R.mo ( r , k)-ZAav(+.Or k ) .

Since r &gt; n in equations ( D. ) , n &gt; h. Let X-h=2h ; then h=-3 is the highest value , and 2n 3r+ n r=n+a3 , , 2+a-= 2n 2n 2n 3k-2n , 3 +3 , e=3 2n i( 3r+n 3k-2n\ 2 ' 2n and Rt mo ?
( r , k)-=O0 , 3 m(r , k)=D(3r n 32n which of course 0 if the fractions are irreducible .
From this we can proceed to find R ' mo(r , k)n , for every odd value of h down to h=1 which makes n-h , r-n , and k , divisible by 2h .
The octagon has no monogonal axis of reversion ( Theorem E ) .
XLIX .
Problem n. To find Rh mo(r , k)n , the number of ( 1+k)7partitioned r-yons built on the n-gbnal nucleus to have h only monogonal axes of reversion , all loaded .
The axes will be either all monogonal or all agonal axes of the n-gon ( Theorem N , 0 ) , for every axis of the r-gon carries the same two configurations ( Theorem C ) .
Let them first be all monogonal , i. e. let n be odd ; this requires that each be loaded at one end with an agonally reversible ( about one or more axes ) ( I-:-+)-partitioned ( 4+2o0)-gon .
The intervals of , h sides will be loaded as in the last preceding construction , to satisfy r=n+h(2+2c0o)+2h(al+a2+t. .

Putting , as in XIX .
, Z , { 2Rm.ag(4+2 , o , so)+R2""gadi(4+2o , o)}==H , and forming the product An-h from a solution of ( D ' .
) which contains those numbers a , , 2h So , we deduce , as before , 'that HH .
A , -h , comprising as many products under Z as those 2h solutions of ( D ' .
) , all orders of the quantities a , el , &amp;c. being counted as solutions , is the total number of axial configurations of ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gons having h loaded monogonal axes and built on the n-gonal nucleus when n is odd .
And as one of these configurations is seen on each r-gon of the number R2i'l)^m ' ?
( r , k ) , , and only one , read from the loaded end of the axis , we obtain Z(H .

An_^sR 'i+ ( r , k)n , 2h where n is odd , and i 0O .
L. Now let the h axes be agonal axes of the n-gon ; i. e. let n be even .
One end of every axis will carry ( Theorem 0 ) the same ( 3+2ao)-gon ( 1+S0)-partitioned and reversible about at least one monogonal axis .
The other ends will carry the same ( 2+2a2)-gon , ( 1+n )-partitioned and reversible about at least one agonal axis , which 2h/ A will be no load if an=0 .
' The interval of 2-h sides between these reversibles will be 2h loaded , on the mth side from the first , with a ( 1+em)-partitioned ( 2+a)-gon ; and the equations to be satisfied are , r=n+h(l+2ao)+2h(a , +a2+. .

Taking now any one solution of these equations , the product H"MA of H m{2Rmag(2 +an , ) +R2-m.adi(2 2+.tn g 2k 2h 2h 2h ( which is to be considered unity when._.=0 , the load being then simply the edge of 2h the n-gon ) , M= mRm c.mo(3+eo 0 o ) , An-2h=D(2+a , , el).D(2+a2 , e2 ) X. D(2 + , n-2h , en-2h ) 2h 2h 2A/ h is the number of configurations that we can produce , about the axis through the nth side of the n-gon , read from that side , of ( 1 +k)-partitioned r-gons built on this nucleus from this one solution , to have h loaded monogonal axes .
And the sum of these products belonging to every solution , all orders and values counting as solutions , is the exact number of all such configurations possible .
Now one , and only one , of these is seen in each r-gon of the number R -ih)^mo(r , k ) , , for n even .
That is , E(ll".M A.n12h)= R(21+1m(r , k)n , where n is even , and i 0 ; and H"=1 whenever n ==0 .
2h LI .
In equation ( D ' .
) , the highest value of h is h=n .
Then those equations become k-n n -2+2o =n / : k-n/ n k-nV H=2(HAlo)=24 2Rn(ag j k ) +R2 magdi r+ =R ) } =R ( r , k ) , since Ao=1 , where n is odd ; but R 'm ?
( r , k , =O of course , if n is even .
From this we can proceed to find R mo(r , k ) , , for all odd values of h &gt; 1 , which make , in equations ( D ' .
) , n-h , r-n--h(2+2ao ) and k-n-h-o , divisible by 2h ; ao and so being selected from our register of agonally and ago-diagonally reversibles .
In equations ( D " .
) , the greatest value of h gives n-2h=0 , or h=2n .
Those equations become 2r3n 2n - ? ? ? ?
' '1~ 2k-2n 0Ao o=-l , whence , if 2n be an odd number ( for h is always odd ) , Ro2 ( r , k).= Hir .

M being equal to the number of solutions of the above reduced KIRKMA_N ON THE K-PARTITIONS OF THE R-GON AND R-ACE .
251 form of equations ( D " .
) , made with numbers cc , os , an , s , selected from our register , as 2h 2h above stated ( L. ) .
From this value of R2 ( r , k)n , we can proceed to find , when n is even , R^m ?
( r , k)n for all values of h &gt; 1 , which make n , r-(1+2ac + ) , and ka -hn ( +d divisible by 2h .
But we cannot find RE ?
( r , k)n by these formulae , there being no such division reducible to a nucleus ( VIII .
) .
Thus we have found ( XLIX .
, L. ) Rl'm0 ( r , k)n for any value of n &gt; 2 .

All the numbers R of article XX .
have now been determined , for every value of h when the axes are not all loaded , and for every value of h &gt; when they are all loaded , the nucleus being n-gonal , and n- &lt; 3 .
We have next to enumerate the doubly and singly reversibles which are built on the 2-gonal nucleus , that is , upon a line , which is of course a drawn axis of reversion of the r-gon , and also the singly reversibles which have an e-scored axis .
These have no proper nucleus ( Theorem K ) .
These r-gons now to be discussed fall into the classes following , R2agdi(r k ) , IR2d , Fr k ) , Rdi(r , k)2 , R(r k ) , Rdi(r , k ) , Ro(r , k ) ; of which the first two have a drawn diagonal axis standing as a perpendicular score upon an undrawn axis ( Theorem G ) ; the third has a single drawn diagonal axis ( Theorem G ) ; and the fourth , fifth and sixth have a single undrawn and scored axis of reversion ( Theorem K ) .
The subscript 2 in the first three symbols shows that the nucleus is a drawn line , which may be considered as a 2-gon reversible about a diagonal and an agonal axis .
Problem o. To find R2gdi(r , k)2 , the ( 1 +k)-partitioned r-gons built on a nucleus-line to have a diagonal and an agonal axis of reversion .
If the drawn diagonal be erased , the figure will be still reversible about the same two axes undrawn , for ( Theorem B , VI .
) the erasure has not disturbed the symmetry about either axis .
But the erasure may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis ( Theoremn R , XVIII .
) .
And every r-gon which has a clear diagonal axis perpendicular to an agonal one , that is , every one of RE(4r+2)agdi(r , k1 ) and of ( 41h+2)agdi(r , k-1 ) .
, whatever h or n may be , if n2 ( Cor. 1 , VII .

Problem p. To find R2d(r , k)2 , the number of ( 1 +k)partitioned r-gons built on a line-nucleus , to have two diagonal axes of reversion .
If the drawn diagonal axis be erased , the figure still remains reversible about the same axis , as in the preceding article , and we may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis .
Every r-gon of the number Rd(r , kl)n will give us two of R2di(r , k)2 , for we can draw a diagonal axis bisecting either of its configurations ; and every r-gon of the number ( R2^+Rdi+ R ' 4agdi+ Ragd ) ( r k -1 ) which have all a clear diagonal axis at right angles to a diagonal axis ( VI .

Cor. 1 ) , will give us one of R2d(r , k)2 , by drawing any diagonal axis of reversion , which can be drawn without meeting diagonals ; i. e. R"(r , k)-=x{2R .
di(r , k-1 ) , +R ^di(r , k--l)+R4hadi(r , k--l)n+R-4dhag(r , k -1 ) } ; comprehending all the values of h &gt; 0 and n &gt; 2 in our register of reversibles .
Hence follows ( XLIV .
) , R2di(8 , 5)2=R4(8 , 4)4 =1 , R2di(8 , 3)2=Rjd(8 , 2)0 =1 , Rdi(8 , 1)2=R2^d(8 , 0)8=1 .

Problem q. To find Rdi(r , k)2 , the number of ( 1+k)-partitioned singly reversible r-gons having a drawn diagonal axis .
If this axis be erased , the figure F remains reversible about the same diagonal axis , and the erasure may have restored the symmetry about some n-gonal nucleus of which that erased line is a clear diagonal axis , one of an odd number of axes of reversion in F ; for if this number were even , there would then be an axis ( VI .
) perpendicular to the erased one , about which the symmetry would not be disturbed by the erasure , so that the figure before the erasure must have been at least doubly reversible , contrary to hypothesis .
Now every one of the number R '1+ ?
)di(r , k-1l ) , will give one ( Theorems B , G ) , and only one , of Rdi(r , k)2 , by drawing of any of its axes of reversion , because all these carry the same configuration .
Consequently Rd"(r , k).=^ ; h7aR ?
^*+ '(r , kl ) , , comprehending all values of h including h= 0 , and all of n , in our register of k-partitions .
Hence we obtain ( XLVI .

Problem r. To find RaO(r , k ) , the number of ( 1+k)-partitioned r-gons reversible only .
about a single scored monogonal axis .
The number of ways in which e diagonals can be drawn at right angles across an axis of one of the r-gons of the division R(^+l)mo(r , k-e)2 is -(n ).+1 ; for any e vertices may be chosen out of ~ on one side of the monogonal axis .
The whole number of operations described in Theorems P and S , by which a ( 1+k)-partitioned monogonal can arise , is the above operation performed on every ( l+k-e)-partitioned monogonal in our register for every value of e , n , and h. The results , by Theorems E , P , and S , are all monogonally reversibles .
And by Theorem Q we see that every ( 1 +k)-partitioned ( 2h+3)-ly reversible about loaded monogonal axes will be among these results , whatever be its nucleus ; and every singly reversible with a loaded monogonal axis will be among them ; for if this be cleared , we have before us one of our subjects of operation just referred to in our register .

Problem s. To find Rag(r , k ) , the number of ( 1 +k)-partitioned r-gons singly reversible about a scored agonal axis .
REg(r , k ) and Rdi(r , k ) are obtained by the operations of Theorems P , R , S , by scoring both 2h-ly and ( 2h+1l)-ly reversibles .
We write Rag(rT , )=Rag(r , k)'+RO(r , k ) " , the first of the right member denoting the number of those r-gons obtained by scoring one of an odd number , and the second , those by one of an even number , of axes .
The number Rag(r , k ) ' is obtained by Theorems P , Q , S , exactly as ER ?
o(r , k ) was obtained , except that the number of angles of the nucleus from which on one side of n-4 .

That is , , ( n--4 e.R]a^+')g(r , I k_ e)nR+ h+"ag(r , k ) , where again the omission of the subscript n shows that constructions upon all nuclei are included .
LVII .
We have next to determine REg(r , k ) " , obtained by scoring a clear axis out of an even number of axes ( Theorem R ) .
Whatever e may be , the constructions of Theorem R are enumerated by subtracting the symmetrical arrangements of the e scores from the whole number of arrangements , and dividing the remainder by two ; for every unsymmetrical one occurs twice in this remainder , once as read from each end of the scored axis , which readings are the two configurations of the singly reversible about the axis ( Theorem C ) .
Let e first be even , in constructing Rag(r , k ) " .
The entire number of e-plets eligible from the numerals on one side of the axis is 2 -4\ el-i -1F--~e~~ ) e+ and that of the 2-plets eligible alike on opposite sides of the centre of the axis is when n=4m , and , when n=-4m+2 , it is ( n-6211 X +1 wherefore , using the circulators 4n and 4n , _ and 2e , 2 , n-4 --1 n-4\^1 fi2 n-6\ ?

255 n-gonal nucleus in any 2h-ly reversible ( 1+k-e)-partitioned r-gon , across a clear agonal axis .
When the axes are all clear and agonal , we can score across either configuration , i. e. upon either of two adjacent axes , and thus obtain , twice this number towards Rg(r , k ) " ; but if only half are clear and agonal , we have only one configuration to score , and can obtain this number only .
Hence we see that the product under Z , Z of the number above written , into Zhz , ezn{ 2R2^~a(r , I-e)RI ag(r , k_e)nR2h -e ) gR2hagd(r , )k-(e ) , } is the entire sum Rg(r , k ) " , of r-gons in Rg(r , k ) obtainable by scoring one of an even number of axes , by the construction of Theorem R. LVIII .
Adding , then , to this entire sum the portion of Rag(r , k ) obtained by scoring one of an odd number of axes ( LVI .
) , we express the complete result thus : R.g(r , k ) = Il)aI(r2 ik-e ) ( le4)e+ 1R +s(r k ) hleEn c ( r , k e ) , 20 ( r , ( ii+l'o2k3 ) ^ + ?

When k=e , the r-gon scored is the simple r-gon , or n=-r .
The only numbers of those in the right member of this expression that our list contains for r=8 , are R &amp; adi(8 , 0)3=1 , Rg(8 , 2 ) , =1 , Ra(8 , 4)4=1 , R , ag(8 , 2)4=1 ( XXVIII .

When the scored axis is a diagonal one out of an even number of axes , the constructions Rdf(r , k ) " of Theorem R are enumerated by a subtraction and division like those of LVII .
Let e first be even .
n--2 The entire number of e-plets eligible from the numerals on one side of this diagonal axis , is ( 2 " e ) X fe+ ; and that of 2-plets eligible alike on opposite sides 1 l2 / --4e e of the centre of the axis is ( n- ) X X , when n=4m+2 , and ( n )21 + &gt; when n= 4m : wherefore J/ n-2SV -/ 2\ 1 ( 1 n-4 -1 ee ' nel T ( sr 2 w1 -( 4 ) *i+e I-2--+ ) 42+1 24I 2 .
( a. ) is the number out of RT(r , k ) " , when e is even , that can be made by e-scoring a clear diagonal axis of a 2h-ly reversible ( +k--e)-partitioned r-gon .
But when e is odd , a diameter of the r-gon must be one of the e scores , if all is symmetrical about the centre , which requires r=4m .
Then when n=4m+2 , every odd e scores that can be drawn gives an unsymmetrical configuration , so that there are thus 4n.2^.{ 2 e(u )Ii.+{1 ' } , out of R(r , ... .
( b. ) obtained by so scoring a clear diagonal axis of a 2h-ly reversible .
And when n=4m , we have merely to subtract from this entire number of ways as before , the number of symmetrical ways , which , after drawing a diameter , is that of drawing -(e--1 ) scores on one side of the centre , and then to divide by two , as before , thus:i2e_14n( o / n-2^ -1 ( n-4\e 2l~l 2 i.2e 1 ' j4-n e2+i ).12 .

When the axes of the r-gon are all clear and diagonal , we obtain twice this number , for we can score an axis carrying either of two configurations ; but we obtain it once only , when only half the axes are clear and diagonal .
That is , if we multiply this number , under EE , , by Z^heAn{2R^C(r , k-e)n+R2h -di(r , k-e ) +R2h^ adi(r , k-e)+R2^ adr , k -e ) , we have the full number Rd(r , k ) " , out of Ro ( r , k ) , that are made by scoring one of an even number of axes .

We have now to investigate the number of irreversible ( 1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon .
And when we have determined Im+2(r , k ) , , mnO , the equations of art .
XXIII .
will enable us to complete the tedious solution of our problem .
It is necessary to demonstrate the theorems following .
THEOREM V. Every h-ly irreversible partition of an r-gon , if h &gt; 2 , and every doubly irreversible partition in which a diameter of the r-gon is not drawn , is regularly built on a polygonal nucleus .
For in each of the h sequences of configuration ( art .
III .
) in the circuit of the r-gon , we seef marginal faces .
These being all erased , we see an r'-gon ( r ' &lt; r ) with fi7 fewer diagonals , and still h sequences , for those of the r-gon have been treated alike .
If this r'-gon is reversibly partitioned , it is not singly reversible , because it has repeated sequences ( V. ) ; therefore the theorem is proved by XII .
; for there is no drawn diameter by hypothesis .
If the r'-gon be still irreversible , it has h ' sequences ( h ' &lt; h ) , from which marginal faces can be removed as before ; and thus we shall finally reduce the figure , either to a reversibly-partitioned r"-gon , or to one having no marginal faces , i. e. to an n-gonal nucleus .
And by reversing the process of reduction , the r-gon can be regularly constructed on that nucleus .
Q. E. D. LXIII .
THEOREM W. If the nucleus line of a doubly irreversible r-gon built on it be erased , the figure becomes 2h-ly reversible or else 2h-ly irreversible , and has no drawn diameter .
For it has still two irreversible sequences , occupying each half the circuit of the r-gon , since the two sequences terminated by the nucleus-line have been treated alike by the erasure ; wherefore it can neither be oddly reversible nor oddly irreversible ( Obs. 1 , 3 , IV .
; and 5 , VII .
) .
And evidently the r-gon cannot have a drawn diameter meeting its nucleus line .
Cor. The r-gon , after the erasure , is one of those reducible to a polygonal nucleus .
THEOREM X. If in any 2m-ly reversible , or 2m-ly irreversible , k-partition of an r-gon , a diameter be drawn which is not an axis of reversion , and which meets no diagonal , the figure becomes a doubly irreversible ( 1 +k)-partition of the r-gon , built on that drawn line .
For such a drawn line disturbs the symmetry about every axis of a reversible , because it is ( VI .
) perpendicular to none of them ; therefore the result is not reversible .
And every 2m-ly reversible or 2m-ly irreversible has an irreversible sequence occupying half its circuit ( III , V. ) , beginning at any angle not on an axis of reversion ; therefore the result is not singly irreversible .
And as there is no other sequence terminated by or exhibiting a drawn diameter , since two cannot be drawn , the result has no sequence more than twice repeated , and is doubly irreversible .
And evidently the figure is built on the drawn line , by applying to it the same polygon on both sides , so as not to give a reversible result .
LXIV .
Problem u. To find Ih(r , k ) .
, ( i &gt; 1 , n &gt; 2 ) , the number of h-ly irreversible ( l+k)-partitions of the r-gon , which are built on the n-gonal nucleus .
The construction differs from that of reversibles , in that the ( 1+em)-partitioned ( 2+a , )-gon which is laid on the mth side of the n-gon in the first interval of h sides , is laid also on the mth side of every interval , so that the series of loads imposed is h times repeated , and not reverted .
The result will be an r-gon in whose circuit a sequence occupying h sides of the nucleus is h times repeated .
The equations to be satisfied are r=n+h(a +a2+..+an v n-+h(a , +~c)h),. .
* *\ , .
( E ) k=n+h(e , +e2 + is hi times repeated .
And as the hi-ly irreversible has the same sequences reversed on its other face , giving hi different aspects which we have all constructed as read from the first side of the n-gon in one direction , we have had this same hi-ly irreversible 2n:hi times before us among our results .
Again , every hi-ly reversible ( l+k)-partitioned r-gon has been times brought before us in our 2An constructions .
For this has a different i-ple sequence reversible or irreversible ofh vertices of the n-gonal nucleus commencing at any one of h successive vertices , and we never see a sequence repeated in it till we have read over an interval equal to that between two alternate axes , that is an interval of jG sides of the n-gon ( art .
V. ) .
This i-ple sequence is h times repeated in the circuit of the r-gon ; so that we have counted this hi-ly reversible n times among those constructed from equation ( E. ) .
Wherefore a=2 1i4{ihi(r , k)+-^i R(r , k ) } , and P(r , k= ( ( 2n()I k2 +-^ , i(r ) ) , ( i &gt; O ) .
LXV .
The highest value of h in ( E. ) comes from putting the subindex n =11 , or h=n .
This gives P(r , k)=n { D ( rn -k n ) -"(r ) , k ) , a given number , since Rn(r , k ) .
is found in our register .
Next putting =2 , or whatever next factor n may have , we can obtain Ih(r , k)n for every value of h &gt; that is a divisor of the three numbers r , k and n. Since h &gt; 1 , n &gt; 2 , r , k and n are none of them prime ; the only values of Ih(8 , k)n that give them all divisible by h , and k &gt; 83 , are I2(8 , 2)6 , I2(8 , 2 ) , , I2(8 , 4)4 and I4(8 , 4 ) , .
By the last written formula , ( 8 , 4)= { D(3 , )-R4(8 , 4 ) , }=1(l-1)=0 , for 12(8 , 2)6 we have three solutions , ( =3 ) 8=6+2(1+0+0)= &amp;c. 2=6+2(0-1-1)= &amp;c. giving 3=--3D(3 , 0)=3 , and as R2(8 , 2)6=1 , 12(8 , 2)6=-{3-R2(8 , 2)6 } =(3 3)0. .
For 1(8 , 2)4 we have ( =2 ) , 8=4+2.(1 +1)=4+2(2 +0)=4+2(0+2 ) 24+2(0-1)=4+2(-1+0 ) 2A2=2D(4 , 0)=2 , and R2(8 , 2 ) , =1 , .
( 8 , 2)4 , = 2-{2-A.l}=0 .
For 2(8 , 4 ) , we have n=2 8=4+2(1+1)=4+2(0+2)=4+2(2+0 ) 4=4+2(0+0)=4+2(-1+1)=4+2(1-1 ) A2 , =D(3 , 0)D(3 , 0)+2D(4 , 1)=1+4=5 , and R(8 , 4 ) , =1 , whence 2(8 , 4 ) , =t 5-4.1}=l which is the only form of Ih(8 , k)n , for h &gt; 1 , n &gt; 2 .
LXVI .
Problem w. To find P(r , k)2 , the doubly irreversible ( 1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon , which have a nucleus line .
It is proved in Theorems W and X , that these are all obtained by drawing a diameter 6 which is not an axis of reversion in one of the r-gons I k(r , k-1 ) .
and R2f(r , k-1l ) ; and that any such diameter drawn in any one of these gives us one of I2(r , k)2 .
And it is evident that 6 is a diameter of the nucleus about which all is symmetrical ( Cor. LXIII .
) .
When no diameter of the nucleus is a diagonal axis of reversion of the r-gon , every diameter that can be drawn is such a line 6 .
Now in I2(r , k-l1 ) you may draw 6 from any one 0 of n vertices of the nucleus , and from no more , because the configuration about 0 is repeated 2h times , about a vertex in each of the 2h repeated sequences .
In a reversible partition no diameter of the nucleus is a diagonal axis of reversion , unless it be .
a clear axis .
Therefore , in dirdi ( r , +k-l1)n+R2ag(r , k-1 ) , 1 ) whether the axes be clear or not in the last one , you can draw 6 from any one of vertices of the r-gon ; for none of the partitions in these ' classes have a clear diagonal axis , and each vertex E in one of the 4h intervals between two adjacent axes begins a different sequence , which does not occur reverted till you come to s ' , equidistant with s from the axis between them .
Wherefore P(r ) ( r , 1k)=2^ , )n 2hagdi+R 2hagdi+)2ha g ) k-l).+ After the + must come , first , 4n 2h / ( R2hagdi+ j2hagdi_.R.2hdi)(f because S cannot be drawn from any of the 2h terminations of clear diagonal axes , but may be drawn to begin a certain sequence 4h times from other vertices , once in the interval between the terminations of every adjacent pair of axes ; and secondly , --n 4h ^t ( r k-l ) , must be added , because , omitting the 4h terminations of clear diagonal axes , you can draw $ to begin a certain sequence 4h times from .
the remaining vertices of the nucleus .
Therefore , finally , I(r , )2= n{2 12^(r , k ) , ++n ( Rhagdi(r , k-l )+R2^gdi(r , k-l1 ) , + R2^g(r , k1 ) ) + h(R gdc ( ir , k-l ) , +R ^adi(r , Jg .

Hence follows , 1(8 , 0)=-l{D(8 , 0)--I.R8(8 , O ) 0 , 1(8 , 1)=-{D(8 , 1)--.R(8 , 1)-8R(8,1 ) } = { 20-4-16 } = 0 , I(8 , 2)=-l{D(8 , 2)--IR2(8 , 2)-8.R(8 , 2 ) } = -{120-4-2-84 } = 5 , 1(8 , 3 ) =-1{D(8 , 3)tR2(8 , 3 ) 8R(8 , 3)-6 I2(8 3 ) ) --}=1-{300-41--8-78-2}=14 , 1(8,4)=-{D(8 , 4 ) R4(8 , 4)8.(8 , 4 ) -126(8 , 4)}=-1{330-2-1 8-8-4-8-1}18 , I(8 , 5)= ?

As a further illustration of these formulae and their use , and for a comparison of methods , it will be worth our while to deduce the seven partitions of the 9-gon , and the eight partitions of the 10-gon , which are obtained by way of example in the memoir referred to , in the first article .
First , to find Rh(9 , 6 ) and I(9 , 6 ) .
As the 9-gon is divided into triangles , there can be only two nuclei , a triangle or a line .
We ask , then , what are Rh(9 , 6)3 and R^(9 , 6)2 ?
By Theorem E , the axes are monogonal only , and R^1h(9 , 6)3 is what we are seeking .
By Problem m , R3mo(9 , 6)3=0 , R1mO(9 , 6)3=D(5 , 2)=5 ; and by Problem n , R3mo(9 , 6)3=(2Rnag9+jR2magdi)(4 , 1)= 0 , R2d(4 , 1)2=1 being the only entry in our register under ( 4 , 1 ) .
For R ?
o(9 , 6)3 , we have , by equations ( D ' .
) , h =I-=h .
9=3+2+2a-o+2a , , 6=3+ eo+2e , , 4+2ao=8-2aj , A,1=D(2+a , , e , ) , o=3 -2e , , Rmo(9 , 6)3=Z .
" { 1(2R +R2Magdi)(82a1 , 3--2e , )}.(2+a , , e , ) .
The only values of el are 0 or 1 ; if e , =1 , al &lt; ,2 , if e , =0 , a , Ql .
And as we have nothing in our register under ( Rmag or Rmagdi)((4 , 1 ) or ( 6 , 3 ) ) , Rao(9 , 6)3=0 , and ( Problems o , p , q ) R(9 , 6)2 = 0 ; wherefore R(9 , 6 ) =R ?
O(9 , 6)3=5 .
Next to find Ih(9 , 6)3 ; by Problem u , I3(9 , 6)3= { D(4 , 1)--R3(9 , 6)3}= , ( 2--0)= 1 , the subtracted term having just been proved to be zero .
And as 9 is odd ( Problem w ) , 12(9 , 6)2= 0 , wherefore ( Problem x ) , 1(9 , 6)-= { D(9 , 6)--9R(9 , 6)-i P8I3(9 , 6)=-8-{429-9*5-61-}=21 .
This agrees with the results at p. 409 of my former memoir , saving an error of transcription in the seventh line from the bottom , in which + 1.ii(8 , 2 , 0 ) is omitted from the value of I(10 , 2 ) as it stands above ( line 14 ) .
If the indulgent reader will kindly correct the sixth and seventh lines thus , t-ACE .
269 I(10 , 2)=2 .
{ ii(8 , 2 , 0).ii(4 , 1 , 0))+1.ii(8 , 2 , 0 ) =2 .
{ 4-2}+4=6 , he will find the sum I(10 , 2)+I(10 , 3)+I(10 , 4)=6+13+2=21 , IP(10 , 3)=1 , and R(10 , 2)+R(10 , 4)=5 , the 7-partitions of the nonagon , in that notation , as we have just found them : vide ( I ) of this memoir .

We shall for a final example determine the 8-partitions of the decagon .
There is no nucleus but 3 and 2 ; we want then Rh(10 , 7)3 R2(10 , 7 ) , , Rd(10 , 7 ) , , R o(10 , 7 ) , II(10 , 7)(10 , 7 ) By Theorems M , E ( XIV .
, IX ) , no axis can be agonal , or monogonal ; we seek then Rdi(10 , 7)3 , Rd(10 , 7)2 Rdi(10 , 7 ) , , and R(10 , 7 ) .
Rdi(10 , 7)3=0 by Problem i , because n is odd ; and *di(10 , 7)3=0 for the same reason , as is also R^di(10 , 7)3 .
Therefore Rh^d(10 , 7)3=0 .
By Problem p , R2di(0 7)2=-hz,2{2R d " L+RJhdi+ iR '4hagdi)(10 , 6 ) } 0 ; for R2^hd ( 10 , 6)=-0 , because 10 is not a multiple of 4h ( Problem 1 ) ; Rjdi ( 10 6)=-0 , for the same reason ( Problem k ) ; Rhagdi ( 10 , 6)n=0 , because 10 is no multiple of 8h ( Problem b ) ; Rdgdi(l1 , 6)n=0 , because 10-n , ( n &gt; 2 ) is no multiple of 8h ( Problem c ) .
R"d ( 10 , 7)2= Jn]R2 +I)'di(10 , 6)-=Rdi(10 , 6 ) , because 10 is a multiple of 4h+2 ( Problems 1 , q ) ; -R ( 10 , 7 ) = he R12h+l)'i(10 , 7-e)n ( 2)l ' +1'+ &amp;c. ](Problem t ) , Ln2 all the remaining part of the expression vanishing ; for we shall presently see that n= 4 only in both these equations ; and R(^+3)di(10 , 7 ) has been proved above to be =0 , as have R2d(1 , 7 e)\ and Rjdr , 7-e)n also ; and R2^"gdi(O , 7-e)-=0 , because 7-e and 10-n are not multiples of 4h , unlessh= , =6 ; ( 2 ) , which makes equations ( A. ) ( n-2h X 4h 1 , 10=6+4.1 , and 7-e=6-2+4.--1,.- .
e=7 ; but R2agdi(0 , 0)6 has no existence , for if there are no diagonals the nucleus is the 10-gon itself .
R2hgdi(10 , 7e)n=0 ; for this can only be Rgd(10 , 7-e ) , for a n-2a reason just given ; but ( Problem c ) 7-e-6 is even , therefore e=1 , and as h=1 , = 4h equations ( A ' .
) become 10=6+.2(2+0)+4.0 , and k=6=6+2.2+4.--1 , i. e. in H , ao=O , so=2 , or a 4-gon has two diagonals not crossing , which is absurd .
Therefore RK^'+')di(O , 7-e ) , is what we have to determine for every value of h , e , and n. Now in R^di(10 , 7e ) ( Problem ' ) , when h is odd , 10 , 7-e and n are not all divisible by 2h if n &gt; 6 ; for n &lt; 10 .
And in REdi(10 , 7-e)6 , h is either 1 or 3 .
For h=3 the formula for RadT gives R3di(10 , 7-e)6=0 , because 0+6 is not integer ; and for h=1 , _2i 10=6+2.(a+a2+a3 ) 7-e=6+2 .
( e , +e2 +e3 ) ; the solutions are 2 -2=+1+0 , or =2+0+0 1-e-=2(0+0--1 ) , or =2(1-1-1 ) , or =2(0-1-1 ) , the second line of which is absurd , if e &lt; 3 .
But for e &gt; 2 , the multiplier -0 .
Therefore n is not 6 .
4 Let then n= 4 , and seek R^di(10 , 7-e)4 , for h odd .
If h= 1 , the formula for R4ndi 10+4 4 gives Rdi(10 , 7-e)4=0 , because is not integer .
Then -2 , h=l , and we have for e=1 , 10=4+2 .
( 2+ 1)=4+2(3+0 ) 6=4+2 ( 1+0)=4+2(2-1 ) , giving four solutions ; and for e=3 , the multiplier ) vanishes .
These four are then the only solutions , and 2(A2)=2D(4 , 1)D(3 , 0)+2D(5 , 2)=2(2+5)3=14 ; -whence ( , )4 ( 2R(i+)d10 , 6)4 { 14-(2Rld6 ) where ( i &gt; 0 ) .
Now R+L)di(10 , 6)4=0 ( Problem 1 ) , because 10 and 6 and 4 have no common measure 2(i+1 ) .
R'j ( 10 , 6)4=-0 ( Problem k ) , because 10 is not divisible by 4 .
R ^gdi ( 10 , 6)4=0 ( Problem b ) , because 10 is no multiple of 4i .
R2 , iagd ( 10 , 6)4=0 ( Problem c ) , because 10-4 is no multiple of 4i .
Therefore R((10 , 6)4= 14=7=Ro(10 , 7 ) , and R(10 , 7)=Rd(10 , 7)2+RdF(10 ; 7)=2Rd(10 , 6)4=14 .
LXXII .
We have next to determine P(10 , 7 ) , h &gt; l. The formule for P ( Problem u ) give P(10 , 7)30+ , because 3s o integer .
13(10 , 7)3=0 , because --iis no integer .
And ( Problem w ) 12(10 , 7)2= Zni2A2I ( 10 , 6)+42hag ( 10 , 6 ) } the quantities here omitted from the formula being R2hagdi(10 , 6)n=0 , because 10 is not divisible by 4h ( Problem e ) .
R2hag ( 10 , 6),.=0 , for the same reason ( Problems f , g , h ) .
R^hagdi(10 , 6 ) =0 , as it has been proved in the preceding article .
RKhagdi(10 , 6)n=0 , because 10 is not divisible by 4h ( Problem b ) .
R-hdi =R^i=O0 , for the same reason ( Problems k , 1 ) .
Now the equations of Problem u for I2(10 , 6)n are those of Problem 1 for R1(10 , 6 ) , , and we have proved in the preceding article that h=l and n=4 are the only values affording a solutionf ; which gives Y(An)= ( A2)= 14 .
Wherefore ( Problem w ) ( i &gt; 0 ) , P2(10 , 6)4=-014- &gt; :t( , ( j-+ljI(i+')2(0 , 6)4+ iR2i(K 6)4 ) } .
10 +4 The formula for P"(r , k)n shows that I4(10 , 6)4=0 , for + is not ilteger , and we have just proved that R2^(10 , 6 ) , =0 under every form except Ri^di(10 , 6 ) , , which remains to be determined .
In Problem d we see that , r-n-2h is divisible by 4h ; wherefore n=4 and A=1 .
Therefore , by the formula for Ri , R2adi(10 , 6)4= mR ' .
no(5 , 2)=Rmo(5 , 2 ) = 1 , as is easily verified .
Consequently 14-2 I2(10 , 6)4=-{1 4-R2agdi(10 , 6)4 =4 3 , and I ( 10 , 7)=I2(10 , 7 ) =4 -(10 , )4+-R 6)=6-+1=7 , whence , finally ( Problem x ) , 1(10o 7 ) ' 2Ii{D(10 , 7)L_ ?
R(fI 7 ) , 220P(10 , 7 ) } =-(1430-10.14-1 0 .

And this enumeration of the 8-partitions of the 10-gon agrees with that at p. 410 of my memoir mentioned in the first article .
It is evident that this last example would have caused far less trouble , if we had had our register of partitions filled up for inspection up to the 7-partitions of the 10-gon .
There is little difficulty , as I have verified to some extent , in framing , by the aid of the results here given , algebraical expressions , containing circulating functions for Rh(r , k ) and Ih(r , k ) , in terms of r and k only , and thence by addition , complete expressions of the ( 1 +k)-partitions of the r-gon .
But the subject has been pursued far enough for one communication .
The notation above employed for the partitions of the r-gon is applicable , with hardly any change , to express those of the r-ace .
An h-ly reversible ( l+k)-partition of the r-ace has h axial planes of reversion , which are acrorial , diachorial , or monochorial , according as they cut none , two , or one only of the faces ( Xwopia ) about the r-ace .
The k partitioning lines may conveniently be called diapipeds , or shorter , diapeds , being each in two planes about the r-ace , as a diagonal is in two summits of the r-gon .
Putting Ac , Di , and Mo , for achorial , diachorial and monochorial , we have the following account to give , N standing for the nucleus n-ace , of the ( 1+ k)-partitions of the r-ace : R112 .
