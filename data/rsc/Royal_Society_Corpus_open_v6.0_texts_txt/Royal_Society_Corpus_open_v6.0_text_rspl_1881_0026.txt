( Abstract .
) The method employed in this research to measure the velocity of light resembled the method of M. Fizeau , subsequently employed by M. Cornu .
A revolving toothed wheel is employed in the same way to alter the intensity of the light reflected from a distance .
In the present method , however , there are two distant reflectors instead of only one .
They are separated by a distance of a quarter of a mile .
The observing telescope and the two reflectors are almost in the same line .
The observer sees two stars of light which go through their phases with different periods as the toothed wheel is revolved at increasing speeds .
One star is increasing , while the other is diminishing , in intensity , with increase of speed of the toothed wheel .
The speed required to produce equality of the lights is determined by means of a chronograph .
By choosing such a speed as gives a maximum of one star at the same speed as a minimum of the other , a paii of observations eliminates all cause of doubt arising from varying brightness in the stars , and ratio of the width of a tooth to the width of a space .
The distances were observed by triangulation with the Ordnance Survey 18-inch theodolite , using as a base line a side of one of the Ordnance Survey triangles .
The source of light was an electric lamp .
The velocities ( uncorrected for rate * of clock , and reduction to a vacuum ) measured are as follows:\#151 ; 187,707 188,405 187,676 ' 186,457 185,788 186,495 187,003 186,190 186,830 187,266 188,110 188,079 VOL. XXXII .
Mean , 187,167 miles a second .
s Velocity of White and of Coloured Light .
The correction to vacunm is + 54 miles a second .
The correction for rate of clock to a mean solar time is + 52 miles a second .
The final results for the velocity of the light from an electric lamp in vacuo is 187,273 miles a second , or 301,382 kilometres a second .
Using Struve 's constant of aberration 20"-445 , we obtain for the solar parallax the value 8"'7 7 , and for the mean distance of the sun 93,223,000 miles .
On February 11th , 1881 , the reflected stars were seen to be coloured , one reddish , the other bluish .
The particular colour of a particular star depended upon the speed of rotation of the toothed wheel .
That star which was increasing with increase of speed of the toothed wheel was reddish , that one which was diminishing with increase of speed was bluish .
This seems to be caused by the fact that blue rays travel quicker than red rays .
A number of tests were made to judge of the accuracy of this conclusion , and they confirmed it .
In the final arrangements , the electric light was acted upon by a bisulphide of carbon prism , and part of a pure spectrum was used .
Differential measurements were then made to find the difference in velocity of rotation of the toothed wheel , required to produce equality of red and of blue lights .
The most convenient method was to use a driving weight slightly in excess of that required to produce equality of the light , then to fix to the pulley carrying the weights one end of a piece of stout india-rubber tubing , the other end being fixed to a point above .
This gradually diminished the effective driving weight .
The equality of red lights was first noted , the colour of the light was changed , and the interval of time until the blue lights were equal was measured .
The rate at which the india-rubber diminished the speed was afterwards measured by the aid of the chronograph , and thus the difference of speed determined .
The mean of 37 determinations in this and other ways gave the result that the difference in velocity between red and blue lights is about 1'8 per cent , of the whole velocity , blue travelling most rapidly .
The general conclusion seems to be supported by a comparison of the velocity of light measured by M. Cornu and Mr. Michelson , where the source of light usually employed is taken into consideration .
These are the only accurate measurements of the velocity of light hitherto published .
They give us the following results :\#151 ; Usual source of light .

llgllw All these results seem to support the view that the more refrangible the source of light , the greater is the velocity .
But the evidence of the present observations , indicating an excess of velocity for blue over red light , seeming to exceed 1 per cent , of the whole , must rest upon the merit of the present observations themselves .
