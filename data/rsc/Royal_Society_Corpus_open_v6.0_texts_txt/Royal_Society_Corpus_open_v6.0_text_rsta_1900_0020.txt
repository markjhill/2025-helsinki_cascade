Introduction .
The existence of a relation between the depression of the freezing point , produced by dissolving an acid or a salt in water , and the electrolytic conductivity of the solution thus obtained was pointed out by Arrhenius in 1887 , and has been the subject of much experiment and discussion since that date .
As is well known , the facts of electrolysis indicate that an electric current , when passing through a solution , is associated with a passage in opposite directions of the constituents of the salt .
Faraday called these mobile parts ions .
The number of the ions depends on the chemical nature of the salt , and is usually indicated by its formula .
Thus for one molecule of potassium chloride we have two ions , the potassium travelling in one direction and the chlorine in the other .
For barium chloride or sulphuric acid we have three ions , and , since the electric charge of an ion is proportional to its valency , the electrically equivalent weights of these substances are represented by JBaCl2 and JH2So4 , respectively .
The freezing point of water is depressed by equal amounts when molecularly equivalent weights of various non-electrolytes , such as cane-sugar or alcohol , are dissolved in it .
Equivalent quantities of electrolytes , however , produce greater effects .
Thus a gramme-molecule of potassium chloride causes nearly twice as much depression as a gramme-molecule of sugar , while the effect of barium chloride or sulphuric acid is almost three times as great as that of a non-electrolyte .
It will he noticed that the molecular depression of the freezing point is approximately proportional to the number of ions into which we must suppose the salt resolved in order to explain its electrical properties .
Again , if the concentration oi a solution be diminished by continual dilution , it is found that the conductivity decreases at a slower rate , so that a rise occurs in the value of the equivalent conductivity , a quantity which is defined as the conductivity of the solution divided by its concentration expressed in electrical gramme-equivalents .
This rise continues till the dilution has reduced the concentration to a value of about the ten-thousandth of a gramme-equivalent of the solute per litre of solution , after VOL. CXCIY.\#151 ; A 259 , 2 T 20.7.1900 which the equivalent conductivity reaches a limit .
Beyond this point further dilution causes no corresponding rise , and in the case of acids and alkalies eventually leads to a sudden decrease in the equivalent conductivity .
These variations are usually referred to changes in the percentage amount of the dissolved substance which is actively concerned in conveying the electric current , and it is easy to calculate what proportion of the whole quantity of such substance must be active in any given solution , for , if no other condition changes , it is measured by the ratio of the equivalent conductivity of the solution to its maximum value .
This ratio is therefore known as the coefficient of ionization .
In examining the freezing point phenomena , very similar variations are noticed .
The molecular depression is relatively greater in those solutions where the ionization is complete , or nearly complete , and relatively less where the conductivity shows that more of the salt is electrically inactive .
Whether this relation between the electrical ionization and the depression of freezing point is exact or only approximate is one of the most important questions in the present state of the theory of solution , and , although an enormous amount of experimental work has been devoted to the subject , it is still a question the answer to Avhich remains uncertain .
This uncertainty arises from two causes .
The first is the difficulty of determining the extremely small freezing-point depressions of very dilute solutions , and the second is the fact that most of the comparisons have been made with the ionization of solutions measured by Kohlrausch , Ostwald and others at temperatures of 18 ' or 25 ' Centigrade .
Now , unless the temperature coefficients of conductivity are the same for different concentrations of a solution , the ionization at 18 ' will not be the same for a definite concentration as the ionization at 0 ' , with which it is evident that the freezing point phenomena should be compared .
As far as is known to the present writer , the only measurements of the ionization of electrolytic solutions which have been made at 0 ' are those of R. W. Wood.# He finds that the ionization of solutions of potassium chloride , sodium chloride , dichloracetic acid , and trichloracetic acid is , as long as the dilution is great , sensibly the same at 0 ' as it is at 18 ' , or , at all events , that the difference between the values at these temperatures is not enough to bring the conductivity measurements into harmony with the freezing point values .
The observations were only carried to a dilution such that one gramme-equivalent weight would be contained in 1024 litres .
This is insufficient to give the limiting values of the molecular conductivity directly , so " the value expressing the conductivity of infinitely dilute solutions was calculated by means of the temperature coefficient from the values found by Kohlrausch and Ostwald for 18 ' and 25 ' .
" Apparently this process must involve a certain amount of extrapolation , for the * 'Zeitschrift fiir Phys. Chemie , ' vol. 18 , p. 3 , 1895 .

DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
323 temperature coefficients of the conductivity of electrolytes vary greatly , as either the concentration or the temperature is changed .
The numbers which follow show this clearly for the case of barium chloride .
The measurements were made by determining the conductivity of the solutions between 0 ' and 18 ' at intervals of about 2 ' ; the figures were carefully plotted orl a diagram , and the value of the tangent to the curve estimated at several points .
The following temperature coefficients were thus obtained :\#151 ; Solution I.\#151 ; Concentration == 0*0004 gramme-equivalent per thousand grammes of solution .

This variation is also shown in some numbers given by Kohlrausch* for the conductivity of potassium chloride solutions of different concentrations .
For a normal solution , the conductivity at 0 ' is 0*06541 , and at 18 ' is 0*09822 , the ratio of these numbers being 1*50 .
For a solution whose concentration is xio normal , the corresponding figures are 0*000776 and 0*001225 , giving a ratio of 1*58 .
Thus , in each case , the difference in conductivity between 0 ' and 18 ' is greater for the more dilute solution .
Now the conductivity of a solution depends on two factors : ( l ) the amount of ionization , ( 2 ) the velocities with which the ions move while active .
These velocities are increased by heating the solution , owing to a decrease in what we may term the ionic viscosity , and at extreme dilution , when , in such salts as potassium or barium chloride at any rate , the ionization is practically * * Annalcn tier Physik und Chcmie , ' N.F. vol. G4 , p. 441 , 1898 .
complete , the temperature coefficient of conductivity is determined by the change in the velocities only .
Since the temperature coefficient decreases as the concentration increases , it must follow that , in the case of these salts , the effect of temperature on the ionization is of opposite sign to its effect on velocity , so that heating the solutions decreases their ionization .
The curves giving the variation of ionization with concentration at 18 ' will , therefore , be more steeply inclined to the axis of concentration than the curves for the same quantity at 0 ' , and , in order to get satisfactory comparisons with freezing point measurements , it is necessary to make conductivity measurements at 0 ' , and to carry the dilution to such an extent that the limiting value of the equivalent conductivity can be directly estimated .
This point will be again considered later , and ionization curves given for 18 ' as well as for the freezing point .
The measurements of the freezing points of dilute solutions which have been hitherto made show great divergences when the values obtained by different observers are compared , though the results of any one observer often agree well among themselves .
The experimental knowledge of this side of the question must be regarded as even more unsatisfactory than that of the electrical conductivity .
In the course of the year 1897 , Mr. E. H. Griffiths and the present writer undertook the further experimental investigation of the subject .
Mr. Griffiths arranged to make the freezing point determinations by the method of platinum resistance thermometry .
The following paper contains an account of the corresponding measurements of the electrical conductivities .
Mr. Griffiths proposes to publish a separate account of his experiments when finished , and this will be followed by a joint comparison of the two lines of research .
Section 1.\#151 ; On the Preparation of the Solutions .
In investigations of the variation of electrical conductivity with concentration , it has been usual to begin with a solution of the maximum concentration required , and to gradually dilute it till the desired limit was reached .
This method involves the use of a very large volume of water , the quality of which must be constant .
It also involves the pouring of the solutions into and out of the electrolytic cell at each dilution .
Impurities are always liable to enter the liquids during this operation , especially when , as in this investigation , the temperature of the liquids is so low that aqueous vapour from the air must be condensed on their surfaces .
The alternative method of beginning with the pure solvent and gradually adding weighed quantities of a stock solution , seemed , on the whole , better suited to the case .
The conductivity of the actual sample of solvent used for the solutions could then be determined for each series of observations , and , since the addition of the successive amounts of stock solution could be made in the electrolytic cell itself , the necessity of pouring the liquids backwards and forwards would be obviated .
This not only eliminated errors due to the taking up of impurities , but also effected a DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
325 valuable saving of time which would otherwise have been lost in cooling each solution after it had been diluted and returned to the cell .
It had at first been intended to transfer each solution from the freezing point apparatus to that in which the resistance was to be measured , or versed , so that experiments for the determination of both constants might be made on identical solutions .
This could not be done if a series of solutions was made up in either apparatus itself .
But the advantage to be obtained is not so great as at first sight appears , since it is unwise to move dilute solutions through air , or to cool them more often than necessary .
Moreover , by using water prepared in the same way for each series of experiments , and adding stock solution by similar methods , it seemed that strictly comparable results would be obtained .
Section 2.\#151 ; On the Electrolytic Cell .
Having settled , then , that the solutions were to be prepared separately in the two sets of apparatus , it remained to devise a cell to contain the liquids while their resistances were being measured .
It seemed likely that some of the discrepancies between the results of different measurements of freezing points might be due to the action of glass dissolved from the containing vessel .
It was therefore decided to carry out the freezing point work in platinum vessels only , and to preserve both the water used and the solutions from all contact with glass .
Similar precautions were therefore taken in the resistance measurements .
The following conditions had to be satisfied in the design of the apparatus :\#151 ; 1 .
The cell itself and all parts which might by any means touch the liquids contained in it must be of platinum .
2 .
There must be two insulated platinum electrodes , rigidly fixed relatively to each other .
Since the vessel was to be made of a conducting substance , it was evident that its walls must be used as one of the electrodes .
3 .
Small changes in the level of the liquid must not appreciably affect the electrical constant of the cell .
4 .
The temperature of the vessel and its contents must be under easy and efficient control .
5 .
Means of emptying and filling the cell must be provided , and also of adding stock solution to the cell when in position .
6 .
Stirring apparatus must be arranged to secure uniform temperature , and to mix the stock solution when added with the former contents of the cell .
After many alterations and one complete reconstruction , the apparatus assumed the form shown in section ( fig. 1 ) .
The walls ( a)of the platinum vessel are used as one electrode , a platinum cage suspended near its centre , forms the other .
This cage , consisting of a short hollow cylinder , is attached by means of four arms to a platinum tube which passes out through a wide aperture in the top of the vessel , and is rigidly fitted into a longer brass tube ( c ) .
The brass sheath is kept in place by ebonite rings ( shaded in the drawing ) , and , with all it supports , is therefore insulated from the platinum vessel .
o - - - a- - A platinum umbrella , attached to the vertical tube , overhangs the opening into the cell , without touching its sides , and thus prevents any dust or other foreign matter from falling into the solution .
Inside the vertical platinum support carrying the cage is fixed a pierced gold DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
327 plug ( g)y through which a central platinum tube can freely revolve .
The top of this platinum is firmly attached to a brass sheath passing through a steel bearing .
The bearing is carried by an ebonite plug , fixed in a horizontal brass arm ( ) , which is supported from the outside of the apparatus by a rigid vertical rod .
The whole central system then can revolve round a vertical axis , the steel ring at the top and the gold plug below acting as bearings .
The use of this central tube is twofold .
In it a mercury thermometer , graduated to y^-th of a centigrade degree , is placed , contact with the platinum walls being secured by the addition of a few drops of mercury .
Secondly , it serves as the shaft of a platinum screw ( / ) , shaped like a ship 's propeller , which , when it revolves , causes a downward current of water through the platinum cage , and thus mixes the whole volume of solution .
The shaft bears an ebonite wheel at its top , which is turned when necessary by a hand wheel and cord .
A second opening gives access to the interior of the cell , and a platinum tube ( h)t about 8 millims. in diameter , springs vertically upwards from it .
This tube has an outer brass case , which can be closed by a stopper made of a piece of glass rod covered with india-rubber tubing .
When the stopper is in its place , no air can enter the cell by this passage , and the only connection between the interior and the atmosphere is at the top of the central screw shaft .
How to close this aperture was a problem of some difficulty .
If the shaft were allowed to revolve in a simple hole , it would have been apt to grind away fragments , which would have fallen into the liquid below , while if the opening were left free , moist air would enter and water , condensing inside the cold tube , would run down into the platinum vessel .
In order to prevent any such effects , the arrangement represented in the figure was adopted .
A brass ring with a rim projecting downwards , is fixed to the central shaft , and revolves with it .
The rim fits loosely , without touching , into a groove cut in a brass collar which lines the inside of the brass supporting tube .
Any air then has to pass over these cold metal surfaces before it can enter the apparatus , and if any moisture is condensed , it is caught in the groove and can be removed .
The platinum vessel and the vertical tubes fixed to its roof , are surrounded with a stout brass case , a thin air-space being left between them .
In this air-space the cooling apparatus is disposed .
It consists of a shallow rectangular box , placed below the platinum vessel , into which a tube is led through the outer brass case .
The tube ends in a nozzle opening near the bottom of the case , and through it a small quantity of ether can be introduced .
Dry air is then sucked through ; the ether evaporates , and its vapour passes with the current of air along a spiral coil of tubing which closely surrounds the platinum vessel .
The evaporation absorbs heat , and the temperature of the whole apparatus slowly falls .
The outer brass case is fixed by means of three projecting arms in a large copper tank of about 30 litres capacity , which can be filled with broken ice .
The tank is placed in a large rectangular box of wood and covered by a lid when measurements are being made .
The apparatus is filled from a platinum vessel , which is an exact model on a larger scale of the filling machine used to add stock solution and is shown in fig. 2 .
The vessel is arranged to hold 250 grammes of water , and about that quantity is collected in it and accurately weighed .
The long limb of the vessel being introduced into the cell , a slight increase of pressure is given by removing the platinum stopper and placing a tube of thick india-rubber lightly on its top .
At the other end of the india-rubber is a glass tube , part of which is packed tightly with cotton wool .
A slight puff of air at the glass tube is then sufficient to start the water siphoning over into the cell .
This goes on till the whole quantity of water has entered the cell .
Fig. 2 .
The water is then left for some hours till its temperature has sunk nearly to the freezing point .
This process can be much accelerated if desirable by the ether apparatus .
It is then necessary to adjust the level of the liquid .
This is done by means of the glass emptying vessel ( shown in fig. 3 ) , through the cork of which pass two tubes .
One of them is connected by means of india-rubber with another glass tube , which carries a short piece of very fine platinum tubing at its end .
The bore of this is so small that a fine needle will only just enter it .
The glass stem will pass into the platinum tube which forms the side entrance to the cell in fig. 1 .
At its upper end is fixed a glass ring which is too big to enter , and lies on the top of the platinum .
When this ring is pressed home , the bottom of the fine platinum tube is in a perfectly definite position inside the cell .
In order that it should always withdraw to exactly the same level , it is necessary that the DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING TOINT .
329 exhaust pump applied should give a constant ( negative ) pressure .
This is secured hy the means shown in fig. 4 .
The exhaust pump is connected with one arm ( a ) of a T-piece , the other arm ( 6 ) going to the emptying vessel , and the leg ( c ) passing through the cork of a tall glass bottle .
This cork is also pierced by a second tube ( d ) open to the air above , which dips a certain fixed distance below the level of the water in the bottle .
When the pump works , a constant stream of bubbles passes through , thus keeping the pressure equal to that of the water column .
By this means liquid is sucked up from the cell into the emptying vessel , and the quantity in the cell when the operation is over , is found to be the same on different occasions to within one or two-tenths of a gramme .
Since the whole quantity is more than 200 grammes , this gives an accuracy greater than one in a thousand .
( See p. 333 .
) Stock solution is added by means of the apparatus shown in fig. 2 .
A quantity of solution is placed in the platinum vessel and accurately weighed .
According to circumstances the quantity varies from '25 to 20 grammes .
The long platinum siphon is then inserted into the cell , and a slight pressure applied by placing the india-rubber tube , already described , on the neck of the vessel .
The solution then runs over , and the last drops are ejected by another gentle blow .
The filling vessel is removed and reweighed , the liquid is mixed by means of the hand wheel and cord , and the apparatus is ready for an observation .
Section 3.\#151 ; On the Surface of the Electrodes .
It is usual in experiments on the resistance of electrolytes to coat the electrodes with a layer of platinum black , the result of which is to increase the effective area of the plates , and so diminish polarization .
In the telephone method , this platinization is necessary , for without it silence cannot be obtained by adjusting the Wheatstone 's bridge , except , perhaps , in the case of very highly resisting solutions .
Platinized electrodes , however , are troublesome to use at high dilution .
They seem to have the power of extracting the salt from a solution , and of condensing it on their surfaces .
Thus , if a dilute solution be placed in a cell with clean platinized electrodes , the resistance will rise for some time\#151 ; the concentration of the solution seems to get less .
If the solution be removed , and pure water , or a solution more dilute than the first , be substituted for it , some of this occluded salt seems to come out , and the resistance of the cell falls .
Now the galvanometer used in this work is much less liable to disturbance by VOL. oxciv.\#151 ; a. 2 u r_-~A polarization effects than the telephone indicator , and it was hoped that , considering the large area of the electrodes , platinization might be unnecessary .
Measurements were therefore made with the bright platinum surfaces .
It was , however , found that , while the results were satisfactory at extreme dilution , the resistances came out higher than they ought as the concentration of the solutions increased .
The cell was therefore platinized by passing a current from two accumulator cells backwards and forwards between the electrodes through a solution of platinum chloride containing a little lead acetate.# It then became very difficult to keep the resistance of a dilute solution constant .
It either slowly increased owing to absorption of salt by the electrodes , or slowly diminished as the absorbed salt was given out again to the solution .
Mr. Griffiths suggested that the surface obtained by heating platinum black might answer the purpose required .
When heated to redness , a platinized surface becomes of a dull grey colour , and apparently loses its spongy texture .
It gives , however , a rough surface , the area of which is much greater than that of a bright polished plate .
The cell was dismounted , and the platinum portion heated for some time to bright redness in a large blow-pipe flame .
The surface thus obtained seemed to be quite satisfactory .
The absorption effects were apparently done away , and the area of the electrode was large enough to make it possible to measure resistances as low as 10 ohms .
Thus , in one apparatus , resistances varying from 10 to 50,000 ohms were easily measurable to an accuracy of one part in a thousand .
Section 4.\#151 ; On the Measurement o f the Electrical Resistance .
Since very dilute solutions were to be examined in a platinum apparatus , the method of direct currents applied successfully by Stroud and Henderson !
to the measurement of electrolytic resistances could not be adopted , and alternating currents had to be used .
The application of these by Kohlrausch , Ostwald , and others , a telephone acting as indicator , is too well known to need description , but the method adopted in these experiments , in which the telephone is replaced by a galvanometer , is not so common .
It was first described by Fitzpatrick , J and the commutator used by him was lent by the Cavendish Laboratory for the earlier part of the present work .
An instrument of improved design was afterwards employed , which is represented m fig. 5 .
A vulcanite drum , revolving round a horizontal axis , has , near each end of its circumference , a series of brass strips fitted into it , alternate strips at each end * Lurnmer and Kurlbaum , 'Ann .

DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
331 being in electrical connection with each other , and with one of two brass rings which are fitted in vulcanite beds on to the axis of the drum .
A pair of wire brushes are brought into contact with the brass rings , and another pair touch the strips as they revolve .
The leads from a single dry cell are connected with the first pair , and the second pair are led to the places on a box of resistance coils at which the battery wires are usually attached in the Wheatstone 's bridge arrangement The drum was at first made to revolve by means of an electric motor ; a hand-wheel was afterwards found more convenient .
Thus the current from the battery is made to alternate rapidly before it reaches the box of coils .
The other end of the drum is arranged in an exactly similar manner , except that the brass strips are rather narrower , and the intervening areas of vulcanite rather broader .
One pair of brushes is connected with the galvanometer terminals of the Wheatstone 's bridge , and the other pair with the terminals of the galvanometer itself .
Thus the galvanometer connections are alternated synchronously with those of the battery , the galvanometer being taken out of circuit a little before the battery , and thrown into circuit a little later .
By this means the current , which alternates while it is passing through the electrolytic cell , is again made direct before it reaches the galvanometer , the deflection of which can therefore he used as an indication of the direction in which the resistances must be changed in order to get a balance .
The galvanometer used was made on the D'Arsonval principle , and was constructed by Messrs. Nalder Bros. This type has important advantages over the Thomson form .
It is quite sensitive enough for the present purpose ; its freedom from magnetic disturbances is useful ; above all , the large moment of inertia and slow period of swing of the suspended portions prevent small residual periodic disturbances from annoying the observer .
This enables very low resistances to be measured .
When thus arranged the method is very satisfactory .
All periodic disturbances , 2 u 2 such as those due to self-induction or electrostatic capacity , are eliminated as soon as a certain speed of the drum is attained , and beyond this speed variations in angular velocity throughout a very wide range can be made without appreciably changing the measured resistance .
The only effect of such disturbances is to make the galvanometer unsteady when the resistance of the solution falls below a certain value ( about 10 ohms in the apparatus used ) , and to make it rather less sensitive when a very high resistance is measured , such as that of the water used as solvent .
This latter effect is chiefly due to the electrostatic capacity of the resistance coils as usually wound , and it has been reduced by the employment of a new set of coils specially wound in sections by Messrs. Elliott Brothers , as described by Chaperon , * which enables higher resistances to be accurately measured .
As the drum revolves , very considerable thermo-electromotive forces are set up at the contact of the brushes with the commutator , but these do not affect the galvanometer when the drum is in motion , for the currents due to them are reversed so rapidly that they produce no resultant deflection .
This can be proved as follows .
The galvanometer is disconnected from the circuit , and its position of equilibrium observed .
It is then connected up again , and , if the drum has lately been at work , and the resistances in the circuit are low , a considerable deflection , due to the thermal effects , is observed while the drum is at rest .
The drum is then revolved , and the galvanometer will be found to return to its normal equilibrium position .
The success of the method of electrical measurement is best shown by the constancy of the observed resistance of a solution when the current through it is changed , or an alteration made in the ratio between the arms of the Wheatstone 's bridge .
As an example the following numbers are taken from experiments on a barium chloride solution :\#151 ; Resistance in battery circuit .

The freezing point of a solution gives , as we have seen , a means of calculating the ionization of the solute at that particular temperature .
In order that the ionization as calculated from the electrical data should be strictly comparable with this , the ratio of the value of the equivalent conductivity of the given solution to that at * 'Comptes Rendus , ' vol. 108 , p. 799 , 1899 .
DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
333 infinite dilution should be found for the temperature of the freezing point of the solution .
It is simpler , however , to measure all the conductivities at the freezing point of water , and to refer them to the limiting value of the equivalent conductivity at that temperature .
The freezing point of the strongest solution used is less than a tenth of a degree below zero , and , since the temperature coefficient of conductivity only changes very slowly as the concentration of the solution alters , the maximum error introduced by this simplification will be less than the unavoidable errors of experiment .
Section 6.\#151 ; On the Testing of the Apparatus .
Insulation of the Electrodes.\#151 ; While the cell was empty it was connected up in series with a dry battery and the galvanometer .
This was repeated at intervals throughout the work .
Sometimes no deflection could be seen , sometimes the movement was just visible .
In either case , the leakage between the electrodes was negligible for the purposes of the experiments .
Adjustment of the Liquid in the Cell to a Constant to pieces , dried by a current of hot air , and put together again .
About 230 to 250 grammes of water were run in from the large platinum filling machine , which was weighed before and after the operation .
The water was then cooled to within half a degree of the freezing point , and the emptying machine weighed and placed in position .
The exhaust apparatus was next worked at a constant pressure of about a foot of water , till no more water came out of the cell .
The increase in weight gave the water withdrawn , and this , subtracted from the weight put in , gave the final weight of water in the cell .
In order to test the constancy of this weight ( .
, the accuracy of the levelling ) , a weighed quantity of water was introduced by means of the small filling machine , and again withdrawn into the emptying vessel .
If all is well , the weight withdrawn should equal that added , and the weight of water left in the cell should keep the same when this process is repeated .
The volume of the cell has to be redetermined whenever it is taken to pieces for cleaning or any other purpose .
Details of one such determination are given below .
The importance of keeping the withdrawing pressure small and constant is well shown by this example .
In the third experiment , by an accident , the full force of the water pump was used , and a variation of nearly half a gramme in the weight of water left in the cell was the result .
When more water was added , and a new withdrawal made with the regulator , it will be seen that the right level was again obtained , August 7 , 1899 .

Constancy of Resistance of the Solvent.\#151 ; During the early stages of the work it was found impossible to keep the resistance of the water in the cell at a constant value for any length of time , rapid increase in conductivity always appearing .
This change occasioned great difficulties , in fact months were given to the investigation of its cause and cure .
It seemed to be due to the gradual absorption of traces of impurity ( such as carbonic acid , \amp ; c. ) from the atmosphere , for whenever a fresh quantity of air found its way into the apparatus , the resistance fell for some time , the fall being quicker when the screw was kept in continual motion .
It was therefore found advisable to fill the cell for some time before using it , for while the contents were cooling , air was of course being drawn in , and , until all the impurities in that volume of air had been absorbed , no constancy of resistance could be obtained .
Again , when the contents were levelled , water was drawn out , and , therefore , air entered to replace it , and this also caused variation for some little time .
This leakage of air also occurred when salt had been added , chiefly at the moments when stock solution was being introduced into the cell .
Its effect was to change the form of the ionization curves for dilute solutions , the impurities as they gradually accumulated DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
335 causing a rise in the apparent equivalent conductivity till the quantity of salt added was so great that the error became unimportant .
The apparatus was eventually moved to a room in which no gas flames were allowed , and the cell more carefully shielded from the atmosphere .
Much greater constancy in the resistance of the solvent was thus obtained , though even after the removal a slight deterioration in quality sometimes appeared .
As an example of a rather bad case the following numbers may be given .
They show the resistance of the water used as solvent for a series of solutions of potassium chloride .

The freezing point of water on the thermometer as used was + 0*08 , and this resistance corresponds to 33818 at that temperature .
The reciprocal of this number , viz. , 2*957 X 10-5 , may be taken as a measure ( in arbitrary cell units ) of the conductivity of the solvent ; it has to be subtracted from the corresponding value for the solutions .
The constancy , was usually greater than this , and it was found that water could be added from the filling machine without changing the measured resistance , except by the small amount due to the increase in volume of the liquid and the slight rise in temperature caused by the addition of warmer water .
This is shown by the following figures:\#151 ; July 30 .

Section 7.\#151 ; On the Preparation of the Water .
Great difficulties occurred in getting water of quality good enough for the experiments .
The process finally adopted was as follows : Tap water was boiled to precipitate calcium carbonate , and filtered through paper .
It was mixed with potash and potassium permanganate till the colour became a deep purple , and then distilled from a copper still .
The water ( No. 1 ) so obtained was redistilled from a big Jena glass flask with a much smaller quantity of alkaline permanganate .
The product ( No. 2 ) of this operation was placed in a large platinum still , a very small quantity of acid potassium sulphate was added , and the water ( No. 3 ) was slowly collected in platinum vessels .
The platinum still stood on a screen of sheet copper in order to shield it from the products of combustion of the gas burner .
In all the distillations the first and last portions of water obtained were rejected , together about one-third of the whole .
The water thus prepared , when measured in the platinum cell at 18 ' , had an average conductivity of about *9 X 10~15 C.G.S. unit .
The best water obtained by Kohlrausch* by distillation in air had a conductivity at the same temperature of *7 X 10-15 , while by distilling in vacuo a value as low as '2 X S ection 8.\#151 ; On the Preparation o f the Stock Solutions .
Miss D. Marshall was good enough to prepare some of the stock solutions for the early part of the work , and Mr. H. J. H. F enton kindly allowed most of those used in the later experiments to be made up under his advice by Mr. George Hall , at the Cambridge University Chemical Laboratory .
Details of the methods are given in Section 11 , under the heading of each substance .
The concentration of these solutions was in general about one-third to one-half normal .
They were made up and kept in Jena glass flasks accurately stoppered .
Glass is less soluble in salt and acid solutions than in pure water , and , under any circumstances , the small quantities * Kohlrausch und Holborn , *Leitvermogen der Electrolyte , ' p. 111 .

DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
337 of these strong solutions ultimately used , make the use of glass harmless for the purpose of storing them .
A second stock solution ( b ) was then prepared from one of these About 2 grammes of ( a)were weighed out in the small filling machine , and a platinum bottle .
Water of the same quality as that to be used as solvent in the platinum cell was then added till a dilution of about one in forty was reached .
This gave to solution ( b ) a concentration of about one-hundredth enabled a solution of about one hundred-thousandth normal to be obtained in the cell by the addition of about " 25 of a gramme of stock solution .

137*4 Section 9.\#151 ; On the Method of Experimenting .
The method of conducting a series of measurements was as follows :\#151 ; The cell was thoroughly washed , water being put in and sucked out with an airpump several times .
The copper tank was then filled with broken ice , and about 250 grammes of water of the best quality were run into the cell , which was then left for several hours till the temperature of the contents had sunk nearly to zero .
It was found advisable to fill the cell the evening before an experiment was made , and leave the water in it for the night .
The level of the water was adjusted with the emptying apparatus , and its temperature lowered , if necessary , by evaporating ether through the spiral coils , till it stood within one-tenth of a degree of zero .
The resistance was then measured at intervals of five minutes , the screw being worked between each observation .
The conductivity of the solvent having reached a practically constant value , a small quantity ( usually about *25 of a gramme ) of stock solution ( was placed in the filling machine , and run into the cell .
As soon as it had entered , the screw was turned till mixture was complete .
This , it was found , was usually the case after about six revolutions of the hand wheel , but more were generally given .
A resistance measurement was then made and repeated at intervals while the weighings necessary for the next experiment were being performed .
The value of the resistance should be practically constant throughout .
A second quantity of stock solution ( b ) was then added and the process repeated , VOL. CXCIV.\#151 ; A. 2 X the amounts being gradually increased , till the whole quantity of stock solution ( b ) in the cell was about 10 grammes .
The liquid had then to be levelled .
It was at first intended to add larger quantities of a weaker stock solution and to level the liquid for each observation , but it soon became evident that the errors would be much reduced in all directions if this mode of procedure was abandoned , and a correction for level applied to the measured resistance .
This correction was determined by experiment , and , in the final state of the cell , was found to be *31 per cent , for each gramme of liquid in the cell above the normal amount .
By this means it was only necessary to level when the total quantity added amounted to about 10 grammes , and the consequent change of level in the liquid in the cell was about one quarter of a centimetre .
Thus one or two levellings were usually enough for a complete set of observations on any one substance .
When the quantity of solution ( b ) added to the liquid in the cell reached about 10 grammes , it became possible to use solution ( a ) , for the equivalent quantity of that solution was about *25 gramme , an amount which could be weighed with care to the necessary accuracy of one part in a thousand .
By the time that about 10 grammes of ( a ) had been added , the resistance had usually sunk to the value at which accurate measurement became impossible , and the experiments were stopped .
At intervals throughout the experiments it was necessary to adjust the temperature by means of the ether apparatus .
It was generally possible to keep the solutions within the limits of a tenth of a degree above or below zero .
While small quantities of solution were being added it was not necessary to cool between each experiment , but when a gramme or more of liquid at the temperature of the room was run in , the liquid in the cell was heated through several tenths of a degree , and had always to be cooled by the ether apparatus .
These opportunities were taken to determine temperature coefficients for the small corrections necessary on the observed values of the resistances .
Section 10.\#151 ; On the Reduction o f the Observations .
1 .
Calculation of the Concentration.\#151 ; The weight of the stock solution ( added for the first experiment is multiplied by its concentration in terms of gramme-equivalents of solute per gramme of solution .
This gives the number of gramme-equivalents of solute present in the cell .
The weight of solution in the cell is equal to the weight of water left after levelling ( which is known from separate and preliminary experiments ) plus the weight of stock solution added , and the weight of solvent is equal to the weight of solution minus the weight of solute added .
Thus the concentration of the solution can be calculated in terms of gramme-equivalents of solute per thousand grammes of solution or per thousand grammes of solvent .
These values are sensibly the same while the solutions are dilute , and the difference only becomes appreciable for the two or three strongest solutions of each set .
Throughout this DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
339 paper the strengths are referred to 1000 grammes of solution .
Let us denote this concentration by the symbol m. When a second quantity of solution is put into the cell , we have to add the amount of solute in it to the amount already present in the cell in order to calculate m. It will be noticed that , as long as we simply add successive quantities of stock solution without withdrawal , the values of m , calculated in terms of weights , are independent of any contraction on mixing the liquids .
If this contraction is appreciable , we shall find that , when we come to level the solution , the weight withdrawn is a little less than the total weight of stock solution added .
From a knowledge of the weight withdrawn , however , we can deduce the weight left in the cell , and this is the weight we must use in subsequent calculations .
The results will then be independent of any contraction which may have occurred .
From the value of the concentration in terms of the weight of solvent , we can calculate the number of solvent molecules which are present to each molecule of solute .
The molecular weight of water being 18 , the number required is the reciprocal of mX or for those substances like potassium chloride in which the molecular is also the electrically equivalent weight , and for bodies such as sulphuric acid , whose equivalents are J-H2S04 , \amp ; c. , its value is 2 X These values are tabulated as N in the final results .
2 .
Calculation of the Conductivity.\#151 ; The mean value of the resistance of a given solution in the cell and the mean temperature at which the measurements were made are calculated from the observations .
The temperature is usually within a tenth of a degree of zero , so that an approximate knowledge of the temperature coefficient is enough to enable the resistance at the freezing point to be deduced with sufficient accuracy .
This value has then to be corrected for the level .
The liquid in the cell stands higher than it did at the beginning , or after the last withdrawal , by an amount proportional to the total weight of solution which has subsequently been added .
It is known that 1 gramme withdrawn from the liquid increases the measured resistance by '31 per cent. , so that it is easy to calculate what the resistance would be in each case if the solution were levelled by means of the withdrawing apparatus .
The value thus found is entered as II in the tables of results .
Its reciprocal is a measure , in arbitrary units , of the conductivity of the solution , and , if the corresponding value for the conductivity of the solvent is subtracted from it , we have a measure of the conductivity of the solute at a given dilution , on the assumption that the conductivity of a mixture is equal to the sum of the conductivities of its constituents .
This supposition is always correct for salts like potassium chloride , \amp ; c. , in which conductivity is proportional to concentration at great dilution , for in stronger solutions the correction for the solvent becomes inappreciable .
For solutions of acids , 2 x 2 we shall find that at extreme dilution the equivalent conductivity decreases rapidly as concentration is reduced , and in such cases perhaps the best way for the present would be to make no correction for the solvent , but to wait until more about its action is understood .
But the equivalent conductivities of acids are much greater than those of salts , owing to the high velocity of the hydrogen ion , and in them the correction for the solvent is therefore smaller .
And so to preserve uniformity , the correction is made in the measurements on sulphuric acid which follow .
Its effect will not appreciably change the general direction of the curve giving the results .
Having thus determined the value of the concentration and of the conductivity k of the substance dissolved , we get k/ m , the equivalent conductivity .
In order to express the results in a visible form , we may plot a curve with the values of k/ m as ordinates , and the values of ( a number proportional to the average nearness of the molecules of solute ) as abscissae .
This gives a curve in which the very dilute portion is not crowded together as it would be if we took the values of m itself as abscissae , and , moreover , the fact that most of the curves so drawn come out as straight lines for the greater part of their length seems to indicate that there are theoretical as well as practical reasons for choosing this method .
The form of these curves is similar to that of the corresponding ionization curves shown in the diagrams .
It will be seen that as the concentration of a solution gets smaller , the value of k/ m approaches a limiting value .
Its maximum can easily be determined from the curve in such cases as potassium chloride or barium chloride , where the slope of the curve is comparatively small and the limit is reached at moderate dilutions .
In cases such as those of potassium bichromate and potassium ferricyanide , the maximum values are more uncertain , and this uncertainty is transferred to the ionization curves deduced from them .
The maximum value having been estimated , the coefficient of ionization , a , is calculated for each solution by dividing the equivalent conductivity by its maximum value , and the curves given below show the results obtained by plotting the ionizations as ordinates and the values of m* as abscissae .
It will be noticed that , in order to get these ionization coefficients for a solution of any given concentration , it is not necessary to know the absolute value of the equivalent conductivity .
For the purposes of these experiments , then , there was no need to measure the constant of the electrolytic cell .
To do so satisfactorily would have involved a redetermination each time the cell was dismounted .
The approximate values of the equivalent conductivities have , nevertheless , been calculated for convenience of reference ; but it must be understood that their accuracy is not supposed to be as great as that of the ionizations , which are quite independent of their absolute values .

341 the observations were recorded , full details from the laboratory note-book are given on p. 342 , for a set of measurements on sulphuric acid .
This set is chosen as a fair example of the usual degree of constancy among the measurements of resistance .
It is also shorter than any of the others , owing to the fact that sulphuric acid had been investigated in the preliminary experiments , and could thus be disposed of in a fewer number of observations .
Four other solutions , stronger than any of this set , were afterwards made up , and their resistances determined in a Jena glass cell .
The results of these are included in the final table on p. 343 .
Sulphuric Acid ( prepared at the Chemical Laboratory).\#151 ; A quantity of redistilled sulphuric acid was taken , and the percentage of H2S04 found .
Then a known weight of S03 was obtained , and the calculated quantity of the sulphuric acid was added to bring it up to 100 per cent. H2S04 .
The acid was then cooled till crystals separated , and the remaining liquid was drained away .
This operation was repeated four times , and finally gave crystals melting at +10 '5 ' C. Four estimations of the concentration of the solution prepared were made with the following results :\#151 ; Weight of Weight of Grammes of H2SO4 per gramme solution .

351 a continuous mark has been made ; where the curvature becomes appreciable , a dotted line has been drawn .
The divergences of individual observations from the smoothed curves indicate the probable errors of experiment .
Reasons have already been given for supposing that the ionization at the freezing point differs from that at higher temperatures by an amount which varies as the concentration of the solutions changes .
In order to directly compare the values of the ionization for different temperatures , the equivalent conductivities as given by Kohlrausch* for sulphuric acid , potassium chloride , barium chloride and copper sulphate have been taken , and the ionizations at different concentrations calculated from them .
The results are placed on the diagrams as crosses , X. It will be seen that the curves so obtained differ in each case from those giving the results of the present work at 0 ' , the ionization at 18 ' falling off more rapidly than at 0 ' as the concentration increases .
At the higher temperature , too , the dilution must be carried further than at the freezing point , in order to complete the ionization .
This again is to be expected , for as we have seen ( p. 323 ) , the general effect of heating a solution is to decrease its ionization .
It must be noticed that , although Kohlrausch 's concentrations are expressed in gramme-equivalents per litre of solution , while the present results are referred to a thousand grammes of solution , the difference produced in the curves by this difference in the method of reckoning is almost inappreciable ; in the case of sulphuric acid where it would be greatest , the change is invisible on the diagram till the last two solutions are reached .
In order to obtain a more direct comparison , and to eliminate any error due to difference of method , a series of measurements were made for copper sulphate at 18 ' in the present apparatus , the operations being conducted in precisely the same way within circles ( ^ ) in the diagram for that sa lt ; these are connected by a second curve .
It will be seen that , when this is done , the curves for 0 ' and 18 ' are nearly coincident while the concentration varies from the smallest value used to about '001 ( m ) \#151 ; 0T0 ) .
Beyond that value , the slant of the curve again becomes visibly greater for the higher temperature .
The results of Kohlrausch 's measurements for this substance ( also at 18 ' ) are shown on the diagram by plain crosses .
At very small concentrations they differ from those made by the present method at the same temperature by an appreciable amount ; but from about the point m = 2 X 10"8 ( m* -- T24 ) onwards , the two sets of results practically coincide , giving a curve much below that representing the ionization at the freezing point .
* Kohlrausch 's latest lists of conductivities ( 'Ann .
der Physik und Chem. , ' N.F. , vol. 66 , p. 811 , 1898 ) give the values as far as a maximum dilution of .0001 normal only .
This is not far enough to directly estimate the value corresponding to complete ionization .
The older numbers ( ' Wied .
Ann. , ' vol. 26 , p. 195 ) are therefore used .
They differ slightly in their absolute values from the new set , but this will not affect the ionization .
as those at 0 ' .
The results are shown by the crosses DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT .
353 It seems , therefore , that for an accurate comparison with satisfactory freezing point determinations , it is , as we supposed , necessary to use measurements of conductivity made at 0 ' .
This result justifies the amount of trouble and time expended on the present investigation , and the comparison with Mr. Griffiths ' promised measurements seems likely to give important information .
In comparing the diagrams for different substances , several results become evident .
The normal type of curve is apparently that shown in the cases of potassium chloride , barium chloride , \amp ; c. , in which the ionization increases as dilution proceeds and eventually reaches a maximum .
On further dilution , the curve remains a horizontal straight line , and it therefore seems right to conclude that the ionization has become complete .
The abnormal shape of the curves for acids , observed when their conductivities are measured at 18 ' or 25 ' in glass vessels , is seen to still represent the facts when the conductivities are measured at 0 ' in platinum .
At extreme dilution the equivalent conductivity falls off at a very rapid rate , and the cause of this fall , whatever it may be , is not removed by avoiding the use of glass or by taking the observations at the freezing point .
It has been usual to explain this phenomenon by action between the acid and the impurities present in the water ; the result of the action being to reduce the effective quantity of acid in solution by an amount which becomes appreciable at great dilution , the substances formed having a smaller conductivity than the acid .
The present experiments , however , seem to furnish a certain amount of evidence against this view .
The quantity of such impurity must be very small , and it is probable therefore that any action between it and the acid would be complete after the addition of the first quantity of acid , the amount of which must be large , reckoned in chemical equivalents , as compared with the total amount of impurity .
Now , if the action were complete at the first addition of acid , it would be possible to correct the results of the other additions for the conductivity of that portion of the acid put out of action by the influence of the impurities on the first instalment .
We ought to be able thus to get a curve agreeing in its general form with those of the normal type , which reach a maximum as the dilution is increased , and show no signs of falling off on further dilution .
The conductivity of the first solution , when reduced in the usual way , gives a value for i^ie ionization of '809 .
Let us calculate the conductivity required to raise this figure to LOCK ) .
It is = 11 '29 X m , 11 *29 being the maximum value of k/ m , corresponding to complete ionization ( seep .
340 ) , is 3*254 X 10-5 , so that k should be 3*673 X 10~4 .
It is , however , actually found to be 3*221 X 10-4 , so that the destruction of conductivity amounts to *452 X 10-4 .
Adding this value in the case of the second and following solutions , we get ionizations 1*006 , 1*016 , 1*017 , \amp ; c. , numbers much too high to give a horizontal curve .
In this connection it is interesting to study the case of potassium permanganate .
This salt is one which is particularly likely to react with the residual impurities of the VOL. CXCIV.--- A. 2 Z solvent , and the curve shows the same drop at extreme dilution as do the curves for acids , though in a less marked manner .
But , in this case , a correction made on the lines indicated above gives the results :\#151 ; oq = 1*000 a2 = 1*002 a3 = 1*000 a4 = 1*002 a. = 1*001 a6 = 0*999 a7 = 0*996 , \amp ; c. In this series the ionization of the first six solutions is constant , when corrected , to an accuracy of two parts in a thousand , which is within the limits of experimental error .
It is probable , therefore , that in the case of permanganate , the drop in the curve is caused by interaction between the salt and the residual impurities of the solvent , and that this action is completed by the first quantity of salt added .
In the case of acids , however , some other explanation is needed .
This result is confirmed by another phenomenon which would not have been discovered if the usual method of beginning with a strong solution and diluting it had been adhered to .
When the first quantity of stock solution is added to the solvent and mixed with it , in the case of solutions having normal curves the resistance settles at once to its final value , but when the drop occurs in the ionization curve , the resistance is found to rise for some considerable time after mixing is complete , as though the action which caused the diminution in conductivity required time for its completion .
This is illustrated by the following numbers :\#151 ; Barium Chloride .

12-54 -o -o i 687-9 12-56 o-oo 687-9 2 z 2 MR. W. C. D. WHETHAM ON THE IONIZATION OF Thus the first solutions of substances like barium chloride and copper sulphate reach a constant resistance as soon as the measurements are begun , the slight decrease with time being caused by the slow rise of temperature which is going on .
In the eases of potassium permanganate and sulphuric acid , however , the resistance goes on rising for nearly , or quite , half an hour after the first addition of stock solution is made .
Potassium permanganate shows this phenomenon in the first solution only , the second one keeping constant or slowly decreasing in resistance just as do the solutions of normal salts , but in sulphuric acid it is appreciable in the second solution also .
We are thus again led to the conclusion that the action with permanganate , whatever it may be , is completed by the first addition of salt , while a second addition of sulphuric acid is acted on in a similar manner to the first .
Experiments at higher temperatures have shown that this drop in the curve at extreme dilution occurs in the cases of acids , alkalies , and , to a smaller extent , of carbonates , which are unstable substances whose solutions probably contain a certain amount of alkali .
Thus the phenomenon seems to be associated with the presence of hydrogen or hydroxyl ions , and to occur only in solutions which contain such ions .
Now these ions have two peculiarities .
Firstly , they form the constituents of the solvent , water , in which the substances are dissolved ; and , secondly , they are ions which travel in aqueous solutions with abnormally high velocities .
These high velocities may , however , be connected with the existence of the ions in the solvent .
It is possible , in cases where one of the ions of a salt is much more mobile than the other , that the dilution of solution near the two electrodes , which we know to be the consequence of the movement of the ions , is so great at one electrode that the effective resistance of the liquid is increased , even in the small time during which the current flows in one direction .
I f .
this were the case we should expect that , in dilute solutions of acids where the equivalent conductivity has passed beyond the maximum , the measured resistance would depend on the rate of alternation of the current .
Experiments made with such a solution of sulphuric acid showed that when the speed of the commutator was altered , the variation in resistance was inappreciable , just as it is in cases of other solutions .
Another possibility is that when one of the ions of the dissolved salt is also a constituent of the solvent , there is some action between them , whereby either the number of effective ions or their velocity is reduced .
Such an action might require time to reach its completion , and hence is not inconsistent with the gradual rise in resistance which has been previously described .
It is a well known fact that the amount of chemical dissociation is greatly reduced when one of the products is already present .
Some such relation may explain the phenomenon in question .
The absolute values of the equivalent conductivities of potassium bichromate and potassium ferricyanide ( see below ) are , when calculated from the formulae ^K3Cr20 7 and ^K ?
jFe(CN)6 , higher than the numbers for any of the other salts used .
It is unlikely that the complex anions of these substances should travel faster than simple ions such as chlorine .
Perhaps , therefore , solutions of these salts may contain a larger number of ions than we have assumed ; thus , the ferricyanide may be resolved into potassium cyanide and ferric cyanide , when both K and Fe would behave as kations .
The electrically equivalent weight would thus become half that taken above , the value of m would be doubled , and the equivalent conductivity reduced by one-half .
The curve giving the ionization of potassium bichromate is unlike any other .
Beginning at extreme dilution , it first falls in a manner similar to that shown by curves for sulphates or other salts with divalent acids .
As the concentration increases to a value of about 10-3 gramme-equivalent per litre , the ionization becomes nearly constant , and remains so till the concentration reaches about 10~2 gramme-equivalent , after which it again begins to fall , and almost looks as though it were passing into a new curve , the expression of a different chemical constitution .
Perhaps these results may indicate that a change in the actual ions of the salt is brought about by increasing concentration .
It is interesting to note that W alden# and OstwaldI have already given evidence to show that bichromates in solution react with the water at moderate concentrations to form a mixture of the normal salt and acid .
Another point which may be of interest to chemists appears in the case of potassium permanganate .
The slant of its curve is very small , and approximates to that for potassium chloride .
It is much less than the slope for substances with divalent acid radicles such as sulphates .
It is therefore probable that a molecule of potassium permanganate gives two ions , K and Mn04 ' , and not three ions , represented by K ' , K ' , and Mn30 8 " .
The chemical structure of the salt in solution should then be represented by KMn04 .
Mr. Griffiths ' freezing-point measurements may be expected to finally settle this question .
In order to collect the results of this investigation and exhibit them in a convenient form , the following tables have been compiled , showing the most probable values of the ionizations for certain definite concentrations .
These results have been obtained from the smoothed curves , and three series of numbers have been tabulated .
In the first set , Table IX .
, the series of concentrations is the same as that used by Kohlrausch , viz. : m = 5 , 2 , 1 X KT* In the second set , Table X. , Ostwald 's series m = 1 , J , J , \amp ; c. , is taken .
In both these sets , m is measured in gramme-equivalents of solute per 1000 grammes of solution .
In the third set , Table XI .
, the concentrations are measured in terms of the number of gramme-molecules of solvent present to 1 gramme-molecule ( not gramme-equivalent ) of solute .

For each set the numbers for m* , corresponding to the concentrations used , were calculated , and the proper values of the ionization coefficients estimated from the smoothed curves .
Table XII .
shows the approximate equivalent conductivities in absolute C.G.S. units .
In order to obtain these numbers , a knowledge of the cell constant or " resistance capacity " of the apparatus is necessary .
This knowledge is not needed for deducing the ionizations , and therefore no arrangements were made in planning the investigations for accurately obtaining it .
Whenever the apparatus was dismounted for cleaning or other purposes , and set up again , it was found that a new measurement of the volume was necessary , slight differences in adjustment making the volume of water contained in it change by three or four-tenths of a cubic centimetre .
Since a knowledge of the amount of solvent used is necessary for accurate estimation of the concentrations of the solutions , this redetermination of volume was always made .
The variation in volume would involve a slight change in the cell constant of resistance , which , not being needed for the main purpose of the work , was only once determined .
The conductivity of solutions of copper sulphate was , as already explained , measured at a temperature of 18 ' as well as .at the freezing point , and a comparison could thus be made between the equivalent conductivity of solutions of known strength , as measured in the arbitrary cell units of this investigation , and the equivalent conductivity of solutions of the same strength as given by Kohlrausch# in absolute units .
Three values obtained for the conversion factor at three different concentrations were 2*345 , 2*322 and 2 '313 , each multiplied by 10 ~n , giving a mean cell constant of 2*327 X 10-11 .
The variation between the three values depends on the slight difference in slant between the two curves for 18 ' , as shown in the diagram ( p. 350 ) .
This mean value of the cell constant was used for calculating the equivalent conductivities for all substances except potassium chloride , the greatest variations in the weight of water contained in the cell during these observations being from 219*25 to 219*61 .
Potassium chloride was investigated at an earlier date , before a change in arrangement had considerably altered the constant of the cell .
In the case of this salt , however , Kohlrausch has given equivalent conductivities for a few concentrations at 0 ' as well as at higher temperatures , !
and thus a new determination of the cell constant was made , using a solution whose concentration was one hundredth normal .
The constant was found to be 2*161 X 1 0 - n , and from this the absolute equivalent conductivities for the other concentrations of that salt were calculated from the present determinations of the ionization .
In conclusion I have to thank my wife for constant help , both with the experiments and calculations , Mr. E. H. Griffiths for much assistance and many valuable suggestions , Mr. Green , for distilling a considerable part of the water used and * ' Ann. der Physik und Chemie , ' N.F. , vol. 66 , p. 813 , 1898 .

359 Mr. F. Thomas for his skill and attention in constructing the apparatus .
Professor J. J. Thomson has made several temporary loans of apparatus from the Cavendish Laboratory , and Messrs. J ohnson and Matthey lent the metal for the platinum still .
Both the British Association and the Boyal Society have made grants of money , without which the great cost of the apparatus would have rendered the investigation impossible .
