" Note on the Anatomy of the Blood-vessel System of the Retina of the Hedgehog .
" By J. W. HLULKE , F.R.S. Received May 26 , 1868 .
( Abstract .
) This retina is very remarkable for the fact that all the arteries and veins lie upon the inner surface of the membrana limitans interna retinue , in intimate relation with the membrana hyaloidea ; while capillaries only traverse the limitans , receiving a sheath from it , and penetrate the inner layers of the retina .
The hedgehog 's retina is in this respect a link between the non-vascular retina of fish , amphibia , reptiles and birds , and the vascular retinae of most mammals .
