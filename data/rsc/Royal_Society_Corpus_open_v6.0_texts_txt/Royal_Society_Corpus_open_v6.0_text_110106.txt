] The principle of Mr. Jones 's Hygrometer is essentially the same with that of Mr. Daniell 's , or rather with that employed by Mr. Dalton to determine the quantity of aqueous vapour present in the air , viz. to ascertain the temperature at which dew is deposited from the atmosphere .
It differs from Mr. Daniell 's , however , in the frigorific action being applied immediately to the bulb of the thermometer employed to measure the temperature .
This bulb is of a considerable size , and of a cylindrical form , slightly flattened , and extended at the end .
The stem of the thermometer being twice bent at right angles , this end of the bulb turns upwards .
It is made of black glass and is exposed , but the rest of the bulb is covered with muslin .
This being moistened with ether , the mercury is cooled , and dew at length settles on the exposed part , at which moment it is read off .
Mr. Jones , after describing this instrument , obviates an objection to its use , drawn from the application of the frigorific process to the lower part of the bulb , while the dew is deposited at the upper .
This objection , if valid , might be obviated , by inclining the bulb so as to have its axis horizontal .
But repeated trials have satisfied him of there being no occasion for this precaution .
Mr. Jones finally alludes to the use of a similar construction in Vienna .
