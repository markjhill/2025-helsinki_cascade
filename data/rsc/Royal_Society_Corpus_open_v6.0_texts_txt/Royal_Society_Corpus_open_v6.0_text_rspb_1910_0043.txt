[ June 15 , August 16 .
A growth consisting of several very small , round , white colonies appeared after three days .
A stained preparation from one of these showed that they were composed of organisms resembling Micrococcus Sub-cultures made .
September 29.\#151 ; The growth from two agar tubes was made into an emulsion with salt solution , and an agglutination test made with serum from a rabbit immunised against Micrococcus melitensis , Malta strain .
The result was that the organism from the goats agglutinated completely in a dilution of 1 in 100 , and the proof was complete that the Ankole goats are liable to contract Malta fever , and to act as a reservoir of the virus .
Conclusions .
1 .
" Muhinyo " is Malta fever .
2 .
" Muhinyo " is conveyed from the goat to man by the drinking of goats ' milk .

) As a good deal of interest , and it may be importance , attaches to the food of the tsetse fly\#151 ; the carrier of Sleeping Sickness\#151 ; the following notes are placed on record :\#151 ; In the laboratory it was found that the flies fed with far more avidity on birds than on monkeys , while they could hardly be tempted to feed on young crocodiles , iguanas , or lizards .
It was very marked , this preference of theirs for birds ; the moment a chicken was placed against the netting of the cage , they instantly swarmed on it in hundreds .
From this it was thought probable that the natural food of the flies would prove to be birds blood , but the two following experiments do not bear this out to any great extent:\#151 ; The first experiment was carried out in the laboratory at Mpumu , and extended over several months .
Flies which had been caught on the Lake-shore and which had been kept over from the previous day , and sometimes longer , were dissected , and each portion of the alimentary canal examined in the fresh state under a low power .
The various organs of the fly were then 1910 .
] The Natural Food of Glossina 491 .smeared separately , and after staining ( with one of the modifications of the Romanowsky stain ) were examined in the usual way .
The dissections were carried out as follows:\#151 ; The pharynx and proboscis were removed with a needle , and having been placed under a cover-glass and slightly opened out by pressure were examined in the fresh state .
The tube of the proboscis was in this way admirably displayed , and the presence of red blood corpuscles or of flagellates could readily be determined .
The alimentary canal was then removed from the abdomen , and the salivary glands detached from the fat-body .
The alimentary canal was then unravelled and laid out in its full length on a slide .
The whole of the tube could then be passed in review , from the junction of the thoracic intestine with the fore-gut down to the rectum , and the contents at various levels \#166 ; determined , as far as possible , with medium power magnifications .
The main portions of the alimentary canal were then noted , and these were separated from one another by cross cuts with a sharp-edged dissecting needle .
In this way the fore-gut , mid-gut , hind-gut , and proctodeum were separately removed and smeared on a slide .
The smears ( whilst still moist ) were exposed to the vapour of osmic acid for a few seconds , and then passed through alcohol before washing and staining .
The proventriculus can , with a little practice , be removed intact from the ventral aspect of the thorax .
If necessary , the thoracic portions of the salivary ducts can also be recovered .
Speaking in general terms , the contents of the various portions of the alimentary canal could be determined with considerable accuracy from the naked-eye appearance during dissection .
If the fly has fed very recently , the blood oozes from its proboscis when it is handled .
The proventriculus , the crop or sucking stomach , as well as the fore-gut , are greatly distended with red blood .
When the fed fly is put aside the blood-cells generally disappear from the proboscis in a few hours , though they may exceptionally be found as long as 24 hours after a feed .
Similarly , the proventriculus and thoracic intestine quickly empty themselves , and the crop discharges its contents into the upper alimentary canal within 24 hours .
The blood travels slowly down the alimentary canal , changing in appearance as it goes .
The outline of the red cells can sometimes be distinguished three days after a feed , but only when they have been retained in the foregut .
When the blood reaches the mid-gut it begins to disintegrate and becomes homogeneous and somewhat translucent ; when it reaches the lower part of the mid-gut it .first becomes dark and eventually black and tarry .
When in this state all cell elements are lost , and the colouring matter of the red cells is recognisable in the form of amorphous black granules .
When Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .
[ June 15 , the contents pass posterior to the Malpighian tubes , that is , into the hind-gut , they at once become fsecal in character , and turn into a dirty , yellowish-brown material , which is microscopically composed of fine granules .
It is passed from the fly in this form .
The figures given in the subjoined table refer to flies which were caught at various parts of the Lake-shore , and were generally kept for about 24 hours before dissection .
The majority of the dissections were done during October , November , and December , 1908 .

The second experiment to ascertain the food supply of Glosdna palpalis was modified as follows:\#151 ; A journey was made to a small peninsula , hereafter referred to as " Crocodile Point .
" This place was distant about two and a-half to three hours by canoe from the Kibanga landing-place , and lay in a sheltered bay far out of the beaten track of the canoes which come backwards and forwards between the islands of Kome , Damba , and Buvuma , and the weekly market at Kibanga clearing .
It was chosen , therefore , partly because it was isolated from human influences , and also because of the large number of flies which lived there and the number of crocodiles and birds which frequented it .
When it was first visited , a large crocodile was disturbed from where she was lying outstretched on a spit of sand .
The canoe-men at once set to work , and unearthed 58 crocodile eggs lying in layers about 18 inches below the surface , over which the " form " of the parent was clearly defined in the soil .
The peninsula was pointed in shape , and not more than 60 yards long , and was closed on the land side by the dense wall of forest which fringes 1910 .

493 the Lake-shore .
It was scattered with light undergrowth and fringed by ambatch trees , on which flocks of divers and cormorants sat with outstretched wings drying in the sun .
A barrier of bare rocks and boulders projected on one side , and a small school of hippopotami was generally to be seen floating near and basking in the sun .
Many small crocodiles were disturbed from the undergrowth as the point was explored , and various kinds of small land birds frequented the reeds and shrubs .
The soil was sandy loam , and shaded by the light foliage .
Glossina palpalis swarmed .
The place has been described at some length , so that the exact conditions may be realised .
Subsequent to this experiment , the daily catch of Lake-shore flies was obtained from this place , and incidentally it may be added that the flies caught here were regularly found to be infective to monkeys .

] In the present experiment , the observer landed by canoe and made the paddlers sit round him ; the fly-boys moved about amongst them and caught the flies as they came to feed .
They were handed at once to the observer , who snipped off their heads , noted their sex , and roughly dissected out the alimentary canal , and , when it contained food-stuff , smeared it at full length on a slide .
Notes were made as to the naked-eye contents of the canal and the question of pregnancy .
The smears were fixed in the usual way and brought to the laboratory , where they were stained and examined minutely .
The total number of flies examined was 183 , of which 104 ( 57 per cent. ) were males and 79 ( 43 per cent. ) were females ; of the total number , 108 ( 59 per cent. ) contained blood in a more or less digested state , and 75 ( 41 per cent. ) contained no food-stuff .
Out of the 79 females , 32 ( 40 per cent. ) contained nearly fully-developed larvae .

[ June 15 The above table shows that out of the original 183 flies examined , 52 ( 28 per cent. ) contained blood which was recent enough to show the red corpuscles .
Out of these 52 , 7 ( 13 per cent. ) were from mammalian blood , whilst non-mammalian blood was present in 35 flies ( 67 per cent. ) .
Trypanosomes were present in 14 flies ( 27 per cent. ) and Halteridia in 5 ( nearly 10 per cent. ) .
One contained a trypanoplasma , derived , probably , from bird 's blood .
An attempt was made to separate the nucleated red blood corpuscles into avian and reptilian .
The distinction was made by size only , it being found from the measurement of corpuscles from birds and reptiles that the average normal length was :\#151 ; Standard amphibian ( crocodile ) , 15'4 microns .

Two hundred and twenty Glossince were caught on various parts of the Lake-shore , and at intervals extending over several months ; they were examined about 24 hours after capture .
The examination of their intestinal contents revealed the fact that about 27 per cent , contained the remains of blood , the majority of which was of mammalian origin .
In the second experiment , 183 Glossince palpalis were caught at one spot where the food supply was abundant\#151 ; birds and crocodiles\#151 ; and the flies were examined at once .
A much higher percentage ( nearly 60 per cent. ) contained the remains of a blood meal .
The blood in the majority of the flies had been obtained from birds or reptiles , and of these the reptilian blood was twice as frequent as the blood of birds .
