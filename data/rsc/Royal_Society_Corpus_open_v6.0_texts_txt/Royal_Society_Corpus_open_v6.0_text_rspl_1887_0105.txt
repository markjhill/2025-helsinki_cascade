" Note on some Experiments on the Viscosity of Ice .
" By J. F. Main , M.A. , D.Sc .

Owing to the uncertainty prevailing as to the continuous extensibility of ice under tensional stress , it appeared to me desirable to institute a series of experiments directed to this point , conducted according to the methods , and , as far as possible , with the exactness of modern experimental testing .
In order to eliminate the influence of regelation , the experiments have been carried on at such low temperatures as preclude the possibility of any effect being produced by this cause , the highest temperature recorded in Experiment No. 1 being \#151 ; 2,6 ' C. ; in No. 2 , \#151 ; l'O0 C. ; and in No. 3 , \#151 ; 0'5 ' C. It must be remarked , moreover , that these maximum temperatures only obtained for a very short time , on one or two days , as will be seen from the records .
The testing machine which I used was constructed for me by Herr Ingenieur Usteri-Reinacher , of Zurich .
It was on the compound lever principle , the ratio of the arms of the equivalent simple lever being 1 : 20 .
All parts where friction could be prejudicial were provided with knife-edges .
The design of the machine is obvious from the figure , in which A represents the specimen of ice to be tested , held by the collars at B and 0 .
D is an equipoise , to balance the weights of the levers and of the vessel E , through which the power is applied by means of shot .
E is a hand-wheel fixed to the screw G , by means of which , as the specimen extends , the under collar C may be lowered , so that the position of the upper collar B and of the two levers may remain the same .
An index at H shows when the parts of the instrument are in the relative position required , and by its motion enables a rough estimate to be formed of the extension of the specimen .
The temperature was rendered more equable by enclosing the apparatus in two wooden boxes , KL and MN .
A delicate thermometer , graduated to tenths of a degree centigrade , and reading from \#151 ; 6 ' C. to -+-6 ' C. , was attached to the central Dr. J. F. Main .
wooden pillar , which , supports the upper lever .
The greatest variations of temperature inside the inner box were given in Experiment 3 , and , on the days mentioned in the record of Experiment 2 , by two thermometers , maximum and minimum , attached to the roof of the inner box .
The centres of the bulbs were about cm .
from the roof .
On the Viscosity of Ice .
The ice specimen was formed by freezing water in a cylindrical iron mould , with a conical expansion at one end .
To obtain ice as free as possible from included air , I in some cases ( but not in ail ) boiled the water and then froze it .
Afterwards it was melted in the mould , boiled , and then allowed again to freeze .
In this way nearly all the air was expelled , only a small core of minute bubbles up the axis of the cylinder remaining .
In Experiment No. 1 , however , these precautions were not taken , and thus the cylinder of ice had linear bubbles of air , radiating in horizontal straight lines from the axis of the cylinder .
These were due to expulsion of the air from the water , in which it was dissolved , as the latter froze in concentric cylindrical shells from outside inwards .
After the ice cylinder had been freed from contact with the mould , by bathing the latter in warm water , it was passed through the conical iron collar ( C in figure ) which the conical expansion of the ice fitted , and which had been screwed to the upper part of a wooden frame .
The other collar ( B ) was then attached to a moveable plate in the wooden frame , which was capable of motion vertically and horizontally , and , by adjusting screws , both the frame and the collar B could be made accurately horizontal .
By a small plummet the ice cylinder wras made to hang vertically , by placing small pieces of cork between it and the edge of the opening in B. Water was then run into B , and , when frozen , a cylinder of ice was obtained , held above and below in two conical collars .
By the above-mentioned adjustments it was ensured that the cylinder of ice was perpendicular to the surfaces of the two collars B and C. As the weight of the two iron collars was over 4'5 kilos .
, much care was needed to prevent fracture of the ice , which , unless handled tenderly , broke with the least jar , on being inserted in the machine .
The lower surface of the upper , and the upper surface of the lower collar had been planed true , and brass rings fitted on them .
These rings were also made plane surfaces .
They extended so far from the ice specimen that it was possible to use callipers between the surfaces of these brass rings , without interference with the larger ends of the conical collars .
The ring on B was provided with four small holes , 90 ' apart on the circumference , and by means of a small plummet the points on the ring of C ( which ring was graduated roughly ) that were vertically under the four points on the ring above , were determined .
By noting these graduations it was rendered certain that the measures would always be taken between the same points in the upper and under rings .
Since the ice specimen was inserted in the apparatus with its axis vertical , the lines measured between the points thus determined on the two rings , were , in each case , parallel to the axis of the cylinder .
The callipers used measured to the one-fiftieth of a millimetre .
Dr. J. F. Main .
I used the rings because I have not been able to devise means , as yet , for so firmly fixing objects in the ice that there would be ' no danger of displacement by their own weight , or during the measurement by callipers .
The results obtained are therefore affected by errors , if any , which may be due to action at the collars , such as slipping through , owing to distortion of the conical enlargements .
This effect is but slight at temperatures below the freezing point ; though near and above freezing point the collars , when the ice is under tensile stress , will not hold it , but , in the course of a few hours , by distortion of its conical enlargements , it slips through them .
At lower temperatures , to act as a check on the measurements taken between the rings on the collars , and to determine if any appreciable effect was due at those temperatures to slipping through the collars , I gummed two pieces of paper on the ice specimen near the top and bottom .
On each of these a small pencil mark was made , and by means of a rule , I got a measure of the distance between the points .
By repeating this measure on a subsequent day , a rough value was obtained of the extension between the marked points .
The distance could be estimated to about the quarter of a millimetre , and showed that , with low temperatures , nearly all the extension observed was due to the stretching of the piece , and not to a shearing action of the ice in the collars .
In the tabular results of three experiments which follow , the first column gives the date ; the second the hour , reckoned from Berne mean midnight , at which the observations were taken ; the third column gives the temperature in degrees centigrade , read by an attached Kew-verified thermometer , graduated to tenths of a degree ; the fourth column gives in millimetres the mean of the distances of the points on the upper from those on the lower ring .
These distances , four in number , were taken at opposite extremities of two perpendicular diameters of the rings .
The next column furnishes the mean extension in millimetres in the interval that has elapsed since the last observation .
The sixth column gives , in hundredths of a millimetre , the hourly mean extension deduced from the preceding column , and the interval which has elapsed between the two observations .
The two next columns give , in kilogrammes per square centimetre , the mean and the maximum stress respectively .
By the rapid evaporation from the ice cylinder , even at low temperatures , the amount of this stress increased from day to day , with the same load at the further end of the compound lever .
Since the evaporation was different at different parts of the ice cylinder , owing probably to variations in texture , and still more to the effect of the proximity of the collars to the ice above and below , which protected the ice near them from evaporating so quickly as in other parts , the diameter of the cylinder at different heights varied .
Thus the mean stress , as On the Viscosity of Ice .
deduced from three measurements of the diameter , at the top , in the middle , and at the bottom , differed from the maximum stress , as deduced from the total load and the least area of section .
The last column but one in Experiment No. 1 gives the minimum temperature the preceding night , measured , not in the box , but by a thermometer freely exposed out of doors .
Since the ice specimen was enclosed in the double box its temperature did not sink as low as those given in this column .
The numbers here are only to be taken as signifying that the night was or was not specially cold .
Unfortunately in this experiment no maximum and minimum temperature observations were taken .
In Experiments 2 and 3 the maximum and minimum temperatures were observed , when recorded , by a maximum and a minimum thermometer suspended in the box , and their determinations furnished " the range of temperature .

Total extension of specimen = 217'41 \#151 ; 215-69 = 1'72 mm. 498 Dr. J. F. My : On the Viscosity of Ice .
499 The specimen broke by a jar due to the falling of a weight on the floor of the room .
On February 27th the three observations were taken , with different loads on the specimen , directly after one another .
With a load of 5'5 kilos , ( the weight of the lower collar ) there was an immediate extension of 0-22 mm. ; and when the load was increased to 12'5 kilos , the extension at once increased by 0'04 mm. The three experiments , of which the results are given above , show that ice subjected to tension stretches continuously by amounts which evidently depend on the temperature and on the tensile stress .
When the stress is great , as in No. I , and the temperature not very low , there are appreciable extensions , as on February 15th , amounting to as much as 1 per cent , of the whole length per day .
When the temperature is lower , and the stress is less , the extension is less , but still such as can be measured .
So continuous and definite is the extension , that it can even be measured from hour to hour , as seen in Experiment No. 1 , when for February 15th and 16th easily measurable extensions were obtained for intervals of two and three hours .
The quantities actually measured were generally both notably greater and less than the mean , since , owing probably to inequalities in the distribution of the stress and to variations of texture in the ice , due to internal strains produced in freezing , one side of the specimen would sometimes stretch 50 per cent , more than the other .
Hence differential motions resulted in the ice .
These motions and extensions took place at temperatures which preclude all possibility of melting and regelation , expecially in Experiments 1 and 2 .
In Experiment No. 1 , it was found that in three days , from February 13th to February 16th , the distance between two marks on pieces of paper gummed on the ice increased from 200 mm. to 203 mm. , giving an elongation of per cent , per day .
This method fails at tempera- tures very near the freezing point , owing to the danger that by thawing the pieces of paper may slip , but is free from this risk at lower temperatures .
It is in any case very rough , and is only useful as a check on the other measures , since there is no question here of slipping through the collars .
How close the correspondence in the results obtained is may be seen by observing that in Experiment 1 there was an extension in nine days of 11 mm. in the case of a cylinder of ice , which at the beginning of that time was 235 mm. long , and this gives an elongation of just about \ per cent , per day , the same as resulted from the three days ' observation with the marked bits of paper .
The experiments are to be regarded rather as proving the existence of continuous extension under tensile stress than as determining its amount .
The quantities observed are functions of the stress , of the time between two observations , and of the time integral Dr. J. F. Main .
during that interval of the temperature .
Owing to the rapid evaporation from ice , even at low temperatures , when the surface is never liquefied , at such an elevation ( 6100 feet above sea level ) as St. Moritz , in the Engadine , where the observations were carried on , the specimen is subjected to a continually increasing stress .
This variation in the stress can no doubt be diminished by clothing the specimen in flannel .
The change of temperature I expect to diminish by filling the interval between the two surrounding wooden boxes with some non-conducting material .
In this way I have good hope that , on resuming the experiments next winter at St. Moritz , I may be able to determine more nearly the law of extension .
That there is such extension , and that it goes on continuously with all stresses above I kilo , per square centimetre , and at all temperatures between \#151 ; 6 ' 0 .
and freezing point , is shown by the above experiments .
When ice is in a condition such that pressure with the point of a needle will cause a set of radiating fractures to pass from the point of contact in all directions , it stretches as certainly , although not by so great an amount , as when it will permit the* passage through it of the same needle without showing the least trace of flaw or scar .
In the discussions , for the most part a priori , on the extensibility of ice , sufficient importance has not usually been assigned to the necessity of distinguishing between the effect of even a small blow or jar and that of a much greater force applied gradually and steadily during a long interval .
A bar of ice may bear a stress of 4 and 5 kilos , per square centimetre if the load is steady , which would fracture at once with a much smaller sudden stress , especially if not uniformly distributed .
In the first experiment we notice a total extension in nine days of II mm. In No. 2 there is an extension of 1*8 mm. in five days , and in No. 3 of 1'7 mm. in three days .
If we assume for the moment an extension proportional to the time , we should thus get a mean daily extension in the three experiments of 1'2 mm. , 0'36 mm. , and 0*56 mm. respectively .
To account for the discrepancy we remark that the stress in No. 1 is much greater than in 2 or 3 , and the temperature not so very low during the day , although low at night .
The effect of increased stress is well shown in Experiment No. 2 , on February 23rd and 24th , where , on increasing the stress from 2*28 to 3'65 kilos .
, the extension in a day rises at once from 0*08 to 0'69 mm. In No. 2 , for three out of the five days , the temperatures were below \#151 ; 6 ' 0 .
, whilst in No. 3 there was a low stress but comparatively high temperatures .
In Experiment No. 2 the large numbers obtained at first probably arose from the fact that in preparing the specimen its conical expansion had frozen to the collar C. WFen the water run into the collar B began to freeze it expanded , and thrust the ice upwards .
The Air of Seivers .
501 As it was frozen to the collar G , and therefore unable to expand upwards , since both collars were fixed to a frame , the cylindrical part of the ice bulged outwards , as in the usual case of a long column under compression .
When the specimen was subsequently exposed to tension , the effect of the latter was to straighten it , so that in a few days it no longer bulged out .
The straightening of the central line of the ice cylinder thus gave rise to greater extensions than were due simply to the extension of a straight bar of ice with an equal distance in all azimuths between the rings .
* The Air of Sewers .

Owing to the complaints which had been made of bad smells in the House of Commons , a Select Committee was appointed in the spring of 1886 to inquire into the ventilation of the House .
In consequence of the experience we had gained in the course of an extensive examination of the air of houses and schools in Dundee ( see ' Phil. Trans. , ' vol. 178 ( 1887 ) , B , p. 61 ) , we were instructed by the Committee to make a series of analyses of the air in the sewers under the Houses of Parliament , and to report thereon ( see ' Second Report of the Committee , ' Appendix ) .
Since then we have examined the air in a considerable number of sewers in Dundee .
Our object was , in the first place , to obtain a general idea of the amount of some of the more important impurities present in sewer air .
But we have also endeavoured to throw some light on their sources , and on the conditions affecting their dissemination .
With this view we found it desirable to supplement our observations in the sewers by a certain number of laboratory experiments .
In spite of the great amount of discussion which has taken place in connexion with real and supposed danger from sewer air , there have hitherto been but few analyses published of the air of sewers of modern construction .
The first and most complete set of analyses was that made by Dr. Letheby in 1857\#151 ; 58 ( 'Report to the City of London Commissioners of Sewers , ' 1858 ) .
He examined the air of thirteen sewers in the City of London .
The following are the means of his analyses :\#151 ; VOL. XLII .
