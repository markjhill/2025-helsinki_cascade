For the information of persons who are not acquainted with the nature of the instrument , it is necessary to add that the transit of the sun was observed with the same tube with which , after an application of a microscope , the position of the needle , or magnetic meridian , could be read off the limb surrounding it , whilst three nonii gave the division corresponding to the true meridian on that day .
Not considering the magnetic observations of sufficient importance to neglect on their account the observations of the sun with the regular transit and mural circle , I left an assistant to observe its culmination with the magnetic transit ; and as this instrument could not be kept permanently in the same position , I directed him to turn the tangent screw of the azimuth circle so as to bring the first wire in contact with the sun 's preceding limb at a second of a chronometer , computed for that purpose , with the declination for the interval of wires and semidiameter .
For any difference found after the reduction of the wires , a correction of the azimuth remained to be made .
With more attention greater accuracy might have been obtained , although the application of the microscope to the tube could not : fail of displacing the optical axis .

Latitude of the Observatory .
Observations for determining the latitude have not merely a local interest .
The differences between the latitudes derived from stars north and south of the zenith , as well as from upper and lower solstices , have long been an object of speculation by astronomers ; so that a series of observations for the latitude of any place on the surface of the earth is valuable : and if the anomalies alluded to should not originate in the defects of the instruments alone , but in hitherto unknown laws of Nature , observations in the Southern hemisphere will be doubly interesting .

, , , 15.0 This shows that the zenith distances have been observed too small ; and the solstice moreover seems to indicate that the error increases with the zenith distance .
Without investigating the cause of this error , we may suppose equal zenith distances on either side of the zenith equally influenced by it .
Calling therefore 6 and z the declination and observed zenith distance of the northern , and ?
' and z ' those of the southern star in his superior culmination , and x the correction of the zenith distance , we have , if both stars have south declination ( in general if latitude and declination are of the same name ) z +x + -latitude and _-- ' x= latitude whence Z--~zf +3a whence fZ2 -Z+ 2_ latitude .
And thus the error x of the instrument is eliminated .
e The solstices of 1821 and 1822 were observed by Sir THOMAs BRISBANE and myself conjointly ; those in 1823 , by Sir THOMAS BRISBANE ; and the remainder by myself alone .
Remarks.-These results are somewhat contradictory to the last , the southern stars giving rather less for latitude than the northern , which would prove that the zenith distances had been observed too great .
When a method leaves us in uncertainty , we must resort to another that is independent of those errors that vitiated the former .
One of the effects of gravity is , that it causes eccentricity in the repeating circle when used in the manner last described , by depressing the small circle , which carries the tube , below the centre of the great circle 's division ; so that the optical axes , or radii of the double zenith distances , are removed downwards parallel to themselves , and thus subtending a greater arc of the limb , make the observed zenith distance too great .
The observations alternately direct and by reflection , are free of these errors , for the displaced vertex of the observed arc remains in the diameter that is parallax to its chord .
In the preceding observations , the refraction corresponding to the mean height of the barometer and thermometer has been applied to the mean of the zenith distances .
There is no error in this , the change of the refraction being in all tables assumed proportional to that of the baromleter and thermometer in so small limits .
But I have also employed the true south polar distance corresponding to the mean date , instead of correcting it for each particular day .
The error thence resulting is within the probable limits of the steadiness of the level , from its being differently influenced by temperature on different days .

on the preceding Eclipse .
Before the end of the eclipse I distinctly saw , on that part of the sun from which the moon parted , this appearance , which could have only arisen from projecting points on the moon 's surface .
The vanishing of the last black spot A was equal to the immersion of a fixed star .
Owing to the oblique direction in which the moon traversed the sun , the diminution of the shade was very slow , so that this eclipse is not well qualified for deducing the geographic longitude , which would be greatly influenced by any small error of the moon 's tables in latitude , or an erroneous assumption of the ratio of the earth 's axes .
Whereas , on the contrary , this ratio might with considerable accuracy be deduced from the preceding micrometrical measurements , if compared with any corresponding observations made in any part of Asia .
I take this opportunity of recording the transit of Mercury over the sun 's disk , as observed by me the 5th November , 1822 .

But Professor WURM , to whose indefatigable exertions Geography is so much indebted , having calculated the occultations observed at Paramatta as far as he was in possession of them , , and could identify the stars , I can do no better than give the results of his calculations in preference .

a-II II tIIi4ii r From the known right ascensions of the Moon 's culminating Stars , observed on the given day , I deduce the true right ascension of the Moon 's centre for the apparent time of the Moon 's limbs passing the middle wire .
For the corresponding time at Greenwich ( found here upon the supposition of the longitude = 10h 4m 3s ) , I find also from the Nautical Almanac , the Moon 's right ascension , applying thereto the correction found from the Observations made on that day at Greenwich .
The difference between the two right ascensions , divided by the Moon 's horary motion , which need only to be known superficially , is the error of the assumed Longitude , which in East Longitude is additive or subtractive , accordingly as the Nautical Almanac gives the Moon 's R greater or less than the Observation .
The above Longitudes rest merely upon a comparison with the Nautical Almanac .
When the errors thereof are once known , it will be sufficient to apply double their quantities to the Longitudes in time found on the corresponding days .
The Longitude of the Observatory by a mean of all hitherto calculated Observations , including the occultations , is 10h 4m 6s.25 .

The geographical position of Port Jackson being of nautical importance , I think its determination here is not misplaced .

By chronometers frequently carried backward and forward between Pa29 cc 49S.6 may therefore be adopted for difference of longitude between Sydney and Paramatta with the more confidence , as inner and outer contact give almost the same result , which is at the same time a proof of the exactness of the observations made at Sydney as well as Paramatta .
" I should prefer , however , to take a mean of 51"93 , 51".98 and 49".6 = 50".88 , which being added to 10h 4m 61.25 , the longitude of the observatory at Paramatta , give for longitude of Sydney 10h 4m 57S.13 .
Remark.-The conjunction Oh 6m 521.2 deduced from the inner contact of the immersion of Sydney , is probably written wrong by Professor WURM .
I Suspect he meant it Oh 6m 24s.78 .
I have , however , not ventured to alter it .

a. ) Observed with REICHENBACH'S repeating Circle .
I shall first state the methods employed in the Reductions of the Observations , and begin with , The Reduction to the Meridian .
Already , on occasion of the first southern solstice observed in this colony , I remarked the insufficiency of DELAMBRE'S method for the reduction to the meridian when the sun culminates near the zenith , on account of the slow convergency of the series employed by him , under such circumstances : when the hour ae angle is about 25 ' , the second term of his formula will in a set of four observations amount to lOO , the third to 60 " , and even the fourth to 122 " , and the work of DELAMBRE'S third and fourth term is very laborious .
I have therefore substituted another series , the very first term of which comes as near the truth as the four terms of that of DELAMBRE .
I find the middle of the times of observation for which I take out DELAMBRE7S first and second part A and I. I take also out these parts A ' A " A " ' ... and 8 ' r " !

, =p =sinz sin ( _)2 i 31 = 0 , and the reduction to the meridian R -= r A ; but now R=XA+CC is too great for a correction whereof the greater part should always be collected in the first term .
A= SS +A = S(S A ) ; therefore 'n A= Xr S8r ( S A ) ; and R =S ( SA ) +p ( S A ) + cot s p2 A ( SpA ) sin 1 " cot p2 ( S -- ) =--Spcot ( S _ ) r Scos ( z + MiaCoS )(S-A ) sinl " sin z omitting cubes and higher powers .
The last term is almost always insensible , and may be neglected ; and in the room of 5 , which is unknown , z or the observed zenith distance may be used in the calculation , which together with my having assumed si ( z ==a never causes the error to amount to one second of arc in the reduction as long as this is not above two degrees .
Correction of the Hour-angle for change of Equation of Time .
BIOT in his Astronomy , vol. i. p. 451 , finds it necessary to correct the hourangle for daily rate of clock , but neglects at the same time a greater source of error .
In solar observations the observed hour-angle is apparent solar time , whilst the interval per clock corrected for sidereal acceleration is mean time , and should be diminished in both solstices by a proportional part of the daily retardation of apparent solar time upon mean time , given in the Nautical Almanac in the column of daily difference of equation of time .
This is a gaining rate of the clock of 13 " in the northern , but of 30 " in the southern solstice , and more therefore than any clock ought to have .
These considerations are unimportant in the northern parts of Europe ; but nobody will dispute their importance where the zenith distance is 10 ?
when an error of 1 " in the hour-angle of 24 minutes causes an error of 10 " in latitude ; I have therefore annexed a Table showing the correction to be subtracted from the hour-angle during the southern solstice .

It is clear that the utmost precision in the time is required under such circumstances , when the vicinity to noon is indeed the most favourable period of the day for determining this very element the time , which in finding the latitude we assume as given .
But I believe that both objects can be attained at once , and that circummeridional altitudes near the zenith afford the means of ascertaining the error in the level of the transit as well as the latitude .
If we find that with an assumed time of the sun 's culmination from several sets of circummeridional altitudes , the deduced respective meridional altitudes A , B , C , D , E either gradually decrease or increase , we may suspect that the sun 's transit has been assumed too late or too soon .
I suppose the correction for the change of declination during the hour-angle ( which also occasions a gradual alteration ) to be already applied .
With the mean of DELAMBRE'S numbers A in an ascending set , take out of his Tables for the Reduction to the Meridian the quantity corresponding to a change of one second in time .
which call m , take also with the mean of A in a descending set a sim'laz quantity n. Then is A -E B--D +m r= + ?

Reduction to the Solstice .
The reduction to the solstice is computed after the following formula ; cx sin2 L2 sin o cos ?
.(D + )where the constant c in , L= complement of sun 's longitude ; D the declination ; and w the obliquity of the ecliptic .
34 Methods of Observing the Repetitions .
During the last years when I was without an assistant , the intervals , and therewitll the second parts of the reductions p2 cot z ( s ) would have become too great in the southern solstice , if I had attended at the same time to the level , which moreover became useless under the sun 's vertical rays .
This is therefore an additional reason why I have resorted to reflection from mercury .
The small nadir distance enabling me to place it upon the same isolated pillar with the instrument , and to keep all the openings of the dome shut except the top slide , the mercury was secured against wind , and all percussion save that occasioned by handling the instrument , and no glass cover was required .
During the same series I did not revolve 1 80 ?
in azimuth , but pointed the tube in a leftsided series , first by means of the great circle to the reflected image , and next by shifting the small circle to the direct object , and I then again turned the great circle for the observation by reflection , repeating this process until a series was completed , containing a multiple of altitudes instead of zenith distances .
In a right-sided series it is the great circle by which the tube must be first pointed to the direct object .
The repetitions can thus be carried on with remarkable expedition by one observer .
All that is required is that the instrument remains steady during the interval between a reflected and direct vision .
The reflection and direct vision enabled me by three observations to verify that the optical axis described a vertical circle , and the effects of bending compensated themselves .
I shall illustrate the process by an Example .

I regret that I had always to interrupt the Observations at noon , in order to observe the Sun with the Transit and Mural Circle .
The second part of the Reduction to the Meridian depends not only upon the Distance from the Meridian , but also upon the number of the Observations contained in the Set , and the intervals between them .
Only small corrections that are of variable signs , and complete their periods during the time that embraces the observations may be neglected in calculations ; but where the sign is constant , even the smallest should be attended to , as the error will not be diminished by taking a mean of the whole , and no benefit arises from often repeated observations .
The original observations of the Abstracts , which follow , of the Solstices observed at Paramatta , would occupy too much space in printing , and are therefore preserved in Manuscript .
On December the 14th , 15th , 16th , 17th and 18th , I had repetitions on Venus about the meridian , with Reichenbach 's Circle , of which the abstract is subjoined .

The Reduction to the Meridian will serve to correct the Parallax .
The culminations of Venus observed with the transit , have been corrected for semi-diameter , and the hour angle thence deduced is corrected for the acceleration of Venus above the fixed stars , which is here additive .
It depends upon the relative situation of the Sun and Venus , whether in the repetitions left and right the planet can always be observed on the same side of the wire , or whether it must be observed alternately on different sides .
The mean arc will be accordingly the zenith distance of the centre , or that of one of the limbs .
Inferior Conjunction of Venus , July and August 1828 , observed with the Mural Circle and Transit at Paramatta .
The lower limb of Venus has been observed throughout .
The observed Right Ascensions are those of the first limb before the conjunction , but after conjunction those of the last limb of Venus .
The Sun 's Parallax has been subtracted from his Refraction , but to Venus no Parallax has been applied .

The elements of this Comet might have been found , without the assistance of the usual methods , in the following manner : The time of the Comet 's passage through its node could be deduced from the observations , by finding through interpolation when its geocentric and consequently also its heliocentric latitude was =0 .
But the Comet was at that time near its opposition , so that a rough estimation of its distance ?
from the earth was sufficient to find the longitude of the node by the formula p sin ( a L ) tang ( -L ) R( -L ) R+p cos ( a L ) where L is the heliocentric longitude of the earth , R its radiuis vector , and Vo the Comet 's geocentric longitude ; for as , L is small near the opposition , g can but little influence the angle of commutation .
We had also the opportunity of observing the Comet when the node was in opposition .
For this time is a plane passing through Sun , Comet , and Earth , tang / 3 the plane of the Comet 's orbit consequently sin g-f )= tang I. , 3 ' being the Comet 's geocentric latitude , and I the inclination of the orbit .
Having thus obtained approximate values of a and I , the rest of the elements might be found as usual , and corrected by three Hypotheses .
We had also the opportunity of observing the Comet in its opposition , when its heliocentric and geocentric longitudes were equal .
Consequently , g ( -tang u ' u being the argument of latitude whence r " is known , and the interval of time found according to LAMBERT'S Theorem with r " , r and u ' , if this interval does 64 Parabolical Elements .

G. Re-appearance of the Comet of ENCKE in 1828 .
Comparisons with principal stars , that but rarely chanced to be sufficiently near its track to avoid inaccuracies arising from the position of the wires or inequalities of the micrometer screws , would have been of little service for a comet , whereof the positions were already better known from the Ephemeris of Professor ENCKE .
I have therefore confined my observations to stars , however small , to which it nearest approached , as their places may be determined at any time hereafter , being sufficiently known from the place of the comet itself to identify the stars in the meridian .

FIXED STARS .
Determination of the Right Ascensions of some of the principal Stars of the Southern Hemisphere , by absolute , and equal Altitudes .
1 .
Absolute Altitudes .
The weakness of the axis of the transit in Paramatta rendered it impossible for its optical axis to move in one and the same plane in passing from the north to the south of the zenith ; so that I could not place implicit confidence in the right ascensions of the southern stars deduced from the northern by means of this instrument .
I was therefore desirous to establish the right ascensions of some of the principal southern circumpolar stars , independently of the transit , by methods not subject to any constant error , and I resorted first to repetitions with REICHENBACH'S circle for observing the hour angles of these stars when near their greatest azimuth circle , corresponding to times of the sidereal clock , whereof the error was ascertained on the same days from equal altitudes of the Sun , Sirius , and other known stars .
Not to lose the time devoted at night to the transit and mural circle , I made these observations in the day-time , having constructed for that purpose a table of azimuths and altitudes for the star from 5 to 5 minutes , which enabled me to find the star at any time for the left observation ; and as the table contained also the double zenith distances , I had but to advance the nonius of the small circle by that quantity , in order to have the star again in the field after half a revolution in azimuth .
Thus I could continue the repetitions to any extent with greater ease and accuracy in the day-time than at night .
The observations were made as much as circumstances would admit east as well as west of the meridian , in order to let the errors of the instrument compensate each other .
The observations were chiefly made at the time when the star 's azimuth was a maximum , and 69 consequently stationary ; the change of altitude was then proportional to the change of time , and the calculated hour-angle did not require the troublesome reduction of the middle of times to the middle of altitudes .
Though it cannot be expected that absolute altitudes will give the right ascensions with the same consistency amongst themselves as observations with a transit instrument , the mean of a great number of them derived from observations made on both sides of the meridian is more likely to be free from any constant errors to which the transit instrument may be subject .

Equal Altitudes .
The object of these observations was the determination of the right ascensions of some of the principal stars of the southern hemisphere that are circumpolar at Paramatta , by a direct comparison with the sun , independent of the transit and of the solar tables .
This comparison was made by deducing the superior and inferior culminations of the stars from a series of equal altitudes , which was kept on without interruption for the space of a month about the time of the Equinox ; and by deducing the true noon and midnight on the same days from equal altitudes of the sun , whereof the evening set was again connected with the morning set .
This gave the difference of right ascensions between the sun and stars .
The distance of the sun from the Equinox is finally derived from the observed declination of the sun on those days .
For the observations of the equal altitudes of the stars I made use of the repeating circle .
The level was during the whole month kept invariably in the same position towards the division of the great circle , which by means of the level was maintained in the same position to the horizon .
Thus the equal altitudes of any number of stars could be observed together with their superior and inferior culminations .
In order to derive some benefit from one set of altitudes in case that clouds should prevent the corresponding one , I had determined the point of the division answering to the zenith in the manner described in page 7 ; so that each observation could be reduced to the culmination by imeans of the hour-angle ; and in that view I had also constructed a table of the Ihour-angles for every five minutes of altitude , corrected for the refraction answering to the mean height of the barometer and thermometer during that period , separately for the morning and evening set .
These observations having been also chiefly made in the day-time , it was expedient to be provided with a table for finding the stars more readily .
Suppose p the colatitude , 8 the polar distance , r and t the hour-angles , z and i zenith distances , Z the meridional zenith distance , D the difference of altitudes , A difference of azimuths , x = ?
( r t ) half difference of hour-angles , and N an auxiliary angle : then is cot p tan 8= cos t , cos ( sec S= cos ~ , cos ( sin 8= sin azimuth ; 2 sin a sin x sin N and sin sin = sin DJ , sin A= -^ in 2 smin(r F D)where tan N= cos $ tan x. With D and A by simple addition or subtraction a table of altitudes and azinuths may be constructed for every five minutes of the hour-angle .
Stars observed on one side of the meridian become often visible on the other side , only at a greater distance from it ; so that it is sometimes necessary to combine unequial altitudes , which is not difficult with stars , if the same differences of altitudes are observed on each side .
sin ID The formula i sin = in azimuth serves to reduce these observations .
x is the quantity to be applied to the middle time to reduce it to the time of culmination .
D is here the difference between the eastern and western altitudes sin , D. combined together ; so that si isa constant factor : and a table of the reductions x may be constructed with the sole entry of the half interval , whereof the azimuth is a function , and given opposite to it in the table of azimuths and altitudes ; for hour-angle and half interval are here equivalent .
A formula expressed in terms of the half interval only , would probably be rather complicate .
sin z ( z)sin ( I + z ) This formula results from sin x= sin ( r + t)in sin ) which serves in general to find the change in time corresponding to that of altitude , and reciprocally ; if we suppose r= 0 , this formula becomes the well-known one for finding the hour-angle .
sinl t= / sin(Z + sin ( Z- ) 2 sin f sin used when no corresponding altitudes can be had .
But by combined altitudes the effects of any unknown error of the instrument are avoided .
2x applied to the times on either side of the meridian reduces the combined altitudes to equal altitudes .
Method of finding the Sun 's Distance from the Equinox .
Suppose c and a ' the sun 's distance upon the equator from the equinox corresponding to the declinations 6 and Y ' observed with the mural circle , then by the known formula for finding the equinoctial point , sin ( a 81 ) tan 2 ( a a ' ) = tan ( a + ' ) sin ( 8 ' ) is the obliquity of the ecliptic eliminated .
But this is no advantage , as the obliquity is better known than the declination .
Suppose x the increase of IR corresponding to an increase a of declination , and x ' the increase of JR corresponding to an increase a ' of the obliquity w , then is a cot wO af tan JR1 x= cos and x ' = ta if the M is not too near 90 ?
or 270 ?
.* cos Iutan w ' Demonstration : tan ( +a ) cot w= sin ( a + x ) r tan 4tan a 1 .
COt W sin cos x +t cos a sin x but tan a tan ao and cos x=1 therefore cot w tan a+ cot w tan a= sin a+ cos a sin x subtract cot w tan 6 ... ... ... .
= sin a remains cot w tan a= cos a sin x. The other formula can be demonstrated in a similar manner .
Hence the following Tables may be constructed : Argument Right Ascension ... ... ... ... ... 0 20 3ยง 4ยง 50 60 70 ยง 9ยง 10 Cor. of a for 1 " increase of Declination ... 2".304 2".305 2".307 2"i.308 2".313 2".317 2".322 2".328 2".332 22".340 Argument Right Ascension ... ... ... ... ... 1 2ยง 30 40 5 6 ?

] 0".161 0"1.202 0".242 0".282 0".324 0".365 " .40G6 So that considering how small the influence upon the right ascension is of an error that could possibly exist in an element , such as the obliquity , long established by innumerable observations , whilst every declination stands by itself with all the errors to which one single observation is liable , we need not hesitate to adopt the obliquity as known , and by using the formula 2 sin ( , -d ) sin ( a ' ) cot w cos 6 .
cos ' cos " + c ) we shall have the advantage of introducing one wellknown part c in the room of the uncertain divisor sin ( + '- ) wherein the errors of observation are doubled .
Cos. cos L ' is nearly -1 .
The errors of so small an angle as 8 is near the equinox , utterly disappear in the cosine ; and c+ a ' is sufficiently well known , as we shall see presently : but I have preferred the following method .
Besides 8 and w , whereby b is already determined according to the formula sin a= tan i cot w , there is also given c+ a ' ; and as this can be ascertained with great precision , I have made use thereof in the following manner to correct the former .
By deducing the errors of the clock , from a comparison of the culminations of the principal fixed stars near the equator with their known right ascensions , and applying these errors to the transits of the sun , we obtain the sun 's right ascensions at the time of his passing the middle wire , as near as the places of the fixed stars can be depended on ; but the differences of these right ascensions , a + a ' , which is all that we require , are correct to all intents , and independent of a small deviation of the transit , as well as any constant error in the places of the fixed stars .
At the same time , for confirmation , + ?
da may be deduced from the Nautical Almanac , which only supposes the sun 's motion during the interval correctly known .
Thus by the united means of the transit and Nautical Almanac , we shall have cz ?
ct given independently of the mural circle .
74 Allowing now that the polar point of the mural circle is well established by superior and inferior culminations of circumpolar stars , as well as by observations of the principal zodiacal stars , and that by observing alternately the upper and lower limb of the sun any vicious habit in observing is obviated , I designate with a , b , c , d , &amp;c. the respective errors in seconds committed in the observations of the different declinations , x being as above the effect upon the right ascensions arising from an error of one second in declination , which during the equinox is a constant quantity of 2".31 .
I find then M ?
cc ' by the formula sin a= cot w tan i and sin l , ' = cot w tan Y ' , and call rn , n , o , p , &amp;c. the differences between a ?
c ' thus calculated from the mural circle , and that known from observation with the transit and Nautical Almanac as above ; then is x ( a + b ) =m x(a + c ) =n x(a + d ) =ox ( a ... ... X{(N -2)a +a+b+c+d + ... ..}= m++o +p ... . .

But if no constant error exists in the observations with the mural circle , m +n+o+.p ... . .
then is a+b+ c+d+ =0 , andax= m+ a-xbeingti e required correction of the sun 's distance from the equinox .
Thus each distance from the equinox found by the formula sin a= tan 3 cot w is successively corrected by a comparison with their observed sums or differences .
I shall omit here the particulars , which are long and tedious , and simply give a short abstract of the results .
During the equinox of September 1827 , the following observations were made for determining the right ascensions of 3 Crucis* and 2 ac Centauri .
truth than that of the transit observations : it must be recollected at the same time that 3 Hydri is within 12 ?
of the Pole , and all the other stars are circumpolar with the exception of Canopus .
Besides the times of the equinoxes , equal altitudes of various stars were observed during their conjunction and opposition with the sun , and thus the right ascensions of the following stars have been established .

A set of absolute altitudes has been counted for half a set of equal altitudes .
The above stars in their upper and lower culminations , form in different parts of the meridian so many meridian marks established without the assistance of the transit : thus it is not likely that the optical axis of this instrument could pass on the same day at the precise time through each of them , unless the plane in which it moves be that of the meridian .
South Polar Distances of Circumpolar Stars deduced from their Superior and Inferior Culminations observed at Paramatta .
The refractions and.reductions for aberration , nutation and precession to the mean places in the beginning of 1828 , have been computed for each observation separately , and their mean has been applied to the mean of the microscopes for upper and lower culminations .
The half difference between the two thus corrected , gives the mean south polar distance for January 1 , 1828 .
The half sum is the polar point , which will serve hereafter for the reduction of the remainder of the stars .
" In determinations of positions of stars or of geographical places , the number and quality of observations upon which they are founded sholuld always be stated , in order that their due weight may be attached to them in comparisons with succeeding observations .

My observations for the determination thereof have been published in the second part of the third volume of the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society of London .
I took the measure from a brass meter made by LENOIR at Paris , which after my return to London was compared , by Messrs. TROUGHTON and SIMMS , with Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH'S Scale of the same metal , and found = 39.387988 English inches .
