Received November 20 , 1856 , -Read January 8 , 1857 .
HAVING in the year 1840 offered to the Royal Society an extensive research upon this subject , which was honoured with the kindest notice of the Society , I felt grateful for the reception it had met with ; and though in its preparation it had occupied my leisure time for some years , and contained the results of as many as 277 experiments , which I had made to prove the conclusions arrived at in it , I was still very anxious to improve and extend it .
Indeed the importance of the subject would seem to justify every effort I could make for the purpose , when it is considered that a large portion of the houses , warehouses and shops in London , Manchester , Liverpool and throughout the country , depend for their principal supports upon iron pillars , which frequently appear very thin for the weight they have to bear , and being hollow do not allow us to judge from their appearance how small a quantity of metal they have in them , or in other words , whether the building is abundantly strong , or is ready to fall down and crush the persons within it , as has frequently happened to warehouses and other buildings dependent on iron supports .
Some of the pillars are made to pass through more than one story , or even are based on the foundation , and support an intermediate floor and the roof .
The importance of the subject , in a practical point of view at least , rendered it desirable that a number of pillars of large size should be broken , to obtain data for the application of the principles established in the preceding research ; but this was impracticable at that time , notwithstanding the liberality of Mr. FAIRBAIRN , who bore the expense of that inquiry .
For by Mr. FAIRBAIRN'S lever then used , more than 18 tons could not be safely applied , and the , iron box or frame in which the pillars were broken did not admit pillars of greater length than 71 feet ; but the laborious inquiry in which I was afterwards engaged by Mr. STEPHENSON , for investigating the properties of the Menai and Conway tubular bridges ( that over the Conway in particular ) , required larger and more powerful apparatus than the preceding , and I can now apply more than three times the pressure formerly used , and break pillars of 10 feet long , and any shorter lengths , with even more accuracy than before .
A drawing of the former machine is given with the paper ( Philosophical Transactions , 1840 ) , and of the latter , with my experiments in the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the application of Iron to Railway Structures , 1849 .
The principle of both machines is the same ; the present is a single lever , about 17 feet , inches long , acting ( usually ) with a leverage of 8-4 upon the upper end of a strong bolt , which moves in a cylinder , just fitting it and keeping it always in the straight line of its pressure .
The top of the bolt is rounded , so that the pressure may act through the axis , and the bottom is flat , and made horizontal , that it may press on the top of a vertical pillar , enclosed in a strong box , as before .
See Plate XXXI .
The present experiments , and others in progress , were undertaken at the suggestion of Mr. ROBERT STEPHENSON , M.P. , F.R.S. , who knew that I had several experimental researches unfinished .
He has generously contributed ?

By the kind permission of the Council of University College , London , my apparatus has been set up at the College , and the experiments made there .
I have in the present research broken only larger pillars than before , having had them cast 10 feet long , and from 21 to 4 inches in diameter , solid and hollow .
The first series includes twenty pillars ( twelve of 10 feet long , and eight shorter ones cut out of them ) ; the whole of these were supplied by the proprietors of the Low Moor Iron-works , for which no charge has yet been madet .
The iron of which these , with five exceptions , were made , was Low Moor iron , No. 2 .
The former research of 1840 was from Low Moor iron , No. 3 ; and the difference of the two is not very great , though the No. 2 , as now used , is somewhat stronger than the other to bear a strain as a long pillar ( p. 864 ) , though softer than it and more easily crushed .
The results of these experiments have been applied to the formulae in my former research , which have undergone no change , except in the constants .
The former researches , and the formulae to which they were reduced , had been applied to pillars of Low Moor iron only , with one exception ; but though we could compute by them the strength for Low Moor iron , we had no evidence as to what were the relative strengths of pillars of the irons of the kingdom in general ; and , at my request , Messrs. EASTON and AMOS have had cast for this purpose twenty-two solid pillars , each 10 feet long and 21inches in diameter , of eleven kinds of iron , making thirteen kinds with two I have had from Low Moor .
The comparison of the breaking weights of these pillars shows that the strengths of the irons vary at least as 2 to 3 , and their crushing strengths as 5 to 9 nearly+ .
In carrying out the experiments , in taking the dimensions , and applying the results to the formule in my research above mentioned , I have had the assistance of Mr. JoHN BRIDGE , M.A. , of University College , my health and eyesight not being sufficient to enable me to bear the labour alone .
Before referring to the experiments which form the basis of the present memoir , I will give some notice of the principal matters contained in the former , but not sufficiently dilated upon ; especially as they have an important bearing upon what will follow , and will themselves receive further illustration , or perhaps be capable of demonstration .
The profound and beautiful researches of EULER on the strength of pillars are entirely theoretical ; they proceed on the supposition that the strength of a pillar is bounded by its power of resisting being bent out of a straight line , the resistance to incipient flexure being supposed to be the measure of its strength , which in long pillars , whose length is I and external and internal diameters d and d , , is 2 or --1 , according as they are solid or hollowt .
2 .
In commencing experiments , in my former research , on this subject , and keeping in view the theory of EULER , I sought with great care for the weight which would produce incipient flexure in columns , and more particularly in those of cast iron .
In this metal flexure commenced with very small weights , much smaller than would be useful to load pillars with in practice ; and I became convinced that no such point existed in cast iron , or at any rate none that would be useful to the engineer ; and my subsequent experiments upon wrought-iron pillars have been attended with very little more success , in seeking for the weight producing incipient flexure .
Having been unsuccessful in seeking for the weight which would first produce flexure in columns , and being convinced that if it were found it would be of little or no use in practice , I sought in future for the weights necessary to break the pillars tried , and in most instances for the deflection and decrement of length produced by the weights laid on .
3 .
The pillars broken were placed in a vertical position during the experiments , and their ends were pressed between two horizontal plates of hardened steel , which , from the nature of the machine , were kept perfectly parallel .
It was found that in cylindrical pillars of cast iron , whose ends were turned perfectly flat , parallel and perpendicular to the axis , the breaking weight varied as the 3*55th power of the diameter d3'55 d4 nearly , and inversely as the 1 7th power of the length , or as l-F7 instead of 1 , as in the 5d ' .
The fractional indices above theory of EULER .
In hollow pillars it is as The fractional indices above were found to apply to all solid pillars of cast iron , whose lengths varied from 120 times the diameter to as low as 30 times the diameter , or thereabouts .
For pillars shorter than these it will be necessary to correct the results obtained , by considerations dependent on the crushing strength of the material .
See pp. 403 to 406 of the former research+ .
4 .
The first experiments were made upon long uniform pillars , with their ends rounded in such a manner that the pressure applied to them would act in the direction of their axis , to meet the requirements of EULER 's theory of the strength of pillars ; but it soon became evident that pillars of the same size with their ends flat , and well supported or bedded throughout , would require a much greater weight to break them than those with rounded ends ; a large number of both kinds were made and broken by experiment to determine their relative strength to resist fracture , and it was found that so long as the pressure required had not been more than about one-fourth of that necessary to crush short specimens of the same material , the strength of a solid pillar with flat ends was a little more than three times that of one with rounded ends , the mean being 3-167 , as shown in the abstract , page 387 of that research , but in other experiments it is still nearer to 3 .
5 .
If the pressure necessary to break the pillar were much greater than about onefourth of that which would crush short specimens of the same material , then the ratio 1 to 3 would become 1 to 2 , or even less .
6 .
In the following abstract , pages 856 and 857 , which includes experiments on hollow pillars with rounded and with flat ends , as above , and upon solid pillars of wrought iron and timber , the ratio of the strengths of the two kinds of pillars is nearly as 1 to 3 , varying not widely from the former .
From this abstract we see that pillars which have been loaded with more than about one-fourth of the crushing weight are in some degree injured , and the ratio in them differs from 1 : 3 , becoming 1 : 26 , 1 : 2'4 , &amp;c. In the last column of the abstract , page 857 , denominated B it may be seen at a glance what portion of the crushing weight was required to break each pillar ; and in those where it amounted to *282 , *272 , or above *25 , they were generally injured by the pressure .
7 .
In the abstract , p. 393 of the former research , the relative strengths of pillars-with both ends rounded , one end rounded and one end flat , and both ends flat , -are determined in a great number of experiments , and found to be nearly as 1 , 2 , 3 , from experiments on cast iron , wrought iron , steel and timber .
8 .
In the abstract , page 391 of the former research , pillars 60inches long , with their ends turned flat , are compared , as to their strengths , with pillars of the same size with discs on their ends turned flat : the strengths of these two classes of pillars differed but little , but the pillars with discs on the ends are rather the stronger .
In this abstract it was shown that pillars one-half the length of the preceding , and of the same diameter but with the ends rounded , were of the same strength as the preceding ones nearly , as shown by many experiments .
Attempt to account for the principal Results in the preceding description of the abstracts .
1 .
Of the general conclusion arrived at in the abstract last referred to , I would offer the following as an explanation .
Suppose a long uniform bar of cast iron were bent by a pressure at its ends so as to take the form AbcdefB , where all the curves Abc , cde , efB , separated by the straight line AceB , would be equal , since the bar was supposed to be uniform .
The curve having taken this form , suppose it to be rendered immovable at the points b and f , by some firm fixings at those points .
This done , it is evident we may remove the parts near to A and B , without at all altering the curve bedef of the part of the pillar between b and f , and consider only that part .
The part bf , which alone we shall have to consider , will be equally bent at all the points b , d , f. The points c and e too are points of contrary flexure , consequently the pillar is not bent in them .
These points are unconstrained except by the pressure which forces them together , and the pillar might be reduced to any e degree in them , provided they were not crushed or detruded by the compressing force .
These points may then be conceived as acting like the rounded ends of the pillars in Table I. in the former research , and the part cde of the pillar , with its ends c and e rounded , will be bearing the same weight as the whole pillar bedef of double the length with its ends b , f firmly fixed .
e 2 .
That the strain at all the points b , d , f is nearly equal , is shown by subsequent experiments , in Tables V. and VI .
, upon pillars varying in length from 6 feet 3 inches to 5 feet and 2 feet 6 inches ; that fracture in some cases took place at all three points at the same time , and in others at two of them , showing the fracture to have commenced on opposite sides of the middle and of the ends , as might be inferred from the foregoing figure , or the last in Plate XXXII .
3 .
That the strength of a pillar , with moveable or rounded ends , is equal to that of a pillar of the same diameter , and double the length , the ends being flat or firmly fixed , may be inferred from the reasoning above ; but it is proved experimentally from various results in the abstract p. 391 of the former research , or as below .
4 .
The strengths of pillars of the same diameter , but of different lengths , vary inversely as the 1'7th or l*6th power of the length , or in this case as 21'7 or 21'6 nearly , according to my experiments .
Hence the strength of a pillar one-half the length of another is 3-249 or 3'031 times greater than it ; or in other words , the strength of a pillar with flat ends is somewhat more than three times as great as that of one of the same length and diameter with rounded ends .
5 .
This is shown in the abstract , p. 387 of the former research , from numerous experiments on solid pillars , with both ends rounded and both ends flat , the mean ratio of their strengths being ... ... ... . .
1 : 3'167 In the abstract , pages 856 and 857 of the present research , the mean ratio from the comparison of the strengths of four hollow pillars , with rounded ends and LMeanratio 1 : 3107 of the like number with flat ends , was ... .
1:3077 In the same abstract , solid pillars of the two forms , of wrought iron and of timber , gave from several experiments a mean ratio of ... ... . .
1 : 3076J 5T2 855 The great difference between the strength of a pillar with both ends rounded and both ends flat , is rendered obvious by their different modes of fracture , the former breaking in one place only , the middle ; and the latter in three , at the middle and at each end .
7 .
In pillars with one end rounded and one end flat , fracture takes place at about one-third of the distance from the rounded end ; and if the base of the pillar be enlarged with a disc , the distance of the place of fracture from the top of a pillar 30 inches long is but '28 inch from one-third of the whole length from the top , deduced from a mean of two experiments , in which one pillar broke at 10-42 inches , and the other at 10-30 inches ( mean , 1036 inches ) from the rounded end ( see p. 439 of former research ) .
8 .
If the pillar had had both ends rounded , then the centre of fracture would have been at the middle , at b ( first pillar , Plate XXXII .
) , or at half the height : in the cases before us , fracture took place at two-thirds of the height nearly , or at b ( second pillar ) .
Hence , comparing the distances Ab , Ab of the points of fracture from the rounded ends of two pillars of equal diameter and height , one with both ends rounded , and the other with one end rounded and one end flat , we have those distances as 1 to 3 , or as 3 to 2 nearly .
9 .
The relative strengths of the two pillars should therefore be inversely as the 1 7th or l-6th powers of their lengths , Ab , Ab , or as 3-249:6'473 , or 3-031:5-8 , differing not widely from 1 to 2 , as is shown by various experiments in Tables I. , II .
, V. , XII .
, XIII .
of the former research .
10 .
Moreover , it will appear that in the curve indicating the form of flexure to the third pillar , Plate XXXII .
, the distance Abce will apply to the first pillar , Abed to the second pillar , and bedef to the third pillar ; these distances being inversely as 2 , 3 , 4 , the i-7th powers of which are 3-249 , 6-473 , 10-556 , and the 1-6th powers 3X031 , 5 8 , 9-19 , or as 1 , 2 , 3 , nearly .
11 .
Hence , of three pillars of the same length and diameter , one with both ends rounded , one with one end rounded and one end flat , and the other with both ends flat , the strengths are as 1 , 2 , 3 .
The following facts , from the subsequent experiments , illustrate the last of the preceding figures .
See also forms of fracture , Plate XXXIII .
In pillars of " Second London Mixture , " 2 feet 6 inches long and 11 inch diameter , fracture took place near to the middle and by breaking across near each end .
A pillar of Old Hill iron , 5 feet long and 2-1 inches diameter , broke in the middle , and broke across near each end .
In pillars 6 feet 3 inches long , fracture took place in the middle , and each end became split .
This was the case in all these pillars .
In pillars 7 feet 6 inches long and 2inches in diameter-that of Derwent iron broke in the middle and split off at each end ; one of Old Park and one of London Mixture broke in three pieces , and split off at one end : there would appear to have been more points of contrary flexure in each of these two pillars than in the other cases .
858 General Remarks on the following Experiments .
The experiments forming the basis of this research are on the strength of cast-iron pillars in two series , the first being on Low Moor Iron , No. 2 , each 10 feet long , varying in diameter from 2to 4 inches , solid and hollow ; of these there are fourteen , including two on Blaenavon iron , No. 3 ; the second series are on solid pillars of cast iron , 10 feet long and 21 inches diameter , from various parts of the kingdom , making twenty-four pillars , with two of a smaller diameter ; other pillars cut out of the preceding ones , and made 7 feet 6 inches , 6 feet 3 inches , 5 feet , &amp;c. long , amount with the former ones to seventy-two .
The experiments on these are distributed in Tables I. to VI .
In two other Tables ( VII .
and VIII .
) other experiments are given , to determine the transverse strengths of some of the irons , in order to compare these with their direct strength as pillars , besides numerous experiments to obtain the crushing strengths of the pillars , and the comparative hardness of the irons in different parts of their sections .
The forms of the fractures of pillars in the first six Tables are given in Plate XXXIII .
It has been seen that the strength of long pillars of cast iron varies as a constant power n of the diameter nearly ; the pillars being solid and uniform in texture , and nearly as the difference of the same powers of the external and internal diameters , when the pillars are hollow ; or as dn in solid pillars , and D"ld in hollow ones , D and d being the external and internal diameters .
This power n was found in my former researches* to be 3 55 , from the mean result of many experiments on the strength of pillars flat at the ends .
In the following experiments , which are on pillars of a larger kind than before , and the iron therefore somewhat softer than iron cast in smaller masses , the average value of n is much more near to 3 50 than to 3 55 , the mean from nineteen comparisons being 3-513 ( page 865 ) .
The strength of pillars , whose diameter is the same , varied inversely as the 1-7th power of the length nearly , according to the average result from pillars with rounded ends and with flat ends , in my former experiments .
But in the present ones , on flat-ended pillars only , the power of the length from the results of twenty-five comparisons ( page 866 ) is 1*63 nearly , instead of 1*7 , as before found .
The preceding results apply only to pillars whose length is thirty times the diameter or upwards ; for pillars shorter than this , the formula for their strength would need correcting by the introduction of the crushing weight of the pillart .
Tables of the powers above for pillars likely to occur in practice are as below .
m D'_Wd " -pof which expressions the first is represented by x , and is calculated on two suppositions for the value of n ; the other depends on the value of p. From my former experiments , n was taken as 3 55 , andp as 1P7 ; and from the experiments in the present research , we have n=3 5 , and p=1'63 , as mentioned before .
To assist in computing the strength of pillars , according to this last supposition , the two Tables of powers of the diameters and lengths of pillars previously given ( page 860 ) have been formed .
W The experiments give the mean value of x , or DW-d , as 2085'2 or 2223'7 lbs. for the strength of a pillar 10 feet long and 1 inch diameter ; but for a pillar of 1 foot long and 1 inch diameter it would be xx 10 , where 10=50'119 , or 42-658 .

In the columns ( Experiments 7 and 8 ) they are too low .
These had been weakened by being ' turned on the outside to reduce their strength , as they had been cast stronger than it was supposed the machinery would break without injury to it .
The great reduction in strength produced by taking away the external crust , shows that to ornament a pillar it would not be prudent to plane it .
It may , however , be mentioned that the eighth pillar had many flaws in it .
In experiments upon hollow pillars , it is frequently found that the metal on one side is much thinner than that on the other , but this does not produce so great a diminution in the strength as might be expected , for the thinner part of a casting is much harder than the thicker ( Table VIII .
) , and this usually becomes the compressed side .
The strength of a solid pillar , 10 feet long and 1 inch diameter , being , from the first mean above , 2085 2 lbs. , that of a solid pillar , 1 foot long and 1 inch diameter , will , since 10'l7=50 119 , be 2085-2 x 50-119 =104508 lbs. , or 46-65 tons ; the strength being supposed to vary directly as the 3 55 power of the diameter , and inversely as the 1*7 power of the length , as obtained from the experiments in my former paper on this subject* .
The larger and more varied pillars in the present research , have , by experiments deduced from most of the irons in the kingdom , given more precise results for the constants on which the strength depends .
They show that it varies directly as the 3'5 power of the diameter , much more nearly than as the 3-55 power , and inversely as the 1P63 power of the length , from a mean of many experiments in each case ( see pages 865 and 866 ) .
From the second mean value of x in the preceding summary , that depending on the 3-5 power of the diameter , the strength of a pillar 10 feet long and 1 inch diameter is 2223'7 lbs. , and this multiplied by 101'63 or 42-658 ( see Table II .
page 860 ) , gives 94858-59 lbs.=42-347 tons , for the strength of a pillar 1 foot long and 1 inch diameter .
Whence w being the breaking weight in tons of a pillar whose length is I in feet , and external and internal diameters D and d in inches , the ends being flat and well-bedded , we have , in Low Moor iron , No. 2D-3'55_d355 w=46-65 X.17 , from formulae in Philosophical Transactions , 1840 ; D 3'5_ d3'5 w=42-347x 1.63 from formule in the present paper .
The preceding chapter contains the results of experiments on the strength of pillars 10 feet long , solid as well as hollow , the hollow ones varying from 2to 4 inches external diameter , and the solid ones cast from models 2 } inches diameter .
They are all of Low Moor iron , No. 2 , except two , Nos. 13 and 14 , of Blaenavon iron .
In the previous researcht the iron used was that of Low Moor , No. 3 , and there appears to be very little difference in their strengths , though the No. 2 seems to be rather the stronger .
The experiments in Table IX .
of the previous paper are on hollow pillars 1-75 inch external diameter and upwards ; and on solid pillars of the same diameter nearly , the From the present experiments on pillars whose models were 2inches diameter in most cases , Tables I. to VI .

In the former experimental paper , mentioned above , I assumed 1'7 as the inverse power which the strength of pillars of the same diameter and of different lengths followed nearly , this applying both to pillars with rounded ends and to those with flat ends ; but it appears from above , that in flat-ended pillars , representing the great mass of those used in practice , the strength would be better represented by some number intermediate between 1-6 and 1-7 : the results of the experiments here detailed give 1-63 as a mean nearly , and this number may be used for all pillars whose length is more than about thirty times the diameter .
In pillars shorter than this the formula used for calculating their strength would require correcting , as previously mentioned in page 859 .
Strength of Pillars , the Iron in the section of which is not uniform .
The iron of all the pillars in this research is assumed to be uniform and of equal resistance throughout the surface of fracture , but this is perhaps seldom or never the case in cast iron , except possibly in very large castings .
My experiments on the crushing of cast iron , made for the British Association , to determine the relative values of hot and cold blast iron , of which an abstract is given in my 'Experimental Researches on the Strength and other properties of Cast Iron , 1846 , ' showed that small cylinders of cast iron , No. 2 , from the Carron Iron-works , turned to the exact dimensions from castings made but little larger than the size intended , required to crush them 130163 lbs. per square inch when they were I inch diameter , and 132319 lbs. per square inch when they were -3inch diameter , from means of several experiments .
In cylinders and prisms cut out of larger masses , the crushing weight per square inch was reduced to 119730 lbs. , 103012 lbs. , 102884 lbs. , 108315 lbs. , 96764 lbs. , &amp;c. In the experiments made to determine the crushing strength of the iron in my former experiments on pillars , cylinders *52 inch diameter and nearly of the size of the original casting , required 115910 lbs. per square inch to crush them , and small rectangles cut out of masses 1 inch square required 103692 lbs. only .
In some experiments made by Captain ( now Colonel ) JAMES , as a Member of the Royal Commission for inquiring into the application of Iron to Railway Structures* , it was found that the central part of bars of iron planed was much weaker to bear a transverse strain than bars cast of the same size .
He states that " it was found by planing out 4-inch bars from the centre of 2-inch square and 3-inch square bars , that the central portion was little more than half the strength of that from an inch bar , the relation being as 7 to 12 " ( there may be some doubt whether the iron was sound at the centre ) .
In page 111 of the same Report , I showed that rectangular bars of cast iron , cast 1 , 2 , and 3 inches square , laid upon supports 41 feet , 9 feet , and 13-feet asunder , were broken by weights of 447 lbs. , 1394 lbs. , and 3043 lbs. respectively .
These weights , divided by the squares of the lengths , should give equal results ; the quotients , however , were as 447 , 349 , and 338 respectively .
I attributed this falling off and deviation from theory partly to the defect of elasticity , which I had always found in cast iron , but principally to the superior hardness of the smaller castings .
From the experiments on the resistance to a crushing force of the various kinds of iron used in this research , it was found that short cylinders , 3 inch in diameter and 11 inch high , cut out of pieces cast 2n inches diameter , resisted the when cut out of the part near to the surface than when cut out of that near to the centre .
To try this , many small cylinders , from four or five kinds of iron , were cut from the centre , and from the part intermediate between the centre and the circumference ( Table VIII .
) , and it was found that the cylinders from the latter part were always stronger than those from the centre ; thus , in cylinders from pillars of Old Park iron , No. 1 , cast as above mentioned 2n inches diameter , the mean crushing force of the iron near to the circumference was 3932 tons per square inch , and that from the centre 3333 tons per square 5.99 inch , the difference being 5*99 tons .
Whence 3932=1523 , the ratio of the falling off of the resistance of the central part to the resistance of the external part .

By comparing the results of the experiments on the resisting powers of the different irons in the kingdom to a crushing force , with those obtained from the direct strengths of pillars of the same irons , 10 feet long and 2 ' inches diameter , it appears that the crushing force varies rather widely from being as the direct strength of pillars from the same model .
Though the ratio assumed is merely an approximation , it will afford means of approaching to the falling off in the strength of pillars , when the resistance of the different parts to a crushing force is known .
Taking the results from the breaking weights of three of the strongest iron pillars , each 10 feet long and 2|r inches diameter , and the crushing weights of the irons from those pillars , we have from the strongest pillarsBreaking weights of the pillars .

The last number , 412857 , ought to have been 464070 if the breaking weights had been as the crushing weights .
But the breaking weight of pillars depends on the tensile and crushing weights conjointly , though principally upon the latter ; the assumption of that proportion must be taken as an approximation only , as previously mentioned .
Let r , r ' be the resistances to crushing per square inch of the parts near to the circumference and to the centre respectively ; D , d the external diameter , and that which includes the softer part of the metal near to the centre .
Then r-r'= the falling off per square inch in the resistance of the softer part below that of the external part .

( A. ) To obtain some additional information as to the distribution of the metal in a large casting , one was formed 9 inches square and 12 inches long , or upwards .
It was cast erect from Derwent iron , No. 1 , and was then placed upon a slotting machine , and cut directly across in the middle .
It was found , however , that there was a hole in the centre , about 4 inch or 1 inch in diameter ; transverse slices were therefore cut , one from above and one from below the central defective piece ; these two slices , each 9 inches square and 1 inch thick nearly , were divided from one side to the other , passing through the centre of each , into nine equal parts , and from each part cylinders were cut , all of the same diameter , 4 inch , and length 1 } inch , four on each side of the central one .

In the part marked B , which was cast under the greater head of metal , the iron from three divisions near the centre , or one-third of the distance across , was crushed with somewhat less weight than that from the external part , the greatest difference being from 29160 at the centre , to 33394 at the side .
The mean resistance of the three central cylinders in this slice is 29944 lbs. , and of the six external ones 32375 lbs. , the difference being much less than in the iron of the smaller castings tried .
The iron in the upper part , marked A in the figure , being cast under a less head of metal than the former , and floating at the top of the softer metal below , was considerably stronger than the other .
The central portion of this was , contrary to all our previous experience , much harder than the rest , and varied from 31512 and 31983 at the sides , to 37627 , 39039 and 39980 near to the middle .
To explain this strange anomaly in the absence of other knowledge , it seems not improbable that some additional heavier metal had been poured into the top part of the mould , when that in the lower part had in some degree solidified .
From the experiments upon the two last castings , which are on a larger scale than those which precede them , it appears that the difference of hardness between the external and internal parts of a large casting is much less than in a small one , and may frequently be neglected .
The following experiments were made after the others had been offered to the Royal Society , or during the months of October and November 1857 , and as the former solid pillars were from various parts of the kingdom , and usually of the iron termed No. 1 , I was desirous of adding the results from a few solid pillars of the quality No. 2 .
These latter pillars were mostly cast circular , and were made 10 feet long and 2inches diameter , with their ends turned flat as before .
To these were added pillars of nearly the same weight , of a square and a triangular form of section , to ascertain the comparative strength of pillars whose sections were circular , square , and triangular .
The cylindrical pillars , in the experiments of which an abstract is given below , though of different irons , were all cast from the same model ; and the square and the triangular pillars were of the same kind of iron as two of the circular ones ( the Calder , No. 2 ) , and were intended to be of the same weights as these .
All the pillars were made uniform throughout their lengths , 10 feet long each , and turned flat at the ends .
As the weights of the different pillars did not differ widely from 150 lbs. each , the breaking weight of each is reduced to what it would have been if the weight had been 150 lbs. The reduced results are as below .

This last conclusion , respecting the strength of triangular solid pillars , may not be considered void of importance .
See Notes to experiments 8 and 9 , Table IX .
following .
Whence it appears that solid triangular pillars with flat ends are stronger than those with either circular or square sections ; but this seems not to be the case in pillars with rounded ends , for from my former experiments* , a pillar , whose section is + , as in the connecting rod of a steam-engine , the ends being moveable , is very weak to bear a strain as a pillar ; and indeed less than half the strength of a hollow cylindrical pillar of the same weight and length , rounded at the ends .
Comparing the results of the cylindrical pillars tried , it appears that those of the second quality , or No. 2 , are usually weaker than those of No. 1 of the same iron .
In the irons below we have the breaking weights of pillars , 10 feet long and 21 inches diameter , of the first and second quality , as follow : Old Park Iron , No. 1 Calder Iron , No. 1 .

The properties of the irons of the second quality are deduced from the following Table of experiments ; those of irons termed No. 1 may be obtained from the second summary of results , page 871 .

As the weights of the following pillars differed generally but little from that above , and a leading object being to compare the results together , the breaking weight has been reduced , as before mentioned , in each case , to what it would have been for a pillar weighing exactly 150 lbs. lbs. 55032.55032.50328 894 This pillar broke , different from the last , by compression of the edge , showing great additional strength .
Note .
The last pillar broke by the compression of one of the edges , and the iron in these , being harder than that in the thicker parts , would offer greater resistance to crushing than in them ; and hence the strength of the pillar would be increased ( see the experiments in Table VIII .
) .
The part subjected to crushing would in this pillar be at a greater distance from the centre of the section than in the others ; and from my numerous experiments on the resistances to crushing and to tearing asunder in cast iron , it appears that the former is , on the average , about six times as great as the latter .
See my experiments in the Report of the Commissioners on the Application of Iron to Railway Structures , page 15 .
From these and other causes the greater strength of a solid triangular pillar of cast iron , above one of a circular or square section , may be inferred ; a conclusion not without importance in some applications of the metal .
