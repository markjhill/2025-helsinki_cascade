A Letter to the Right Honourable Hugh Earl of Marchmont .
F. R. S. concerning the Sections of a Solid , hitherto not considered by Geometers ; from William Brakenridge , D. D. Rector of St. Michael Bassishaw London , and F. R. S. My Lord , YOUR knowledge in Geometry , and the other Sciences that depend upon it , makes me presume to lay before you the following speculations .
Your benevolence to all philosophical Inquiries encourages me , and the personal regard I have for your Lordship induces me to do myself this honour ; and tho ' what I offer at present may be of no great consequence , I am persuaded , that every little accession to our knowledge will give you some pleasure , as you very well know , that all our improvements in science are slow , and from small beginnings .
You have here a new method of considering some geometrical curves , from the sections of a solid , hitherto not taken notice of , and by which , in particular , you will see , that the two infinite curve lines from the section of the cone , are also the sections of this ; which may be of some use , as it seems to extend our views of their nature and properties .
The description of it is very easy and obvious , and it has something remarkable in its form , that tho ' , in the most simple case , it is generated and bounded by right lines , the surface is incurvated .
The solid is thus described .

R AQ RC LK P PO ODLEn ~NB N Let DN be a right line drawn on a plane , and a point given A at any distance from the line , from which having raised , above the plane , the right line AM in any given angle , and drawing from the same point A the line A D , meeting the line DN on the plane in D , make another plane MNR to move parallel to itself , and to that line AD in a given angle to the first plane ; and then , suppose the intersections of it M , N , m , n , &amp;c. with the lines AM and D N , to be continually joined with right lines M N , m n , &amp;c. and there will be generated an incurvated surface by them , and bounded by the lines A M , M N , N D , A D. Plate X. Fig. 1 .
The same surface will be described , if a line MN be supposed to move in such manner , along the lines AM and D N , that the parts AM and DN be continually in a given ratio .
For let a plane be drawn thro ' the raised line A M , perpendicular to the given plane AD N , and their common intersection be the line A R ; then having joined the points A and D , from the point N , while the line MN is moving , let there be continually drawn a line NR parallel to D A , meeting the line of intersection ARE of the planes in R , and the proportion of DN to ARE will always be given .
But as the ratio of DN to AM is given , the ratio of AM to ARE will also be given ; and the line RM being drawn , the angle ARM will be given ; and therefore the plane of the triangle MRN will move parallel to itself , and to the line A D , making the given angle MRA with the plane AD N , and the line MN will generate the same surface as before .
It is evident this incurvated surface may be infinitely extended on all sides beyond the lines A M , M N , N D , A D , and as well below the given plane ADN as above it ; and therefore the various sections of it , if continued , will be infinite lines .
The line A M , raised above the given plane AD N , may be called the vertical Directrix .
And if thro ' this directrix AM there be drawn a plane AMR in any given angle to the plane AD N , intersecting the moving plane NMR in the line M R , and meeting the given plane ADN in R ; then the points A , R , and R , N , being joined , there will be a trapezium ARN D , formed , that may be named the Base , and in which the line DN may be called the Directrix of the Base .
And the plane AMR passing thro ' the vertical directrix and the moving plane MN R , together with the base ARN D , and the curve surface , will make a solid AMRND A , something in the form of a wedge .
In this solid there may be made five sections in a given angle with the base , or parallel to it ; viz , one parallel to the moved plane ; one parallel to the directrix of the base ; another parallel to the vertical directrix ; a fourth parallel to the base ; and a fifth intersecting both the directrices .
And in all these cases , when the directrices are right lines , the sections will be either the conic hyperbola , or the parabola , or right lines .
1 st , If the solid AMRNDA be cut by a plane parallel to the moved or generating plane NM R , or the line A D , the section will be a right line .
This is evident from the description , Fig. 1 .
2 .
If the section be made by a plane BPO parallel to the directrix of the base D N , and in any given angle to the base , it will be an hyperbola , Fig 2 .
Let the section PBO meet the base in the line B O , which will be parallel to D N , and make the moving plane NMR intersect the base in N R , the vertical directrix in M , and the section in P O ; by which D B=N O. From the point M draw MR parallel to P O , and imagine a plane to pass through the directrix AM and the line M R , meeting the base in A R ; which will be given in position .
Then thro ' the point A draw A Q , parallel to D N , intersecting NR in Q , and making N Q=A D ; and the two triangles ARE Q , AM R , will have all their angles given , and the proportion of their sides .
And therefore the ratio of AQ to Q R , and of AQ to M R , will be given .
Make A D=a , B D=b , A Q : QR : : a : q , and A Q : M R : : a : m , the abscisse B O=x , and the ordinate PO= y ; from which QR=q x/ a , NR= a+qx/ a , MR=m x/ a. And then from the similar triangles NO P , NM R , the analogy N O : OP : : N R : MR will give the equation yx q+y a2 =xb m , and the curve BP is an hyperbola .
3 .
If the section PB be made by a plane parallel to the vertical directrix A M , it will be an hyperbola .
Fig. 1 .
Let the moving plane MR N , parallel to D A , intersect the base in R N , and the vertical directrix in M , and make the plane of the section BPO cut the moving plane NMR in P O , and the base in the line B O , meeting DA in Z , and the base directrix DN in B ; from the point M draw the line MR parallel to the plane of the section , and meeting the base in R ; and the lines MR and PO will be parallel .
Then thro ' the vertical A M , and the line M R , make a plane to pass , which will be parallel to the section , intersecting the base in A R , and the lines ARE and BO will also be parallel .
Draw BL parallel to D A , or N R , passing ARE in L , and then BO=L R , BL=RO=A Z , and AL=B Z. And the line ARE being given in position , the lines BL and AL will be given .
The angles also MAR and NBO being given , the ratio of ARE to R M , and of BO to O N , will be given .
Suppose ADz =B L=a , A L=c the abscisse B O=x , the ordinate P O=y , and A R : R M : : a : m , and B O : O N : : a : n , from which we have O N= n x/ a , R M= m c+m x/ a ; N R=a +n x/ a. And then , in the triangles on the moving plane , which are similar , MR N , PO N , the analogy N O : P O : : N R : RM will produce the equation y a3 +nxa y=x2n m+xnm c ; which shows the curve BP to be an hyperbola ; and the figure is convex to the base .
4 .
The section being made parallel to the base , it will be the same curve .
Fig. 3 .
Having thro ' the vertical directrix made a plane AMR to pass perpendicular to the base , let the section BP O , and the base parallel to it , meet that plane in the lines BO and A R , and also the moving plane NMR in the lines PO and N R. From the point A draw AQ parallel to the directrix DN of the base , and AD parallel to N R , and from B the line BC parallel to O R , meeting ARE in C ; and then the lines A D , A C , and B C , will be given , and the angles RA Q , MA R , being also given , the proportion of ARE to Q R , and of BO to M O , will be known .
Make AD= a , AC= c , the abscisse BO= x , the ordinate PO= y , and A R : RQ : : a : q ; from which we have M O : M R : : x : x + c , QR=cq+q x/ a. And because , in the similar triangles MP O , and MN R , in the moving plane , we have M O : P O : : M R : R N , there will result the equation yxa+yca= x2 q+xcq+x a2 ; which denotes the curve BP to be an hyperbola .
5 .
If the section is made so as to meet the two directrices , the curve will be also an hyperbola .
Fig. 4 .
Let the section BPO meet the directrices in B , m , and intersect the plane of the base in the line B O ; and make the moving plane NMR to be cut by the section in P O , and to meet the vertical directrix in M. Then from the point M draw MR parallel to P O ; and thro ' the lines A M , M R , imagine , as before , a plane to pass , intersecting the base in the line ARE r , and meeting the line BO in r , and the section in m r. And from A draw AD parallel to N R , and AQ to D N ; and thro ' r make nr parallel to N R , and to meet AQ in q , and DN in n. Draw also from the point B the line BC parallel to A D , and meeting AQ in C. The lines then A q , A r , m r , r q , B r , B n , r n , will be given .
Make therefore A D=a=BC , A Q : Q R : : a : q , and A Q : RM : : a : m , B r : B n : : a : b , B r : r n : : a : n , A C=D B =c ; the abscisse B O=x ; the ordinate O P=y .
From which we have BN=b x/ a , ON=n x/ a , AQ=c+ b x/ a , RQ=qca+qb x/ a2 , MR=mc a+m b x/ a2 .
And then , in the similar triangles NP O , MR N , having N O : P O : : N R : M R , the equation will be y a4+ yc a2q+y xba q=n mca x+n mb x2 .
And the curve is an hyperbola ; and in the case of this Fig. 4 .
it will be convex to the plane of the base .
But when BN is negative in the case of Fig. 5 .
the equation , retaining the same symbols , will be y a4+y qc a2 yxbq a=m ncaxnmb x2 ; and the hyperbolic curve will be concave towards the base .
6 .
If the vertical directrix AM is made parallel to the plan of the base , but the plane passing thro ' it not parallel to the other directrix , then the section , meeting the two directrices , will also be the same curve .
Fig. 6 .
For in this case the line MR is a constant quantity ; and therefore , if the common section are of the plane thro ' the vertical A M , with the base , meet aD parallel to NR in a , other being as before , making M R=m , and D a=a ; from the analogy N O : P O : : N R : MR in the triangles NO P , MR N , we shall have ma x=y a3 +yacq+yxq b ; by which the curve is known to be an hyperbola .
And in all those sections , where the common intersection of the plane , passing thro ' the vertical with the base , is not parallel to the other directrix , the curve is an hyperbola .
7 .
But now , if we suppose the common intersection ARE of the plane passing thro ' the vertical , with the base , to be parallel to the directrix DN of the base , and both directrices to be cut by the section , the curve will be a parabola .
Fig. 7 .
For , in this case , the two lines ARE and AQ coincide , and ARE is parallel to the directrix DN of the base ; and therefore , using the same symbols as above , the equation , from Fig. 4 .
will be reduced to y a4=n mcax+nmb x2 ; and from Fig. 5 .
it will come to y a4=n mca x-n mb x2 ; both which show the curve to be a parabola .
It may also be demonstrated in this manner .
It is evident , that P O : m r : : PO~M R : mr~M R , that is , the ratio of PO to mr is equal to that compounded of P O : M R , and of M R : m r. But from the similar triangles MR N , PO N , we have P O : MR : : N O : NR=n r , and from the triangles BO N , Br n , we have B O : B r : : N O : n r ; therefore P O : M R : : B O : B r. In like manner , from the equiangular triangles MR A , mr A , there will be M R : m r : : R A : r A , and from the triangles RO r , ZA R , it is R A : r A : : O z : r z ; therefore M R : m r : : o z : r z. If then in the ratio of PO~RM to mr~M R , we substitute the ratio of B O : B r , and of O Z : r z , which are equal to P O : M R , and M R : m r , we shall have P O : m r : : BO~o z : Br~r z ; which is a known property of the parabola .
And thus I have endeavoured to extend , a little , the Theory of the conic sections .
I have here shown how two of them may be had from the sections of this solid ; and in the year 1733 , I published , in my Exercitatio Geometrica , a method of describing all of them on a plane , by the moving of three right lines about three given points , two of the intersections being drawn along two other lines given in position ; the only hint of which I had from a geometric tric locus , in the construction of a clock , by the celebrated M. De la Hire , in the French Memoires for the year 1717 , entitled , Construction d'une Horologe qui marque le vrai tems avec le moyen .
Having now briefly considered the various sections of this solid , the directrix DN of the base being a right line , let us next see what they are when it is a curve line of any order .
But because there are an infinite number of cases , it will be sufficient to mention a few of them , when that directrix is a conic section or circle , and then to give a general proposition when it is any higher geometrical curve .
8 .
If the directrix DN of the base be a parabola , having a diameter parallel to the intersection ARE of the plane , passing thro ' the vertical A , and other things being as before , the section BP will be a line of the third order .
Fig. 8 .
Let the diameter be DL n , the ordinate N n , and the equation of the parabola u2=z p , and make the moving plan MNR to pass thro ' the ordinate N n , and the section to intersect the base in B O , and the diameter in E. From the points B and D draw BL and D C , parallel to N O , and meeting the lines ARE and Dn in C and L. Then suppose A R : RM ::a:m , and B O : L n : : a : n , A C=c , D C=d , BL =b , D L=l , B E=e , N n=u , D n=z , the abscisse B O=x , the ordinate P O=y ; and we have L n=z l=n x/ a , no=b~x e/ e , MR=mc+m z/ a = mca+mal+nx m/ a2 and u2 =apl+px n/ a. But from the similar triangles NPO and NMR we have this proportion N O : P O : : N R : M R , which gives the equation bxbe~mca+mal+nmxdy a2 e/ y a2 emcaemalenmxe= u=~pl+px n/ a ; and this being reduced , shows , that the section PB is a line of the third order .
9 .
If the directrix DN be a circle , and other things being as before , the section will be a line of the fourth order .
Fig. 9 .
Make the center of the circle to be in the line DLn parallel to A Q , the ordinate to be Nn= u , the abscisse Dn= z , the radius = r , and the equation u2 =2rz z2 .
And let the plane passing thro ' the vertical , cut the base in A R , and the section meet the diameter DK in E. Then the same things being supposed , and the symbols retained as before , we shall have Ln=zl=x n/ a , z=al+x n/ a , nO=bxe b/ e , QR=qac+qal+qn x/ a2 , MR= mac+mal+mn x/ a2 , ~2rl a2 +2rxna x2 n2 2alnx a2 l~/ a2 = u. And the analogy N O : P O : : N R : MR will give this equation , mac+mal+mn x/ a2 ~beb x/ e + y a2 d+yqac+yqal+yqn x/ a2 =mac+mal+mnx a2 y/ a2 ~~2rl a2 +2rxna x2 n2 2alnx a2 l2/ a2 ; from which it appears , that the curve BP is a line of the fourth order .
And in general it may be seen , that if the directrix of the base be a conic section , except in the case above , the section of the solid will be a line of the fourth order .
10 .
If the vertical be parallel to the base , and the plane passing thro ' it perpendicular , the directrix of the base being a circle , having its center in the intersection ARE of the two planes ; then the solid will be the cono-cuneus of the learned Dr. Wallis , and the various curve sections of it will be also lines of the fourth order .
Fig. 10 .
In this case , the quantities QR and DC will vanish , and making MR= m , the equation , retaining the other symbols , will be my~ ~2rxna+2rl a2 x2 2xnla a2 l2/ a2 =m~ebx b/ e. And there it is surprising that the great Doctor , while he was considering his solid , did not fall upon the one I have explained ; but indeed , in searching after new discoveries , we are often like those , who , groping in the dark , miss the things that are nearest them .
11 .
To conclude , if the directrix DN of the base be a line of any order n , the section BP will be of the order 2 n. Fig. 11 .
In the equation of the curve directrix DN of the base un =A zn +B zn-1 u+C zn-2 u2 +D zn-3 u3 &amp;c. make the abscisse Dn= z , and the ordinate Nn= u ; and draw AQ parallel to D n , and then , other things being as before , the analogy N O : PO : : N R : MR will be thus expressed , u+ bxe b/ e : y : : u+d+qnx+qa l+q a c/ a2 : nmx+mal+mc a/ a2 ; from which we shall have u= ebbx~nmx+mca+ma l/ ~ mal+emnx+mace a2 ey+d a2 y+nqxy+qaly+qya c/ m nx+mac a2 y+ma l. And because Dn=z=l+n x/ a , if we substitute these values of u and z , in the above general equation the line of the section BP will appear to be of the order 2 n. And now , my Lord , I have given you some general propositions about the various sections of this solid , and I have shown how lines of any order may arise from them ; which is a new theory , and perhaps may introduce to something farther .
I have other things of this sort , that relate to what I have published in the Philosophical Transactions , Vol. 39 .
in the year 1735 , which I have had many years by me , that I intend to send you , if my health , and the circumstances of my life , will allow me to revise them .
And in the mean time , with great respect , I am , My Lord , Your Lordship 's most obedient and affectionate servant , Wm. Brakenridge .
