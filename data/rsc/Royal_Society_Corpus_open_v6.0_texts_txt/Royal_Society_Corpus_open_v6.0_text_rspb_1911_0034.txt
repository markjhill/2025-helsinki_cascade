( Received February 15 , \#151 ; Read March 16 , 1911 .
) The object of these experiments was to try to discover if there is any definite cycle of development of the trypanosome of Sleeping Sickness in the tsetse fly , Glossina palpalis , and if the late or renewed infectivity of the fly coincides with any phase in this development .
The mode of experimentation was to feed a cageful of laboratory-brccl tsetse flies on an animal whose blood contained numerous trypanosomes , and at the end of various times to kill the flies and examine their intestinal contents .
This was done for periods of one day , two days , three days , and so on , up to 56 days .
The microscopical examination of preparations made from the intestinal contents on the various days gave information as to the number and appearance of the trypanosomes .
After the infective feed or feeds the flies were fed every day on a healthy animal , So that by the appearance of trypanosomes in the animal 's blood the day on which one or more of the flies became infective could be arrived at .
Method Used in the Examination of the Flies .
The flies were killed by exposing them to the vapour of chloroform .
After being killed the proboscis and pharynx were removed and examined under a cover-glass with the high and low powers .
The terminal segment of the abdomen of the fly was then snipped off , and the whole abdominal viscera gently pressed out .
This was moistened with a little normal saline solution , and the gut unravelled without rupturing .
The proventriculus and crop were often pulled out intact with the gut .
The whole thoracic and abdominal tract could then be laid out in line and examined under a low power .
In taking'out the gut it was generally possible to draw out with it the abdominal portion of the salivary glands , which could then be separated without contamination from accidental rupture of the gut .
If the salivary glands or proventriculus remained behind they were dissected out after removal of the gut .
In every case these organs were thoroughly washed in .514 Col. Sir D. Bruce and others .
Development of [ Feb. 15 , three changes of normal saline solution , in order to minimise the chance of their being contaminated by accidental rupture of the intestines .
The stained specimens were examined day after day , and coloured .drawings , at a magnification of 2000 diameters , made of all the different forms met with .
The drawings of the trypanosomes found in the proboscis , proventriculus , fore-gut , mid-gut , hind-gut , proctodseum , and salivary glands , were kept separate , so that a series of drawings of trypanosomes taken from any one part , from the first day of infection to the 56th day , could be compared .
By arranging these drawings on a wall the horizontal layers would represent the contents of , say , the fore-gut from one day onwards , while the vertical rows would represent the trypanosomes found in the whole length of a fly for one day .
More than six hundred drawings were made in this way , so that it seems impossible that any important form can have been left out .
General Considerations regarding the Development of the Trypanosomes in the Fly .
Let us now take a general view of the types of trypanosomes found in the various parts .
It is evident that very few of the six hundred drawings can be reproduced ; a few types , taken here and there , must suffice .
For the first three or four days trypanosomes are found in all the flies , hut at the end of six or seven the trypanosomes have disappeared out of many of them .
That is to say , it is only in a certain percentage that further development takes place .
In one series this was 8 per cent. In 92 per cent. , then , of flies which imbibe infected blood , the trypanosomes simply degenerate and die out within the first few days .
In 8 per cent. , on the other hand , the trypanosomes find conditions more favourable for development , and increase to a marvellous extent , filling the whole of the fore-gut , mid-gut , and hind-gut with countless swarms of trypanosomes .
How long this development continues is unknown .
It is considered probable that it continues for the remainder of the fly 's life , and this has been proved by experiment up to 96 days .
What the conditions in the intestine of the fly are , which render this development possible , are also unknown .
It was thought that it might depend on the reaction of the intestinal fluids .
This is , however , found on examination to be faintly acid in all flies , whether development has taken place or not .
The presence of bacteria also seems to have no connection with the phenomenon .
Sex , moreover , has no influence ; development occurs in as many males as females .

TYpes of Trypanosoma gambiense found in the Alimentary Canal .
It would serve no good purpose to describe separately , day by day , the types found in the various parts of the alimentary canal , as they run into each other in such a way that any classification of them seems impossible .
The following table represents , approximately , the numbers found in the different parts of the alimentary canal at various times after infection .
The \#151 ; sign means that an examination was made and nothing found .
+ means few .
+ , many .
+ + , very many .
+ -f + , swarming .
If no sign , then no examination has been made .
( See p. 516 .
) The Proboscis.\#151 ; In our experience Trypanosoma gambiense is never found in the proboscis of Glossina palpalis , except immediately after an infected feed , when for a short time blood containing trypanosomes may be seen in the lumen of the proboscis .
This is very different from what obtains in an infection by Trypanosoma vivax , in which case the proboscis is alone infected .
Proventriculus.\#151 ; As seen from the above table , this part of the alimentary .canal is sometimes found empty when the remainder of the gut is swarming .
Fore- , Mid.- , and Hind-gut.\#151 ; It is here that the greatest development of the trypanosomes is found .
Among the extraordinary numbers and diversity of type it is difficult or impossible to find one 's way .
Generally speaking , the trypanosomes found during the first few days are merely degenerating blood forms .
After this there appears a type of trypanosome which remains .dominant throughout the whole developmental period .
This is a long , moderately broad form , the protoplasm staining well , without granules or vacuoles , having an oval compact nucleus situated in the centre of the body , a small round micronucleus lying at some distance from the elongated snoutlike posterior extremity , the undulating membrane narrow and simple , and the flagellum proceeding little , if anything , beyond the protoplasm of the .cell .
The flagellum also appears very frequently to arise from a pink-.coloured body situated near the micronucleus , an appearance never seen in the normal blood trypanosomes .
This seems to be the healthy normal developing type in the intestine of the fly .
It is seen in all parts of the intestine and at all times .
It forms masses of innumerable individuals alike in size and shape .
When a fresh supply of blood is taken in by the fly this type can be imagined to multiply with extraordinary rapidity .
When the blood supply runs low then this type can also be imagined as degenerating and disappearing just as rapidly .
The host of diverse forms which thus arises beggars description .
Some are round or oval in shape , 3 or 4 microns in diameter , with or without a flagellum .
From this simple form all shapes and sizes can be seen up to the huge shapeless mass of protoplasm , multi-nucleated and multi-flagellated .

] Trypanosoma gambiense Glossina palpalis .
517 In our experience , the long narrow forms , described by some observers as " male " forms , are exceedingly rare , and it seems impossible to ascribe to to them any very important role in the process of development .
Crithidia-like forms are also exceedingly rare\#151 ; that is , forms with the micronucleus close to or anterior to the nucleus .
Types of Trypanosoma gambiense found in the Salivary On referring to lable I it will be seen that trypanosomes did not appear in these glands until the twenty-fifth day , but that after this time they were usually present .
In our opinion , this invasion of the salivary glands is of the greatest importance in the history of the development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis .
Here it may be parenthetically remarked that , because one kind of development takes place with one species of trypanosome and one species of tsetse fly , it by no means follows that the same thing will occur either with another species of trypanosome or another species of fly .
Each combination must be worked out separately and nothing left to analogy .
Trypanosoma vivax and Glossina palpalis afford a striking example of this .
In the development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis one circumstance , which we think of prime importance , emerges , and that is , that in the salivary glands , and here alone , the trypanosomes are found to revert to the normal blood-type .
It must not be imagined , however , that the salivary glands show no other forms but this blood-type .
On the contrary , there are many other forms seen ; but here only are found trypanosomes apparently identical with the short and stumpy forms found in the blood .
What causes or leads up to this reversion to the blood-type in the salivary glands is quite unknown , but , as will be seen later , the Glossina palpalis does not become infective by biting until this invasion of the salivary glands takes place .
How the trypanosomes find their way into the salivary glands is also quite unknown .
It seems highly improbable that they pass from the alimentary canal by way of the salivary duct , and as they are never found in the body-cavity , it is also difficult to see how they can make their way directly from the intestine to the abdominal portion of the salivary glands .

Figs. 8\#151 ; 13 represent what we consider to be the normal reproductive or developing type found throughout the intestine during the whole period of development .
It is to be noted that this form is longer and broader than the normal broad form ; the protoplasm is clear , and stains readily and evenly , and this cell looks normal .
The nucleus i , s compact and situated nearer the posterior extremity than the anterior .
The micronucleus is small and round , lying at some distance from the elongated posterior -extremity .
Many dividing forms of this type can be seen .
In our opinion , this is the 'Common multiplying form , and from it arises an infinite variety of degenerating forms .

Fig. 14.\#151 ; Part of a mass of Trypanosoma gambiense from the mid-gut .
This figure is given in order to try to convey some idea of the enormous proliferation of trypanosomes which takes place in the intestine of Glossina palpalis .
Throughout the whole length of the alimentary canal , from the proventriculus to the proctodieum , this condition is frequently seen , and in the living condition presents an extraordinary spectacle .
Looked at through the wall of the intestine the matted masses are seen in active movement , swaying about and wriggling in every direction .
They do not appear to be attached to the wall of the intestine , but move about freely , and when the intestinal wall is burst pour out in countless numbers .
The trypanosomes evidently belong to the type figured in the preceding sketch , called the normal reproductive type .

Figs. 25\#151 ; 38 represent round and irregularly-shaped forms of the parasite , taken from the eighth to the forty-sixth day of development .
It is impossible to say what is exactly the origin of these forms\#151 ; whether by the segmentation of large masses , or simply by the division and subdivision of irregular forms .
Some of the examples figured are evidently dividing , as they show several nuclei and flagella .
Whether the round aflagellar forms correspond to the so-called " latent " forms of various writers it is impossible to say .
Those possessing flagella were active during life .
In our opinion , they may be looked upon as part of the degenerative processes which are constantly taking place in the intestine of the fly .

How they reach these glands is up to the present unknown .

When alluding , generally , in a previous part of this paper to the types of Trypanosoma gambiense found in the salivary glands , it was said that in the salivary glands , and here alone , the trypanosomes are found to revert to the normal type found in the blood .
Figs. 73\#151 ; 80 illustrate this reversion .
By comparing them with figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 , which represent normal blood trypanosomes , it will be seen that they are very similar to the short and stumpy form found in the blood .
No such forms have ever been seen in any other part of the fly , and we would suggest that the occurrence of these forms in the salivary glands , coinciding as it does with the renewed infectivity of the fly , is more than mere coincidence .
Infectivity of Trypanosoma gambiense after its Development in Glossina palpalis , as shown by the Bites of the Flies giving RISE TO THE DISEASE IN HEALTHY ANIMALS .
As has been shown in a previous paper , * the fly ceases to he infective by biting within a short time of its infective feed .
From this time on for some 28 days the fly remains non-infective .
Table II ( p. 526 ) illustrates this .
From that Table it will be seen that in this series of experiments the flies first became infective 28 days after the infective feed , and that after this time the flies are usually found to be capable of giving rise to the disease by their bites .
It was stated above that the most important discovery made in this research is the connection between the invasion of the salivary glands and the infectivity of the fly .
That this appears to be so is shown in Table III .

This may have been due to an accident , such as this particular fly not biting the monkey , or the invasion of the salivary glands only taking place after the fly had bitten , or to the fact that the blood-type of trypanosome was not present .
With this exception all the other experiments , 12 in number , confirm the hypothesis that the fly does not become infective until the salivary glands are invaded .
Another point which comes out with striking clearness is , that in all the salivary glands from flies which gave a positive result , trypanosomes similar to the short and stumpy blood-type were invariably present .
It is to be hoped that before long the result of this work will be confirmed , and so added to , that the whole story of the development of the trypanosomes within the fly , and their passage into the salivary glands , will be unfolded .
Conclusions .
1 .
In the course of the development of Trypanosoma gambiense in Glossina palpalis the proboscis does not become involved , as in the case of some other species .
2 .
A few days after an infective feed the trypanosomes disappear out of the great majority of the flies , but in a small percentage this initial disappearance is followed by a renewed development .
3 .
After a very short time the flies which have fed on an infected animal become incapable of conveying the infection by their bites , and this non-infectivity lasts for some 28 days , when a renewed or late infectivity takes place .
4 .
A fly in which this renewed or late infectivity occurs can remain infective for at least 96 days .
5 .
An invasion of the salivary glands occurs at the same time as this renewal of infectivity , and without this invasion of the salivary glands there \#166 ; can be no infectivity .
6 .
The type of trypanosome found in the salivary glands when the fly becomes infective is similar to the short stumpy form found in vertebrate blood , and it is believed that this reversion to the blood-type is a sine qud non in the infective process .
