By JOHN FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL , Esq. F. R. S. and JAMES SOUTH , Esq. F. R. S. Read January 15 , 1824 .
HE frequent and exact determination of the apparent distances and positions of such double stars , as are sufficiently close to be easily measured with micrometers and high magnifying powers , was suggested by Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL , more than forty years ago , as an enquiry likely to lead to interesting results , and which has , in fact , in his hands , led to the creation of a new department of physical astronomy , and to the discovery of a class of phenomenon in the sidereal heavens referable to the agency of attractive forces , and analogous to those produced by gravity within the limits of our own system .
The immediate object with which the enquiry was commenced , the determination of the existence and amount of annual parallax , was soon lost sight of in the more extensive views of the construction of the universe which unfolded themselves as it advanced , and has not since been resumed ; though , from the extreme precision of which it will appear in the course of this paper such measurements are susceptible , owing to the refinements of modern instrumentmaking ( a precision not to be looked for in any other class of celestial observations ) and the progress we may yet hope for from farther improvements in this respect , there is every reason to suppose it still the most eligible mode of setting at rest that great question , and to believe that no distant period must put us in possession of something decisive from this quarter , as to the existence or non-existence of an appreciable amount of that element .
Meanwhile unexpected phenomenon have been witnessed .
The existence of binary systems , in which two stars perform to each other the offices of sun and planet , has been distinctly proved , and the periods of rotation of more than one such pair ascertained with something approaching to exactness .
The immersions and emersions of stars behind each other have been noted , and real motions among them detected , rapid enough to become sensible and measureable in very short intervals of time .
The results of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL'S observations from 1779 to 1784 , were published in two Catalogues in the Philosophical Transactions for 1782 and 1785 , and consist of descriptions and measures of 702 double and triple stars .
The labour of re-examination was undertaken and executed by him in i8oi , 2 , 3 and 4 , after a lapse of twenty years ; and the changes observed or suspected in them were recorded in two other papers , published in the volumes for 1802 and 1804 .
It was to be naturally expected that , owing to the imperfection of the micrometers with which many of the earlier measures , especially those of 1779 and 1780 , were performed , and the novelty of the subject , many errors would have crept in ; and that a verification of the facts , by farther observation , would at all events be highly desirable .
Accordingly , in the 8 year i816 , a second re-examination of the measures was entered on by his Son ( one of the authors of this paper ) , and some progress made in it ; several of the results of which will be found attached to the measures in the following pages .
The instruments in Mr. SOUTH'S possession being peculiarly adapted to the purpose , a similar idea had also occurred to him ; and , at his suggestion , it was determined to undertake the work of re-examination in concert , which was accordingly commenced in March , 1821 , and continued , whenever weather and circumstances would permit , till the present time .
Meanwhile ( though at that time unknown to us ) , a similar undertaking had been commenced and carried to a considerable extent by a very exact and assiduous continental astronomer , Mr. STRUVE , Director of the Imperial Observatory of Dorpat .
The comparison of his observations of such of our stars as have been measured by him with our own , will not be found the least interesting part of the present paper .
So far as it goes , the coincidences of our results , with very few exceptions , are striking ; and afford the most satisfactory ground for reliance on the methods employed by both .
Professor AMICI , of Modena , has also of late occupied himself in the pursuit of the same object , with instruments said to be of extraordinary power .
Very few , however , of his results have come to our knowledge , and those imperfectly stated ; hence it may fairly be presumed that the differences existing between them and our own , will be found to admit of easy explanation .
The instruments employed in our combined observations , are two capital achromatic telescopes mounted equatorially , of the respective focal lengths of five and seven feet .
These are cited in the following pages by the names of the five-feet and the seven-feet equatorials ; and a brief account of them , especially of the former , will neither be uninteresting to the practical astronomer , nor irrelevant to the objects of this communication .
Five-feet Equatorial .
The greatest part of this instrument , with regard to bulk , is constructed of tinned iron plate .
Its characteristic qualities are great lightness , extreme steadiness , promptness in answering to its adjustments , and capability of retaining them .
The instrument , as represented in fig. i , Plate I , is drawn on a scale of one-twelfth of the real dimensions .
The view is taken at right angles to the plane of the declination circle .
The polar axis is about ten feet and a half long .
The lower end is a pivot attached to a cone , which , reckoning upwards , is about one-fourth of the whole length , the sides of this cone making with each other an angle of about fifty degrees .
The higher side of the cone , for about a foot of its length , is cut in a sloping direction , as seen in the figure , for the purpose of more conveniently observing in the vicinity of the pole .
From the upper end of the cone , the polar axis branches into two parts , between which is room for the declination circle and the head of the observer : these two branches are again united at the top by an open frame of bell-metal , represented in fig. 2 , to which the upper pivot is attached ; which frame , as well as the iron work which supports it , is so contrived , as to present the least possible surface to obstruct the telescope .
For the same reason , the pivot at the top of the axis is made as small as possible , while that at the lower end is considerably larger .
Both ends of 4 the axis are supported on stones ; the northern one rising within about four inches of the level of the axis of the declination circle ; the rest of the support being of wrought iron .
At the southern end the stone rises very little above the floor , but a cast iron frame supports the pivot at the height of about two feet The Y , or angle which receives the lower pivot , is placed upon the frame , and provided with two screw adjustments , one for giving the axis its due elevation , and the other for bringing the instrument to the meridian .
The form of the iron-work above-mentioned will be sufficiently comprehended on consulting the different figures of the Plates .
The two branches of the polar axis , on their upper sides , are formed of broad planes , both making one continued plane .
On these surfaces the axis and reading microscopes of the declination circle are fixed .
The plane is as much above the line of centre as was judged would render the instrument self-balanced ; but the declination circle , &amp;c. having proved somewhat lighter than was expected , an equilibrium is effected by a weight fixed to the conical part of the polar axis .
The diameter of the declination circle is four feet , the length of the telescope five feet , and the axis about thirty-two inches long .
In Plate I , fig. 1 , the declination circle appears quite plane , exhibiting the form of a drum-head , with the telescope looking towards the equator , and projecting at each end a little beyond the circle .
In Plate II , the draughtsman stood close to the south pole of the instrument , on account of which , and its elevation , the polar axis is considerably foreshortened .
In this figure the edge of the declination circle is shown as a short cylinder , the object-end of the telescope protruding beyond it .
In this figure is also seen the shape of the declination axis , and the two principal reading microscopes , viz , those which give declinations .
There is a third microscope , which indicates zenith distances .
This is seen in Plate I. fig. i , between the eye end of the telescope and the instrument 's elevated pole .
In the latter figure is shown , on the extreme border of the drum , a narrow brass ring , whereon the graduation is made .
This ring is not only narrow , butas thin as was judged consistent with sound workmanship ; this slightness is necessary , because iron plate and brass expand very differently , but the former being much stronger , the latter must obey it : the brass is soldered to the iron , and also pinned to it at short intervals .
The hour circle , two feet in diameter , is fastened to the lower end of the polar axis , the edge of which is seen in Plate I. fig. i , its under side in Plate II .
, and its face in Plate III .
fig. 5 .
One of the reading microscopes is well seen in Plate I. fig. l , and both of them , less perfectly in the other two figures .
The whole of this circle was of brass , and the divisions were at first made upon that metal ; but twenty-two years exposure to the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of London had obliterated the graduation .
This has been restored by Mr. TROUGHTON , upon an inlaid ring of platina , the divisions ( fine lines ) corresponding to twenty seconds each , which are subdivided by the microscopes to tenths of seconds .
The declination circle is divided to five minutes , which are subdivided by the micrometer screw of the microscopes to single seconds , with a capability of estimating further subdivisions .
The instrument is furnished with two good ground levels , neither of which are seen in any of the figures .
The divided side of the declination circle has been called a drum ; but the reverse is articulated ; showing how the conical parts of the axis and telescope are united , as well as the radial bars which proceed from the axis and telescope almost to the border of the circle , and how these bars , thin as the tinned plate is , are rendered firm and inflexible .
It is on this side that the levels would be seen ; one of them is parallel to the telescope , the other to the declination axis .
In fig. i , is seen the support of one end of the latter , above the polar axis , and nearly half way between the centre of the circle and its limb ; here a circular aperture in the drum is represented as being quadrisected by a cross .
This has , inserted in its centre , a small pivot or cylinder pointed inwards , upon which one end of the level is supported , while , on the articulated side , a cross and similar pivot support the opposite end .
Both of the pivots are adjustable by screws , and the adjustment being duly performed by them , the horizontality of the axis is ascertained in every position of the telescope , when directed to the meridian .
The other level , which is the larger , hangs upon similar adjustable pivots , which adjustment being performed , places the level parallel to the line of collimation of the telescope , serving at all times to ascertain the due elevation of the polar axis , as well as to answer many other useful purposes .
The clamps and screws for slow motion deserve notice ; the former from being unusual , and both from being good .
Instead of the common mode of clamping upon the circle , in this instrument the clamp is made to grasp the axis .
There is soldered on each axis a ring of brass , the outer edge of which is broad and cylindrical .
On this fixed ring a movable one is well fitted , and afterwards cut into three equal parts .
These are again united at two places by joints , like 7 those which bind the different parts of a watch-chain together .
At the third juncture the clamping takes place ; a projecting part of the ring having been left where the third section is made , and a strong screw at right angles to this section , which is made to gape , brings the parts towards each other , and effects a firm embrace .
The clamping apparatus , so far described , was avowedly borrowed from the means used for fixing the shaft of an ordinary wind-mill .
To the middle of each of the trisected rings are fastened long arms of tinned iron plate , at the extremities of which the slow moving screws have their places .
The fixed stud is in the lower screw planted in the iron support ; that of the upper one in the polar axis ; the moveable studs are of course connected with the levers .
The long screw for slow motion in right ascension is acted on by a contrate wheel and a pinion at right angles to the plane of the circle ; a long handle attached to it is shown in Plate I , fig. i , leaning against the northern pier .
A similar screw for declination , but without the contrate part , is seen in Plate II , fig. 3 .
All the apparatus for clamping and slow motion is seen in Plates I , II , and III , figures 1 , 3 , and 5 .
It may be remarked , that in the apparatus described , the right-ascension motion does not at all disturb that in declination ; nor does that of declination affect the other : properties most essential to facilitate and render accurate , micrometrical observations ; properties not to be expected , with the same precision , from those contrivances to which micrometers are usually attached , known by the name of equatorial stands .
The illumination of the wires of the telescope is produced by a small lantern , which has its place at one end of the 8 declination axis .
There is a neat contrivance placed between the nosel of the lantern and end of the axis , by which the quantity of light is regulated , so as to suit the nature of any observation that may be made ; and such is the amplitude of this illumination , that , on one hand , the brightness of broad day is produced , and on the other , total darkness .
In any position of the telescope , and while the object is viewed , the adjustment of light can be conveniently effected , by means of a long handle shown in Plate I. fig. i , hanging down on the hither side of the polar axis .
In Plate III .
fig. 4 , the eye-piece of the telescope is represented , in which there is seen the edge of a graduated circle , the front of a quadrant , and two small spirit levels .
This apparatus is particularly described by Sir G. SHUCKBURGH , in the Phil. Trans. 1793 ; by which , and by some small tables given in his paper on the Equatorial , the corrections due to refraction and parallax are neatly allowed for , in observations made at a distance from the meridian .
There is also seen in this figure , rather partially represented , a double parallel line micrometer ( sometimes called a repeating micrometer ) , which also measures angles of position .
Although this apparatus has had not a little to do with the observations recorded in this paper , it is forborne to give a detailed account of it : ist .
, because it would considerably lengthen this description , which , it is feared , many will think too long already ; sdly , because a great number of these micrometers are in the possession of practical astronomers , and of course their construction is tolerably well known ; and , lastly , because they have been described in our modern Encyclopaedias.* It is thought however , that the micrometer under consideration , .
was the first that had a position circle large enough to show distinctly minutes of a degree , by help of its verniers .
This equatorial was designed to suit its first situation , viz. on the top of a house , where , to the north , higher buildings prevented any distant objects from being seen , and to the south , a smoky town presented almost as great an obstruction .
The instrument being elevated 50 feet above solid ground , it became absolutely necessary that a permanent mark should from time to time be consulted .
This advantage only presented itself to the westward , where , at a proper distance , the ground was not much below the level of the instrument ; and to suit it to these circumstances , the declination axis was converted into a telescope .
The effect produced by this , is similar to that of the Y level of the civil engineers , but with this difference : it is here required that each end of the axis should alternately be presented to the object , and that in reversed positions the telescope should have equal power .
For these purposes , both ends have crossed wires , adjustable so as to be placed in the centres of their respective pivots .
Exterior to the wires are placed object glasses of equal focal lengths , and an eye-glass , removable from one end to the other , completes the apparatus .
The whole instrument having been adjusted astronomically , it was easy to build up a mark to the level of the axis , and also at right angles to the meridian , which afterwards became a substitute for a meridian mark , and also afforded an excellent mean for adjusting the reading microscopes of the hour circle .
The instrument bears no maker 's name .
The whole scheme of its fabric was cast by the late Captain HUDDART , many years a worthy Fellow of this Society .
All the tinned iron work was made , under the direction and inspection of the same able engineer .
Under the like superintendence also , was the brass work made , by J. and E. TROUGHTON ; who having furnished it with graduation , reading microscopes , levels , &amp;c. completed the instrument in 1797 .
The excellent object-glass for the telescope of 3inches aperture was made by the late P. and J. DOLLOND .
The power ordinarily employed is $33 ; besides which , powers of 68 , 16 , 240 , 303 , and 381 , were occasionally used , being double eyepieces ; and in some few cases a single lens with a power of 578 was employed for the purpose of minute scrutiny .
The extent of the field with these powers ( in their order beginning with the lowest , 68 ) was respectively 34 ' , 31 ' , 20 ' , 19 ' , 13 ' , l ' , and ... .
To preserve the tinned iron plate from oxidation , it has been well covered with white paint , and afterwards varnished ; thus it has not only a neat appearance , but can be cleaned at any time , without difficulty .
The present situation of this instrument , in the immediate vicinity of one of the great thoroughfares of this immense metropolis , required the adoption of particular precautions against tremors .
The northern pier is therefore sunk seven feet into the earth , where it is bedded on a Yorkshire flag four feet square , and two feet in thickness , into which the pier is firmly tenoned and fastened by stone wedges .
From this flag rises a mass of brickwork to the level of the surface , surrounding the pier , and united with PARKER'S cement , having the area of its horizontal section equal to that of the 11 flag .
The weight of this effectually secures the stability of the foundation stone .
The southern pier likewise consists of a large stone , two feet in thickness , resting on a bed of brickwork , carried downwards ten feet below the surface .
So effectual are these precautions , that stars pass with perfect regularity along the whole extent of the declination wire , while the heaviest waggons are traversing the street within forty feet of the instrument , which , in one instance , has kept its adjustments , and been actually employed as a transit for six weeks , without sensible alteration .
Indeed , whilst in Captain HUDDART'S possession , it was almost exclusively used as a meridian instrument .
The object glass of the seven feet equatorial is the work of Mr. TULLEY , and may perhaps be regarded at present as the chef d'oeuvre of that eminent artist .
It is five inches in clear aperture , and in distinctness under high magnifying powers* is probably excelled by no refractor existing .
Proof of this will be found in the separation and measurement of the most minute double stars , such as or and q Coronas Borealis , in its sharp definition of the double ring of Saturn , and various other of the most delicate celestial objects .
It is mounted on a polar axis of brass , furnished with declination and hour circles of the same metal , the work of the late Mr. SssoN ; being , in fact , those of the old equatorial sector of the Royal Observatory , committed to our care for this purpose by the Council of the Royal Society ( to whom our thanks are therefore due ) and of which a more particular deUnder favourable circumstances , with a power of 600 , the discs of the two stars of n Corona and of o Corona ; of 5 Bootis and of C Orionis , are shown perfectly round , and as sharply defined as possible .
scription , accompanied with a plate , will be found in page 141 of VINCE 's Practical Astronomy .
The axis is supported by strong piles of wood sunk deep into the earth ; and though not quite exempt from tremors , is sufficiently so for the performance ( with due care ) of the most accurate and delicate measurements .
The telescope is furnished with a micrometer , the work of TROUGHTON , similar in all respects to that of the five feet just described , with the exception of a peculiar apparatus carrying an additional moveable cross wire , for a purpose not connected with the present paper .
The ordinary observing power employed with this telescope was 179 , but occasionally a lower power of 105 , and a higher one of 273 , were also used .
The illumination of the field is effected by a lamp attached to the tube , and ( as in the five feet ) , may be increased or diminished to any extent .
The values of the parts of the scale of each micrometer were determined by separating the wires a certain known number of revolutions and parts , and having placed them in the direction of the meridian , measuring repeatedly the time occupied by the passage of an equatorial star , or other of known declination , from wire to wire .
By this method , one part of the scale of the five-feet micrometer was ascertained to represent o".31582 , and of the seven feet , o".24o44 .
The equality of the threads of the screw was proved by the same value resulting , whatever opening of the wires was employed ; and the parallelism* of them in either micrometer was perfect .
The position of the declination wire , when set to zero , was frequently examined by running a star from one end to the other , backwards and forwards , by the right ascension motion of the instrument ; but being once well adjusted , was found liable to no change , except in one instance , when the micrometer had received a blow , the defect produced by which was immediately discovered and rectified .
Respecting the precautions used in observing , a few words will suffice .
In measuring distances , the stars were bisected by both wires , and kept on them by means of the long handle of the slow R. A. motion , held in the left hand , and gently turned between the finger and thumb , the right being at liberty to manage the micrometer .
This , though rather difficult at first , becomes easy by a little practice , and even in unfavourable positions , the effect of the earth 's diurnal motion may be almost exactly neutralised with a little management .
The measures of distance are therefore all central , a circumstance the more necessary to be noticed , by reason of the greater size of the spurious discs of stars in refracting , than in reflecting telescopes .
In taking angles of position , these spurious discs are often extremely troublesome , as their inequality renders it very difficult ( especially in close stars ) , to judge of the position of the line joining their centres .
In such cases a green , or even a slightly smoked glass , was sometimes used in viewing bright stars , or advantage taken of the favourable intervention of a thin cloud , which reduces them to mere points , or even of broad daylight , to obliterate their rings and scattered light , &amp;c. Such cases are noticed when they occur , but it may not be amiss to mention , that the angle of position of a pair of very close stars , or very unequal ones , at a moderate distance , ( such as e Bootis , , Orionis , &amp;c. ) , can never be obtained with any degree of certainty by a single measure , especially when the two stars , as in the above instances , differ greatly in colour .
The requisite degree of illumination is a matter of great consequence , and differs in almost each particular star .
In relation to this , a singular phxnomenon deserves mention .
Many very minute stars bear , without extinction , strong degrees of illumination , and are even seen the better for it , while others , apparently brighter , have been found unable to bear even the slightest extraneous light .
This may probably be owing to an excess of blue light in the star , forming a contrast with the ruddy tint of the lamp illumination : at least , the most remarkable instances* of the phenomenon in question are , those in which the small star is decidedly of a blue colour .
A rather singular method of obtaining a view , and even a rough measure of the angles of stars of the last degree of faintness , has often been resorted to , viz. to direct the eye to another part of the field .
In this way , a faint star in the neighbourhood of a large one , will often become very conspicuous , so as to bear a certain illumination , which will yet totally disappear , as if suddenly blotted out , when the eye is turned full upon it , and so on , appearing and disappearing * Scorpii is much improved by illumination .

alternately , as often as we please .
The small companion of 93 ( h ) Ursoe Majoris , is a remarkable instance , and others will be found in the note.* The lateral portions of the retina , less fatigued by strong lights , and less exhausted by perpetual attention , are probably more sensible to faint impressions than the central ones , which may serve to account for this phenomenon .
The measures were , for the most part , taken by both observers in each other 's presence , the one acting as assistant , and writing down what the other announced .
Frequently , however , this disposition , dictated by convenience , was changed , and the observations made by one were read off , as well as written down , by the other , and the results not communicated till the measures were finished .
This mode of checking each other 's measures , the severest which can well be resorted to when two persons observe together , was however only adopted , when , from a discrepancy in the first measures , some suspicion of a bias in the eye , or judgment of one or other , arose , in cases of peculiar interest , or in the earlier part of the work , before practice had confirmed our confidence .
When the two instruments were used at once however , which during the last year 's observations was almost perpetually the case , the observers were necessarily separated from each other , and their results only communicated on the following morning , at the time of taking and applying the index errors .
In a very few instances , the assistance of a third person has been called in , to give a turn to our opinion in a doubtful case .
Mr. RICHARDSON , of the Royal Observatory , has generally * ?
Persei ; 7 Tauri ; 43 Persei ; been the person selected for this purpose , as possessing the necessary qualifications of an eye practised* in observations with this particular instrument , a correct hand , and unbiased impartiality .
A few measures by Mr. TROUGHTOIN will also be found on similar occasions .
Of the general disposition of the following paper , it will now be necessary to give some account .
The stars observed by us , are arranged in order of right ascension , and such names , synonyms , and references are attached , as will serve to identify them in the writings of other astronomers .
The catalogues of Mr. SOUTH and Mr. STRUVE , e have been extremely useful to us ; the latter being much more extensive than the former , the number of each star , in the order in which it stands in that work , is annexed : the synonyms therein given are also generally adopted , with such additions and corrections as seemed necessary .
Our observations will be found to include many stars given by Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL , in his catalogue of 145 new double stars , printed in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society , Vol. 1 .
These are cited by their numbers ( for instance , 41 of the 145 .
) Some few discovered by ourselves , are either mentioned as new , or may be known by the absence of any other reference .
The right ascensions and declinations are generally those of STRUVE .
When de .
termined by ourselves , they may be regarded as true to the nearest minute in declination ( unless for southern stars , where the neglect of refraction will entail a larger error ) , and to a few seconds in R. A. The identification of the stars being our only* object , greater accuracy was not attempted , than would suffice for setting the instrument directly upon them .
Next follow our observations as written down at the time , or at least as allowed to stand , at the moment of terminating the measure .
It would have been easy indeed , by giving only the mean results of whole sets of measures , to have produced an appearance of very exact coincidences ; but this has not been so much our object , as to show , by an actual exposd of the whole work , what degree of confidence is due to our results , and what extent of deviation from mean quantities , other observers , who may enter upon the same enquiry with similar instruments , may fairly expect to meet with .
In this respect , very few liberties have been taken .
To have rendered this paper as complete as possible , it was Mr. SOUTH 's intention to have accompanied it with the observed places of each principal star , brought up to a particular epoch , and some progress towards effecting it was actually made so far back as February , 182 : but , although the transits of fifty stars , over all the wires of his instrument , were occasionally observed by him in one night , the scheme was found to interfere so much with the primary object , that it was deemed advisable to relinquish it .
Should , however , their places remain undetermined , possessing , as he does , the instrumental means of ascertaining them , / with the greatest accuracy , his original design , ( if health allow ) , will probably be not abandoned .
Still , it must be remembered , that , two or three hundred double stars yet remain unmeasured ; this done , the period must be distant , ere a private individual can , with his own eyes , ( be his industry great as it may ) , furnish standard observations , both in Right Ascension and Declination , of seven hundred stars , many of which are only visible in the illuminated fields of our large meridian instruments , under circumstances which , in this country , are of very rare occurrence .
When indeed a measure ( on looking down the list , without reference to the observations of former nights ) was found to differ considerably from the rest , the micrometer was usually set to the suspicious reading off , and the measure re-examined by both observers .
If declared erroneous ( and the contrary would occasionally happen ) , it was corrected by him whose measure it originally was , and the result set down in the place of that rejected .
In general , the degree of discordance in the measures of any particular star , may be taken as a pretty fair criterion of the difficulty which attended the observation .
The instrument with which each set of measures was taken , is mentioned .
In the north preceding and south following quadrants , the micrometers show angles of position complementary to the true ones .
These are , however , ( except in one or two instances ) set down as read off , and the mean afterwards subtracted from 90 ? .
In the measures of distance , the index error is applied to the mean of the micrometer parts in each set , and the result reduced into seconds is stated .
The index error was at first only taken at pretty considerable intervals ; but , being soon found liable to a trifling change , it was afterwards regularly taken on the morning after each night 's observation , or at least as soon as circumstances would permit .
The zeros applied are means of at least five , but frequently of ten separate determinations .
In order to make this paper more complete , and to save trouble to those who may wish to consult our measures , or prosecute farther this interesting department of astronomy , we have presented at the end of our observations of each star , 1st , the mean result of our own measures , reduced to a mean epoch , in computing which , each single measure ( unless the contrary is expressly mentioned ) is supposed to have the same weight : and , 2dly , a brief statement of all the results obtained by other observers , as far as they are known to us , arranged in the order of their dates , for the sake of comparison with our own , so as to give , as it were , a history of all that is known on the subject .
Among them , a multitude of hitherto unpublished observations of Sir W. HERSCHEL are inserted from his Journals and Registers ; many lacunae in the history of particular stars filled up , and the chain of observation continued unbroken up to the present time .
One or two points here require notice .
ist .
The dates of his observations will generally be found to differ from those attached to the description of the stars in his Catalogues .
The reason is , that the dates here given are those of the observations , as they occur in the Journals , or their mean , if more than one , while the dates in the Catalogues are those when the stars were first discovered to be double .
2dly , Both the angles and distances will also be frequently at variance with those printed in Sir WILLIAM'S Catalogues .
This must be explained more at large .
Unless a mean result is expressly mentioned , the 'angles and distances in his Catalogues are invariably the results of single measures .
However numerous the measures taken , one has been selected as the best , and all the rest rejected .
So great a degree of confidence in single measures , however , is hardly borne out by our experience ; and the results we have inserted from the Journals and Registers , are therefore the means of all that could be found , such only being rejected as offer something obviously objectionable .
We have only to cast our eyes at the obsersl vations of Rigel , to see how widely they differ from each other , and yet how exactly their mean agrees with that of our own , to be satisfied that , in so doing , not only no improper liberty is taken , but much valuable labour rescued from oblivion , which would otherwise have been lost to science .
In numerous instances , too , whole series of observations have been found , and their mean results inserted .
These are generally noted by the letters MSS .
annexed .
Finally , such remarks are subjoined as comparisons of modern with ancient measures of the same star suggest .
In numerous instances they confirm the changes previously surmised to have taken place by Sir W. HERSCHEL , in his papers of 1803 and 1804 .
In a few they afford no such satisfactory confirmation .
In more than one instance , they furnish important verifications of the proper motions assigned to particular stars by MASKELYNE , PIAZZI , and others ; while in some , on the other hand , the degree of permanence in the relative situations of the large and small stars is hardly less remarkable .
After the main body of observations , we have added a list of a few stars less perfectly measured , or of which , from their uncommon difficulty , the observations are too precarious to be received as satisfactory .
The only reason for inserting them is , that should there ever hereafter arise a question respecting them , any measures made with some care and with good instruments are better than none at all , and may become useful , though confessedly imperfect data .
This reason is strengthened by the probability that their difficulty , and the little apparent interest they offer , will cause them to be disthe following statement of the measures taken at different periods .

The position of 1814 cannot be relied on , being deduced only from two estimations of the ratio of the differences of right ascensions and of declinations to the distance , which differ in their results as much as 8 ? .

The slow decrease in the angle of position is here sufficiently evident , though too small to place any confidence in , were it not for the progressive steps by which the intermediate observations show it to have taken place .
The rate of decrease , calculating on all the observations according to the formula ( 1 ) is no more than o ?
.I17 per annum , in the direction np sf , or retrograde .
Supposing it to revolve uniformly in a circle , its period would at this rate be 3077 years .
The distance , in 1783 , was 1diameter of the large star .
M. STRUVE , in 1819 , made it 5".77 , with which ours coincides , almost to minute precision .
The distance , therefore , as well as the angle , seems to be subject to a slow variation , as a diameter and half between the discs , in equal stars of the 7th magnitude , can hardly exceed 4 " from centre to centre .

The angle therefore seems liable to no alteration , but the distance is increased if the measure of 1783 be correct ; but it is only the result of a single measure .
This star is remarkable for the great differences between the means of several independent sets of measures , while the star presents no peculiar difficulty .
One of the angles differs 30 23 ' from the mean of all ; and this may be considered the maximum error to which the measure of an angle can be considered liable , unless in peculiar cases .

}s The change of position in the interval between 1782 and S10o is therefore not verified , and has probably arisen from some error in the earlier observation .
The loss or disappearance of the third star , described as in a line with the other two , and 25 or e6 " distant , is therefore to be regretted , and is the more singular , as a MSS observation ( Journal .

The way in which the same mean results from series of observations so discordant , is an instance no less remarkable of the efficacy of multiplying even inaccurate observations , when made under such variety of time and circumstance as to avoid any possible bias .
The slight diminution ( o".65S ) in the distance may very possibly be owing to a real change .

g25 nf ( Catalogue of 1782 ) , which agrees perfectly with our measure ; but neither in that Catalogue , nor in the subsequent one of 1785 , is there any mention of the separation of the large star into two .
Yet , had it been then as distinctly separated as at present , it is not possible it could have been overlooked , when kept long enough in view to take an accurate measure , in the course of which the attention must have been closely directed to either star .
Still less could it have escaped notice in the reviews of the heavens , in the course of which it has often been examined with minute attention with reference to this very point , as the Journals written at the time testify .
On the 29th of September , 1782 , during one of the reviews on which the Catalogue of 1785 is founded , it was examined with the 7 feet reflector , power 460 , and is called " white , distinctly round , double , " the double referring obviously to the more distant star , and the " distinctly round " to the principal , or central one , according to usual custom .
A beautiful star of the first class could never have escaped registering by neglect , when the object was expressly to form a Catalogue of such stars , and we are therefore forced to conclude , that in 1782 , the small star was so closely covered by the large one , as not even to elongate its disc .
[ Herculis and a Cygni have afforded instances of sidereal occultations , in which one star has completely disappeared behind the other , and o Coronae appears to be on the point of perfornling the same singular evolution .
This is the first instance , however , of the reverse process , for the observation ' Orionis continued .
of M. FLAUGERGUES , on 'Ursae Majoris , ( mentioned under the head of that star ) , which would be a strong case in point , is proved to have been an illusion .
So remarkable a fact deserves every attention , and this star should be assiduously watched .

The measures of this star have furnished a curious instance of a constant difference between the observations of two observers ; the one always observing anglesabove the mean , the other below it ; and that not one night only , but after long intervals , without communication , &amp;c. Occasionally each observer read off the other 's measure , and each declared his eye offended by the situation of the micrometer wire as left by the other .
The differences being found irreconcilable , other practised observers were called in to decide the point , whose measures , as will be seen , had no such effect .
However the mean angle 65§ 57 ' here set down , being the result of 47 single measures , by four different observers , and on five nights , embracing an interval of two years , cannot well be erroneous to any extent .

Thie difference of size and closeness of these stars renders the measure of their position uncommonly difficult ; but as the angle here set down is a mean of 41 single measures , we cannot suppose it materially in error , especially as it is very nearly a mean between the results of the two best sets of observations-those of April , 182a , and April , 1823 , which , taken alone , would give 8§ 29 ' sf .

at some future period , may rely with confidence in any investigation relative to the orbit of this star .
A double star in which the two stars are nearly equal , connected undoubtedly in a binary system by their mutual gravitation , and revolving round their common center of gravity with a motion so rapid as to admit of being traced , and measuredfrom month to month , must be allowed to be a phbenomenon of no common interest , and deserving every attention , both from the practical and theoretical astronomer .
The rapid alteration of position in k Ursae Majoris , was first pointed out and established by unequivocal observations by Sir W. HERSCHEL , in his second " Account of the changes that have happened in the relative situations of double stars , " Phil. Trans. 1804 , already so often referred to .
The observations of M. STRUVE ( who has called the attention of astronomers to it in a pointed manner ) and our own , fully confirm it ; at the same time that they indicate a remarkable alteration in its velocity , which can only be accounted for by supposing the relative orbit to be one of great ellipticity .

In the next period , of 1.74 years , the angle described was s12.o3 , or 6 ?
.914 per annum ; while in the succeeding short period of 1.54 years , the motion amounted only to 6 ?
.84 or 4 ?
.44 .
per annum .
It is therefore at present rapidly decreasing , and the maximum annual motion must , at some period between x8o3 and 1820o , have greatly exceeded io ?
.499 , and perhaps may have amounted to 2o or 30 ? .
This consideration would lead us to place the perihelion of the orbit in the north-preceding quadrant , between the 3oth and Goth degree from the parallel , and to suppose its plane greatly inclined to the visual line , in a plane not far from that passing through the eye and the major axis of the orbit ; and this agrees well with the change of distance , which is certainly less at present than in 1782 , though the estimation by diameters is necessarily very uncertain .
In the present imperfect state of the data , it would be useless to enter into any minute investigations respecting the elements of the orbit ; but when twenty or thirty years observations shall have enabled us to trace precisely the variation of the angular motion up to the aphelion , and to ascertain , by direct observation , the periodic time and mean motion , the principles of physical astronomy may be applied , and the case is one particularly favourable to their application , so that we may hope one day to obtain a precise knowledge of all the most important points respecting this interesting system .
It is to be regretted that owing to an error in the place of this star in BODE 's Catalogue , it was not observed by us at an earlier date ; the comparison of our observations with those of M. STRUVE being very desirable , No. CXXIII .

This star appears to have undergone a very remarkable diminution of distance , and at the same time a material increase in the mean motion of its component stars one about the other .
The computed occultation of CASSINI in 17 o cannot have any dependence placed on it , as the lunar tables can hardly be supposed correct enougl to carry us back ioo years from the present time , with the precision necessary for so delicate an object , unless corrected for that express purpose by some observations made about the time ; and it may fairly be doubted whether the necessary degree of accuracy for such observations could then be attained .

Sir W. HERSCHEL saw it double on the gth April , 1774 , with a power of 211 , and has given its measures in his first Catalogue as follows : Position 560 46 ' sf ; Distance 14".50 , by two years observations , from 1779 to 1781 .
These measures coincide so closely with our own , that no suspicion can arise of any real considerable change in this star .
The following strange observation of M. FLAUGERGUES , recorded in the Connaissance des Temps , An. xi .
page 36o , is therefore the more surprising .
After recounting his habitual observations of it , as a trial of his telescopes , without ever noticing its being double , he goes on to say , " Le 4 Aoit , 1787 , a8 heurs du soir , regardant cette etoile avec un telescope de 15 pouces , je vis avec surprise qu'elle etait composee de deux etoiles , un grande et l'autre plus petite , distant entre else du diam6tre de la plus petite .
La ligne passant par ces deux 6toiles etait dirigee a-peu-pres verse s du Bouvier .
" " Depuis cette 6poque j'ai observe souvent ces deux etoiles , et j'ai reconnu que la distance entre else augmentait continuellement .
Ce progres est actuellement bien sensible et il ya au moins quinze secondes de distance entre else , c'est a-dire trois ou quatre fois plus que lorsque je fis cette observation .
La petite etoile qui est la plus au sud a de plus beaucoup augment de grandeur et d'eclat .
" We should not have noticed this observation , which can only be regarded as an instance of the effect of familiarity , in our judgment of an object 's appearance , were it not that , by a singular coincidence , the earlier observations of Sir W. H. on this very star had suggested to him a similar idea of a rapidly increasing distance .

HERSCHEL'S Catalogue for 1785 , 54 Hydra , which BODE has altered in his Catalogue to 73 Hydrae , or 30 Turdi Solitarii On referring to the copy of FLAMSTEED'S Atlas , used by him in his Observations , Reviews , &amp;c. ( in which the numbers are affixed to the stars in MS .

between the greatest and least among the single measures amounting to the enormous quantity of 16 ?
io ' , and even among the mean results of whole sets of observations extending to to or l ?
i. The closeness , and great difference of size and colour of the two stars , will partly account for this ; but if we compare our measures of this with those of Rigel , in which the difference of size is much more considerable , and where the two stars are also very close ( the distance being within 9 " ) we shall find reason to believe that some other cause than mere imperfection of vision , bias of eye , or error in judgment , must have operated .
There can be no doubt but that , had the micrometer been purposely deranged 16 ?
after any measure with which the observer had been tolerably satisfied , he could not possibly have avoided noticing the change on reviewing his measure .
The remark annexed to the observations of April 9 , with the five-feet instrument , shows that a much less change proved intolerably offensive to the eye .
Refraction , acting differently on two stars close together , and differing so decidedly in colour as these do , might be expected to produce great alterations in their relative apparent situations , but unluckily this will not account for the particular changes observed .
The point requires farther investigation .
Meanwhile , the mean angle above given being concluded from 62 single measures , is probably near the truth .

Letter to Baron de ZAOH , Corr. Ast viii .
p. 2I6 .
If we lay down the distances and angles here given on a scale ( with the exception of M. AMICI)S , which is evidently much too small ; indeed all his measures hitherto published , appear to err more or less on that side ) , the apparent relative orbit of the small star ss 's " , will be found not to deviate much from a strait line , the slight degree of concavity towards the large one observable in it ( See fig. i , Plate IV .
) being not to be depended on , on account of the uncertainty of the estimation on which the distance of 6 " depends .
Moreover the motion in it will be found to be not far remote from uniformity .
The position ss ' and s ' s " being in the ratio of 18 to 24 , and the times in that of 18 : 22 .
The obvious conclusion therefore is , that the two stars are unconnected , and the relative motion merely the difference of their proper motions ; If so , both stars must have a considerable proper motion , for the large one ( according to PIAZZI ) has one which alone would carry it in the sp direction , at an angle of about 4o ?
from the parallel ( and therefore almost directly away from the small star , at the rate of about o".30 per annum .
) This would explain the increase of distance , but not the angular motion .
To explain both it becomes necessary ~ Bootis continued .
to attribute to the small star a motion of -0".35 in R.A. , and -o0".7 in declination , those of the large one being -o".23 , and -o".18 .
This , though very possible , is not very probable , unless we admit a connection of some kind between the stars , and other circumstances conspire to throw a doubt on the validity of the opposite conclusion .
The first is , that either the position of 1804 , or that of 1792 , is certainly incorrect .
The observation of 1791 , when taken in combination with that of the following year , shows that about that time the angle of position must have been exactly a right one , the small star then being in the act of changing quadrants .
Even with this concession , supposing the position to have been exactly north in i791-2 , and assuming this ( 1791.8 ) as an epoch , the angle described in the lo preceding years will have been 24 ?
, while in the 11 succeeding ones it amounted to no more than 7 ?
x2 ( up to 1803.25 , the mean between the observations of 1802 and 1804 ) or o ?
.68 per annum .
Yet this rapid diminution of angular velocity has not continued , for in the next 20 years , up to 1823 , we find an angular motion of 13 ?
, or o.65 per annum , and taking only the observations of the last four years , it exceeds a degree per annum .
These considerations indicate a considerable error , either in the measures of 1802 , 1804 , which corroborate each other , or in that of 1782 , which is marked " very exact .
" Here then we have a choice of difficulties , but fortunately a few years will enable us to decide .
If the relative path of the small star be really the strait line it appears to be , the angle of position will never reach 50 ?
np , and the angular velocity will diminish continually from the present moment .
On the other hand , ' Bootis continued .
if the stars form a binary system , the present angular velocity of about a degree per annum , will continue for some time nearly uniform , and in 15 or o2 years the limit of 500 np will be attained or passed .
If we give up the observations of 1802 , 1804 , and suppose the position to have been exactly north at the epoch 1792.8 , the observations , both of angle and distance , will be nearly represented by a circular orbit , described with a mean motion of 1 ?
.8 per annum , and inclined at an angle of 13§ 3 ' to the visual ray , supposing the intersection with the plane of projection to lie in the np and sf quadrants , at an angle of 70o with the parallel ; but the data are too precarious to rely much on this conclusion .
There is a small star at about ior 2 minutes distance , and at about 82 ?
np , which is not to be suspected with the seven-feet reflector ( aperture 6 inches ) and can barely be discerned by rare glimpses ( knowing its place ) in the ten ( aperture 9 inches ) but with the twenty-feet it is very conspicuous .
This was observed by Sir W. HERSCHEL , in 1792 , to be in the same line with the two stars of ~ , or rather , according to a diagram made at the time of observation , a little more ( 3 ?

The change in the position of the small star here is established by indisputable evidence ; the star , being fortunately placed at a very convenient distance to serve as a mark of reference , and nearly in the direction of the small star , being about 81 ?

In 1781 it was remarked by Sir W. H. that the small star followed the line joining the large one and ~ , and in 1802 that it had changed sides , and preceded the same line .
Our observations and M. STRUVE'S fully confirm this change .
In the interval of 19.98 years between the observations of 1782 and 1802 , the motion observed was 11 ?

The relative positions of the large and small star appears then not to have varied ( at least as far as angle is concerned ) since 1781 .
This is a point of some importance , as the rotation of the small star ( which is itself a close double star ) is established by this fact .
On the other hand , if the proper motions assigned by PIAZZI ( o".3o in R. A. and + o".16 in declination ) be correct , this fact would go to establish a connexion between the two stars ; for supposing the small star at rest , the space passed over in its path by the large one amounts , in 40 years , to 13^.5 , which being inclined at an angle of 28 ?
to the parallel in a np direction , would subtend at the small one an angle of 5§ 49 ' , a quantity which could not have escaped measurement in so distant a star ; either therefore PIAZZI 's proper motions are erroneous , or the two stars have a common proper motion .

We have here an instance of a great and almost sudden acceleration in the angular velocity of the small star .
In the interval of so.95 years elapsed , between 1781 and 1802 , the angle described was 23 ?
.86 , giving a mean velocity of 1 ?
.i39 per annum .
In the next interval of 16.86 years the angle described was 38 ?
.60 , or 2 ?
.298 a year ; while from 1819.6 to 1823.83 the angle described amounted to 2O ?
.55 in 3.23 years , or 60.982 per annum .
This rapid increase of angular velocity has been accompanied with a very sensible diminution of distance .
In the catalogue of 1782 , the interval between the two stars is described as being full S:4 diameter of the large star , with a power of 227 ; while , with the same power , M. STRUVE observed them only j diameter asunder ; and the same assiduous observer remarks , that the stars j Ursae and 17 Draconis , both of which are set down in the catalogues as closer than a- , are now farther asunder .
Our observations corroborate this diminution of distance ; aCoronae is now a very difficult star to separate , almost equally so with 4 , and requiring the most favourable a Corona continued .
circumstances for its measurement .
Indeed the distance of the centres is less in -c than in 9 , a mean of 12 capital observations having given us 1i.455 for the former distance on the 5th of June , 1823 , while n , on the same extraordinary night , measured 1'.577 ; but the greater inequality of the stars of afevours their separation .
To explain these phoenomena we may suppose , first , that the orbit is elliptic , and the star approaching its perihelion .
But this would require a much greater variation of distance than appears to have taken place , to produce the effect , without the assistance of a second supposition , viz. that of the motion being performed in a plane passing nearly through the eye .
Without therefore going into the minutiae of an elliptic orbit , let us conceive the small star to describe a circle about the large one , in a plane 30 ?
inclined to the visual line , and intersecting the plane of projection in the line SA which joined the two stars at the moment of the first observation .
Taking the mean motion in the orbit at .

The small star observed on the loth April will serve to verify the proper motion of A ( 36 ) , which has been supposed in some way connected with the star 30 Scorpii , though at a great distance ( i ' ) from it , by reason of an observation of BESSEL , that they have a common proper motion .
The point is a very interesting one , especially should other stars in this neighbourhood appear to be similarly affected .
But our knowledge of the proper motions of the stars is lamentably deficient-or rather our ignorance respecting them is the opprobrium of modern astronomy , CCXLVI .

observation the circumstance of the stars being exactly in the direction of the equatorial motion and running together along the hair is particularly mentioned .
The motion of these stars appears exceedingly capricious , the diminution of angular velocity since the year 1821 being so great and sudden as almost to throw a doubt on the observations made after that time .
The agreement between our measures and those of M. STRUVE in that year , is sufficient to prove that we have observed the same star , and all other observations on it were made with the utmost care , in nights selected for their clearness , &amp;c. , and when the telescope was in its best action .
Had the angular 70 p Ophiuchi continued .
motion continued nearly uniform from 1821 , at its former rate of about 6 ?
per annum , the position , at the time of the observations of 1822 , should have been 60 ?
sf , and on the gth of April , 1823 , about 54 ? .
The notes annexed to the last set of observations contain the result of two trials made to ascertain the quantity of error the eye would bear in a single measure of this star .
When purposely set , either way , 2 ?
from the mean , the micrometer wire was found to be intolerably out of place .
The corrections were cautiously made so as barely to give satisfaction , and from their readings off we are fairly entitled to conclude that no satisfactory measure can deviate above a degree , or a degree and a half from the truth , at most .
On the 9th April the micrometer wire was purposely set to 9033 = 57 ?
sf , but its position was so offensive as to be marked " shocking ; " and when set to 51 ?
it had no appearance of ever being intended for a measure , the wire actually passing between the stars .
Admitting the correctness of our measures and those of M. STRUVE in 1819 , 1820 , the mean angular velocities , during the several different intervals of the observations , will stand as follows : Observation of 1779 to that of 80oz-mean annual motion. .

There is a great disagreement between our angle and M. STRUVE'S , but the latter is only the result of a single measure ; and in the case of very close stars of very unequal magnitudes , and of opposite colours , a single measure can never have any dependence placed on it .
We have instances of this kind in E Bootis , Rigel , STRUVE'S NO 40o , &amp;c. The distance however has undoubtedly undergone a remarkable change ; in 1781 the interval with 460 was 2D , corresponding to about 4 ' of distance between the centres .
In 1802 it was four or five diameters , which could hardly represent less than 7 " central distance , while it now seems again on the decrease .
This agrees with the idea of a rapid rotation of one star about the other in a plane nearly passing through the eye , the small star being at its greatest elon39 Draconis continued .

M. STRUVE suspects the angle of position of AC to be changed .
It is perhaps a little , an error of 40 being too much to commit in the measure of two stars a minute and a half asunder .
He has not observed the close star .
The angle of position of this was shown by Sir W. HERSCHEL , in his paper of 1804 , to have undergone a change of 6§ 22 in the interval of 22 years , from 1780 to 1802 .
Our observations confirm this by pointing out a further change in the same direction-not indeed nearly so considerable , but enough M Lyrae continued .
parallel in the np quadrant , and therefore making an angle of 84 ?
with the position of the small star .
Its velocity is o'.375 per annum , or 15 " in 40 years .
The change observed in the angle of position of the small star is in the same sense therefore as that which would result from the proper motion of a , the small star remaining at rest , and its quantity ( reckoning from the year 1792 , the observations of that year being of course to be preferred from the great superiority of the instrument employed ) 15 54 ' , is almost precisely that which such a supposition would give it ( 15 47 ) , while the small decrease in the distance , since 1792 , is also conformable to the same hypothesis .
There is therefore every presumption : Ist , that the proximity of the large and small stars is merely apparent and accidental , no connection existing between them ; and 2dly , that the proper motions assigned to a are not very remote from truth .

The measures on the whole are favourable to a slow variation in the angle of position , as surmised by Sir WILLIAM HERCHEL in 1804 ; but as the amount does not exceed o§ 19 per annum , it must be regarded as still open to further enquiry .

Twenty-feet Reflector , Equal , or nearly so ; each of the i5th or 2oth magnitude .
Its existence cannot be even suspected with either of the two Equatorials .
The seven and ten-feet reflectors ( the former of six , the latter of nine inches aperture ) in like manner fail to give any indication of it ; but all of them show a small star of about the loth magnitude preceding them both , and making an isosceles triangle of about 100o at the vertex with s and 5 .
The twenty-feet reflector however shows a double star , whose distance is one fourth that of e from 5 ( i.e. 53 " ) in the middle between them .
Its Debilissima inter 4( ) et 5 Lyrae continued .
position is such that the line joining the two stars makes an angle of about 50 ?
with that joining e and 5 , which latter line is nearly in the direction of the meridian .
Although these are only estimations , and of course inaccurate , yet as this star naturally refers itself to e Lyrae , and can only be found by it , it was thought adviseable to place its description here rather than defer it .

BIANCHINI relates in his observations ( Verona , 1737 ) that the most southern of the two stars of ' Lyra was occasionally seen double by him , and sometimes accompanied with other small stars , through several telescopes , by CAMPINI and CELLIUS , of great focal length .
It is also said to have been seen through a 12 feet telescope ( by SHORT ) surrounded by five small stars .
Doubtless , in a part of the heavens so crowded with stars , numbers of minute stars may be seen near it in good telescopes ; but the division of one of the large stars into two is a fact we may be allowed to doubt .
Many strange things were seen among the stars before the use of powerful telescopes became common among observers .
3 Cygni continued .
Few stars are better determined than this , and few appear subject to less variation either in angle or distance .
We may fairly regard our mean result as true to o " .
i in distance , and Xa degree , or even less , in the angle .
The angle of position deduced from the right ascensions and declinations of the stars at so early a period as BRADLEY'S observations , cannot merit much reliance .
The observations of 181 6 by one of us , not at that time much practised in these delicate measurements , are not to be put in competition with the rest .

As it is not possible to commit an error of 80 in the position of a star at the distance of B , the relative motion of these stars is past a doubt .
The proper motion of a is not sufficient to account for it , for this is such as would alone carry it almost directly towards the small star with a velocity of o".634 per annum .
Were the small star at rest then , the large one should have approached it by 26".63 , with a variation of the angle of position of not more than two or three degrees , and that in a contrary direction to what has actually happened .
To account for the phenomenon , if the proper motion assigned to a be correct , the small star must have a motion nearly in the same direction as a , and somewhat more rapid .

The proper motion assigned by PIAZZI and BESSEL to 61 Cygni , are + 5".38 in R. A. , and + 3.30 in declination .
This affords indisputable proof of their connection in a binary system , otherwise the lapse of nearly 70 years , during which they have been observed , one of them would doubtless have left the other behind , without supposing a coincidence too extraordinary to have resulted from accident .
Of the reality of this proper motion we have satisfied ourselves by a series of more than 500 micrometrical comparisons of the large star with minute stars in the neighbourhood , which will more properly be reserved for another communication .
The mean angular motion , as deduced from the micrometrical measures of 1781 , 1819 , 182 , ( regarding the latter as perfectly correct ) comes out o ?
.7386 per annum .

The proper motions assigned by PIAZZI to this star are + o".40 in R. A. , equivalent to o".38 on the parallel , and -o".ol in declination .
In 40 years therefore it should have moved 15".2 from its place in a direction almost exactly coincident with the parallel , and supposing the small star at rest , and the position of 1783 correct , the angle at present should be 75§ 38 ' , coinciding exactly with the observed .
The proper motion of this star appears therefore to be well established in fact and correct in quantity .

The motion first noticed by Sir W HERSCHEL in his paper of 1804 is therefore clearly confirmed .
It is remarkable that M. STRUVE uniformly places the smaller star in the n-preceding quadrant , while our observations as regularly make it sp or nf , but the position is so nearly in the meridian that it is scarcely possible to perceive a bias one way or the other ; and perhaps 90g n or s may be taken as the present situation without sensible error .
In 42.37 years therefore the angle described is 19 ?
, giving an average annual motion of o ?
.4484 in the direction npsf or retrograde .
As the proper motion of Aquarii ( according to PIAZZI ) amounts to 0".173 or 7".266 in 42 years , and yet the stars of which it consists still retain the same distance and nearly the same relative situation with respect to each other ; this circumstance alone amounts to a proof of their mutual connection , which their equal size corroborates , and renders it exceedingly probable that they form a binary system .

" The distance has not undergone that rapid change which Sir W. HERSCHEL surmised to take place in this star , as is evident by comparing M. STRUVE'S measure 1144/ '.5 , taken in 1819.88 , with the mean of two very accurate ones in 1780.69 , which gives i 13.32 .
Some mistake therefore must have been made in the measures t ' 44'".218 in the Catalogue of 1782 , from which the motion was concluded with so much certainty .
