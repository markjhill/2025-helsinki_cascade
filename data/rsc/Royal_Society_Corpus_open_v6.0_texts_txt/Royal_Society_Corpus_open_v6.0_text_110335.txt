A paper was also read , entitled , " On the Law which connects the various Magneto-electric Phenomena lately discovered by Dr. Fara ?
day .
" By the Rev. William Ritchie , LL. D. F.R.S. Professor of Na ?
tural and Experimental Philosophy in the Royal Institution of Great Britain , and Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy in the University of London .
The general principle from which the author deduces the law in question , is that of the equality of action and reaction .
The apply ?
cation of this principle to electro-magnetism , he thinks , may be thus expressed : ?
since a current of voltaic electricity can , in certain circumstances , induce magnetism , magnets will , in similar circumstances , induce similar voltaic currents .
He gives an account of several experiments in confirmation of the universality of this law .
