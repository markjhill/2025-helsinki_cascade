( Abstract .
) The observations detailed in the paper were made with the view of redetermining the relation between the B.A. unit and the mercury unit of Siemens , i.e. , the resistance of a column of mercury at 0 ' , one metre in length , and one square millim. in section .
According to Siemens ' experiments , 1 mercury unit='9536 B.A. unit , and according to Matthiessen and Hockin , 1 mercury unit=-9619 B.A. unit .
The value resulting from our observations agrees pretty closely with that of Siemens .
We find 1 mercury unit ='95418 B.A. unit .
On the Specific Resistance of Mercury .
[ May 4 , Four tubes were used to contain the mercury , of lengths varying from 87 to 194 centims. .
The diameter of the three first tubes was about 1 millim. and that of the fourth about 2 millims. The final numbers obtained from the several fillings of the tubes are as follows :\#151 ; Tube I Tube II .
