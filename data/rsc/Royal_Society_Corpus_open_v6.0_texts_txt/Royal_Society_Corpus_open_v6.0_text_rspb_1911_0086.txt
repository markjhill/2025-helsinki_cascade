) Ozone lias been extolled as the active health-giving agent in mountain and .
sea air , its virtues have been vaunted as a therapeutic agent , until these have , by mere reiteration , become part and parcel of common belief ; and yet exact physiological evidence in favour of its good effects has been hitherto almost entirely wanting .
Ozone has been found occasionally in traces in the atmosphere , it has been proved to have active oxidising properties , and on these facts the superstructure of its therapy has been reared .
Popular attention has been fixed on the mysterious and the unknown , and has neglected the prepotent power of cold wind and sunlight to influence the nervous health and metabolism of man .
The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone , so far attained , is that it causes irritation and oedema of the lungs , and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time , e.g. , 0*05 per cent. , death in two hours ( Schwarzenbach ) ; 1 per cent , in one hour ( Barlow ) .
A. Loewy and 1ST .
Zuntz* write that " the physiological foundations of an ozone-therapy can scarcely be discussed , so little is the extent of our exact knowledge on this subject .
" The old idea , that ozone passing into the blood acts as an oxidising agent there , thus destroying " organised " and " unorganised " poisons , was exploded by Pfiiiger , f who pointed out that ozone is immediately destroyed on contact with blood ; even if it were not , there is no reason why it should oxidise toxins rather than normal constituents of the blood .
C. BinzJ observed that " animals submitted to ozone became quiet and appeared to sleep .
" W. SigmundS also noted this effect in white mice , gold fish , and insects .
He considered that ozone is not a very dangerous substance , for even small animals could bear for a time a relatively large amount without serious effect ; warm-blooded animals were the more sensitive . .

The Physiological Influence of Ozone .
Filipow* found weak concentrations had no effect on men or animals , while a higher concentration of ozone caused irritation of the respiratory tract .
Schultzf confirmed this irritative effect , and found long-continued breathing of ozone caused pathological changes , particularly in the lungs , which were the cause of death .
Schultz considered that the ozone passed into the blood and injured the lung secondarily .
Bohr and MaarJ overthrew this supposition by the ingenious experiment they devised of making one lung breathe ozonised air and the other normal air .
They found this lung remained normal while the ozonised lung became oedematous .
Using a concentration of ozone which produced no visible change in the pulmonary structure , these observers found that it caused a diminished uptake of oxygen ; the other lung compensated for the deficiency by an increased uptake .
This occurred in both cold-blooded ( tortoise ) and warmblooded animals .
In the former the initial effect of ozone was occasionally a slightly increased oxygen uptake .
If the inhalation of ozone were continuous , the increased uptake by the lung ventilated with normal air finally fell away and became deficient ; this occurred sooner in the mammal than in the tortoise .
The C02 output was also diminished , but not so markedly as the oxygen uptake , thus the respiratory quotients often rose over 1 .
The effect of ozone on the respiratory exchange came on gradually , and with weak concentrations often reached its height after the cessation of the ozone inhalation\#151 ; there was , in fact , an after-effect which took some little time to pass off .
The effect was not modified by a preliminary division of the vagi and pulmonary sympathetic nerves .
The blood of the ozonised animal had no toxic effect when transfused into another .
Bohr concluded that the effect was primarily on the lungs , and as the oxygen uptake was affected more than the C02 output , he claimed that his results supported his view that the pulmonary epithelium by its secretory activity controlled the passage of the respiratory gases .
Butte and PeyronS likewise record that ozone when inhaled diminishes the metabolism .
One of the obstacles in the way of investigation has been the difficulty of obtaining pure ozone free from oxides of nitrogen , and another has been the want of an accurate method of estimating the concentration of ozone .
There has been devised lately an ingenious apparatus for producing ozone , which eliminates the production of the oxides of nitrogen , and allows the * ' Arch. f. d. Ges .

[ July 6 , ready use of ozone for bleaching , sterilising water or ventilating purposes .
The ozone is generated by the electrical discharge of high-potential currents across sheets of fine gauze set parallel and insulated from each other .
The gauze net ensures the equality of the discharge over the whole surface , and prevents that excessive high-tension discharge at certain rough points , which occurring in the older form of instruments fitted with smooth metal plates , causes the production of oxides of nitrogen from the burning of atmospheric nitrogen.* Our object therefore has been to determine the effects of undoubtedly pure ozone , especially in concentrations far less than those used by previous observers .
Method of Estimation of Concentration of Ozone.\#151 ; The air containing ozone is sucked by an aspirator or filter pump through a 1 per cent , solution of potassium iodide , acidified with a small quantity of 10 per cent , sulphuric acid contained in a Drechsel wash-bottle .
It is essential that contact with rubber be avoided .
After 10 litres of air have been passed through the wash-bottle , the acidified KI is removed and freshly prepared pure starch emulsion added .
A blue colour indicates the presence of ozone .
The amount is estimated by titration with sodium hyposulphite solution until this blue colour is discharged .
The hyposulphite solution is prepared by dissolving 22'2 grm. in 1 litre of distilled water , so that 1 c.c. of the solution is equivalent to 100 parts per million of ozone in the air collected as a ten litre sample .
For small quantities of ozone the solution may be diluted 10 or 100 times , giving 1 c.c. of the solution equal respectively to ten and one part per million of ozone in the air collected .
Lethal Dose of Ozone.\#151 ; To determine this the animals were placed in a large airtight chamber .
The ozonised air was then driven through by means of a gas engine driving an air-pump , and the concentration of ozone determined in the issuing air .
The animals could be observed through the glass windows of the chamber , which could also , if necessary , be lighted by electric light .
Our experiments show that animals may die after being submitted to 15 to 20 parts per million for two hours .
We do not doubt that a lower concentration would have a fatal effect if breathed for a much longer period .
The cause of death is acute inflammation of the respiratory tract .
The lungs become intensely congested and oedematous .
Microscopically the pulmonary alveoli appear full of an inflammatory exudation .
Many of the alveoli are full , of blood , for so intense is the irritant effect that haemorrhages take place .
There are no other signs of the effect of ozone * Mr. Edward L. Joseph , the inventor of the " Ozonair apparatus , was good enough to give us the use of a complete installation and place his information at our disposal .

] in the body .
On inhaling ozonised air ourselves and expiring through the iodine test solution we find no evidence of ozone in the exhaled air .
It is all taken up by the wet mucous surface of the respiratory tract and exerts its effect there .

On breathing two to three parts per million , we ourselves find it irritating to the respiratory tract , with a tendency to produce , in this concentration , headache and oppression .
The irritation set up by ozone , together with its strong characteristic smell , affords ample warning , and would prevent anyone exposing himself unintentionally to a dangerous concentration .
The irritation set up would naturally make anyone remove himself from the influence of the ozone before any serious damage to the lungs had been set up .
As far as we can see , then , no serious risk can arise from the use of ozone generators , so long as the generators are not placed in a confined space from which escape is impossible .
It is only possible to estimate concentrations of much less than one part of ozone per million parts of air by passing very large quantities of the ozonised air through the acidified potassium iodide solution .
We find concentrations of far less than one in a million parts can be both smelt and tasted : the physiological test for ozone therefore is extraordinarily delicate .
If ozone is used in a ventilating system , we think it should be in such concentration as is scarcely perceptible to a keen sense of smell .
Ozone has most potent action as a deodoriser .
We tested this by filling Messrs. L. Hill and M. Flack .
[ July 6 , our experimental chamber with the smoke of shag tobacco , ammonium sulphide , or carbon bisulphide vapour .
At other times we placed in the chamber stinking meat , or human feeces .
After putting in action the two small ozonisers , placed in the roof of the chamber , for two minutes , we were not able to detect the odours of these substances .
The smell of the ozone masked all other smells .
The masking of these smells gives no proof of the destruction of the evil-smelling emanations , for Zwaardemaker has shown that two smells can neutralise each other , ammonia introduced up one nostril , and acetic acid up the other .
Erlandsen and L. Schwarz* concluded , from a series of careful observations on the effect of ozone on ammonia and hydrogen sulphide , trimethylamine , butyric and valerianic acids , indol and skatol , that the smells are only masked and not destroyed by the presence of ozone .
The odoriferous substance and ozone were introduced into the chamber together .
After a period the ozone disappeared from the chamber , and the smell was found to have returned .
The smell of tobacco , in particular , was masked and not destroyed .
From a hygienic standpoint the ozone may be useful as a deodoriser , since , from the point of view of its effect on the nervous system , it does not matter whether the evil smell is masked or destroyed .
The question is which is preferable , the evil smell or the smell of ozone .
Certain smells are objectionable , and become more so if persistent and uniform .
In cold meat or dry goods stores , tube railways , etc. , ozone may have its use as a deodoriser and freshener of the atmosphere , relieving the stale and tedious quality of the air .
In a room fitted with a gas radiator ( without flue ) we have found , by a series of daily observations , that ozone relieves the disagreeable quality of the air .
It seems to give a certain tang to the air , and , by stimulating nerve-endings in the respiratory tract , relieves the monotony of over-warm and close air .
We were informed by an engineer employed in a large public office that he added " Sanitas " to the water used for spraying and cooling the air which was pumped into the building on a Plenum system .
In the late afternoon the clerks often telephoned down to him and asked for " more Sanitas " \#151 ; anything to change the monotony of air always warmed to 65 ' F. Under the conditions of natural life we are " blown upon by every wind , and wet with every shower .

In the House of Commons the air is drawn in from over the Thames , cooled and wetted by a water spray , and carried in at the rate of 40,000 to 50,000 feet a minute\#151 ; a fine bracing current .
Before it reaches the House it is warmed by passing over steam radiators , mixed , and passed in a uniform draughtless stream at 63 ' E. , through the gauze-covered floor of the House .
When the division bell rings the current is switched from the House on to the Division lobbies .
Hour after hour the same uniformity is maintained , which leads the open-air man to complain that it is too hot , and the old East Indian to revile the cold .
The fault lies in the uniformity .
When the House is cleared for division , it should be swept , in our opinion , with a current of cool air straight from the water sprays .
In such conditions of uniformity an ozoniser , just as a cigarette , may relieve the tedium of the nervous system .
Ozonised air may help under the depressing conditions which obtain in many shops and factories by varying the stimulation of the nervous system .
It has been claimed that traces of ozone in the atmosphere , by its oxidising properties , destroy dust , bacteria , noxious gases , and render the air pure .
There is no doubt that ozone in the presence of water and in strong concentration is a powerful oxidising agent .
It is actually used for the sterilisation of the water supply of certain towns .
The ozonised air is thoroughly mixed with the water , and brought into intimate contact with the bacteria .
On dry bacteria concentrated ozone has no action ( Ohlmuller* ) .
In weak concentrations , such as can be inhaled safely , we found ozone had no sterilising effect when bubbled through moist cultures of Bacillus coli \#166 ; communis .
The ozone only acts on the surface , and in weak concentrations cannot be expected to pass through relatively thick layers of wet material .
Erlandsen and Schwarz rightly point out that there is no justification for the assertion made by Lubbert that " organic dust , ill-smelling particles and agents of infection cannot exist in the presence of ozone , and that a demonstrable excess of ozone indicates absolute purity of the air .
" Owing to its powerful bactericidal action when passed through water in high concentrations , it might be thought that inhalation of ozone would be of value in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract , and such inhalations have been used , e.g. , for pulmonary tuberculosis .
\lt ; Against the use of all such bactericidal agents in the treatment of pulmonary disease is the fact that the bacilli are growing in thefsubstance of * ' Arbeiten a. d. Kab .

[ July 6 , the wet tissues , and therefore to kill the bacilli a concentration must be used which would also kill the tissues .
One of the most potent methods of treatment is to draw blood in increased volume to the infected part , by fomentations , blisters , etc. , the blood itself having bactericidal and immunising properties .
We suggest that inhalation of weak concentrations of ozone , by mildly irritating the respiratory tract may bring more blood to the part and thus have the curative effect of a fomentation or blister .
Fat has a power of absorbing ozone until it smells strongly of ozone , and it retains the ozone for a long time .
Mr. F. Kidd kindly tried for us the application of ozonised lard or vaseline to foul chronic ulcers of the leg , but found that while hot fomentations were efficacious in cleaning up and rendering sweet control cases of nicer , the ozonised ointment had little effect .
For the investigation of the respiratory metabolism we used the Haldane-Pembrey gravimetric method .
Mice or small rats were placed in a beaker fitted with a thermometer and the beaker placed in a Hearson air-bath to keep the external temperature constant .
In a first series of experiments the ozone was generated by a specially made small ozoniser , and led partly through the animal chamber and partly through a collecting wash-bottle , in order that its concentration might be determined .
The water vapour given off by the animal varied so much with the passing of urine and faeces , and possibly with the animal putting up its fur , as it does when depressed by the ozone , that we can lay no weight on the calculation of oxygen intake .
The weakness of the gravimetric method lies in the fact that the oxygen is calculated from the difference between loss of body-weight and output of water and C02 , and not directly measured .
We shall confine our considerations in these experiments to the loss of body-weight , and the C02 output .
Table II shows the loss of weight sustained by the animal , the amounts of H20 and C02 given off before , during , and after ozone .
It is seen that there is a marked depression during and after the administration of ozone .
The table gives a random selection made from 25 similar experiments .
The figures for the loss of weight represent the loss of weight of the animals weighed in the respiration chamber .
Evaporation of urine and faeces when passed contribute to this loss .
As the loss of body-weight is also influenced by the passing and evaporation of the urine and water from the faeces , the C02 output results are the more trustworthy .
As the concentration of ozone given by the small generator seemed to be too high , we obtained the ozone in the following experiments by generating it 1911 .

Table III gives the loss of weight and amount of COa given off in milligrammes in the last eight experiments made under these conditions , the reading for the oxygen as before being variable .
In all , 16 similar experiments were made on small rats .
In all these experiments the animals were given a preliminary half-hour or so on air , in which to settle down and adjust themselves to their new surroundings .
Judging by the CO2 given off in some cases , the ozone appears to have perhaps a transitory stimulating effect , followed by a corresponding depressant effect ; in others there is but little evidence of any action of the ozone at all at concentrations such as these .
The ozone itself was always in concentrations far less than one part per million , and varied from day to day according to the atmospheric conditions prevailing .
We should state that several of our figures obtained during and after ozone show a R.Q. above 1 , confirming the observations of Bohr as to the diminished uptake of oxygen .

the influence of ozone , we selected the method devised recently by Dr. Gordon Douglas , * of Oxford , owing to its simplicity and efficiency .
The subject was provided with a mouthpiece , fitted with inspiratory and expiratory valves .
( We used the excellent mica valves made by Messrs. Siebe , Gorman , and Co. , and used in their mine rescue apparatus .
) While inspiring atmospheric air , the subject expired into a large canvas-rubber bag of suitable construction , and previously emptied of air .
After a period of 10 minutes a fresh bag was substituted , and the volume of expired air in the first bag was measured by pressing the contents of the bag through the meter , and a sample of the expired air was collected and analysed .
Successive samples were thus taken , some when the air was ozonised , and some when it was not .
The composition of the atmospheric air being known , the requisite data were calculated from the measurements of the meter and the analysis of the samples , all results being reduced to 0 ' C. and 760 mm. In all we have made 19 experiments , and append the details of the last seven .
In the preliminary trials of the method we found considerable * C. G. Douglas , ' Journ. Physiol. , ' 1911 , vol. 42 ; 'Proceedings , ' p. xvii .

variations in the metabolism in successive periods of time .
These were due to want of complete rest on the part of the subject .
( See'Table IV .
) Our last series of experiments were carried out with the subject recumbent on a couch and prepared for the test by a preliminary period of rest .
Even then , the opening and shutting of the windows ( to vary the condition of ozonisation of the air ) must have somewhat influenced our results by altering the cooling effect of the air on the body .
These tests were carried out in warm summer weather , and in the final experiment the windows were kept shut all the time and the room ventilated by opening the doors leading into other and larger laboratories .
In this experiment we obtained results which we regard as the most conclusive of all .
The metabolism varies with the degree of complete rest of the subject .
If he moves slightly more or less , e.g. , in reading , talking , this will affect the result , and thus we cannot expect figures more concordant than those we have obtained .
Looking at the figures in columns IY and YI , we cannot find any conclusive evidence that ozone altered the respiratory metabolism .
Note particularly the final experiment ( No. 7 ) , in which the windows were shut and the conditions even all through .
The ozone was given in a concentration that made the air smell quite strongly , and in some cases it was pushed even to an unpleasant degree .
Taking these figures together with those obtained on mice , we must conclude that we have failed to obtain certain evidence that inhalation of ozone in weak concentration stimulates the respiratory metabolism , the output of of C03 and use of 02 .
On the other hand , our experiments conclusively show that any considerable concentration of ozone depresses the respiratory metabolism .
We think that the beneficial results obtained by the use of pure ozone in ventilation must be reached by the effect of ozone on the nervous system\#151 ; by its stimulating the mucous membrane , neutralising smells , and relieving the depressing uniformity of close air .
Our experiments show that no harm results to man from breathing air ozonised till the air smells quite strongly of ozone , for periods of half to one hour .
Perhaps the most interesting observation made in the research is this : when the respiratory tract is irritated by ozone , the animal becomes motionless , sits hunched up with its fur erect , thus showing the signs of depression .
The ozone lessens the respiratory exchange , reduces it even to one-seventh , at a time when the lung shows no changes visible to the naked eye ; the animal adjusts its behaviour to this condition , and keeps very still and quiet .
Its body temperature at the same time falls .
The damage to the lung cannot be serious , since this depressant effect is quite evanescent .

] The Physiological Influence of Ozone .
effect of ozone on the oxygen partial pressure of the blood .
We would draw attention to the fact that high pressures of oxygen produce inflammation of the lung ( Lorrain Smith , L. Hill , and -T .
J. E. Maeleod ) similar to that produced by ozone .
It is this resemblance which in part led us to make this research .
Conclusions .
( 1 ) Ozone is a powerful deodoriser .
It masks rather than destroys smells .
Its practical value in relieving the nervous system from the depressant influence of an unpleasant odour is none the less for this .
( 2 ) A concentration as little as one per million is irritating to the respiratory tract .
Exposure for two hours to a concentration of 15 to 20 per million is not without risk to life .
The irritative effect and the discomfort produced thereby\#151 ; cough , headache\#151 ; give ample warning , and there is no risk from inhaling ozone so long as an outlet for the instinctive escape from its influence is open .
It is necessary that systems of ventilation in which ozone is used should be dealt with by those experienced in the matter , so that concentrations may be supplied which will not irritate the respiratory tract .
( 3 ) The respiratory metabolism is reduced by ozone , in concentrations even less than one part per million .
There is no conclusive evidence of a preliminary stimulation of metabolism preceding the fall .
( 4 ) The beneficial effect of ozone obtained by the ozone ventilating systems is to be explained by its effect on the nervous system .
By exciting the olfactory nerves and those of the respiratory tract and skin , it may relieve the monotony of close air , the smell of tube railways , in cold meat stores , hide stores , and other trades .
( 5 ) There is no harm in breathing weak concentrations of ozone , such as can be scarcely sensed by a keen sense of small .
( 6 ) Ozone in somewhat higher concentrations ( one per million ) may have some value as a therapeutic agent if inhaled for brief periods ; by irritating the respiratory tract it may act as a blister or fomentation and bring more blood and tissue lymph to the part .
The blood and tissue lymph contain the immunising and curative properties .
It seems to us a simple and convenient way of applying a " blister " to the respiratory tract .
This research has been carried out with the aid of a grant from the London Hospital Eesearch Fund .
[ Note added November 21 , 1911.\#151 ; We have found that exposure for 10 minutes to two parts in 10 millions of ozone may lower the rectal temperature of rats as much as three degrees , while control rats maintained their normal temperature of 38'5 ' C. ]
