Received Novenmber 15 , 1865 .
On the 17th of October , 1865 , at 2 P.M. the spot referred to had traversed a great portion of its arc , and was approaching the limb .
It showed two large unequal umbrae , and in each of them a blacker nucleus .
Between them were several small dark dots , partially coalescent .
The edges of the umbrm were very irregular .
In the smaller umbra two bright dots .
Above the larger umbra ( which appeared to the right in the telescope ) was an exceptionally bright band , traversed by two dark threads ending in dark dots .
This band crossed a part of the umbra , like a bridge , but itself was there traversed by a small bar .
Four bright patches lay in the continuation of this facula toward the prolonged upper ( apparently ) extremity of the penumbra , which was itself more lutminous than other penumbral parts .
The penumbra had broken edges , and an interior mottling of small brighter and darker spaces directed variously toward the umbrae .
The granulated surface of the sun with soft gleaming facular ridges was conspicuously seen , and tracts of darkly dotted surface were seen beyond each extremity and on one side ( P1 .
X. fig. 1 ) .
Nov. 4 , 9.45.-The spot had now returned by rotation , and was very distinctlv seen amidst far extended clouds of bright faculae , though reduced to less than half its former dimensions .
It retained the two umbral tracts ; but it was now the left-hand tract which was the larger .
Being about 15 ' from the lirnb , the general figure was oval , as usual ; the umbrae were of irregular figure , the larger one cut into by bright branches from the interumbral space .
Dark dots amidst the facule on the border ( P1 .
X. fig. 2 ) .
Nov. 6 , 9.45'.-The spot had reached about 450 from the edge , and appeared less elliptical , and otherwise changed in aspect .
The large umbra was much dissected by bright streams , and the smaller one had assumed a distinctly tripartite shape .
The edges of the penumbra appeared rugged .
Many small spots and dark dots towards the edge of the disk ( P1 .
X. fig. 3 ) Nov. 11 , 9.45.-The spot had now passed the central meridian , and was greatly altered , and almost cut into two parts by a bright facular mass , passing between the umbre .
The larger of these is now in a pentagonal form , and has a bright central speck , with a rather obscure narrow prolongation .
The smaller umbra is tripartite , and has small gleaming points in it .
Several Hlack dots in the surrounding surface , amidst faculm , areolm , and other structures very distinctly seen for a great part of this day with good definition ( P1 .

fig. 4 ) .
Nov. 13 , 9.45.-Verv great change in general figure and in the several parts of the spot .
The larger spot is now cut in twain ; the smaller spot is reduced to two dots , surrounded by a large bright space .
The spot is now about 36 ?
from the limb ( P1 .

Nov. 15.-The spot is very near the edge , and of course almost elliptical in outline ( P1 .
