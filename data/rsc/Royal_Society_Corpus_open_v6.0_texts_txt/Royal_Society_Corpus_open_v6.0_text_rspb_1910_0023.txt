( Received February 12 , \#151 ; Read February 24 , 1910 .
) Two equations have been proposed by the authors* to represent the course of alcoholic fermentation by yeast-juice : ( 1 ) 2C6H120 6 + 2P04HR3 = 2C02+ 2C2H60 + 2H20 + C6H10O4(PO4R2)2 , ( 2 ) C6H10O4(PO4R2)2 + 2H20 = C6Hi20 6 + 2P 0 4HR2 .
These were founded on ( a ) the determination of the amount of carbon and alcohol produced by the addition of a known amount of phosphate in presence of excess of sugarf ; ( b ) the production of a hexosephosphate composition CeHioCh ( P 0 4R2)2 ; ( c ) the occurrence of an enzymic hydrolysis of this substance with production of free phosphate .
In order to obtain further experimental justification for this view , several additional determinations have been made , and these form the subject of the present paper .
I. Ratio o f Carbon Dioxide produced to Sugar fermented in Presence o f Excess o f Phosphate .
When glucose or fructose is fermented by yeast-juice in presence of excess of phosphate , a period of accelerated fermentation occurs , during which two molecules of carbon dioxide are evolved and one molecule of hexosephosphate formed from two molecules of sugar added .
The ratio between sugar added and carbon dioxide evolved is determined by adding a known weight of sugar , together with an excess of sodium phosphate to yeast-juice at 25 ' .
The phenomena then observed are precisely similar to those which occur when a phosphate is added to a fermenting mixture of yeast-juice and excess of sugar , as previously described ( loc. cit.).j The rate of fermentation and then gradually falls until a rate is attained approximately equal to that of the auto-fermentation of the juice in presence of phosphate .
At this point it is found that the extra carbon dioxide evolved , beyond the amount which would have been given off in the absence of added sugar , is equivalent to only half the sugar according to the equation : CeHijjOg = 2C02+2C2H60 , * ' Roy .

but exactly equivalent to the sugar according to the authors ' equation ( 1 ) as given above .
Experiments 1 and 2.\#151 ; Two quantities of 25 c.c. of yeast-juice were incubated at 25 ' for 15 minutes .

To one was added 4 c.c. of a 0*6 molar solution of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate , saturated with carbon dioxide , and 1 c.c. of a solution containing 0'2 gramme of fructose \#166 ; ( pure from inulin ) .
The volumes of gas evolved in successive periods of 5 minutes were then read .
As soon as a steady rate had been attained , a second addition of 4 c.c. of potassium phosphate solution and 1 c.c. of fructose solution was made , and the volumes of gas evolved observed as before .

The second portion of yeast-juice was treated in the same way , except that 0 -2 gramme of pure glucose was substituted for the fructose .

Fermentation in Presence of Small Amounts of Phosphate .
Numerous attempts have been made to procure conclusive experimental evidence that alcoholic fermentation cannot take place in the absence of phosphates .
Hitherto , however , it has not been found possible to free the materials employed completely from phosphorus compounds which yield phosphates by enzymic hydrolysis during the experiment , but it has been found that when the phosphate contents are reduced to as low a limit as possible , the amount of sugar fermented becomes correspondingly small , and , 1910 .

325 further , that in these circumstances the addition of a small amount of phosphate produces a relatively large increase in the fermenting power of the enzyme .
It was previously shown that the addition of phosphate to a mixture of yeast-juice and a sugar not only caused the evolution of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide , but , in addition , produced an increase in the total fermentation amounting to from 10 to 150 per cent , of the original .
It now appears that when the total phosphorus present is largely reduced , the increase produced by the addition of a small amount of phosphate may amount to as much as 700 per cent , of the original , in addition to the quantity equivalent to the phosphate , whilst the actual total evolved , including thisequi valent , may be as much as twenty times the original fermentation .
This result must be regarded as strong evidence in favour of the view that phosphates are indispensable for alcoholic fermentation .
The results indicated above were experimentally obtained in three different ways .
In the first place ( Experiments 3 and 4 ) advantage was taken of the fact that the residues obtained by filtering yeast-juice through a Martin gelatin filter are sometimes found to be almost free from mineral phosphates , whilst they still contain a small amount of coferment .
The experiment then consists in comparing the fermentation produced by such a residue poor in phosphate with that observed when a small amount of phosphate is added .
The second method ( Experiment 5 ) consisted in carrying out two parallel fermentations by means of a residue rendered inactive by filtration and a solution of coferment free from phosphate and hexosephosphate ( prepared by a method shortly to be described ) and adding a small amount of phosphate to\gt ; one of the solutions .
The third method ( Experiment 6 ) consisted in washing zymin with water to remove soluble phosphates and then adding to it a solution of coferment containing only a small amount of phosphate , and ascertaining the effect upon the fermentation of the addition of a small known amount of phosphate .

Hydrolysis of Hexosephosphate by Yeast-juice with Production of Free Phosphate and a Fermentable Sugar .
( a ) Production of free phosphate and a reducing substance .
I t has previously been shown that free phosphate is produced by the action of the enzymes of yeast-juice on the hexosephosphate formed during fermentation.* According to equation ( 2 ) above , this phosphate should be accompanied by a sugar , and the following experiment shows that this is actually the case:\#151 ; Experiment 7.\#151 ; Potassium hexosephosphate was incubated with an inactive filtrationresidue , so that no fermentation of any liberated hexose could occur , and the amounts of free phosphate and reducing substance formed were determined , allowance being made for the quantities produced by the incubation of titer residue and of the hexosephosphate 5 grammes of an inactive filtration-residue were dissolved in water and made to 75 c.c. , and a solution of potassium hexosephosphate , free from glucose and free phosphate , and * Harden and Young , ' Roy .

325 containing phosphorus equivalent to 0*2352 gramme Mg2P20 7 in 25 c.c. , was prepared .
The following mixtures were then made and incubated at 25 ' in presence of toluene :\#151 ; ( 1 ) 25 c.c. residue+ 25 c.c. water . .

After 5 hours ' incubation the solutions were heated for 5 minutes in boiling water , made up to a known volume , and the phosphate and reducing power estimated in aliquot portions of the filtrate .
In order to ascertain the reducing power of the product , it was necessary to remove the unaltered hexosephosphate , and this was effected by precipitation with basic lead acetate , the estimation of the reducing power being made by means of Pavy 's ammoniacal copper solution .
In the following table the amounts of phosphate are expressed as grammes of Mg2P20 7 , and the reducing power as grammes of glucose in the quantities originally incubated .

( b ) Proof that the reducing substance is a sugar .
Experiment 8.\#151 ; 50 grammes of zymin ( Schroder ) were washed in the centrifuge four times with water , in order to remove as much as possible of the coferment and thus to diminish the fermenting power of the zymin , and the residue was made to 120 c.c. with water .
The following solutions were then incubated , Nos. 2 and 3 being added to ascertain the amount of sugar formed by the spontaneous hydrolysis of the hexosephosphate and from the carbohydrates of the zymin :\#151 ; 1 .
50 c.c. washed zymin suspension+ 55 c.c. of a solution of sodium hexosephospbate , equal to 19*9 c.c. normal solution , and equivalent if completely fermented to 223 c.c. of carbon dioxide at N.T.P. 2 .

At the end of 48 hours all three solutions were removed , filtered , and precipitated with lead acetate in neutral solution in order to remove all phosphate and unchanged hexosephosphate .
The excess of lead was then precipitated in the filtrates with sulphuretted hydrogen , and the filtrates , after removal of the sulphuretted hydrogen by a current of air , were neutralised and all made up to the same volume . !

Hence a sugar has been produced by the action of zymin freed from coferment on the hexosephosphate , which has the characteristic reactions of fructose , although the presence of other hexoses is not excluded .
A sugar of the same properties has already been shown to be formed when a hexosephosphate is hydrolysed by acids.* The decomposition products of hexosephosphate by enzymic and acid hydrolysis appear , therefore , to be the same .

6*6 l The carbon dioxide derived from the sugar produced by the enzymic hydrolysis of the hexosephosphate by the zymin is therefore equal to 77-5- ( 29-8+ 2-8 ) = 44*9 c.e. Hence the sugar formed by digesting hexosephosphate with zymin is readily fermentable by yeast .
( \lt ; d )Production of carbon dioxide from hexosephosphate by yeast-juice and zymin .
It follows from the facts recounted above , which are expressed in equation ( 2 ) at the commencement of the paper , that the products of the enzymic hydrolysis of the hexosephosphates should be fermented by yeastjuice .
Since , moreover , the enzyme producing this hydrolysis , which may be termed hexosephosphatase , is present in yeast-juice , the hexosephosphate itself when added to yeast-juice should undergo gradual hydrolysis and fermentation .
The whole of the phosphorus would then be liberated as free phosphate , and the carbohydrate residue would be converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide .
The following experiments show that hexosephosphate is actually fermented by yeast-juice with evolution of carbon dioxide and production of free phosphate:\#151 ; Experiment 10.\#151 ; Two quantities of 25 c.c. of yeast-juice were incubated at 25 ' in presence of toluene until a steady rate of auto-fermentation had been attained , ( a ) To one were added 15 c.c. of water ; ( 6 ) To the other were added 15 c.c. of a solution of sodium hexosephosphate containing phosphorus equivalent to 0*4673 gramme of Mg2P20 7 and therefore capable of yielding 94*3 c.c. of carbon dioxide .

46*8 at 19 ' and 762 mm. = 42*97 c.c. at N.T.P. Somewhat less than half the available carbon dioxide was therefore evolved .
In this case the auto-fermentation of the yeast-juice was a considerable traction of the total fermentation produced in presence of the hexose328 phosphate .
This introduces an uncertainty , as the additional phosphate constantly being formed in ( b ) might accelerate the auto-fermentation to such an extent as greatly to increase the total evolved .
In order to avoid this complication as far as possible , a second experiment was carried out with yeast-juice which was prepared from yeast previously kept in the pressed condition at 20 ' for 20 hours , the juice being then treated with living yeast for three hours before use in order to ferment away any free sugar .
In this way a juice of small auto-fermenting power was obtained .
Unfortunately the fermenting power of the juice towards sugar was also considerably lowered by this treatment .
Experiment 11.\#151 ; Yeast-juice , treated as described above , was employed , and two quantities were taken\#151 ; a. 30 c.c. of the juice+ 30 c.c. of a solution of potassium hexosephosphate , equivalent to 134'6 c.c. of carbon dioxide .
b. 30 c.c. of the juice+ 30 c.c. of water .
These mixtures were incubated in presence of toluene , and the gas evolved and phosphate formed were estimated .

The fact that hexosephosphate is fermented by zymin has been observed by Iwanoff , * and this observation has been confirmed by the authors .
I V. Nature of the Chemical Change involved in Alcoholic Fermentation .
The facts ( 1 ) that alcoholic fermentation occurs according to the equation : 2C6H120 6 + 2P04HK2 = 2COa+ 2C2H60 + 2H20 + C6H10O4(PO4R2)2 ) and ( 2 ) that the hexosephosphates produced from glucose , fructose , and mannose appear to be identicalf have an important bearing on the chemical interpretation of the decomposition by fermentation of the hexoses into carbon dioxide and alcohol .

329 the identity of the hexosephosphates from these three sugars may possibly be explained in either of two ways .
In the first place it is to be noted that these three sugars have a common enolic form , and the hexosephosphate may be a derivative of this .
In the second place , it is possible that the two molecules of sugar which are involved in the reaction , of which the equation is given above , may be decomposed into smaller groups , and that the hexosephosphate may be formed by a synthesis from these .
As the formation of the hexosephosphate is invariably accompanied by that of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide and alcohol , the second explanation appears the more probable , as it provides a source for the simultaneous production of these substances .
According to this view two molecules of the hexose , or possibly of the enolic form , are each decomposed primarily into two groups .
Of the four groups thus produced , two go to form alcohol and carbon dioxide , and the other two are synthesised to a new chain of six carbon atoms , which forms the carbohydrate residue of the hexosephosphate .
The introduction of the phosphoric acid groups may possibly occur before the rupture of the original molecules , and may even be the determining factor of this rupture , or , again , this introduction may take place during or after the formation of the new carbon chain .
Sufficient information is not yet available for the exact formulation of a scheme for this reaction .
Such a scheme , it may be noted , would not necessarily be inconsistent with the views of Wohl and Buchner as to the way in which the carbon chain of a hexose is broken in the process of fermentation , but would interpret differently the subsequent changes which are undergone by the simpler groups which are the result of this rupture .
It may , however , be pointed out that if the hexosephosphate be a derivative ' of the enolic form common to mannose , glucose , and fructose , the compound derived from galactose should be different .
If , , on the other hand , the hexosephosphate be derived from fractions of two hexose groups , the galactose compound might , or might not , be different from that derived from the other hexoses .
The enolic form of galactose differs from that of mannose , glucose , and fructose , in the symmetry of its 7-carbon atom , and the production of a hexosephosphate different from , or identical with , that derived from glucose , would depend on the preservation or destruction of the symmetry of this carbon atom in ' the reaction .
It appears , therefore , that a study of the behaviour of galactose towards phosphate in the presence of the yeast enzymes may have an important bearing on the question , and experiments on this subject are now in progress .
330 The Alcoholic Ferment o f .
Summary .
1 .
When glucose or fructose is added to yeast-juice in presence of excess of phosphate , a period of accelerated fermentation occurs , during which the added sugar undergoes the reaction : 2C6H120 6 + 2P04HR2 = 2C02 + 2C2H60 + 2H20 + C6H10O4(PO4R2)2 , one molecule of carbon dioxide being evolved for each molecule of sugar added .
2 .
When the available phosphate of a mixture of ferment , coferment , and sugar is greatly reduced , the total fermentation produced becomes very small .
The addition of a small amount of a phosphate to such a mixture produces a relatively large increase in the total fermentation , even after allowing for the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to the phosphate added .
3 .
A hexosephosphate when digested with yeast-juice is hydrolysed by an enzyme , hexosephosphatase , with production of free phosphate and a sugar which is capable of being fermented by yeast .
As the result of this hydrolytic action , the hexosephosphates , when treated with yeast-juice or zymin , are finally converted into carbon dioxide , alcohol , and free phosphate .
4 .
In discussing the chemical changes which the molecule of sugar may undergo in the process of fermentation , it is necessary to take into consideration the|fact that two molecules of sugar are involved in the reaction .
