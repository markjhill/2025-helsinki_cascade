[ October12 , 1909.\#151 ; " The iodine liberated in the experiments of Pesgrez and Nicloux on anaesthetised animals was due to some extent to the direct decomposition of the iodine pentoxide by the chloroform vapour contained in their blood gases , but mainly to the carbon monoxide produced by the action of this chloroform on the potash over which they passed the blood gases in order to free them from carbon dioxide .
This explanation is quite in accordance with their observations that the amount of iodine liberated increases with the duration of the anaesthesia .

The Ilexosephosphate formed by Yeast-juice from and Phosphate .
By W. J. Young ( Biochemical Laboratory of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine ) .
( Communicated by A. Harden , F.R.S. Received July 30 , 1909 .
) It has been shown by Harden and Young* that\#151 ; ( 1 ) the rate of fermentation of glucose by yeast-juice is greatly increased by the addition of a soluble phosphate ; ( 2 ) this rate soon diminishes until a constant rate is attained , which is only slightly greater than that of the original yeast-juice and glucose ; ( 3 ) during this period of increased fermentative activity , the phosphate undergoes some alteration , and at the end of the period is no longer present in a form precipitable by magnesium citrate mixture .
1 he authors suggested in the first paper that a combination of the phosphate with the sugar , to form a phosphoric acid ester , had taken place , and more recent lyt embodied this suggestion in the form of an equation\#151 ; 2C6H1206 + 2R'2HP04 = 2COs + 2C2H60 + CeHjofMPChR^a + 2H20 .
It has also been shown that the same phenomena occur when fructose or mannose is used in place of glucose .

] Yeast-juice from Hexosand Phosphate .
In a paper on the changes that take place in the phosphorus compounds of plants , etc. , * * * S Iwanoff stated that , during the fermentation of sugar by pressed yeast , the inorganic phosphates of the yeast are converted into organic compounds .
This observation , however , remained unknown to the author of the present paper until the publication of a later paper by Iwanoff , f in which he described the formation of a phosphoric acid compound during the fermentation of glucose or fructose in the presence of sodium phosphate by yeast which had been previously treated with acetone ( " zymin " ) .
By precipitating with copper acetate , decomposing with sulphuretted hydrogen and evaporating , he obtained the free acids , corresponding to these compounds , in the form of dark brown syrups , which when prepared from glucose contained 19'6 to :20 per cent. , and from fructose 13'4 to 14 per cent. , of phosphorus .
No other analyses were given in the paper .
These syrups gave the characteristic reactions of aldo- and keto-groups , and yielded osazones when heated with phenylhydrazine , that from the glucose compound melting at 142 ' , and that from the fructose compound at 125 ' .
Iwanoff concluded that these bodies were compounds of phosphoric acid either with a triose or with methylglyoxal , and that they were different according to the sugar from which they were derived .
At the time when Iwanoff 's paper appeared , a considerable amount of work had been done by the author on this reaction , and a preliminary note was published describing the isolation of the compound by means of its lead salt.* It was shown that this salt had the empirical formula CsHsC^PChPb ) , and when decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen yielded an acid which was slightly dextro-rotatory , and which , when the solution was boiled , underwent hydrolysis with formation of phosphoric acid and a laevorotatory reducing substance .
The present paper embodies the results of further work on this substance , and also on the similar compounds obtained by fermenting fructose and mannose in place of glucose .
No difference has been detected between the \#166 ; compounds obtained from these three sugars .
Preparation of the Lead Compound.\#151 ; A solution of 06 molar di-sodium or potassium hydrogen phosphate ( B'2HP04 ) was added to a mixture of yeast-juice and excess of glucose at 25 ' , in such an amount that rapid fermentation was set up .
The quantity of phosphate which may be used varies with different juices , S and the necessary amount was determined in each case in * 4 Travaux de la Soci6te des Naturalistes de St. Petersbourg , ' vol. 34 , 1905 .

Hexosephosp [ July 30 , a small sample by measuring the rate of evolution of carbon dioxide under similar conditions .
When the rate of fermentation had fallen , more phosphate was added , and the additions continued so long as this acceleration could be produced .
The mixture was then boiled , and filtered from the coagulate formed .
In a typical experiment , a mixture of 440 c.c. of yeast-juice and 55 grammes of glucose was employed , and 440 c.c. of the potassium phosphate solution ( 37 grammes , K2HP04 ) were added 80 c.c. at a time .
When fructose is used in place of glucose , much more phosphate may be added ; thus in one case a mixture of 495 c.c. of yeast-juice and 200 grammes of fructose was employed , and 1000 c.c. of the phosphate solution ( 104'4 grammes K2HP04 ) were added , 100 c.c. at a time .
The liquid , after boiling and filtering , was always found to contain a little free phosphate , and this was removed by adding a solution of magnesium nitrate , making alkaline with potash , stirring well , and allowing to stand for a few hours .
The filtered liquid was then neutralised with acetic acid , lead hexosephospliate precipitated by the addition of lead acetate , and washed repeatedly with water by means of a centrifugal machine , until the washings no longer reduced Fehling 's solution .
It was found that this precipitate invariably contained traces of some nitrogenous material , and it was therefore suspended in water , decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen , and the excess of this gas removed after filtering by passing a current of air through the solution .
The liquid was then neutralised with potash and the lead salt reprecipitated with lead acetate , the process being repeated until the precipitate , after washing , was free from nitrogen .
Usually two or three such precipitations were found sufficient .
The salt was then filtered off and dried , first on a porous plate and then in a vacuum over sulphuric acid .
It was thus obtained as a white , amorphous powder , free from nitrogen , which , on decomposing with sulphuretted hydrogen , yielded an acid solution containing no free phosphate precipitable by magnesium citrate mixture .
The preparation of yeast sold .
under the name of " zymin , " which is obtained by treating pressed brewers ' yeast with acetone , may be used in place of yeast-juice for the preparation of hexosephosphate .
In one experiment 10 grammes of zymin , 10 grammes of glucose , and 100 c.c. of water were incubated at 25 ' , and 75 c.c. of a 0'3 molar solution of potassium phosphate added , 15 c.c. at a time .
After rapid fermentation had ceased the mixture was filtered without boiling , and the lead compound obtained from the filtrate as before .
Lead compounds have been prepared from glucose , fructose , and mannose , and the analyses of several different preparations of these compounds are- 1909 .

Hexosephosphate formed by [ July 30 , tures in a vacuum over sulphuric acid , decomposition occurred and free phosphoric acid was formed .
The solution was found to give Mohlisch 's a-naphthol reaction .
It reduced Fehling 's solution only after some hours in the cold , rapidly on boiling : this reduction may be due to the hydrolysis of the compound with formation of a reducing hexose .
This is known to take place , as an alkaline solution of the sodium salt that had been left standing for two or three days at room temperature was found to contain free phosphate , and a lsevorotatory substance which reduced Fehling 's solution in the cold in a few minutes .
The same change was brought about more rapidly when the solution was boiled .
The acid was found to have a less reducing power when boiled with Pavy 's annnoniacal copper solution than corresponded to an equivalent quantity of glucose .
Thus five preparations from glucose gave reductions of 0754 , 0788 , 0*767 , 0732 , and 0800 , an equivalent quantity of glucose being taken as 1 .
No osazone could be obtained , as on heating with phenylhydrazine acetate decomposition took place , and phenylhydrazine phosphate was formed .
Attempts were also made to prepare insoluble hydrazones or osazones with phenylhydrazine , methylphenylhydrazine , benzylphenyl-hydrazine , parabromophenylhydrazine , and nitrophenylhydrazine , but in no case was any success attained .
No differences could be detected between the acids obtained from glucose , fructose , or mannose .
They all yielded the same products on hydrolysis , formed salts having the same properties , and had approximately the same dextro-rotatory power .

All these acids were prepared from the lead salts with sulphuretted hydrogen , excepting No. 13 which was obtained from the barium salt by means of dilute sulphuric acid .
No. 16 was obtained from yeast-juice to which neither sugar nor phosphate had been added , whilst zymin was employed for the preparation of Nos. 6 and 11 .
It will be observed that the differences between the values for the acids derived from fructose and mannose are of the same order as the differences among the glucose preparations themselves .
With so low a rotatory power a small experimental error or a trace of optically active impurity would cause an appreciable difference in the \#171 ; d , and the differences seen in the table are probably due to these causes .
The rotations of the barium salts of these acids , which are slightly soluble in cold water , were also determined , and were found to be approximately equal .

Hexosepho formed [ July 30 , and the reduction as the number of grammes of glucose to which it corresponded .
The original solution contained 07167 gramme of the acid in 200 c.c. ( approximately OOl molar ) , corresponding when completely hydrolysed to 0-511 gramme of magnesium pyrophosphate , and equivalent to 0-414 gramme of glucose .
Samples were taken out after the intervals stated , and the free phosphate estimated with magnesium citrate mixture and the reducing power with Pavy 's solution .
The solution after about seven hours ' boiling became very dark coloured , some of the reducing substance formed evidently being decomposed .
The acids obtained from fructose and mannose behaved in a similar-manner on boiling , in every case a laevorotatory substance and phosphoric acid were formed .

Preparations of the lead salt were therefore made without removing the free phosphate , the solution being kept always slightly acid , but the method being otherwise the same as before .
The hexosephosphoric acids obtained from these acid preparations were found to have approximately the same specific rotatory power as the others .
The strength of the solution used was estimated by determining the total phosphorus , and making allowance for the small quantity of free phosphoric acid , which was precipitated in 1909 .

After filtration , the solution was evaporated at 35 ' to 40 ' under reduced pressure to a thick syrup .
This was found to reduce Fehling 's solution in the cold , and to be lsevorotatory .
It gave the red coloration characteristic of fructose when heated with resorcinol and hydrochloric acid ( Seliwanoff ) .
When this syrup was treated at 0 ' with milk of lime , an insoluble calcium compound similar to calcium fructosate was formed .
This was filtered off , washed with water , suspended in water , and decomposed with carbon dioxide , and the filtered liquid treated with animal charcoal and evaporated under reduced pressure .
The colourless syrup thus obtained reduced an alkaline solution of copper glycocolate after 12 hours in the cold , a reaction which , according to Pieraerts , * is only given by fructose .

Hexosephos jormed by [ July 30 , with glucosazone melted at 206 ' to 207 ' .
The analysis also corresponded to that of glucosazone\#151 ; 0T222 gramme gave 16-2 c.c. nitrogen at 16'*4 and 774*3 mm. N = 15*76 per cent. Glucosazone , C18H22O4N4 , requires 1ST = 15*64 per cent. The fructose and mannose acids , when treated as above , yielded syrups having the same properties as that from the glucose acid ; in both eases glucosazone was obtained from them .
All these syrups were found to induce rapid fermentation in a mixture of yeast-juice and glucose with such an excess of phosphate that fermentation was only proceeding at a very slow rate , and this induction has been shown to be brought about by the addition of fructose , but not of glucose or mannose.* Finally , the ratio of the rotation to the reducing power was obtained and was found to be approximately the same as that found for pure fructose .
The reducing power was determined by means of Pavy 's ammoniacal copper solution and , as this was standardised , each time it was used , with a solution of pure glucose it has been found convenient to express the reduction per 100 c.c. of solution by the number of grammes of glucose which would reduce the same amount of copper , and to compare the rotation of the solution in a 4-dm .

537 power than a solution of fructose having the same optical activity .
The ratio of the rotation to the reduction was always lower than that for pure fructose , and varied from T36 to 2*78 .
This might be accounted for by the presence of glucose or mannose , and experiments were made to ascertain if these sugars were present ; in no case , however , could either be detected .
The insoluble hydrazone of mannose was not obtained with phenylhydrazine , nor was a hydrazone formed when the syrup was treated with methyl-phenylhydrazine in the manner described by Neuberg* for the separation of glucose or mannose from fructose .
They were also examined for glucose by the method by which Lobry de Bruyn and van Ekensteinf detected glucose in the mixtures obtained by the action of alkalis on fructose or mannose .
This consisted in removing most of the fructose by precipitating as calcium fructosate or by extracting successively with alcohol , ethyl acetate , ether , and acetone , and identifying glucose in the residue either by converting into a-methyl glucoside by means of methyl alcoholic hydrochloric acid , or by oxidising with dilute nitric acid and precipitating the acid potassium salt of the saccharic acid formed .
Neither of these compounds could be obtained from the syrups under examination .
In order to ascertain whether these low ratios were due to the action of the phosphoric acid on the fructose after it was set free , a mixture of these compounds in the same relative proportions as would be contained in hexosephosphoric acid was boiled for some hours , and the phosphoric acid then removed by means of barium hydrate and alcohol in a similar manner to that described for the hydrolysed acid .

Hexosephos formed by [ July 30 , is much more susceptible to the action of phosphoric acid .
On the other hand , these low ratios may be due to the presence of some other reducing substances having a less lsevorotatory power than fructose .
Salts of Hexosephospho Acid .
In addition to the lead salt already described , several other salts have been prepared .
Attempts to obtain the potassium and sodium salts were made by adding the hydrates to the acid solution until neutral to phenolphthalein , and evaporating the solution under reduced pressure .
A sticky mass was left which would not crystallise , and which decomposed on keeping .
Solutions of the alkali salts slowly decomposed on keeping , free phosphate being formed and the solution becoming lsevorotatory .
This decomposition causes a small error in the estimation of the free phosphate present in a mixture of this salt and hexosephosphate by means of magnesium citrate mixture .
Many of the salts are more soluble in cold than in hot water .
thus , when magnesium citrate is added to a solution of sodium hexosephosphate , no precipitate is formed until the mixture is heated ; a white precipitate then comes down , which redissolves on cooling .
The manganese , barium , and calcium salts behave in a similar manner .
Silver Hexosephosphate , C6 HioO^PChAga^.\#151 ; This salt was obtained by neutralising the free acid with caustic soda , adding the calculated quantity of silver nitrate and then half the total volume of alcohol .
The precipitate was filtered off , well washed with a mixture of water and alcohol , dehydrated with alcohol and ether , and dried over sulphuric acid in a vacuum , and it was thus obtained as a white amorphous powder .
It was exceedingly unstable , and the whole preparation was carried out by red light .
Even when dry the salt darkened on exposure to light , whilst when heated with water it was at once reduced to metallic silver .

Source of the Hcxosephosphate.\#151 ; In order to show that this compound was formed from the added phosphate , two quantities of 50 c.c. of yeast-juice were incubated at 25 ' , one with 30 c.c. of a 30-per-cent , solution of glucose and the other with 30 c.c. of a 0*3 molar solution of potassium phosphate containing 30 per cent , glucose .
After two hours both were boiled and filtered , 30 c.c. of each filtrate were treated with the same quantity of magnesium nitrate and potash to remove any free phosphate and , after 540 Mr. W. J. Young .
Hexosephos formed by [ July 30 , standing for a few hours , the solutions were filtered , neutralised with acetic acid and lead hexosephosphate precipitated with lead acetate , washed and dried over sulphuric acid in a vacuum .
The mixture to which the phosphate had been added gave 5'03 grammes of lead salt , whilst the other only yielded 1*35 grammes .
This experiment also shows that yeast-juice itself contains a small quantity of hexosephosphate , and experiments have already been quoted to show that this compound has similar properties to that formed when phosphate and sugar are added .
The same hexosephosphate was obtained by means of zymin in place of yeast-juice as already mentioned , and as in this case the mixture was not boiled before the precipitation of the lead salt , it follows that the salts of this acid were present in the mixture as such , and were not formed from a more complex body by the boiling , which was always necessary when yeast-juice was employed .
A hexosephosphate has also been detected in the extract obtained by boiling pressed brewers ' yeast with water .
Molecular Weight of Hexosepliosphoric Acid.\#151 ; The analyses of the salts of this acid gave no information as to its molecular weight , since the same percentage composition would be obtained if the acid had the formula C3H502(P04H2 ) and not ( AHioO^PChHsV The first compound might be expected on hydrolysis to yield glyceraldehyde or dioxyacetone , and these might polymerise to form hexoses ; so that the fact that fructose was formed when the acid was hydrolysed does not do away with the possibility of the smaller formula .
As no derivatives of the acid could be obtained , such as a hydrazone or an osazone , analysis of which would have settled the question , recourse was made to physical methods .
The molecular weight of the acid was calculated from the difference between the freezing point of its solution and that of water , and was compared with that calculated by taking into consideration the extent to which it was dissociated in solution as determined by the rate at which it hydrolysed cane sugar .
The freezing points of three solutions of different concentrations of the acid prepared from glucose was found by the ordinary method , the amount of acid in solution was estimated by titration and checked by the total phosphorus content , and the weight of water in the solution was obtained from the specific gravity .
By way.of comparison with a compound of known constitution and of a similar nature , corresponding determinations were carried out with a sample of synthetical glycero-phosphoric acid , which was purified by means of its lead salt in exactly the same manner as the liexosephosphoric acid .
The results are given in Table XII , Nos. 1 , 2 , and 3 being those obtained from the hexosephosphoric acid , and Nos. 4 and 5 from two concentrations of glycerophosphoric acid .

It follows from these rates that the ratio of hydrogen ions in the solution of hexosephosphoric acid to those in the hydrochloric acid was 3-981 to 22-466 or 17*7 to 100 , whilst in the case of glycerophosphoric acid the ratio was 3'353 to 22*466 = 14'9 to 100 .
As hydrochloric acid is almost completely dissociated , these numbers may be taken as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solutions .
Glycerophosphoric acid is dibasic and a solution which is semi-normal by titration will contain only half as many molecules as a semi-normal solution of hydrochloric acid , or 50 molecules for every 100 of hydrochloric acid .
If the glycerophosphoric acid be assumed to dissociate into two ions , then out of every 50 molecules 14-9 are dissociated into 14-9 x 2 = 29'8 ions , and 50 \#151 ; 14-9 = 35-1 molecules remain undissociated .
The solution will thus contain 29*8 + 35*1 = 64*9 units , and the freezing point depression will correspond to a molecular weight of x 172 = 132-5 ; thoseactually observed gave 135*5 and 127"7 .
Similarly with the hexosephosphoric acid , if the larger formula obtain , the acid is tetrabasic and a semi-normal solution will only contain one-quarter as many molecules as a semi-normal solution of hydrochloric acid , or 25 molecules to every 100 of hydrochloric acid .
If the dissociation take place into two ions , of these 25 molecules 17*7 are dissociated into 17'7 x 2 = 35"4 ions , 25 \#151 ; 17*7 = 7*3 molecules remain undissociated , and the total number of units will be 7*3+ 35*4 = 42-7 .
The molecular weight of the acid from the freezing point of this solution will be- = 190 : the'observed values were 177 , 178 , and 169-4 .

543 If , on the other hand , the compound have the smaller formula , with a molecular weight of 170 , it will be a dibasic acid and the solution will contain 50 molecules to every 100 contained in a solution of hydrochloric acid of similar normality .
The number of dissociated molecules corresponding to the hydrogen ions present will be 17'7 , yielding 17*7 x 2 = 35*4 ions , 50 \#151 ; 17*7 = 32*3 will be undissociated , and the total number of units will be 35*4+32*3 = 67*7 .
The molecular weight , as deduced from the freezing point , would therefore be = 125*5 .
67*7 The observed depression thus corresponds more closely to that which would be expected from the larger formula , although the agreement is not so good as that in the case of glycerophosphoric acid .
This low result may be due to some hydrolysis in the solution , which would make the number of units still greater .
If the hexosephosphoric acid had the smaller formula , it would be expected to depress the freezing point at least to the same extent as glycerophosphoric acid , since it only differs from this by two hydrogen atoms , and is slightly more dissociated in solution than this acid .
These results thus point to the acid having the formula C^HioO^PChH^Further evidence against the acid being a derivative of glyceraldehyde is also afforded by the following factsWhen the acid was reduced with sodium amalgam , no glycerol was obtained , as might have been expected if it were a compound of glyceraldehyde .
When glycerophosphoric acid was heated with hydriodic acid in a current of carbon dioxide , it was reduced to isopropyl iodide , which was detected by passing into alcoholic silver nitrate in the manner in which glycerol is estimated by the method of Zeisel and Fanto .
On the other hand , hexosephosphoric acid gave no volatile iodide when treated in this manner .
Constitution of Hexosephosphoric Acid.\#151 ; It has not yet been found possible to obtain any evidence with regard to the position of the phosphoric acid groups in the molecule .
The facts that the compound does not reduce Fehling 's solution in the cold until after a long time , and that no hydrazones or osazones could be obtained , render it possible that the acid does not contain an active carbonyl group , and it may be that this group is involved in the reaction with the phosphoric acid .
Glucose , fructose , and mannose all appear to yield the same hexosephosphoric acid when fermented by veast-juice in the presence of phosphate .
One explanation of this is that these sugars are changed , before conversion into hexosephosphate , into some form common to all three .
The only differences between glucose , fructose , and mannose are in the groups or arrangement of the groups attached to the first two carbon atoms : 544 Hexosephosphate formed by Yeast-juice from etc. CHO CHO CH2OH | HCOH | OHCH CO OHCH OHCH OHCH | H-C-OH HCOH H-C-OH | HCOH HCOH H-C-OH j CH2OH CH2OH CH2OH Glucose .

and are converted into one another in alkaline solution , * and it is conceivable that the hexosephosphate is a derivative of this enolic form .
If the reaction take place according to the equation : 2C6H120(3 + 2R,2HP04 = 2CO2+2C2H6O + C6H10O4(PO4R'2)2 + 2H2O , two molecules of sugar are concerned , and another possibility is that the phosphoric acid groups are attached to a new molecule , which is formed by the combination of portions of each of these two sugar molecules .
In this case , also , the hexosephosphoric acid might be expected to have the same composition when formed from different sugars .
Summary.\#151 ; 1 .
The compound formed during the accelerated fermentation of glucose , fructose , and mannose by yeast-juice , in the presence of a soluble phosphate , is a salt of an acid which probably has the formula C6Hi0O4(PO4H2)2 , and may be isolated by precipitation of its lead salt .
2 .
The free acid may be obtained in solution by decomposing this lead salt with sulphuretted hydrogen .
3 .
The acid is very unstable and readily decomposes on keeping , or on evaporating even at ordinary temperatures in a vacuum over sulphuric acid , with formation of a reducing substance and phosphoric acid .
4 .
It reduces Fehling 's solution only after some hours in the cold , rapidly on boiling , whilst no osazones or hydrazones have been obtained from it .

No differences have been detected between the hexosephosphoric acids or their salts , whether derived from glucose , fructose , or mannose .
6 .
On hydrolysis of the acid by boiling , phosphoric acid is set free and fructose formed .
No other hexose could be identified , but the solution , after hydrolysis , was always less leevorotatory than a solution of pure fructose of the same reducing power .

[ The compound containing phosphorus , which was considered to be phenyl-hydrazine phosphate , has since been examined by von Lebedew ( ' Biochem. Zeits .

A re-examination of this substance by the author leads to the conclusion that it is in reality a derivative of hexosephosphoric acid , but decisive results as to its constitution have not yet been obtained.\#151 ; November 15 , 1909 .

Method.\#151 ; The two sartorius muscles of a frog are dissected out and the portions of bone to which they are attached are ligatured with fine copper wires serving as conductors .
The muscles are set up in the two vessels ' V , Y and connected with two myographic levers that record their movements on two smoked plates L , R. The connections with the secondary coil of an inductorium ( Berne model ) are as given in the diagram , so that both muscles are traversed in series by the same current in the same direction .
The muscles are directly excited once every 10 seconds by maximal break induction shocks .
