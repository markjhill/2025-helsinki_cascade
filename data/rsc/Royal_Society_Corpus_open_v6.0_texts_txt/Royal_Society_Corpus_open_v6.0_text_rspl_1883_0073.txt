The author remarks that the first indication of since restored species , e.g. , of the as a large extinct Marsupial , was a portion of a tooth , and corresponding accessions of fossil remains may be expected to lead to a like reconstruction of the present animal .
He is indebted to E. P. Ramsay , Esq. , F.L.S. , for casts of the first found specimens of the teeth in question to which the transmitter had appended the name ; subsequently the author received , through the kindness of 0 .
H. Hartman , Esq. , of Toonromba , Queensland , a large portion of the tooth itself .

" Evidence of a Large Extinct Monotreme ( Ramsayi , Ow .
) from the Wellington Breccia Cave , New South Wales .
' ' By Professor Owen , C.B. , F.R.S. Received November 3 , 1883 .
( Abstract .
) In this communication the author gives a description of a fossil humerus from the breccia cave of Wellington Valley , which repeats the characters of that bone in the existing monotrematous genus Echidna more closely than those of the same bone in any other known kind of mammal .
The fossil , however , greatly exceeds in size that of the existing Australian species , Echidna hystrix , Cuv .
The existence of , at least , two other kinds lately discovered living in New Guinea has been made known in memoirs by Professor Gervais and Mr. E. P. Ramsay , E.L.S. ; these occupy , in respect of size , the interval between them and the Australian Each .
, but the subject of the present paper makes known the largest Monotreme hitherto discovered .
Figures of the fossil in question , and of the corresponding bone of the smaller existing Australian kind , accompany the text .
The fossil formed part of the series of remains obtained from the cave above cited , and was with them submitted to the author , who proposes to indicate the present acquisition by the name Echidna Ramsayi .
