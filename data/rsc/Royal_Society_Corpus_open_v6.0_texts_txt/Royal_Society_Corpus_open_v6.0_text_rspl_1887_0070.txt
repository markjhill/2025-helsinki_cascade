( Abstract .
) The gases considered are iodine , bromine , chlorine , and nitrogen tetroxide .
The effects of the spark on iodine and bromine were investigated in two ways .
In the first method the iodine was placed in a tube from which the air had been exhausted , and which was furnished with a gauge which served to measure the changes of pressure in the tube .
The liquid in the manometer wras sulphuric acid , and in order to avoid any disturbance due to the absorption of 344 Dissociation of Gases by the Electric Discharge .
[ May 26 the iodine vapour by this substance , the discharge tube was doubled so that the iodine vapour was symmetrically placed with reference to the sulphuric acid .
The system was then placed in an oil-bath and maintained at a temperature which varied in different experiments from about 200 ' to 280 ' .
On sparking through such a tube with an induction coil giving a spark about 3 inches long in air , the pressure rapidly increases at first , but the rate of increase gradually diminishes and the pressure finally becomes steady .
On stopping the coil by far the greater part of this increase is permanent , or at any rate lasts for several hours .
It is not due to the decomposition of the vapour from the sulphuric acid in the gauge , for it does not occur if there is no iodine in the gauge , or if the iodine is replaced by bromine .
This increase of pressure can be produced by the silent discharge as well as by ordinary sparking .
In order to simplify the conditions as much as possible , I had an arrangement made by which instead of determining the increase of pressure by the sulphuric acid gauge , the vapour density of the iodine after sparking could be measured .
In this arrangement the iodine was never near any sulphuric acid .
The result of these determinations is shown in the following table , and it is seen that the results confirm those obtained by the first method .

86 In the last experiment the vapour-density was determined 24 hours after the sparking .
These figures point to very considerable dissociation of the iodine , in fact the dissociation produced by the spark at 214 ' is as much as that produced by Victor Meyer at the temperature 1570 ' C. The appearance of the dissociated iodine is not greatly different from that of the unsparked , its colour , however , is I think a little lighter and not so uniform .
I was not able to detect any change in the absorption spectrum produced by the sparking .
The electric strength of the sparked gas was however less than that of the unsparked .

Bromine .
Wlien the experiment with the pressure gauge is made with bromine instead of iodine , it is found that there is a considerable increase of pressure produced by the passage of the spark , but that this disappears almost as soon as the sparking , and on determining the vapour-density of the spai'ked and unsparked bromine it is found that they are identical .
It seems most probable that the difference between bromine and iodine is not that the bromine is not dissociated by the spark , but that the atoms combine very much more quickly than the iodine atoms .
The vapour-density determinations showed that bromine vapour is dissociated if it is heated for a long time at a low pressure , even though the temperature is not very high .
The results of these determinations are given in the following table :\#151 ; Pressure .

165 90 77 Only a short time in bath .
390 111 70 In bath for 7 hours .
These experiments show that it takes a long time for bromine to reach a state of equilibrium , and that for the experiments on the vapour-density , the gas should be maintained at a constant temperature for some time before the experiments are made .
Experiments on chlorine and nitrogen tetroxide are also described in the paper .
