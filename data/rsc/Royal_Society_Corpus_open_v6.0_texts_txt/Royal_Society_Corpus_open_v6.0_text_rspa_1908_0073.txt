[ June 25 , it was at once charged , as in Experiment 9 .
The same was the case when solid silica was employed , but hardly any luminosity appeared .

All these experiments were repeated with glass glow-bulbs , but the effects were minute in comparison with those produced when silica was used , and it was found that considerable leakage back of a charge took place when glass was used .

An electrical machine is now being constructed by me , in which silica and mercury will be used on a far larger scale than in the experiments described in this paper .
I wish to thank Mr. H. G. Lacell , of the Silica Syndicate , for the great care with which the glow-bulbs have been prepared under his supervision .
On the Atomic Weight of Chlorine .

) ( Abstract .
) Six years ago Professor Dixon and I began a research with the object of determining directly the weight of chlorine which combines with the unit weight of hydrogen .
Our method was to burn a jet of hydrogen in an atmosphere of chlorine ; hydrogen being stored and weighed in palladium , the chlorine being condensed and weighed as liquid .
The number we obtained for the combining weight of chlorine was appreciably higher than that found indirectly by Stas , and still higher than that approved by the International Committee on Atomic Weights .
While this research was in progress , other determinations had been made bearing on the relative weights of silver , chlorine , and nitrogen , so that some modification in the accepted values of one or more of these elements appeared inevitable .
The direct " joining up " of the two ends of the chain connecting hydrogen with chlorine thus became a matter of immediate importance .
Since the method of burning one gas in an atmosphere of the other had been proved to be accurate within fairly narrow limits , I was encouraged to continue the investigation , and to modify the apparatus , with a view to 1908 .
] On the Atomic Weight of Chlorine .
217 -eliminate some of the possible sources of error in the former series of experiments .
The most important source of error lies in the weighing of the hydrogen .
To diminish this error the weight of hydrogen employed was doubled ; and since Professor Dixon and I found , when water was used to condense the hydrogen chloride formed in the flame , that some of the water vapour was decomposed by the free chlorine , I avoided#this by burning a jet of chlorine in dry hydrogen , condensing the hydrogen chloride as it was formed in a tube dipped into liquid air .
In some of the experiments the hydrogen chloride formed has been weighed .
My experiments ( concluded in 1907 ) agree closely with the results previously obtained in 1905 .
The method \#166 ; employed was briefly as follows:\#151 ; Hydrogen , made by the electrolysis of barium hydrate solution , and dried by potash and phosphorous pentoxide , was occluded , and weighed in palladium contained in a boro-silicate glass bulb .
The chlorine , prepared by electrolysing fused silver chloride in a Jena glass vessel , was weighed as a liquid in a thick-walled boro-silicate glass bulb .
Two ground joints attached these bulbs to a quartz combustion vessel , which was also connected with a vertical quartz tube , and with a steel bomb and-a pump .
After a thorough evacuation of the whole apparatus , the vertical limb of the combustion vessel was immersed in liquid air .
Then the vacuous vessel was filled with hydrogen from the heated palladium bulb .
Chlorine was ignited by a spark at the tip of a quartz jet , and continued to burn in the atmosphere of hydrogen with a fine needle-shaped flame .
The endeavour was made so to regulate the gases as to maintain the flame until nearly all the chlorine weighed had been burnt .
Then the supply of hydrogen was cut off .
As the atmosphere became more attenuated the flame died away until , just before it went out , the chlorine was turned off .
The hydrogen chloride , immediately after it was formed in the flame , was condensed as a snow-white solid by the liquid air surrounding the vertical limb of the combustion vessel ; and a little chlorine , which had escaped burning , was also solidified .
At the end of the combustion , the residual gas was extracted by the pump and analysed ; it proved to be practically pure hydrogen .
Then the snow-white hydrogen chloride was allowed to evaporate .
By passing the gas through a quartz tube filled with mercury vapour , the chlorine it contained was completely removed and the purified hydrogen chloride passed on to a steel bomb immersed in liquid air , where it was condensed in six experiments and successfully weighed in three ; in the other three the bomb leaked .
In two other experiments the gas was absorbed by water and weighed as aqueous acid .
The weights of hydrogen and chlorine burnt were On the Atomic Weight of Chlorine .
obtained by subtracting from the total weight of each used the weight of hydrogen extracted by the pump and the weight of chlorine caught by mercury vapour respectively .
The balance was specially made for this work by Oertling ; even under the load of the steel bomb , weighing over 1000 grammes , it gave very reliable readings .
Each piece of apparatus weighed was tared with another of the same material and of very nearly equal volume and weight , and the small weights used in the weighings were reduced to a vacuum standard .
Below are set out the corrected weights of hydrogen and chlorine burnt in eight experiments , and the weights of hydrogen chloride caught in five :\#151 ; !

Dixon and Edgar , burning hydrogen in chlorine , found the equivalent of chlorine to be 35-463 + 0-0019 from their nine experiments .
The concordance of the two sets of experiments is thus exceedingly close , and the number 35'462 may be taken as representing the result of the whole work .
On the other hand Noyes and Weber , * by passing a known weight of hydrogen over weighed potassium chlorplatinate , noting the loss in weight of the salt , and condensing and weighing in water the hydrogen chloride formed , have recently obtained for the atomic weight of chlorine the mean number 35-452 + 0-0008 ( H = T00762 ) .
In view of the promised recalculation of the atomic weights by the International Committee this year , I have not attempted to correlate my results with the recent determinations of silver , nitrogen , and chlorine .
