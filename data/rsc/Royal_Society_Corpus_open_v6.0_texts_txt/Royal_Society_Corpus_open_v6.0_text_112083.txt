" On the Action of Chloride of Iodine up)ll Organic Bodies .

In a former communlicationi *I stated to the Society that chloride of iodine combines directly with ethylenie and propylene gases .
I have sinee ascertained that it also directly combines with those radicals which are at the same time both monoanid tri-atomic .
Iodide of allyle and bromide of aldehydene , having , the desired atomicity , were the bodies I selected for my experiments .
Action of Chloride of Iodine on Iodide of Allyle .
In order to determine the unionl of these bodies , it was simply necessary to mix and agitate them .
The chloride of iodine uised was in the form of a watery solution .
During the agitation the mixture became warm , and assumed a dark colotur froym the liberation of iodine .
To complete the reaction , it was gently heated over the lamp for a short time .
By these means a dark oily liquid was obtained , which was separated from the excess of chloride of iodine , washed with dilute potash , then with pure water , and distilled .
Almost the entire li14uid passed over between 1900 and 215 ' Cenit .
The fraction distilling betweeni 205 and 210 being very considerable in quantity , was collected sepaaratelv and analyzed , having been previotusly decolorized by agitation wi ith mer cuty .
The numbers obtained correspond suifficienitly well with the formula C0 115 Cl9 I , as will be seem from the followiig Tfstble Thieory .

239 00 100 00 The excess of carboni is accounted for by the slight decornposition su'ffered by the liquid during distillation , which was evidenced by thC libelration of iodine .
This body I propose to call iodo-bichlor-allyle .
It is a colourless oil , is insoluble in water , an(l has a sweet and biting taste .
The following equation will explain the reaction which genierates this body ; it is a case of addition and double decompositioni , C6 IHI I+2C -IC( ; II Cl , CI+I I. One equivalent of chloride of iodine converts , by douible decomposition , the iodide into the chloride of allyle ; and with this the other equivalenlt then directly combines .
Action of Chloride of Iodine on Bromide of Aldehydene.-A mixture of 1 volume of bromide of aldehydene and 2 voltumes of chloride of iodine was exposed in a sealed tube to the temperature of 1000 Cent. for about two hours .
The tube was then opened , the excess of chloride of iodine removed , and the dark-coloured oil which was formed washed with dilute potash and distilled .
The entire liquid passed over between 1750 and 2000 Cent. , suffering at the same time slight decomposition with liberation of iodine .
The portion distilling between 190 ?
and 200( was collected apart , deprived of free iodinie by agitation with mercury , and analyzed .
The numbers obh tained approach sufficiently near the formuila C0 H13 Br Cl I to leave no doubt as to its being the true one : Theory .

91 00 I. 127-0 J 269-5 100 00 This body I suppose I must call iodo-chlor-brom-aldehydene .
It is a colourless oil , is insoluble in water , and , like the former body , has a sweet and biting taste .
It is formed by the direct addition of one atom of chloride of iodine to one atom of bromide of aldehydene .
I have also tried the action of chloride of iodine on cyanide of allyle , in the expectation of forming the body C6 H1 Cy Cl I , and from this , by the action of potash , the acid C8 H11 0 ? .
My expectations , however , were not realized .
On heating these substances together as in the former cases , all the iodine of the chloride of iodine was set free ; and I obtained on evaporating the liquor , instead of ain oil , a mixture of chloride of ammonium and an organic acid , probably crotonic .
The solution of chloride of iodine employed in these and my former experiments on ethylene and propylene gases , was made by conducting a stream of chlorine into 1600 grains of water holding in suspension 700 grains of iodine .
The mixture was kept cold and agitated repeatedly during the passage of the gas , which was interrupted when all the iodine , with the exception of a trace , had been dissolved .
It is highly probable that bromide of acetylene ( C , H , Br2 ) and similar non-saturated bodies may be also made to combine directly with chloride of iodine .
