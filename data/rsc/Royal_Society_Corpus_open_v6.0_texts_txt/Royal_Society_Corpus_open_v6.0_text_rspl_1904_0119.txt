The methods hitherto employed for propelling a current through very high resistance have involved the use either of a very large static inductive machine , such as that of Wimshurst and others , or a battery of a very large number of cells , as employed by De la Rue , Trowbridge , , etc. The author finds that by the use of high-tension mercury-rectifiers the same result can be attained with ordinary sources of supply , e.g^ by transforming and utilising the current from any steady or alternating main .
In particular the use of rectifiers enables a high-tension intermittent or jerky current , such as that from a Ruhmkorff coil , to be trapped , and the supply stored in a couple of reservoirs , all the positive pulses in one , all the negative in another , whence they can be continuously discharged through any high resistance .
The author proposes to exhibit the effect at a forthcoming soiree. .
The arrangement was originally designed for the purpose of discharging large quantities of electricity into the air for the purpose of coagulating : mist and fog .
