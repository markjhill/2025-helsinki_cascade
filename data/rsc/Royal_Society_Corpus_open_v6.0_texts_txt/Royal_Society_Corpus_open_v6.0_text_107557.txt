On the Errors in Longitude as determined by Chronometers at Sea , arising from the atlion of the iron in the ships upon the Chronometers .
By GEORGE FISHER , Esq. Commnunicated by JOHN BARROW , Esq. F. R. S. Read June 8 , 1820 .
TH E determination of the longitude at sea by timekeepers , is so exceedingly easy from the simplicity of the observations and calculations employed , and from the general practicability of the method , as to render chronometers , in the present improved state of navigation , almost indispensable articles in the equipment of ships for foreign service ; and I shall feel happy if the following observations may , in any way , contribute to the more accurate determination of the longitude by this method .
The sudden alteration in the rates of chronometers when taken on board of ships , has been frequently observed by intelligent seamen ; and is generally ascribed to the motion of the vessels .
Before , however , I attempt to account for this alteration , I shall first prove that it actually takes place ; and , in order to do this , shall relate the circumstances connected with the chronometers on board the Dorothea and Trent , commanded by Captain BUCHAN , which occurred during the late voyage to the North Pole .
Soon after the arrival of the ships on the coast of Spitzbergen , the chronometers on board the Dorothea ( five in number ) were found to be rapidly gaining on their former rates as determined in London previous to the ship 's sailing ; in consequence of which the land appeared considerably to the westward of its true position as determined by lunar observation , and they were found to be still gaining daily , which appeared not only from each subsequent set of lunars , but also by comparing the longitude of different points of land determined by the chronometers , with the longitude of the same points ascertained in the same way some time afterwards .
For instance ; the longitude of a remarkable point of land on the north-west coast of Spitzbergen , called Cloven Cliff , was found by a mean of the observations taken with the chronometers on June 2 1,.1818 , to be lo0 35 ' 27 " E ; but the longitude of the same point of land on July 31 , was lo ?
15 ' 37 " E , making a difference of no less than about 20 ' of longitude in five weeks ; that is , estimating the longitude with the same rates and errors as determined in London before their departure ; from this , therefore , it appears , they had been gaining on their former rates , or had been increasing their gaining rates , and diminishing their losing ones .
An opportunity soon afterwards occurred of observing the effect produced upon the chronometers by removing them on shore .
On the gth of August , the chronometers , nine in number , were landed on an island , where a temporary observatory had been erected for the purpose , and the latitude of which had been accurately determined with a repeating circle made by TROUGHTON , when it was found that the acceleration immediately ceased ; for the longitude of the place by chronometers , August 12 , was 9§ 42 36 " E , but on the 27th , it was 10 ?
i ' o " E , making a difference of 18 ' 24 " of longitude in fifteen days , using the former rates .
Since , therefore , the chronometers were getting easterly by their removal on shore , the acceleration must have ceased ; which will appear upon consideration .
A similar circumstance was observed by Lieut. FRANKLIN to take place with the chronometers on board the Trent , which were four in number ; and he observes , " It may be " worthy of remark , that the chronometers taken out by the " Hon. Captain PHIPPS , showed too great westerly longitude , " c and consequently gained on these seas .
The fact of so c many chronometers altering their rates the same way , is " curious , but I am not aware that any cause can be assigned .
" The effect produced upon one or two of the chronometers by their removal to land , was very remarkable ; a chronometer made by BAIRD was ( by observations taken on shore near where the ships lay at anchor , by Lieutenants FRANKLIN and BEECHEY , with false horizon , and eight inch reflecting circles of TROUGHTON , from August 8 , A.M. to 1s , P.M. ) losing 3/ .'4 daily when on board ; but upon its removal on shore to the observatory , its rate per transit , from August i6 , to s6 , was observed by myself to be 18 ' , " losing .
Upon again removing it on board , it was found by obser .
vation , as before , to be losing 6 , " 5 daily ; from which it appears the chronometer lost no less than about thirteen or fourteen seconds daily by its removal on shore .
Another chronometer in the Trent , made by PENNINGTON , had been gaining rapidly on board ; when taken on shore , it acquired immediately a losing rate of 1 , " 8 , nearly the same as it had in London before the vessels sailed .
A chronometer of my own , by ARNOLD , was affected likewise nearly as much , losing about q9 daily by its removal on shore .
i98 In the other chronometers the alteration was less sudden , but was ultimately not less considerable ; and they were several days on shore before they acquired a steady rate , as will appear by the following table of their rates , during the interval of the respective dates .

+ 4.47'4 132 + z.2 -5.x15 Aug. 2- , + 5-12.s The errors of the chronometers in April , were those obtained in London before the ships sailed ; those on the s2th August were determined at the Observatory on Dane 's Island , Spitzbergen , the longitude of which was determined by a great many observations of the distances of the sun and moon for several days with TROUGHTON'S eight inch sextants and reflecting circles .
The rates in the column entitled " Mean Rates at Sea , " are deduced by dividing the difference of the errors by the interval .
The rates in the column entitled c " Mean Rates on Shore , " or more properly what they would have had , are means between the rates of chronometers on shore before leaving England , and those obtained at Spitzbergen ; and although a mean between the rates of chronometers obtained at different times , may not accurately be the mean rate they would have had during the interval of those times , from the continued variation to which they are subject ; yet , upon comparing the two last columns together , of the rates thus deduced , it will be perceived , that in all the chronometers their gaining rates had either been increased , or their losing ones diminished on ship-board , or in other words , they had all been accelerated .
Nor is this acceleration peculiar to high latitudes ; it was observed very soon after the chronometers were put on board in the tiver , particularly in Nos. 3 and 8 , which , upon arriving at Shetland , were found to have gained instead of losing rates , which they had in London .
This acceleration was very soon perceptible in the chronometers taken out by the Hon. Captain PHIPPS , made by Q01 KENDAL and ARNOLD .
Mr. LYONS , who accompanied him , landed at Sheerness Fort , and found the longitudcbv them to be 30 'o " E , which is about 13 ' W of the true longitude , as determined in the Trigonometrical Survey .
The same occurrence took place last summer ( 1819 ) .
The longitude of a place in one of the Orkney Islands , as determined by three chronometers made by ARNOLD , two of them belonging to myself , the other to Lieut. E. HOME , R. N. who accompanied me , was 6 ' 40 " W. of the longitude determined by the difference of R of stars E and W of ) .
Again , in the trial of Mr. HARRISON'S timekeeper , in 1764 , the longitude of Barbadoes by the watch was 10 ' 45 " more to the westward than that determined by astronomical observations made by the persons sent out for that purpose .
Soon after this trial , the commissioners of longitude agreed with Mr. KENDAL , one of the watchmakers appointed by them to receive Mr. HARRISON'S discoveries , to make another watch on the same construction , which went considerably better than Mr. HARRISON'S .
Mr. KENDAL'S watch was sent out with Captain COOK in his second voyage towards the South Pole and round the world , in the years 1772-3-4 and 5 , " when the only fault found in the watch was , that its rate of going was continually accelerated .
" It now remains , therefore , to determine what this acceleration arises from .
That it does not arise from the motion of the vessels , is evident in the case of the nine chronometers on board the Dorothea and Trent ; since the acceleration was observed when the ships were firmly beset with ice ; also in the case of the alteration in the rates of the chronometers upon Q0S landing , and taking them on board again at Dane 's Island , the ships were riding at anchor close in shore without any perceptible motion .
An account was also kept on board and on shore , of the state of the temperature and barometer , every two hours , both night and day ; and upon comparing them together , there does not appear to be the least correspondence between the change of rates and the temperature at the time .
It appears therefore to me , that this acceleration arose entirely from the magnetic action exerted by the iron in the ship on the inner rim of the balance , which is made of steel .
That the iron in the ships becomes magnetic , is plain , from the polarity which exists in it ; the whole forming altogether one large magnet , having its south pole on deck nearly amidships , and its north pole below .
This is seen from the constant deviation of the north end of the compasses placed on deck towards the centre of the ship , as appears from recent observations , which I have mentioned elsewhere , Nor is it surprising that the force exerted by the ship 's iron ( thus become magnetical ) on the balance of the chronometers , should be sufficient to cause a very sensible alteration in the rate of going , when we consider how easily , in other cases , the presence of any thing magnetical is detected by the alteration of the rate of a chronometer ; and when we consider the great influence exerted by this iron upon the binnacle compasses at very considerable distances , and in situations where the utmost precaution is used to remove every piece of iron from them , by using copper-bolts , fastenings , &amp;c. It remains only to determine , how far this alteration in the.20 rates of the chronometers , can be reconciled with that observed in chronometers when under the influence of magnets placed in different positions with respect to their balances .
To determine this , two watches were used , with steel balances and horizontal escapements , one by EARNSHAW , the other by ALLAN and CAITHNESS ; also two chronometers made by ARNOLD .
To each of these watches were applied , at a distance of two inches from the balance , magnets of twelve inches in length , in four different positions , and in the planes of the balances .
The following Table will show the rates of the watches in twenty-four hours , deduced by comparing them with an excellent clock with GRAHAM'S dead beat escapement , and regulated by transit .

No. 2 , gained with both poles in every position .
Nos. S and gained in every position but two ; and the quantities lost in the positions were far exceeded by the accelerations caused by the opposite poles , excepting one case in that of No. 4 .
The magnets were likewise placed in different positions out of the planes of the balances ; the results were very similar to those above , but differing in quantity , according to the distance of the magnets from the planes of the balances .
Upon placing the magnets very near to the rim of the balances , a very rapid acceleration took place with both poles , and in every position of the magnets , particularly in the watches Nos. i and 2 .
Upon too near an approach of the magnets , the watch No. i , and chronometer No. 3 , were rendered useless ; the former , when the magnets were taken away , gaining no less than about 13 hour , and the chronometer losing about 50 " in 24 hours ; and in again repeating the experiments in the plane of the balances , the rates of the chronometers ( without the magnets ) were so variable , that it was necessary to determine their rates before and after each application of the magnets ; the following , however , is a Table of the results upon the chronometers Nos. $ and 4d j |No.3 .

2SS -2.26.3 + x.6 Each of these results in this Table , is the difference of the rates when the magnets were applied , and a mean of the rates of the chronometers before and after the application of the magnets .
The rate of the chronometer No. $ , is very different from that given in the former Table ; that of No. 4 is nearly , the same , and does not appear to have been affected , as No. g was , by the close approach of the magnet .
Upon the whole , however , it appears that chronometers will be generally accelerated ( particularly if their balances Qsohave not received polarity by the too near approach of any thing magnetical ) on ship-board .
It appears probable , likewise , that the force of the balance springs is affected in the same way ; since it is well known that chronometers having gold balance springs , although more difficult to adjust , yet keep better rates at sea than the others .
However this may be , these observations show the necessity of not trusting to the rates of chronometers ascertained during the time they are on shore ; and if the rates are ascertained on board , the chronometers should always be kept in the same place , and also in the same position with respect to the ship ; for I have but little doubt that , upon an accurate trial , a chronometer will be found to change its rate , more or less , according as these circumstances are attended to .
If these precautions are not taken , land will appear to be considerably to the westward of its true position ; this is particularly exemplified in the observations of the Hon. Captain PHIPPs ; from which , nearly the whole line of coast on the west side of East Greenland has been placed nearly i0 too much to the westward , by reason of the acceleration of his chronometers ; the same circumstance would have occurred with the chronometers in both of the ships Dorothea and Trent , in the late voyage , had not the longitude been otherwise determined .
It is therefore highly requisite that attention should be paid to a circumstance so much connected with the improvement of geography as well as the safety of the seaman .
As an Appendix to these observations , I beg leave to add the following Table of Rates , furnished by Mr. COLEMAN , to which I have prefixed his letter as an introduction .

SIR , IN compliance with the wish of our common friend Lieutenant EVERARD HOME ; I have much pleasure in sending you a table of rates of chronometers .
My profession as Teacher of Navigation , conjointly with Mr. NoRIE , which connects me 80 intimately with the Officers of the Honourable East India Company , employed on board the ships trading to India , has enabled me to present you with this table upon an enlarged scale .
While engaged in the same service eighteen years , this subject occupied my attention , and it affords me much satisfaction that you are bringing the subject before the Royal Society .
My remarks correspond very much with those , I understand , you are now bringing forward .
I am , Sir , Your obedient servant , GEORGE COLEMAN .
