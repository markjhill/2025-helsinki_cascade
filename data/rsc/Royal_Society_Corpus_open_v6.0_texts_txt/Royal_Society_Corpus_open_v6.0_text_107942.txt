On the Friction and Resistance of Fluids .
By GEORGE RENNIE , Esq. .
P.R.S. Read June 16 , 1831 .
WHEN on a former occasion I communicated the results of a series of experiments on the Friction and Resistance of the Surfaces of Solids ( Philosophical Transactions for 1828 ) , I stated that they formed part only of a series of experiments on the nature of friction generally .
My object at first was to trace the relation subsisting between the retardation produced by the surfaces of solids in motion when in contact with each other and with fluids ; but finding that the subject connected with either of these branches was sufficiently extensive , I deemed it necessary to postpone the second part of the inquiry to a future occasion .
Those experiments , however , established some important facts .
They showed that ( within the limits of abrasion ) friction was the same for all solids , and that it was neither affected by surface nor velocity .
Subsequent experiments upon rolling bodies of great weight and magnitude , when the resistance was reduced T-oLth part of the mass , and the surfaces in the ratio of 13 to 1 , have corroborated the affinity of resistance between rolling and sliding bodies .
Thus in connecting and continuing the isolated experiments of COULOMB and VINCE , and assigning values to the abrasive resistances of most of the most useful solids , a considerable advance has been made in the science .
The subject of the present paper , however , involves difficulties of a more complicated kind .
The theory of solids as deduced from the laws of mechanics , and independent of experiment , may be applied to any system of bodies ; but the theory of fluids , in which the form and the disposition of the particles , or the laws of their action , are unknown , must necessarily be founded on experiment ; and even with this aid , which can only be obtained through the intervention of a solid , our knowledge of the true properties of fluids must be vague and uncertain .
Accordingly we find that the subject of fluids attracted the attention of some of the most distinguished mathematicians and philosophers of Europe for the last two centuries ; that is , from the year 1628 , when CASTELLI first published his Treatise on the Measure of running Water , down to the hydraulic investigations of EYTELWEIN and YOUNG .
Between these periods , Italy , France , Germany and England , added their contributions to the science .
But it is to the Italians principally that we owe the foundation of it , in their numerous investigations and controversies on the rivers of Italy ; hence the writings of CASTELLI , VIVIANI , ZENDRINI , MANFREDI , POLINI , FRISI , GULIELMINI , LECHI , MICHELLOTTI , and of many others * .
Each of them has endeavoured to establish a theory applicable to rivers and torrents , but in general with indifferent success .
The science again received fresh accessions from the more valuable investigations of BOssUT , DUBUAT , VENTURI , FiNCK , BRUNNING , BIDONE , COULOMB , PRONY , EYTELWEIN and GIRARD ; and anmong our own countrymen , of M'CLAURIN , VINCE , MATTHEW YOUNG , Dr. JURIN , Professor ROBINSON , and the late Dr. THOMAS YOUNG .
Sir ISAAC NEWTON had already demonstrated , in his celebrated propositions 51 , 52 , and 53 , of the Principia , ( in the case of a cylinder in motion immersed in a fluid , ) that the resistance arising from the want of a perfect lubricity in fluids is ( caeteris paribus ) proportional to the velocity with which the parts of a fluid separated from each other ; and that , if a solid cylinder of infinite length revolves with a uniform motion round a fixed axis , in a uniform and infinite fluid , the periodical times of the parts of the fluid thus put in motion will be proportional to their distances from the axis .
This theory ( although conformable to experiment ) was objected to by BERNOULLI and D'ALEMBERT , on the ground that Sir ISAAC NEWTON had not taken into consideration the centrifugal force or friction arising from the pressure of the concentric rings or filaments round the cylinder , the fluid being supposed in a state of permanence , and the friction of the rings equal throughout .
PITOT ( 1728 ) , in his experiments on the water-works at Marly and Versailles , was the first to demonstrate that with equal velocities , and in the ratio of the volume of water , the friction of water in pipes was in the inverse ratio of their ]E 'L EX z_ z iNt_0 N of6 e/ awe / ) aSWA'/ 7i/ 1s^ o/ -T 7/ /t , ' THE REISTACE orWATJiER .

96 1__= IIiI I ' IIIIiI i ; I I.I , 'CC.d % diameters ; and COUPLET ( 1733 ) , MARIOTTE , and DEPARCIEUX , estimated the difference between the real and calculated expenditures of glass tubes and pipes .
CHEZY ( in 1771 and 1786 ) was the first engineer who endeavoured to establish the relation subsisting between the inclination of an aqueduct and the transverse section of the volume of water it ought to carry , -on the supposition that the accelerating force , due to the inclination of the bed of the conduit , is counterbalanced by the resistances of the channel in the ratio of the surface , and increasing in proportion to the square of the velocity .
What CHEZY had remarked was concluded by BossUT , who cleared the investigation of most of its difficulties , and demonstrated it to be in accordance with theory .
He found that small orifices discharged less water in proportion than great ones , on account of friction ; that the vena contracta , and consequent expenditure , diminished with the height of the reservoir : he pointed out the law by which the discharge diminishes according to the inclination and number of bends in a pipe , and the influence of friction in retarding the velocity of waters moving in canals and pipes , in which he made the square of the velocity to be in the inverse ratio of the length of the pipe : he determined the co-efficients by experiment , and thus obtained a formula expressive of the conditions of the uniform motion of water in open canals .
The greater part of these hypotheses may be said to have been removed by the more extensive researches of DUBUAT .
His great hydraulic work , published in 1779 and 1786 , contains a series of the most valuable observations , whose results accord very nearly with the new formula of the motion of water in pipes and open conduits ; and his experiments , with pipes inclined in various angles from the 40,000th part of a right angle to 90 degrees , and in channels which varied from a line and a half in diameter to areas of seven or eight square toises , seem to comprehend every case of inclination ; so that by collecting a prodigious number of facts , both with compressible and incompressible fluids , he obtained a general expression for all cases relative to the friction and cohesion of fluids : but a logarithmic function which he introduces in it , by a sort of approximation , gives it a character of uncertainty , which restrains its use , and shows the necessity of fresh researches .
VENTURI , in 1798 , " ; Sir la Communication latirale du Mouvements dans les Fluides , " repeated and added many new facts to the experiments of BossUT , on 3i2 the expenditure of differently shaped orifices and tubes , but particularly on the lateral communication of motion by the cohesion of fluids .
COULOMB first approximated to the solution of the question , by a very ingenious apparatus , consisting of discs of different sizes , fixed by their centres to the lower extremity of a brass wire , and made to oscillate in fluids by the force of torsion only ; he concluded that the resistance was a function , composed of two terms , one proportional to the first , the other to the second powers of the resistance : again , that it was not sensibly increased by increasing the height of the fluid , but simply by the cohesion of the particles of the fluid which presented greater or less resistance , in proportion to the viscidity of the fluid , oil being to water in the ratio of 17.5 to 1 .
But whatever might be the conclusions of COULOMB , it is obvious that both the size and construction of his apparatus were ill calculated to produce results whereon to found a satisfactory theory ; and accordingly both Messrs. PRONY and GIRARD , in expressing their formulae of resistance , have not admitted that of COULOMB , but have adopted the mean of the best of experiments made by other authors : but as these formulae give only the mean velocity , which is much greater than the velocity ( of the fluid contiguous to the pipe ) which ought alone to enter into the expression of the retarding force , it follows , that the coefficients deduced from the mean of all the experiments adopted by these gentlemen , have a value greatly inferior to the motion of the fluid contiguous to the side of the pipe or conduit .
To ascertain correctly the value of this kind of resistance , M. GIRARD ( vide les M6moires des Scavans etrangers for 1815 ) , undertook a prodigious number of experiments on tubes of different diameters and length , from which lie deduced that the retardation is as the velocity simply .
The effects of temperature are very remarkable ; if the velocity be expressed by 10 , when the temperature is 0 ?
centigrade thermometer , the velocity will be 42 ?
, or increased four times when the temperature is 85 ?
: these values must be deemed approximations only .
The contributions of British philosophers towards the improvement of this science have been , unfortunately , scanty ; for , with the exception of Sir ISAAc NEWTON ( who led the way ) , Dr. JURIN , Dr. MATTHEW YOUNG , Dr. DESAGULIERS , Dr. VINCE , Mr. SMEATON , Mr. BANKS , and the late Dr. THOMAS YOUNG , ( see the paper of the latter gentleman in the Philosophical Transactions , and his commentaries on EYTELWEIN'S experiments , ) we can scarcely find any experiments on the subject* : whatever has been effected by our engineers or scientific men , has either been withheld from the public , or consigned to obscurity ; and though we have tracts of marshes and fen land , consisting of many thousand acres , the dissertations on the mode of draining and carrying off their superfluous waters are confined to local pamphlets and reports , of comparatively minor interest to the science of hydraulics .
From the foregoing short but imperfect history , it is obvious that much has been done towards perfecting this science .
It is however certain , that much yet remains to be accomplished ; and although we are deeply indebted to both the French and English philosophers for their extensive investigations on the laws of capillary attraction , the descents of globes in fluids , and the adhesion of fluids to metal discs , the phenomena of fluidity , and the laws which govern the motion and equilibrium of their particles , must yet remain a problem purely geometrical ; and as we possess no tangible means of approximating to the solution of the problem , but through the intervention of a solid , we must content ourselves , in like manner , with the imperfect formulae deduced from experiments made on a small scale on the friction and adhesion of water in pipes and conduits , until we can ascertain more correctly the causes of the retardations of rivers as they occur in nature .
In the consideration of this question , therefore , I propose to examine , first , the retardations of the surfaces of solids moving in fluids at rest ; secondly , the retardations of fluids over solids ; and , thirdly , the direct resistance of solids revolving in fluids at rest .
To illustrate the first case , I caused an apparatus to be constructed , of which the annexed Plate XI .
is a representation ; it consists simply of a cylinder of wood ten inches and three quarters in diameter , and twenty-four inches long , and divided into eight sections of three inches in each , and fixed upon a spindle of iron about four feet in length , and one inch and a quarter thick .
The apparatus was accurately turned and polished .
Upon the upper part of the spindle , a small cylinder or pulley , six inches in diameter was fixed , and a fine flexible silken cord , communicating with the weight , -was wound ; the apparatus was then fixed in an iron frame , and the framre let into a groove in two upright posts , driven into the bed of the river Thames .
The object of the frame was to allow the cylinder to slide up and down with the level of the tide , and imnlerse it more or less according to the experiment required to be tried .
The friction of the apparatus , or the time that the weight took to descend in the atmosphere , was first noticed ; after which it was successively immersed in the water three , six , nine , twelve , fifteen , eighteen , twenty-one , and twenty-four inches , the difference of time showing the retardation according to the annexed Table .

iii Conclusions .
1 .
That the friction or adhesion of water against the surfaces of solids in motion , approximates the ratio of the surfaces with slow velocities ; but that an increase of surface does not materially affect it with increased velocities .
2 .
That with equal surfaces the velocities do not seem to observe any fixed ratio , but approximate to the squares of the resistance .
With increased velocities the index of the power was found to be less than the duplicate ratio .
To exemplify the result of the foregoing conclusion in a different way , - the cylinder was removed , and circular discs of iron , ten inches and three quarters diameter and one eighth of an inch thick , accurately adjusted to the spindle and polished , were substituted .
The friction of the apparatus was again tried , and imnlersed in the river Thames , as before .

That the friction or adhesion of water is not quite as the surfaces with slow velocities , being in the ratio of one to three instead of one to four , but diminishes rapidly , without observing any ratio in increased velocities* .
Hence the resistance of a ship or vessel moving through the water , with an average or higher rate of velocity , forms an inconsiderable portion of the resistance resulting from the displacement of the fluid , and that the brightness observed on the copper of ships after a voyage , may be owing to other causes than the friction of the water simply .
An experiment was made to ascertain the comparative resistance of a pipe revolving in water , and with water running through a pipe ; when the resistance was found to be as the surfaces in slow velocities , but to diminish greatly , as before , in high velocities , without observing any fixed ratio .
The above conclusions are in contradiction to those of COULOMB , who did not find that pressure augmented the resistance , but states that the resistance is greater when the immersion is partial .
This apparatus being applicable to fluids generally , advantage was taken of it to ascertain the direct resistance of solids to fluids ( see Plate XII.)t by causing plates and globes to revolve in them , with their planes perpendicular to the plane of the horizon .
As the resistance of solids in fluids does not form the object of this paper , it will be unnecessary to introduce many detailed observations on the subject of these experiments at present , connected as they are with another branch of hydrodynamics .
But as it is important to show the relation subsisting between the resistances of cohesion and impulse , I have ventured to detail the following experiments .

That the mean resistances of circular discs , square plates , and globes in air , are as the numbers 25.180 , 22.010 , 10.627 ; and in water , 1.18 , 1.36 , 0.755 ; consequently the proportional resistance of air to water , with Circular discs , is as 1 to 21.3 Plates and fans. .

Experiments on the Quantities of Water discharged by Orifices and Tubes of different diameters and lengths , and at different altitudes .
The phenomena incident to spouting fluids are , First , The inequality observed in the velocity of the particles comprised in every horizontal section parallel to the orifice .
Secondly , The contraction of the fluid vein beyond the orifice , and consequent diminution of discharge as compared with theory .
Thirdly , The inversion and changes in the sections of the fluid vein at different distances from the orifices .
All these phenomena have been noticed and recorded by various writers , and formulae adapted to the different circumstances of the expenditure have been given .
But neither BosSUT nor Du BUAT ( the most accurate of writers ) have recorded a continuous and systematic series of experiments upon the comparative expenditure of orifices and tubes under the circumstances of area , altitude , and length .
The apparatus with which these experiments were performed , consisted of a wooden cistern very accurately made , two feet square inside , and four feet four inches in height .
The water was kept at a constant altitude by a regulating cock ; and a float having an index attached to it enabled the observer to ascertain the exact height at which the water stood in the cistern above the centre of the orifice .
The orifices were accurately made by DOLLOND in brass plates one sixtieth of an inch in thickness .
The plates were accurately adjusted to a hole in the side of the cistern , and closed by a valve of brass ground to each of the plates .
The valve was opened by a lever , and the time noted by chronometers .
The diameters of the tubes , from having been drawn on mandrils , were as accurate as possible ; their diameters at the extremities were carefully enlarged , to prevent any wire edges from diminishing their sections ; and one extremity of the tube being inserted into a block of hard wood fastened to the cistern , and the other stopped by a valve , the experiments were recorded as before .

Remarks .
The phenomena relative to the form and direction of veins of spouting fluids , and the remarkable inversion of the fluid veins at certain distances from their orifices , have been so fully noticed in " Experiences sur la Forme et sur la Direction des Veines et des Courans d'Eau ; par GEORGE BIDONE : Turin , 1829 , " that it is unnecessary to state further than that they have been completely corroborated in the foregoing experiments .

JErLFLrFFLULrL Conclusions .
From the foregoing experiments with one rectangular pipe , it would be reasonable to conclude that the diminution of discharge would be as the number of right angles ; but comparing the expenditure by one right-angled pipe with the expenditure of a pipe with twenty-four right angles , the difference is only in the ratio of about two to one .
General Remarks on the Expenditure of Horizontal and Bent Pipes .
Formule adapted to the different circumstances of the motion of water in pipes and conduits have been given by various authors .
By some , the retardations were supposed to be in the inverse ratios of the squares of the lengths of the pipes ; and by others , to be represented by a certain portion of the altitude of the reservoir above the centre of the pipe , the resistance being directly as the length and circumference of the pipe , and inversely as the area of the section .
M. GIRARD , in his beautiful experiments* , conceived the resistance to be compounded of the first and second powers of the velocity .
So that , deducing the values from DUBUAT'S experiments , and expressing the resistance due to cohesion by Rx U , R being the quantity to be obtained by experiment , and making " Memoires des Scavans Etrangers .
the resistance due to the asperities equal to Rx U2 , the sum of the resistance is R ( U + U)2 .
M. PRONY , applying his profound acquirements to the solution of all the cases of preceding authors , deduced from a selection of upwards of fifty experiDZ ments the following simple formula : U= 26.79 V/ - ; U being the mean velocity of the section of the pipe ; D the diameter of the pipe ; Z the altitude of the water ; x the length of the pipe : from which it appears that the velocity is directly in the compound ratio of the square roots of the diameter of the pipe and head of water , and inversely as the square roots of the length of the pipe ; that is , for any given head of water and diameter of pipe , the velocity is inversely as the square root of the length of the pipe .
If we compare these results with those of DUBUAT , GIRARD , and others , they approximate very nearly to each other .
In general , if we incline a pipe to an angle of about 6degrees , or one ninth of its length , the discharge will be nearly equal to the discharge by additional tubes .
The charge necessary to express the mean velocity of water issuing V2 V2 from straight pipes is by some authors equal to 78 Dr. YOUNG makes it 50 : the diminution of expenditure depending upon the contraction of the fluid vein and the friction of the pipe .
The change occasioned by bends and angles in the direction of the fluid vein tends to diminish the velocity in a very remarkable manner .
DUBUAT undertook several experiments upon this subject , but the formula V2 S2 proposed by him does not solve the difficulty , where Vgives the resistance due to one bend , V being the velocity , S the sine of incidence or reflection , and ma constant quantity determined by DUBUAT to be 2998.50 .
Now although it is reasonable to suppose that the resistance should be proportionable to the squares of the sines of the angles of incidence , yet as all * DUBUAT and LANGSDORF .
the particles of the fluid vein are not reflected in the same angle , and as a considerable portion of the velocity is destroyed by the first angle or bend the fluid meets with in the pipe , M. DUBUAT'S theory is fundamentally erroneous , the more especially as he has rejected more than one half of the twenty-five experiments mentioned by him .
Dr. YOUNG'S suppositions , of the resistance being as the angular flexure and the power of the radius , of which the index is 8 , are equally erroneous , as is evinced by the foregoing experiments .
In conclusion , it is evident that the subject of friction admits of an immense variety of applications .
To determine the measure of the resistances experienced by vessels and floating bodies in their motion through fluids ; the law of the retardations of rivers , and the cause of the obstructions presented to the waves of the ocean in the slopes assumed by its shores ; the equilibrium of earths , and their connection with solids and fluids , -all of them are questions of the utmost importance in the economy of nature , and their solution can only be attained by an accumulation of facts .
N.B. Since the foregoing paper was presented to the Royal Society , an abstract of an extensive series of experiments on the expenditure of water through rectangular orifices of large dimensions , has been submitted to the French Academy by Messrs. PONCELET and LESBROS , of the Corps de Genie at Metz ; and as these experiments were undertaken by order of the French government , no expense was spared to have them made as extensive as possible .
Their objects were principally to ascertain the exact measure of the coefficient of contraction and the forms of the fluid veins under different altitudes and areas .
The results of which are : That with an orifice of 20 centimetres square , the coefficient is 0.600 under altitudes of 1 metre 68 centimetres .
But when the altitude was reduced to four or five times the opening of the orifice , the coefficient increased to 0.605 , but again diminished rapidly as the altitude diminished , to 0.593 .
That with orifices of smaller dimensions , i. e. from 10 to 5 centimetres square , the same law was observed , the coefficients being respectively 0.61 1 , and 0.611 , for opening of 10 and for 5 centimetres , 0.618 , 0.631 , 0.623 ; and for orifices of less dimension , the coefficient continually increased up to 0.698 .
That for water running over weirs , the mean coefficient was 0.400 , which differs very little from that of BIDONE .
Hence we see little reason to deviate from the coefficients already given .
