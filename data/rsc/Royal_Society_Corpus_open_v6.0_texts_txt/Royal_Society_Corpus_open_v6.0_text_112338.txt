( Abstract .
) The author gave a detailed description of his apparatus , and of the method employed in drying the air .
The result of his experiments gave as the coefficient of increase of elasticity of air of constant volume for 1 ?
F. 0'002040 , this being slightly different from that given by Regnault , which is 0'002036 .
He also finds that the temperature of the freezing-point of mercury is constant , and that its value on Fahrenheit 's scale , as given by an air-thermometer , is -37ยง 93 , while as recorded by a standard mercurial thermometer it is -38 ?
'00 .
It is probable that this difference is owing to an anomalous contraction of mercury before it freezes , similar to the corresponding expansion of water ; but this effect in the case of mercury seems to be very small , and it may be said that a mercurial thermometer properly graduated , will denote the true temperature , even down to the freezing-point of the mercury itself .

'On the Degree and Weight of the Resultant of a Multipartite System of Equations .
" By Professor J. J SYLVESTER , F.R.S. Received May 25 , 1863 .
Let there be ( l n ) equations each homogeneous in any number of sets of variables , and suppose that the degrees of the several equations in respect to these sets are respectively a , b , c,. .

As regards weight .
By the weight of any letter in respect to any given variable is to be understood the exponent of that variable in the term affected with the coefficient ; and by the weight of any term of the resultant in respect to such variable , the sum of the weights of its several simple factors ; each term in the resultant in respect to any given variable has the same weight ; and this weight may also be proved to be alike for each variable in the same set , and may be taken as the weight of the resultant in respect to such set .
This being premised , we have the following theorem : The value of the weight of the resultant in respect to any particular set of the variables , ex. gr. the ( 1 + a ) set , will be the coefficient of pf+ .

Thus , ex. gr. , if we suppose each equation linear in respect to the variables of each set , the degree of the resultant in respect to the coefficients of any equation will be rr(a+3+y ... +X ) 7r .
