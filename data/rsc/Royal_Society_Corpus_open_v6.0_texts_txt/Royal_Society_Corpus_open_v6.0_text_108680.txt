Note on Archdeacon PRATT'S Paper " ' On the Effect of Local Attraction in the ' English Are .
" By Captain A. R. CLARKE , R.E. Communicated by Lieut.-Colonel JAMES , R.E. Received June 30 , -Read November 18 , 1858 .
TFHE distances between the parallels of latitude of the principal stations of the original English Arc , as used by Archdeacon PRATT in his paper " On the Effects of Local Attraction* , " are taken from the second and third volumes of the " 1 Account of the Trigonometrical Survey .
" The correct distances , with the exception of that for Blenheim , are given at page 732 of the last published volumet of the Ordnance Survey .
They are as follows : Feet .
Dunnose and Greenwich.313716-9 Greenwich and Blenheim.132802-0 Blenheim and Arbury Hill.139837 4 Arbury Hill and Clifton.450225 2 Clifton and Burleigh Moor.406596 9 The distance , Greenwich to Bleinheim , is not altered , as there is no new determination of that quantity .
The quantities A and { , as used by Archdeacon PRATT , do not require alteration .
The following Table exhibits the values of E and A for the several arcs : Arc. Values of E. values of A. 1 .

| From the 'Account of the Principal Triangulation , ' page 712 , it appears , however , that the most probable deflections areAt Dunnose 1 1 .

At Greenwich 1. .
864 North .
At Arbury ... .
2-226 North .
At Clifton ee*e 2447 South .
At Burleigh Moor. .
3-589 South .
These values result from the comparison of all the geodetical and astronomical determinations in Great Britain and Ireland .
When the English arc is used in the determination of the figure of the earth , in combination with the measurements in other countries , the following system of quantities is obtained ( pages 764 , 765 ) : At Dunnose ... 1767 South .
At Greenwich e1e P270 North .
At Arbury. .
1 .
P692 North .
At Clifton .
e. .
2864 South .
At Burleigh Moor. .
3-885 South .
From this it will be seen that the " ; rough approximation " of Archdeacon PRATT ( at page 46 of his paper ) , namely , the determination of the local attraction at Burleigh Moor from the form of the masses of hill in the neighbourhood , is exceedingly near the truth .
He finds 3"1 660 South , which is intermediate to the quantities quoted above , viz. 3 " 589 and -3 " 885 ; but the values assigned at page 47 for the deflections at the other stations are not correctly inferred .
