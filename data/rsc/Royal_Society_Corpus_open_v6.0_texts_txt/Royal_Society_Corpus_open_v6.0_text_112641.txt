( Abstract .
) In the preface to this paper , Sir Henry James gives an account of the circumstances under which the work was undertaken , as follows .
( A Table of results is appended , p. 313 .
) The principal triangulation of the United Kingdom was finished in 1851 ; and the triangulations of France , Belgium , Prussia , and Russia were so far advanced in 1860 , that , if connected , we should have a continuous triangulation from the Island of Yalentia on the south-west extremity of Ireland , in north latitude 51ยง 55 ' 20 " , and longitude 10ยง 20 ' 40 " west of Greenwich , to Orsk on the River Ural in Russia .
It was therefore possible to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52 ?
of about 75 ?
, and to determine , by the assistance of the electric telegraph , the exact difference of longitude between the extremities of this arc , and thus obtain a crucial test of the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the earth , as derived from the measurement of arcs of meridian , or the data for modifying the results previously arrived at .
The Russian Government , therefore , at the instance of M. Otto Struve , Imperial Astronomer of Russia , invited ( in 1860 ) the cooperation of the Governments of Prussia , Belgium , France , and England , to effect this most important object , and to their great honour they all consented , and granted the necessary funds for the execution of the work .
The portion of the work which was assigned to me , was the connexion of the triangulation of England with that of France and Belgium , and I published the results of this operation in 1862 * .
But this work has been done in duplicate ; for when application was made to the French Government to permit the necessary observations to be made in France , they not only consented to allow this , but at the same time volunteered to join in the labour and expense of the work itself .
It would obviously have been wrong to mix up observations made with different kinds of instruments and on different principles , and therefore it was agreed that the work should , in fact , be made in duplicate , both the French and English geometricians using exactly the same stations .
The results obtained by the French geometricians is published in the Supplement to vol. ix .
of the ' Mimorial du Depot G6neral de la Guerre , ' 1865 , and the agreement with the results obtained by the English is truly surprising .
But however accurately the trigonometrical observations might be performed , it is obvious that , without a knowledge of the exact relative lepngths of the standards used as the units of measure in the triangulation of the several countries , it would be impossible accurately to express the length of the arc of parallel in terms of any one of the standards .
It was therefore necessary that a comparison of the standards of length should be made , and as we had a building and apparatus expressly erected for the purpose of comparing standards at this Office , the English Government , on my recommendation , invited the Governments of the several countries named to send their standards here , and we have had the following compared with the greatest accuracy:1 .
1Russian standard , double toise , P. 2 .
Prussian standard toise .
3 .
Belgium standard toise .
4 .
Platinum metre of the Royal Society , compared with the standard metre of France by 1M .
Arago .
5 .
English standard yards , A , B , C , 29 , 47 , 51 , 55 , 58 .
6 .
Ordnance Survey 10-foot standard bar .
7 .
Indian 10-foot standard bars , new and old .
8 .
Australian 10-foot standard bar .
9 .
In addition to the above , the 10-foot standard bar of the Cape of Good Hope was compared heie in 1844 .
We have invited the Governments of Austria , Spain , and the United States of America , also to send their standards .
We have been promised that of Austria , and , but for the unfortunate war in which she has been lately engaged , we should have received it before this .
I have entrusted the execution of the work of comparison and the drawing up of the results to Captain Alexander R. Clarke of the Royal Engineers , who designed the apparatus used .
The numerous comparisons to be made entailed a great amount of labour upon him and his assistants , Quartermaster Steel and Corporal Compton , of the Royal Engineers .
Before the connexion of the triangulation of the several countries into one great network of triangles , extending across the entire breadth of Europe , and before the discovery of the electric telegraph and its extension from Valentia to the Ural Mountains , it was not possible to execute so vast an undertaking as that which is now in progress .
It is , in fact , a work which could not possibly have been executed at any earlier period in the history of the world .
The exact determination of the figure and dimensions of the earth has been the great aim of astronomers for upwards of two thousand years , and it is fortunate that we live in a time when men are so enlightened as to combine their labours to effect an ob t-I Expressed in Expressed in Expressed in Terms of the Expressed in lines of the Millimetres. .
