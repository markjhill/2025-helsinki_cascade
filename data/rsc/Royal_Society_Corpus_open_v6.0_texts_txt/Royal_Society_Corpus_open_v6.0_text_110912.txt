On the Secretory Apparatus and Function of the Liver .
" By C. Handfield Jones , M.D. Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie , Bart. , F.R.S. The author is led by his researches into the minute structure of the liver , to results which confirm the view of Mr. Bowman , in opposition to those of Mr. Kiernan on this subject ; and particularly with regard to the absence of real tubercular ducts from the interior of the lobules .
He concludes that the secreting process commences in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding the central axis of the lobule , and that the fluid there secreted is transmitted to the cells forming the margin of the lobule , where it is further elaborated , and , by the bursting of these cells , is conveyed into the cavity of the surrounding duct .
A few diagrams are annexed , illustrative of the descriptions of microscopic structure given in the paper. .
