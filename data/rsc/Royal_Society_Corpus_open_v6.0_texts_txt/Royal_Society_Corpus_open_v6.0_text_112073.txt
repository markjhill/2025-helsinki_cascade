" On Drops .
" By FREDERICK GUTHRIE , Esq. , Professor of Chemistry and Physics at the Royal College , Mauritius .
Communicated by Professor STOKES , Sec. R.S. Received July 15 , 1864 .
In the following investigation , the word drop is used in a rather more definite sense than that which is ulsually attached to it .
In common speech a drop signifies any mass of liquiid matter whose form is visibly influenced towards the spherical by the attraction of its parts , and whose senisible motion or tendency is towards the earth .
This definition both includes drops with which we are not here concerned , and excludes others which we shall have to consider ; for we shall " have to measure the size of drops ; and it can only be of avail to measure the size of such drops as are formed under fixed and determinable conditions .
How many drops , according to the usual scope of the term , are formed untder indefinite conditions .
For instance , a rain-drop depends for its size upon such circumstances as the quantity of vapour at the time and place of its formation , the tranquillity and electrical condition of the air , its rate of motion , the number and size of the drops it meets with in its course , &amp;c. , all of which are fortuitous , or , at least , immeasurable conditions .
With such drops we have here nothing to do , but only with those which are formed under fixed circumstances .
On the other hand , we shall have to consider drops which move upwards* .
Drops of this kind are so seldom met with that no distinguishing name has been given to them .
We shall find it convenient to include them in the general term drop , though it may appear at first inapplicable to them .
Without attempting to give an exhaustive definition , it will be suifficient to define a drop as a mass of liquid collected and held together by the attraction of its parts and separated from other matter by the attraction of gravitation .
This definition will exclude -such drops as those of mist or rain , and will include the upward-moving drops mentioned above .
It follows that the size of a drop may depend upon and be influenced by variation in(1 ) The self-attraction and cohesion of the drop-generating liquid ; ( 2 ) Its adhesion to the matter upon which the drop is formed ; ( 3 ) The shape of the matter from which the drop moves ; ( 4 ) The physical relation of the medium through which the drop moves , on the one hand , to the liquid of which the drop is formed , and on the other , to the matter on which it is formed ; ( 5 ) The attraction of the earth , or gravitation , upon the drop-forming liquid and upon the mediuim , as influenced by their respective and relative densities , and by variation in the attracting power of the earth .
In order to study systematically the influence which each of these factors exerts , each must be varied in succession while the others remain constant .
Denoting the three states of matter , solid , liquid , and gaseous , by the symbols S , L , G respectively , and considering the symbols in the order in which they are written to denote respectively the matter from which the dropping takes place , the drop and the medium , we get a convenient notation .
As we are speaking at present exclusively of liquid drops , L must always hold the middle place in the symbol .
Of the eight symbolically possible variations , ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) SLS , SLL , SLG , LLS , LLL , LLG , GLS , GLG , ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 7 ) are physically impossible on account of the superior cohesion of solids over liquids , ( 6 ) and ( 8 ) are physically impossible on account of the superior density of liquids over gases .
SLL , SLG , and LLL are therefore the only cases we have to consider .
That is , SLL , from a solid a liquid drops through a liquid .
SLG , from a solid a liquid drops through a gas .
LLL , from a liquid a liquiid drops through a liquid .
Of these three cases , two , SLL and LLL , may be inverted ; that is , the motion of the drop may be towards or from the earth .
The gravitation of the drop may be greater than and overcome the gravitation of the medium , the drop descends ; or the gravitation of the medium may overcome that of the drop , the drop ascends .
The case SLG cannot be inverted , because , at all events , at the same pressure every known gas is lighter than every known liquid .
It will be convenient to consider the case SLG first , because instances of it come more frequently under our notice than of the other two , and because it will be convenient to consider together those cases which are capable of inversion .
As we are considering the physical aspect of the question , we will only discuss those cases where no chemical action takes place between the terms , and where either no solution takes place , or where it is so small as to be negligible , or of such a kind as to admit of experimental elimination .
This limitation of course excludes a vast number of combinations , but it must be made in order to study the purely physical and definite influences which determine the size of a drop .
SLG .
From a Solid a Liquid drops through a Gas .
The variable factors are 1 .
The self-attraction and cohesion of the liquid : A. Dependent on its purely chemical constitution .
B. Dependent on the proportioni and physical relation between its heterogeneous parts , when a mixture .
C. Dependent on temperature .
2 .
The adhesion between the solid and the liquid : A , B , C as in 1 .
D. Dependent upon the shape of the solid .
3 .
The adhesion of the gas to the solid .
4 .
The adhesion of the gas to the liquid .
The factors 3 and 4 may be neglected , as we shall at present only consider the case where the gaseous medium is air at the ordinary barometric pressure .
One of these factors , namely temperature , though varying in different cases , may be supposed in the same case to be the same for the differenit kinds of matter present .
Another factor in the same predicament is the locally constant gravitation at the place where the dropping occurs .
Lastly , a condition of great influence is the length of the time-interval between the successive drops .
This interval we shall call , for brevity , the growth-time , and denote by gt .
If the above conditions are exhaustive , we may assert that a drop of liquid will always be of the same size , if it is formed of the same liquid substance and falls from a solid of the same substance , size , and shape , provided that the temperature remain the same , and the growth-tim-ne be constant .
The size of the drops may be most conveniently determined by weighing a noted number of tbem .
We are concerned rather with the relative than with the absolute sizes of the drops .
The sizes of drops formed of the same liquid are proportional to their weights ; of different liquids , to those weights divided by the specific gravities of the liquids .
In the first series of experiments the apparatuis , fig. 1 , was employed .
The globe A , full of the liquid under experiment , is inverted into the cylinder B , containing the same .
The mouth of A is supported just in A contact with the surface of the liquid in B , by means of the tripod stand D. A and B are carried on a table , which may be raised or lowered at pleasure .
A siphon , E , leads from the reservoir B , and is firmnly held by the clamp F. The longer limb of E , from which the liquid flows , is turned up at the end , and touches a plug of cotton wool at G. The sphere HI , from which the dropping takes place , is hung by three thin wires from the ring of a retort-stand .
The upper half of the sphere is clothed in cotton wool , which reaches up to the plug at G. The whole arrangement is placed upon a separate table from that which supports the balance , so as to avoid the vibration caused by opening and shutting the balance case .
The drops which fall from II enter the funnel L , whose lower end is somewhat bent , so that the drops are throwni out of the vertical , and all upward splashing avoided .
The rapidity of the flow through the siphon , and consequent dropping from H , is regulated by raising or lowering the table C. The vessel A acts as a regulator for keeping the level of the liquid in B at a constant height .
The first series of experiments was made with the double object of determining how far the rapidity of dropping influenced the size of the drops , and to establish the uniformity of the size of the drops which drop at equal intervals of time .
In these experiments cocoa-nut oil was taken as the liquid , an ivory sphere as the solid , and atmospheric air as the gas .
The ivory sphere was washed in hydrochloric acid , so as to deaden its surface .
Immediately before and after each batch of drops , the same number of drops were counted , and their time of falling compared with the time which elapsed in the actual experiment .
In no case , however , was there a difference between the two of a single second , so that gt may be considered in each case to be exactly given .

1 , , 0 066279 Preliminary experiments having shown that the size of a drop is greatly affected by the rate at which the dropping takes place , that is , by the time occupied by the drop in its formation , the following experiments were performed to establish the connexion between the two .
It may be here remarked that with some liquids , of which cocoa-nut oil 1is one , a continuous stream of liquid by no means implies a faster delivery of it than may be achieved by a succession of drops .
On the contrary , just as by walking more rapid progress may be made than by running , so may dropping deliver more liquiid than passes in a stream .
A uniformly rapid series of drops may be converted into a stream , and reconverted into drops under certain restrictions , at pleasure , without altering the quantity of liquid delivered .
We shall return to this point .

Further , it seems that between the rates gt= -433 and gt= -567 a minimum occurs , that is , instead of there being a continuous diminution in the weight as the growthtime increases , there is at first a diminution , then any increase , and finally a conitinuLouis diminution , so that drops of the rate yt= '500 have sensibly the same size as those of the rate gt=-633 .
In order to establish more precisely the position of this minimum and the general relation between rate and size , the observations must be both more minute and more extended .
For this purpose a fresh sample of oil was taken , and the time-intervals extended from-i 25 " l)er 60 drops to 240ff per 20 drops ; as before , four experiments were made at each time-interval .
The mean results are given in Table IV .

The mean weights of the single drops are got as in Table III .
The weights of oil passing in one second are found by dividing the terms of column 2 by those of column 1 , which correspond to them .

f. A few rather discordant results , got at the rate of 60 drops in 20"t , gave a mean of 0'09264 grn. as the weight of a single drop ; this tends to show that at this high rate the drops were considerably larger than at any lower rate .
Towards the end of the Table , at the slower rates , the error of time becomes so exaggerated ( the least alteration in the adjustment of the instrument makes so sensible a change in the entire time-lapse ) that it is nearly impossible to avoid an error of about 0"'5 in the whole time of several minutes .
Although the time-error thus becomes palpable , it nevertheless remiiains , relatively to the whole time-lapse , as immaterially small as the inappreciable errors of the swifter rates of dropping .
The numbers of Table IV .
present us with several interesting and important facts .

The most prominent fact is that , on the whole , the drops undergo -a continuous diminution in weight or size as gt increases .
To such an extent is this the case , that the most rapidly falling drops of the above Table are nearly twice as heavy as the most slowly falling onies .
The cause of this is probably to be sought for in the circumstance that when the flowing to the solid is more slow , the latter is covered with a thinner film of liquid , so that , as the drop parts , the solid reclaims by adhesion more of the root of the drop than is the case when the adhesion of the solid to the liquid can satisfy itself from the thicker film which surrounds the drop in the case of a more rapid flow .
The influence of rate is seen to extend even to the exceedingly slow rate of gt= 12t .
This connexion between rate and weight ( or quantity ) should not be lost sight of by prescribers and dispensers of medicine .
A pharmacist who administers 100 drops of a liquid drug at the rate of three drops per second , may give half as muich again , as one who measures the same number at the rate of one drop in two seconds , and so on .
For our present purpose the effect of rate upon the size of a drop is of great moment , because it proves that there is no such thing as a drop of normal size .
At no degree of slowness of dropping do drops assume a size unaffected by even a slight change in the rate of their sequence .
Hence , whenever a comparison has to be made between the sizes of different drops , we shall have to eliminate this source of difference by takino drops which follow at exactly the same rate .
About the rate at which the diminution of size takes place for equal increments of gt , the Table gives us little iniformation beyond the fact that , on the whole , the sizes of the drops at the slower rates are less influenced by equal increments of gt than are those of the quicker rates .
This , however , only appears distinctly at and below the rate of about gt=1 " If00 .
if the connexion between gt and the drop-size be represented by a curve ( fig. 2 , A ) , the abscisswe being the values of gt , and the ordinates the corresponding drop-weights , there is apparently no asymptote parallel to the axis of X. The curve presents , however , in its course two secondary maxima and minima : Secondary maxima .
Secondary minima .
( 1 ) yt 450 " gt= 433f ' ( 2 ) gtj 517 " gt= 467"f Although at these minima the drops are less than at the immediately succeeding rates , yet the quantity of liquid passed in a given time is , at every rate of dropping , greater than the quantity passed in the same time at every slower rate .
The decrease of rate more than counterbalances the temporary increase in the drop-size .
This is seen on comparing the numbers of column 3 , Table IV .
, with one aniother .
They are found to decrease continually , though by no means uniformly , as the rate of dropping decreases .
The same fact is shown graphically in fig. 2 , B. The second maximum ( at yt =-500 and gt = 517 ) is in remarkable connexion with the rate at which a series of drops may be converted into a continuous stream .
At all rates of dropping , from yt=-333 to gt= 517 inclusive , the drops may be converted into a permanent stream by pouring a little additional oil upon the sphere as the drops are falling from it .
A stream is thus established which remains for any length of time , if it be protected from all currents of air and vibration .
At the rate gt= 519 the stream may be established by the same means for a few seconds ( about 30 " ) , but the continuous part inevitably begins to palpitate , becoming alternately longer and shorter , thinner and thicker , until at last it draws up and is converted into a succession of drops .
At the immediately slower rates of dropping the same effect follows , but in each case in a shorter time , so that the slowest rate of dropping , which may be converted into permanent running , coincides with the rate which gives the second maximum size of drops ( gt= 500 and gt= l 7 ) .
The appearance of a dropconvertible stream is peculiar , the narrowing which it undergoes on leaving the solid being remarkably sudden .
In many liquids such secondary maxima are entirely wanting .
They appear in liquids of the physical nature of oils , whether those oils be chemically fatty ( adipic salt"of glycerilne ) , or whether they be miscible with water , as syrups , glycerine itself , &amp;c. In order to avoid the influence of variations in rate , we shall for the future take the same rate of dropping in all cases , and , unless the contrary be stated , the rate adopted will be gt= 2 ' .
The factor , the influence of whose variation on the size of the drop we have next to consider , is the constitution of the liquid of which the drop is formed .
For the foregoing experiments concerning the influence of rate , cocoa-nut oil was employed on account of its non-volatility .
On allowing a quantity of it , having an exposed surface of about two square inches , to stand for 70 hours , it was found to have increased about 2 milligrammes in weight , probably in consequence of oxidation .
Its fixedness , therefore , and its perfect liquidness at the temperature of 28 ?
~30 ?
C. , make it well adapted for this special purpose .
Chemically and physically , however , it is of little interest for our immediate purpose , because it is a mixture of several substances , the proportion between which is indefinite .
The constitution of a liquid may vary in two ways .
A liquid may be a mixture of two or more simple liquids , or a solution of one or more solids in a single or mixed liquid ; or secondly , the liquid being single , may vary in the sense of its chemical constitution .
It would be clearly impossible to exhaust experimentally the countless variations which might thus arise .
We must be satisfied with taking a few simple examples of the two cases .
With the more mobile liquids the apparatus , fig. 1 , fails to give a strictly uniform flow .
As the liquid descends in B , it adheres by capillary action to the lip of A for some time after the level of B is below the lip .
The air at last separates the two , enters the flask A , displaces the liquid there , and restores the level to B , so that although the average height of B is constant , yet it undergoes a series of slight but ceaseless variations .
As even such slight irregularities sensibly affect the rate of flow through the siphon , and consequently the rate of dropping from the sphere , the apparatus is slightly modified as follows , fig. 3 .
Between the reservoir , B , fig. 1 , and the dripping sphere , a second reservoir , M , is placed .
This is kept in a state of continual overflow .
The overflow is regulated by means of a few filaments of cotton wool hanging over the edge of the overflowing vessel , and so fashioned that the end in the overflowing vessel tapers to a point .
Finially , the rate of flow is in many instances so sensitive , that it is impossible to procure exactly a predetermined rate by the ordinary screw-adjustment of the holder which carries the siphon .
For the final adjustment , it is convenient to depend upon the elasticity of the siphon .
A heavy ring is passed over the siphon , which is then firmly fixed so as to deliver the liquid at nearly the required rate .
The ring slipped backwards and forwards , bends the siphon more or less , and regulates the flow through it .
Solution of Chloride of Calcium in water.-A solution of chloride of calcium , nearly saturated at 280 C. , was taken as the starting-point or solution of maximum saline contents .
Half of this solution was mixed with an equal volume of water ( solutioni 2 ) .
Half of solution 2 was mixed with its own volume of water , giving solutionl 3 , and so on .
In -this manner , without knowing the absolute strength of solution 1 , we know that the successive strengths of the saline solutions , whether there be loss of volume owing to chemical union or not , are as 8 4 , .
0 .
These numbers give exactly the relative quantity of solid matter in a unit of volume of the liquid .
As , however , solution 1 on dilution evolves heat and therefore probably contracts , the sizes of the drops cannot be derived directly from their weights .
The specific gravity of each solution has to be determined experimentally .

The comparatively small quantity of solid matter in 28 causes the drop to diminish about -th of its volume .
We must bear in mind that the successive increments of solid matter may affect the size of the drop in opposite directions , -by affecting the * The first number from six , the following numbers from four determninations of the weight of 30 drops .
cohesion of the water , by asserting its own cohesion , by increasing the gravity of the liquid and thereby determining an earlier separation of the drop , and , in this particular case , by the chemical affinity of the solid to the liquid , and the probable formation of hydrates .
It is seen that these influences cause an irregularity in the diminution of the size of the drop as it acquires more solid matter .
In fact , it is only when the liquid has the considerable strength of that the diminution in drop-size becomes continuous .
In fig. 2 , C shows graphically the relation between drop-size and strength .
The abscissoe represent the strengths of the solution progressing in geometric Fig. 2 .
A ' B ratio ; the ordinates show the corresponding comparative drop-sizes .
It may be remarked that the curve C bears a striking resemblance to the curve A , as though increase in solid constituent produced a similar effect upon the drop-size as increase in the time-interval on the drops of a homogeneous liquid .
We may also notice the great difference in size between a drop of water and a drop of oil under the same conditions .
From Table IV .
we find that a drop of oil of specific gravity *91 95 has the weight *05986 when gt=2 " .

We shall have to study this point more especially hereafter .
On account of the chemical union which takes place on dissolving Ca Cl in water , it would be useless to give the absolute strengths of the various solutions .
Solution of Nitrate of Potash in water.-Nitrate of potash was the next solid examined , on account of the probable non-existence of hydrates .

Afterwards 222222 1 34/ ( T5 -67 ) the size of the drop is partially recovered .
There is a stage of dilution when the specific gravity is 1P0680 , where the drop-size is a miiiinium .
Further , it is seein from columni 5 that the quaiitity of nitre in a drop increases continually tus the strength of the solutioni inicreases , although both the weight and the volume of the drop vary .
Inversely , the regularity of the variation of drop-size , in the case of nitre , points to the absenec of hydrates of that body .
It would be delusive to endeavour to construct a formula connecting the specific gravity with the drop-size or drop-weight of the solution ; but , as before , a graphic representation serves to show the connliexionl between the variables .
In curve D , fig. 2 , the abscissee represen:t the quantity of nitrate of potash in solution , the ordinates show the corresponding dropsizes .
As with chloride of calcium , it is seen that the drop-size of water is larger than that of any solution ol ' nitre .
Curve E , fig. 2 , having the same abscissme as D , has ordiniates which represent the drop-weights .
It is confessedly a matter of great interest , and still greater difficulty , to determine exactly the relation which exists between a dissolved solid and its solvent-that is , to find out whether or when a solid should be viewed as being in combiniation with a portion of the liquid in which it is dissolved .
Such questions may perhaps receive additional light from experiments similar to the above , but more extensive , and performed with this special object in view .
Comparing the curves C and D , for instance , there can be little doubt that the secolndary maxima and minimna of C are owing to the existence of hydrates of chloride of calcinn in solution .
The only known hydrates of chloride of calcium are Ca Cl , 2 I-I0 and Ca Cl , 6 1O , the latter of which contains 5017 per cent. of Ca Cl. Solution S contains about 42 5 per cent. It is noteworthy that , while the six-water chloride in the solid state absorbs heat on solutioni , the solution S evolves h}eat on dilution , as already mentioned .
In the case of iiitre we have in the drop-sizes evidence only of the opposite efforts of two cohesions , that of the water and that of the nitre .
By pursuing this direction of experimental inquiry , evidence may probably be got concerning the truth of Berthollet 's hypothesis of reciprocal recomposition in the case of the mixture of the solution.s of two salts , AX and BY , where AY and BX are also soluble in water .
