An Experiment On Aloe Americana Serrati-folia weighed ; seeming to import a Circulation of the Sap in Plants , by the same Dr. Merret .
August 4 .
1656 .
this Aloes weighed 21 Ounces , 6 Drams , 2 Grains .
Its colour was of a pale-green , consisting of 11 Leaves ; it was bound about with a red dry Cloth , and was hung up without Oil , as is usual , in the Kitchen .

19 30 12 2 49 So that in a whole year it lost 2 Ounces , 3 Drams , 24 Grains .
The succeeding year being drier and hotter , it lost 3 Ounces , 2 1/ 2 Scruples , and more than double in the 6 colder , than the 6 hotter Moneths .
I kept it about 5 years , and it decreased much about the same proportion .
And in the year 1660 , hanging it in a colder Garret , it perished .
These Observables I had about it , that every Year two of the greater Leaves first changed Colour , and withered ; and in the Spring-time , there grew out two very fresh and green ones , never amounting to the bigness of any of the precedent ; insomuch , that all this time I had the same number of Leaves .
And then , these new Leaves were more fresh and green , and not serrated , and thicker also in proportion to their other Dimensions .
Whence perhaps it may probably be inferred , vid .
from the growth of these latter Leaves , that there is a Circulation in this Plant of the Succus nutritius .
For , how is it possible , that the Roots , continuing as firm and solid as at first , should supply so much nourishment , as to procreate new Leaves , unless it were from the return of the said Succus , from the old and decaying Leaves , into the Root , and there protruded for the production of new ones ?
For , all Bulbous Roots , as Garlic , Onions , Tulips , and especially Squils , who protrude their Leaves , placed in a Shop or House , have their Roots lighter , and more spungy ; the Leaves being formed out of the substance of the Root , as a Chick out of the Albumen ; in the mean while the whole decreasing in weight , as in the aforesaid Aloe ; as it is manifest by many Experiments made by me .
