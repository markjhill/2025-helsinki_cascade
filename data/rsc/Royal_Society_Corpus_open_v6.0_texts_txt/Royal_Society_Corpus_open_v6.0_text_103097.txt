The Natural History and Description of the Phaenicopterus or Flamingo ; with two Views of the Head , and three of the Tongue , of that beautiful and uncommon Bird .
By James Douglass , M. D. Reg. Soc. S. NOME N. IT was the famous Comical Poet Aristophanes , that first makes mention of this Bird by the Name of ~ ( a ) , and not long after it is called ~ ~ ( b ) by Philostratus in his Life of Apollonius Tyaneus .
Apicius , Plinius , Suetonius , Fuvenal , and other Latin Writers , retain the Greek Word , and call it Phaenicopterus .
Bellonius ( c ) says , that in French it is named le Flement or Flambant .
Scaliger affirms , that in Provence they call it Flammant : And ( d ) Gesner says it may be called Avis Rubra per excellentiam ( e ) Aldrovandus writes , that in Sardinia it goes by the Name of Fiamingo ; and de Laet tells us , the Spaniards in the West Indies call it Flamenco .
Dr. Charlton and Dr. Grew convert the Greek Appellation into English , naming it the Phaenicopter : And Sir Hans Sloane , in his Catalogue of Jamaica Birds annexed to Mr. Ray 's Synopsis Avium , stiles it the Flamingo .
( f ) Du Tertre calls it le Flamand , which differs but little from the Name given it by Bellonius : And ( a ) Aristoph .

to mention no more .
( g ) Du Hamel says it is commonly called Becharu in France .
Etymologia .
All these differing Names may be easily accounted for , from the Colour most praedominant in its Wings .
Thus Martial ( Epigram 58 .
Lib. III .
) says of this Bird : Nomenque debet quae rubentibus pennis .
And again ( Epigr .
71 .
Lib. XIII .
) he makes it give the true Derivation of its own Name ; Dat mihi penna rubens nomen .
The Greek Name is compounded of two , viz ~~ , puniceus , ruber , and ~ , Ala , a Wing , quod sit rubentibus Alis ; which thing in different Words is expressed as follows , by the several Authors I have consulted .
Bellonius says it is called in French Flambant , not only from the Date-Colour of its Wings , a Dactylorum colore , i. e. a Scarlet or light red , like the Fruit of the Palm or Date~ Tree called in Greek ~ ; but also from the Lustre of the Colour resembling Flame : or as Aldrovandus has it , quod velut ignis instar ejus rubedo emicet .
The Words of Gesner are , Ego Gallicum nomen a rubro &amp; flammeo rostri , crurum , pennarumque in aliquibus partibus colore inditum sse conjecerim : aut forte quoniam ex Flandria hyeme ad Narbonensis Provinciae maritima volat ; nam Flan~ drum Galli Flammant appellant : vel a corporis proceritate , quales solent esse Flandri .
Mr. Willoughby ( h ) says the French name it thus rather from the flammeous Colour of the Wings and Feet , than that it comes in the Winter Time ( g ) Hist. de l ' Acad. Royale , p. 213 .

from Flanders .
For he believes there was scarce ever seen in Flanders a Bird of that kind ; so far are they from being common there , and flying from thence into other Countries .
( k ) Dr. Grew believes it named in Greek from the Scarlet Colour of its Wings ; and Flamment in French for the same Reason .
Du Hamel explains its Name Becharu by Aratri-rostrum , ( quasi Bec-Charrue ) quoniam rostrum ejus aratri instar inflectitur .
Genus .
All Authors , from Aristophanes down to Aldrovandus , have accounted the Phaenicopterus a Bird of the Palmipede or web~footed kind ; and tho ' this last named Author will not allow it to be so , yet he is forced to own that it is not a true Fissipede or digitated Fowl ; nam &amp; membranae digitos sepientis quoddam habet rudimentum , are his own Words .
Dr. Charlton only , among all the later Natural Historians , has approved of his Division , and accordingly ranked the Phaenicopter in the Class of Aquatic Fissipedes .
But that it is a Water-Fowl all agree ; Aristophanes calls it ~ , i. e. palustris ; and Aldrovandus says of it , Avis est aquas amans : not to mention others .
Differentiae .
I find Authors are silent as to the different Sorts of this Bird , only Aldrovandus gives us two Figures thereof that are not alike .
Locus Natalis .
This Bird is found in three of the Principal Parts of the World , that is , in Africa , America and Europe .
Heliodorus ( AEthiop .
Lib. 6 .
) calls it ~ ~ , a Bird of the Nile ; and the old Scholiast upon Juvenal ( Sat. xi .
ver .
139 .
) affirms , that abundans est in Africa ; and Du Hamel 's Words are , Inter animantes ( ~ ) Museaum Reg. Soc. p. 67 .
quae sua mole commendantur , Avis illa ex AEgyto allata est , quam Veteres ob plumas in Alis rubeas Phaenicopterum dixere .
John de Laet writes , that there is an Abundance of them in the Island of Cuba , as also at the Isle called Rocca , lying on the Coast of the Province of Venezuela in South America ; and Rochfort says the same thing of the Island of St. Domingo .
( l ) Dampier saw some few of them at Sal , one of the Cape Virde Islands : He hath likewise seen some of them at Rio la Hacha ; also at an Island near the Main of America right against Querisao , called by the Privateers Flamingo-Key , from the Multitude of these Fowls that breed there ; and he never saw of their Nests and Young but there only .
Tho ' these winged Creatures live for the most part in those hot Countries , yet they sometimes visit us here in Europe , and so may be accounted amongst the Migratory Kind or Birds of Passage , which is confirmed by the Testimonies of several Authors : For~ Bellonius told us long ago , migrant ultra mare , and are often taken in Italy , and oftner in Spain .
( m ) Gassendus says they are frequently catched in the fenny Grounds and Marshes about Arles in Provence , upon the Rhone .
Gesnerus .
Quidam mihi retulit avem hanc non procul a Monte-Pessulano capi .
He says in another Place , that they swim in Flocks not far from the Shore in Mediterraneo Mari Gallico .
Willoughby writes , that in hard Weather in the Winter Time , it comes over to the Coast of Provence ( and is often taken about Martiquez , a Sea-Port Town in that Country ) and inLanguedoc , and is frequently found about Montpelier : But whence it comes and where it is bred , ( l ) Damp .

to me , says he , is unknown .
N. B. This Passage is not in the Latin Edition of his Works , but added to the English which was published two Years after the first .
However , he says positively , that they do n't come from Flanders , where they are so far from being common , as some allege , that there never was one seen in that Country .
( n ) Dr. Charleton informs his Reader that he was presented with the Skin of one of these Birds , well stuffed and dried , by a Gentleman at his Return from the University of Montpelier , near which Place it had been taken .
Hujus exuvias rite conditas infertasque mihi dono dedit praenobilis Juvenis D. Thomas Crew Eq. Aurat .
( o ) Dr Lister says , Frequens est Phoenicopterus in paludibus maritimis ad mare Mediterraneum Provinciae &amp; Languedociae .
Whether this Bird were known to Aristotle is a Question : for all our Writers of Natural History agree , that the Phoenicopterus is no where mentioned by Name by the Philosopher ; yet they can hardly believe that he was ignorant of a Bird so clearly described by his Contemporary Aristophanes .
Mirum est , says Gesner , hujus tam pulchrae &amp; eximiae Avis nomen ab Aristotele taceri , cum Aristophanes , qui vixit eadem aetate , meminerit .
Sed Graecis etiam raram esse hanc avem puto .
Bellonius thinks that Aristotle described this Bird under the Name of Glottis or Lingulaca .
as Theodorus Gaza translates it .
Aldrovandus is of the same Opinion , but Gesner and Scaliger are not ; for the first says , Ego vero iis quas Gallinulas aquaticas nostri vocant avibus Glottidem adnumero , quae emnes fissipedes sunt : And the latter in his Commentary upon this Passage says .
Glottis autem quae sit nondum mihi constat .

Victus Ratio , Nidificatio , Volatus , &amp;c. Gesner says , circa lacus &amp; paludes victitat , and that it seeds on Perwinkles and Fish : And by Dampier 's Account we learn , that they delight to keep together in Flocks , and seed in Mud and Ponds , or in such Places where there is not much Water ; that they are very shy , and therefore it is hard to shoot them ; that they build their Nests in shallow Ponds , where there is much Mud , which they scrape together , making little Hillocks , like small Islands , appearing out of the Water , a Foot and an half from the Bottom : They make the Foundation of these Hillocks broad , bringing them up tapering to the Top , where they leave a small hollow Pit to lay their Eggs in .
And when they either lay their Eggs or hatch them , they stand all the while , not on the Hillock , but over it , with their Legs on the Ground in the Water , resting themselves against the Hillock , and covering the hollow Nest upon it with their Wings : For their Legs are very long , and building thus , as they do , upon the Ground , they could neither draw their Legs conveniently into their Nests , nor sit down upon them otherwise than by resting their whole Bodies there , to the Prejudice of their Eggs or Young , were it not for this admirable Contrivance , which they have by natural Instinct .
They never lay more than three Eggs , and seldom sewer .
The young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown ; but will run prodigiously fast .
Thus far Dampier .
Du Tertre , in his History of the Isles , &amp;c. gives these further Circumstances .
Ces oyseaux , dit il , ont le ton de la voix si fort , qu'il n'y a personne , en les entendant , qui no creust que ce sont des trumpets qui sonnent .
Ils sont toujours en bands , &amp; pendant qu'ils ont ~ teste cachee , barbodans l ' eau comme les Cygnes , pour trouver leur mangeaille , il ya toujours un en sentinelle tout de bout , le col etendu du , l'oeil circonspect , &amp; la teste inquiete .
Si tossed qu'il appercoit quelqu'un , il son la trompette , donne l'alarme au quartier , prend le vol tout le premier , &amp; tous les autres le suivent .
Ils volent en ordre comme les Grues ; que si l ' on les peut surprendre , ils sont si facile a tuer , que les moindres blessures les font demeurer sir la place .
Ils sont rares &amp; no se voyent jamais , si non dans les salines le plus eloignees du Peuple .
On les ecorche , &amp; de leur peaux on fait de fourreurs , que l ' on dit etre tres utile a ceux qui sont travaillez des froideurs &amp; debilite d ' estomac ( p ) Rochfort likewise informs us , That Ils ont l ' Ouye &amp; l ' Odorat si subtle , qu'ils eventent de loin les chasseurs , &amp; les arms a feu .
Pour eviter aussi tout surprise , ils se posent volontiers en des lieux decouverts , &amp; au milieu de marecages , d'ou ils peuvent appercevoir de loin leurs ennemis ; &amp; il ' y en a toujours un de la band qui fait le guet .
Ils sont gras &amp; ont la chair assez delicate .
On conserve leur peau qui est convert d'un mol duvet , pour etre employ aux mesmes usages que celles du Cygne &amp; du Vautour .
De Laet observes , that these Birds are so accustomed to Salt Water , that the Indians , when they tame them , mix Salt with the fresh Water for them ; else they pine away and die .
And though Aristophanes says it is ~~ ~ , or not used to be tame ; yet Gassendus writes , that M. Varius , President of the Parliament at Aix in Provence , and a great Friend of M. Peireso , used to divert himself with feeding them with Bread moistned with Water , which they commonly eat in the Night and not in the Day Time .
The same learned Person observed , that they could discern the Approach of cold Weather , and would come to the Fire , so as sometimes to burn their Feet ; and that when one Foot pained them , they would go upon the other , using their Bill instead ( p ) Histoire des Antilles .
of the burnt Foot ; That they slept standing upright on one Foot , with the other drawn up to their Breast among their Feathers : And lastly , that very little Sleep served their Turn .
Usus .
This beautiful and scarce Bird was much esteemed by the Romans , and frequently made use of in their costly Sacrifices and sumptuous Entertainments .
Thus Suetonius ( q ) describing the equisite Sacrifices which were appointed by the mad Emperor Caligula to be offered to himself as a Divinity , says of them , Hostiae erant Phaenicopteri , Pavones , Tetraones , Numidicae , Meliagrides , Phasianae , quae generatim per singulos dies immolarentur .
And the same Historian relates further ( r ) , that this Emperor pridie quam periret sacrificans respersus est Phaenicopteri sanguine .
That the Tongue of this Volatile was much commended , and in great Esteem , for its excellent Taste and most delicious Relish , will appear from the following Quotations .
And first we read in Pliny ( s ) , that Apicius said the Tongue of this Bird was a delicious and savory Bit , Phaenicopteri linguam praecipui esse saporis Apicius docuit , nepotum omnium altissimus gurges .
The Poet Martial says the same thing in the aforecired Epigram : Dat mihi penna rubens nomen : sed lingua gulosis Nostra sapit ; And Juvenal ( t ) in that Satyr where he exposes the extravagant Luxury and Gluttony of the Romans , men(q ) Suetonii Caligula , ~ .

tions this Fowl , amongst some others equally rare , that they made use of in their Feasts .
Et Scythicae volucres &amp; Phaenicopterus ingens .
We read in Suetonius how the Emperor Vitellius had them often served at his Table , with a great many more Varieties brought from the most distant Parts of the Universe ; his Words are , ( u ) In hac Scarorum jocinera , Phasianorum cerebella , linguas Phaenicopterum , Muraenarum lactes a Carpathio usque fretoque Hispaniae per Navarchos ac Triremes petitarum commiscuit ; hoc est , ab extremis imperii sinibus Orientum versus &amp; Occidentem .
And Heliogabalus , another of the Roman Emperors , as Lampridius writes , treated his Courtiers with sumptuous nice Dishes made of the Inwards and Brains of Phaenicopters , exhibuit Palatinis ingentes dapes extis &amp; cerebellis Phaenicopterorum refertas .
What is related by Gassendus , in the Life of that learned Nobleman Peireskius , is no Argument against the excellent Relish of the Tongue of this Bird .
For his Friend Varius , who therein seems to contradict the received Opinion , was at that Time just upon the Recovery from a long illness ; he had no Appetite , loathed all Sorts of Meats , and mended but very slowly ; so that its no Wonder if he did not perceive all the Relish of that nice Bit , for which of old it was so much commended .
Besides , his Answer is not as to the Tongue , which was owned to be much sweeter than that of a Kid , but to the Flesh of this Bird , ( as will appear from the Original .
) Rogatus subinde fuit de sapore carnis Phaenicopteri .
Excepit autem mirari se , cur illam Apicius apud Plinium , &amp; Imperatores Caligula &amp; Vitellius apud Suetonium , Heliogabalus apud Lampridium , &amp; nonnulli alii tantis in deliciis habuissent .

The Tongue of this Bird , as Apicius said , was a delicious Morsel amonst the Romans .
N. B. In the Treatise de Obsoniis &amp; Condimentis , that goes under the Name of Apicius , there 's no mention made of the Tongue of this Fowl : For as Dr. Lister well observes , Apicius noster hic silet de linguae praecipuo sapore : Which is a pretty convincing Proof , that this Book de re coquinaria , is only a Collection made by some modern Roman ; the Name of the old Apicius , that great Master of the Art of Eating , being only prefixed to it , for the Benefit of the Bookseller .

Descriptio Partium .
Magnitudo .
According to Bellonius this Bird is of the Bigness of the Fowl he calls Elorius , which is our ~ .
Scaliger compares it to the Heron , magnitudo ei Ardeae .
Gesner says it is as big as a Ciconia or Stork , or rather bigger .
Aldrovandus writes , de magnitudine ejus ego nihil certi ossero , quia Avem ~ vidi .
Dampier .
The Flamingo is a sort of large Fowl much like the Heron in Shape , but bigger and of a reddish Colour .
Du Tertre .
~ Flamand est un oiseau gros comme un Oye sauvage .

It hath an extraordinary long Neck according to Mr. Willoughby .
Du Tertre .
Il a le cou rouge , fort menu pour la ~ de l ' oyseau , &amp; long d'une demi Toise .
Cauda .
Scaliger .
Caudam habet brevissimam ac veluti praecisam .
Rostrum &amp; Caput .
Scaliger writes , that the Bill of this Fowl is neither straight nor altogether crooked : Rostrum neque rectum plane , sed neque aduncum habet , Scythici arcus partem potius imitatur .
Gesner , who compares this Bird to the Crane for Bigness , adds , Rostro sequialtera fere longitudine ad Ciconiae rostrum , superius crasso &amp; tuberculis quibusdam aspero .
Aldrovandus commends the Account Scaliger gives of the Bill , and then adds , in Rostri autem conformatione non parum lusit Natura ; non enim ut Anatum aut Anserum planum est , cum alioqui sit latum , neque ut Ardearum rectum &amp; rotundum , neque denique ut rapacium Aquilarum aut Accipitrum aduncum ; cum tamen sit curvum ~ &amp; ~ inflexum , sed in medio superioris mandibulae notabili ~rantia insigne , sex digitos longum , intus cavum &amp; canaliculatum media sui part .
Superior etiam mandibula ~ longior est , &amp; in acutissimam aciem definite ; contra vero inferior longe crassior .
Du Tertre .
Il a la teste ronde &amp; petite , a laquelle est ~tache un gros bec , long de quatre pouces , moitie rouge &amp; moitie noire , &amp; recourbe en form de cueilliere .
Olaus Wormius gives the following Description of the Head and Bill of the Phaenicopter , which he had sent him from a Friend , viz. Caput longitudine uncias octo superabat .
Ipsum caput , excepto rostro , trium erat .
Rostrum ipsum figuram a Scaligero delineatam obtinet , in medio crassum satis sed cavum , superiore ejus part utrinque ad latera caniculatum ; ad sui exortum duobus grandibus foramlnibus olfactui deputatis praeditum , in extremitate aduncum , intern denticulatum cum costa seu eminentia in medio .
Pars vero inferior nigra , frequentibus praedita striis ad extremum excurrentibus ; longitudine vero cedit superiori , sed ampla est et capax , crassae linguae , quae aberat , excipiendae apta .
Dr. Grew has obliged us with a very curious Account of the Bill of this Bird , for which he says it is most remarkable .
The Figure of each Beak is truly Hyperbolical : The upper Jaw is ridged behind , before plain or flat , and pointed like a Sword , with the Extremity bended a little downwards : Within it hath an Angle or sharp Ridge , which runs all along the Middle , at the Top of the Hyperbole , not above a quarter of an Inch high : The lower Beak in the same Place above one Inch high , hollow , and the Margins strangely expanded inward , for the Breadth of above a quarter of an Inch , and somewhat convexly .
They are both furnished with black Teeth , as I call them from their Use , of an unusual Figure , scil .
slender , numerous , and parallel as in Ivory Combs ; but also very short , scarce the eighth Part of an Inch deep .
An admirable Invention of Nature , by the Help of which and of the sharp Ridge above-mentioned , this Bird holds his slippery Prey the faster .
Mr. Ray describes the Rostrum to be latiusculum , singularis &amp; insolitae figurae ; mandibula nempe superior incurva , depressa , dentata ; inferior crassior .
Menippus , the Cynic Philosopher , in a Fragment of his de Homine ( which however at this Time is either lost , or at least hard to be come at ) affirms this Bird to move its upper Jaw , as we find him quoted by ( y ) Rondeletius , where he is talking of the Crocodile 's moving that Mandible : His Words are , sed id non soli ex omnibus animalibus Crocodilo peculiar , nam intra Aves , Phaenicopterus superiorem partem Rostri movet , ut annotavit Menippus Philosophus , Libro de Homine .
Gesner makes the very same Quotation from Rondeletius .
( z ) Cardanus repeats the same thing without Mention of any Author , nam quidam existimant etiam Phoeni(y ) Rondel .
Lib. de Amphibiis , Chap. 5 .
( z ) Carden de Amphibiis Rerum , Lib. 7 .
Cap. 37 .
copteros aves Mandibulam movere superiorem ; but subjoins , sed non adeo manifesta causa est in Ave ut in Crocodilo .
Wormius is of the same Opinion ; but with Cardan , he thinks the Cause is not so manifest as in the Crocodile .
Dr. Charleton says , that it was Cardanus that first made that Observation .
Dr. Grew argues for this Movement from the peculiar Structure of the Rostrum ; alleging , however , that there can be no Determination of these Matters , without Inspection into the Muscles , and the Articulation of the Bones .
As for the Phaenicopter , says he , it must needs be said , that the Shape and Bigness of the upper Beak ( which here , contrary to what it is in all other Birds that I have seen , is thinner and far less than the neither ) speaks it to be the more fit for Motion , or to make the Appulse , and the neither to receive it .
Crura &amp; Pedes .
Bellonius remarks , that the Legs of this Volatile are very long .
And on the contrary , *Scaliger writes , Crura pedesque sunt adeo breves , ut cum in Homine Galenus agnoverit longissimos , huic omnium , quae nota sunt nobis , animalium brevissimos attribuere potuerit .
For this he is severely taxed by Dr. Charlton , hic nobis candid not andus occurrit error quidam Scaligeri egregius : Is nimirum in Exercit in Arist .

Ad haec , non aliunde fuit quam a proceritate crurum &amp; colli , quod Phaenicopterus clim a Juvenale ingens diceretur .
Dr. Grew observes the same Mistake , but in fewer Words , which are the following ; when Scaliger therefore saith that this Bird hath the shortest Legs of any Animal yet known , he would have said the longest .
Gesner says , it is Cruribus rubris , ea proceritate qua in Ciconia sunt , vel procerioribus .

Scaliger thus elegantly expresses the fine Colour of its Wings Cinereum colorem nobilitant alarm puniceae pennae .
Aldrovandus .
Mirum est cur nigrum alarm colorem non annotavit Scaliger .
Caetera tota Avis ex cinereo , phaeniceo &amp; albo coloribus mistis spectalur .
Gesner says , Pennis albis part prona ; rubentibus per Collum , Pectus , Ventrem &amp; Alas .
And speaking of one taken near Montpellier , he says , tota alba , praeter illas in alis parts quae nigrae sunt in Ciconiis ( z ) De Laet observes , that while they are young their Feathers are chiefly white ; but as they grow up , they are painted with an Infinity of Colours .

Du Tertre gives much the same account .

Willoughby says , the Neck and Body is white : The Alarm Remiges , or Quill-Feathers of the Wings , are black ; but the Vestivrices , or Covert-Feathers , are wholly dyed with a most beautiful , bright purple , or flame Colour , unde ei nomen .
Dampier .
The young ones at first are of a light grey ; and as their Wing-Feathers spring out , they grow darker , and never come to their right Colour , or any beautiful Shape , under ten or eleven Months old .
When many of them are standing together by a Pond 's Side , being half a Mile distant from a man , they appear to him like a Brick Wall ; their Feathers being of the Colour of a new red Brick : And they commonly stand upright and single , one by one exactly in a Row , except when feeding , and close by each other .
Color Pedum .
All Authors agree in the red Colour of its Legs and Feet .
Thus Scaliger , Crura pedesque alis habet concolores .

Color Rostri .
Gesner says , Colore rubro instar sanguinis .
Aldrovandus writes , Pars quae spectat frontem ex albo ad Castaneae colorem vergit , caetero nigrum .
Willoughby asfirms , that the Tip of the Bill is black , or of a dark blue .
Figurae .
The whole Fowl is delineated by Gesner and Aldrovandus ; and Dr. Grew has given us the Figure of the Head and Bill , as he found it amongst the Rarities in Greshum-College .
N. B. The Figure of the Phaenicopter in Willoughby , is copied from the second of Aldrovandus .
Gesner says the Phaenicopterus whence his Figure was taken , was sent to him by Rondeletius .
Aldrovandus had the first of his Figures from Sardinia ; and the second .
which he calls Phaenicopterus alter rostro lato , was given him by that famous Botanist Carolus Clusius : He owns that he never saw the Bird himself .
In de Rochfort , the Body and Neck of the Flammant is pretty well delineated ; but the Legs are not , neither is the Bill , nor the Claws .
( * ) Du Hamel gives a very exact Account of this Bird in the following Words , with which I 'll close this tedious and prolix Description , collected from all the Authors that have made any mention of the Phaenicopter or RedWing .

Oesophagus in sui initio valde angustus , paulatim latior sactus in ingluviem seu in saccum ampliorem desinit : Ventriculus fere ut in Gallina , tametsi Granis non vescitur , sed parvis Conchyliis , quae ventriculi musculis teruntur ut Grana .
This Author tells us that the Phaenicopter was dissected by Monsieur Perrault at Paris .
Alae cjus didictae colorem illum rutilum exhibent , unde vulgo Flamand dici solet , non quod in Belgio reperiatur , sed quia ejus Plumae per membranam pellucidam visae colorem flammeum praebent : Vix ulla est Avis major : Rostrum ex utraque part deorsum incurvatum , quod in ca Ave omnino est singular ; are atri enim instar inflectitur , unde &amp; vulgo Becharu , quasi Aratrirostrum , appellatur .
Haec ille .
When I get the Opportunity , which I do very much long for , of dissecting this fine Volatile with my own Hand , I shall then more particularly insist on the Anatomical Part ; and , with all the Exactness I can , give a true Description of each Viscus .
I proceed to the Explanation of the Figures , which were drawn from a Flamingo that was sent to Mr. Botley to be stuffed .
The Explanation of the Figures , Tab. II .
Fig. ~ .
Gives a Side-view of the Head and Bill .
Fig. II .
In this is represented a Front-view of the same Parts .
Fig III .
Exhibits the under-side of the Tongue next the under Bill .
In which a denotes a Cartilaginous Substance that covers the Tip or extremity of the Tongue ; ba Glandulous Substance at its Basis ; c the Horns of the Os Hyoeides .
Fig. IV .
In this the upper side of the Tongue is fairly delineated , upon which we see two Rows of strong Papillae Nerveae ; their Apices or Points turning inwards , for the better retention of the Prey .

Vdr : Gucht Sculp : Fig. V. In this the Tongue is drawn in a lateral View .
that we may have a Prospect of the true Figure of these Papillae , which being hooked and turned backwards prevent , in a great Measure , the return of any little Animal swallowed alive , which they seed upon .
Fig. VI .
The Cornua or Horns of the Os Hyoidaeum are drawn in this last Figure , as all the other Parts are , as big as the Life .
