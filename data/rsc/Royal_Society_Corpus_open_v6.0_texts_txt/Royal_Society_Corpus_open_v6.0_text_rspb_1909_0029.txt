) Introduction .
The aim of the following experiments was to ascertain whether bacteria suspended in an electrolyte through which a current passes are transmitted to either electrode , and if so , whether pathogenic organisms could be collected and extracted by such means from pathological liquids .
Method of Experiment .
The first observations as to a possible migration of bacteria under the action of an electric current were made in the following way :\#151 ; A cover square was fitted with two platinum foil terminals , separated about 6 mm. from each other .
A drop of weak bacterial emulsion made electrical connection between these two terminals , and was prevented from evaporating by another cover square resting on the top of the first one , the edges of which were greased ; the " glass cell , " as it may be called , was then mounted on a stand ( fig. 1 ) , which rested on the stage of a microscope , and a current of about 1 milliampere sent through it .
Fig. 1 .
It was at once found that the bacteria , viz. , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococci , M. melitensis , B. tuberculosis , B. coli , B. typhosus , B. of Gaertner , B. pyocyaneus , and Hoffmann 's bacillus , moved towards one electrode , theii direction of movement being reversed on reversal of the current ; the velocity of transmission was approximately estimated at about 1/ 100 mm. per minute ( under the particular conditions of pressure and sectional aiea ) .
The Electrical Reactions of certain , etc. 315 It was a matter of considerable difficulty to keep a particular bacillus continuously in view and thus watch its migration ; to obviate this , and in view of the possibility of the observed movement being due to some variation of surface tension of the fluid under the influence of the current , the experimental arrangements were altered and observations made in the following way:\#151 ; An emulsion of the Bacillus coli was made by pouring normal saline upon a fresh agar culture of the organism , sweeping the growth by a platinum loop into the saline , and pouring it into a test-tube , which was then sealed in the blow-pipe ; by thorough agitation an even emulsion was made ; some of this emulsion was then poured into a glass U-tube , fitted with platinum terminals which just dipped beneath the liquid ; a current from Leclanchd cells was sent through the emulsion .
Observations at frequent intervals showed that the bacilli were accumulating under the anode in one limb of the U-tube ; after several hours a dense column had formed , the fluid in the opposite limb becoming clear ; reversing the current reversed the direction of motion of the bacteria .
A systematic series of tests was next undertaken with different bacteria in various electrolytes .
To expedite the work , four similar U-tubes were mounted on a stand as seen in fig. 2 , and observations made simultaneously of the behaviour of the bacteria when suspended in different electrolytes , the same current traversing the four solutions in series .
The current was measured by a tangent galvanometer in circuit , and the voltage between the terminals of the U-tubes by a voltmeter when required .
Usually 4-per-cent , solutions of the electrolytes were used ; with weaker solutions , i per cent. , gravitation of the bacteria to the bottom of the U-tubes occurred before the electrical effect was evident .
Mr. C. Russ .
[ May 21 It was thus found that:\#151 ; ( 1 ) The accumulation at an electrode varies in degree with different species in the same electrolyte .
( 2 ) The accumulation at an electrode varies for the same species in different electrolytes .

] The Electrical Reactions certain , 317 It was important to decide the relationship of these bacterial movements to the bacterial vitality .
In point of fact the accumulation occurs in boiled , dead , as well as in living cultures .
As regards the probable nature of the movement of the bacteria under the action of the current , we are in the presence of the following alternatives:\#151 ; ( 1 ) If bacteria possess electric charges , they might be attracted to the electrode of opposite sign , and migration of the bacilli would ensue .
( 2 ) Minute particles suspended in fluids , through which a current is sent , are known to be directed to the electric terminals .
During the course of this work solutions have been found in which no movement of the bacilli was effected by the current .
It will be seen from some experiments to be described , that the phenomena are hardly to he explained on the lines indicated above .
( 3 ) When a current passes through an electrolyte , the usually accepted view of the main processes therein involved is that there is a movement through the solution of the ions of the solute in opposite directions towards the electrodes .
If we suppose that some chemical affinity exists between the ions and the bacteria , there is at once the possibility of migration of the bacteria towards the electrode ; the transmission of the bacteria to the anode in one electrolyte , and the cathode in another ( e.g. , the tubercle bacillus proceeds to the anode in sodium chloride , and to the cathode in ammonium sulphate ) can be attributed to a chemical affinity between them and the ions of the electrolyte .
The migration of bacteria in electrolytes having been established , the next step was to ascertain whether bacteria present in very small numbers in a pathological liquid would be transmitted to either electrode in an electrolyte , and thus concentrated in a small volume of liquid for further examination .
With this object in view , the tubercle bacillus in urine was chosen because of the convenience in recognising the organisms without there being any necessity of undertaking cultivation work .
The chief conditions required for the purposes of these experiments are that the electrolyte ( 1 ) should conduct electricity well , ( 2 ) should not be destructive of organic matter , ( 3 ) should form a colourless fluid in aqueous solution , ( 4 ) should yield no metal or metallic oxide as a result of electrolysis ; for such action has been found to mask bacterial aggregation .
The search for a suitable electrolyte for the tubercle bacillus proved a long and laborious one .
The general method of experimenting was practically identical with that described in which the U-tubes were used .
The tubercle bacilli from glycerine agar cultures were ground in a mortar , made into an emulsion with water and added to the electrolytes under test .
Out of Mr. C. Russ .
[ May 21 .
43 substances ( a list of which is appended ) tried in this way , a decided aggregation was observed with ethylamine , ammonium sulphate , acetamide , and iodide of potash .
The first three will be noticed to contain an NH2 or NH4 group .
The aggregation in acetamide or potassium iodide is anodic , but weaker than the cathodic aggregation in ethylamine , or ammonium sulphate .
A curious effect was noticed with ammonium sulphate , viz. , an early aggregation at the cathode , soon followed by a sinking away of the massed organisms , resulting in the appearance of a clear zone between the bacterial cloud and the platinum foil .
This was probably the result of some secondary electrolysis at the terminal in question ; this disturbing action led to the abandonment of ammonium sulphate for the purposes of these experiments .
A good accumulation was found to occur with a mixture of ethylamine and lactic acid , the migration of the bacilli being towards the cathode ; separate tests indicated no reaction in lactic acid , and a moderate one with ethylamine alone .
The movement of the tubercle bacillus in normal urine was found to be slightly anodic .
The addition of urine to the lactic acid and ethylamine did not interfere with the aggregation of the tubercle bacilli at the cathode .
At the end of the test the presence of the bacilli in large numbers at the cathode , and their absence at the anode , was confirmed by making stained films from the cloudy and clear fluids round the respective poles .
It was , however , noticed in these films that the bacilli stained feebly after several hours of electrolysis in the ethylamine lactic acid and urine mixture ; this difficulty was overcome by the addition of bromic acid to the mixture .
The proportions of these substances found to be most satisfactory were:\#151 ; Ethylamine , 5-per-cent , solution ... ... One part .
Lactic acid , 10 " ... ... .
Four parts .
Bromic acid , 5 " ... ... .
Two parts .
Urine ... ... ... . .

One or two parts .
It may be useful to mention here that when electrolytes are added to urine , and the mixture electrolysed , there is formed at the cathode a white tiocculent substance which is insoluble in the fluid , but soluble in mineral and organic acids .
As this substance is easily mistaken ( in aggregation tests in urine ) for the bacterial cloud expected at the electrode , the solubility in acid should be tested for .
It may further be distinguished by its rapidity of appearance and bulkiness of the cloud , in which particulars it contrasts with the true bacterial massing at the foil ; the lactic acid used in the mixture above mentioned prevents its formation .
1909 .
] The Electrical Reactions certain Bacteria , etc. 319 In order to apply the observed aggregations of tubercle bacillus as a method of their extraction from tuberculous urine , the experimental arrangements were altered as follows:\#151 ; The modified U-tube ( fig. 3 ) was filled with a mixture of tuberculous Fig. 3 .
urine , ethylamine , lactic and bromic acids , thoroughly shaken previously .
In the narrow limb of the vessel a platinum foil strip was submerged , and served for the transmission of current through the main column of fluid .
The gases liberated at this foil escaped by the narrow limb , and were thus prevented from traversing the bulk of the fluid .
In the broad limb a glass tube was submerged slightly and traversed by a platinum wire , which just touched the fluid surface .
The lower end of the glass tube formed a bacterial trap by arranging the circuit so that the platinum wire was the cathode .
On passing a current the tubercle bacilli contained in the tuberculous urine in the vessel are conveyed to the cathode as in the U-tube experiments ; they eventually enter the fluid enveloped by the submerged end of the tube , and remain close to the platinum wire .
After sufficient time the wire was carefully lifted out , the glass tube slightly lowered in the vessel , the top of the tube closed by the wet or greased finger , and lifted away to a glass slide , and examined for tubercle bacilli .
The fluid contained in the trap was 2 or 3 minims in volume , and strongly alkaline at the end of the process , the bulk of the mixture remaining acid .
This alkaline fluid was acidified with a 10-per-cent , solution of acetic acid on the slide previously smeared with albumen fixative ; it was fixed by heat and stained by the ordinary Z N carbol fuchsin method .
Tubercle bacilli were found in small numbers in the early attempts .
The following experiment , in which the centrifuge and the electric current were compared in the detection of tubercle bacilli placed in very small numbers in a test fluid , is given in illustration of the power of the electrical method:\#151 ; 320 Mr. 0 .

[ May 21 , My colleague , Dr. Fletcher , prepared an emulsion of tubercle bacilli in water , and standardised to contain 1000 bacilli per cubic centimetre ; he thoroughly mixed | c.c. ( i.e. 500 " T. B. " ) of this emulsion with 100 c.c. of normal urine .
Allowing this mixture to stand for 24 hours in a conical vessel to assist sedimentation of the bacilli , he then siphoned off the supernatant three-quarters of its volume ; the remainder was centrifugalised ( 1/ 8 H.P. electric centrifuge ) three times .
In a stained preparation from the final deposit he found no tubercle bacilli .
I added | c.c. ( i.e. 500 tubercle bacilli ) of the same emulsion to 50 c.c. of normal urine , and made up the volume to 100 c.c. by adding bromic acid , lactic acid , and ethylamine , and thoroughly shaking the mixture .
This mixture was electrolysed in the vessel illustrated in fig. 3 .
After 21 hours ' electrolysis 128 tubercle bacilli were counted in the stained preparations made from the trap contents .

The film forms a permanent record of the experiment in each case .
These experiments concluded by repetition of this process in 12 cases , using always tuberculous urine , in which the bacilli had been previously found by the centrifuge .
During these cases , variations of the time the current passed and of its strength were introduced .
The results are collected in Table III , the main conclusions being ( 1 ) Tubercle bacilli were obtained in the trap upon the conclusion of every test .

] The Electrical Reactions of certain , etc. ( 2 ) They were present in larger numbers than would have been obtained in 2 or 3 minims of the original urine .
( 3 ) The transmission of the bacilli by the current is emphasised by the relatively large number of bacilli obtained in the trap when working with very much diluted solutions of the original urine .
( 4 ) The evidence is not complete that all the bacilli present in the urine used were conveyed into the trap ( though examinations of the " catch " were made at successive stages of the electrolysis ) .
The appearance of the bacilli in the films made from the trap is similar to that in a film from centrifuged urine , though the pus cells undergo dissolution with increasing alkalinity of the trap contents .
If the electrolysis was carried on for 24 to 36 hours the bacilli failed to take the stain properly ; such exposure , however , is unnecessary .
I am indebted to Mr. S. Russ , Demonstrator of Physics , Manchester University , for assistance with the electrical technique and measurements ; to Dr. Eastes for the use of his laboratory during the earlier part of the experimental work , and to Mr. Pardoe for tuberculous urine from St. Peter 's Hospital .
In conclusion , the results of the present preliminary investigation may be summarised as follows:\#151 ; Certain bacteria under the influence of a suitable current aggregate at one or other electrode .
The aggregation varies with the nature of the electrolyte , and is probably due to affinity between the products of electrolysis and the bacteria .
It occurs with killed as well as with living bacteria .
The aggregation by electrical currents affords a means of collection and examination .
The differences in behaviour of various bacteria are such as to suggest the possibility of utilising the method for purposes of specific discrimination ; but in this particular the data hitherto obtained are not sufficient to warrant definite statements .

[ Note.\#151 ; Since completing these experiments I have searched the literature of the subject with the following results :\#151 ; Abbot and Life ( ' American Journ. Physiol./ 1908 , p. 202 ) tested microscopic quantities of motile bacteria suspended in distilled water , and observed to-and-fro movements in a glass trough .
They used excessively minute currents , and concluded that variations in the observed reactions of the organisms depended upon their cultivation in acid or alkaline media .
They found no effects with dead or non-motile ( living ) species ; they avoided currents large enough to cause electrolysis , and concluded that their results were galvanotropic .
Apostoli and Laquerriere ( ' Compt .
Rend./ 1901 , vol. 133 , p. 186 ) concluded that constant currents are able to sterilise cultures or attenuate their virulence .
They studied especially the conditions necessary to produce such effects .
