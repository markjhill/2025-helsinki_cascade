The following communications were read I. " On the Brom-Iodides/ " By Dr. Maxwell Simpson , F.R.S. , Professor of Chemistry , Queen 's College , Cork .
Received November 4 , 1873 .
Some years ago I ascertained that chloride of iodine combines directly with the olefines and the non-saturated haloid ethers in the same manner as free chlorine or bromine .
I have since ascertained that bromide of iodine also enters into direct combination with these bodies .
In the following experiments I have invariably used a solution of bromide of iodine in water , which was prepared by adding rather more than a molecule of iodine in fine powder to a molecule of bromine previously mixed with about six times its weight of water .
The bromine was repeatedly agitated during the addition of the iodine , and kept cold by being surrounded by water .
An almost black liquid was thus obtained , which was separated from the excess of iodine .

An oily liquid soon made its appearance , ' which was the body in question ; it was then subjected to distillation , having been previously washed with dilute potash , and afterwards with distilled water .
Almost the entire quantity passed over without decomposition between 162 ' and 167 ' Cent. .

It has a sweet biting taste ; on exposure to light it becomes slightly coloured , from the separation of free iodine .
When subjected to the action of alcoholic potash , it yields iodide of potassium 5 and a gas burning with a green flame , which is doubtless bromide of : vinyl .
It is an isomer of the brom-iodide obtained by Pfaundler* , and afterwards by Eeboult , by exposing bromide of vinyl to the action of j hydriodic acid .

It was washed with dilute potash , then with water , and distilled .

The distillate was then analyzed , having been previously agitated with mercury to remove free iodine .

SHI 2*77 Notwithstanding the difference between the theoretical and experimental numbers , I believe this is a definite compound , and not a mixture of bromide and iodide of propylene .
The discrepancy probably arises from the slight decomposition which the body suffered during distillation .
Brom-iodide of propylene is , when freshly prepared , a colourless oily liquid ; it has a sweet and biting taste .
Treated with alcoholic potash , it yields iodide of potassium and brom-propylene ( C3 H5 Br ) . .
Iodo-dibrom-vinyl.\#151 ; When the brom-iodine solution and bromide ot vinyl are brought into contact , direct combination takes place , and this body is formed .
In order to complete their union , it is advisable ta heat them gently in a sealed tube .

" Contributions to the History of the Orcins.\#151 ; No. IV .
On the Iodo-derivatives of the Orcins/ - ' By John Stenhouse , LL. D. , F.R.S. , \amp ; c. Received November 10 , 1873 .
A preliminary notice on these compounds has already appeared in the ' Chemical News , ' vol. xxvi .
p. 279 ; and the present paper contains a more detailed account of my experiments .
In 1864* I published an account of a crystalline teriodorcin obtained by precipitating an aqueous solution of orcin with a solution of iodine monochloride , but I found I was unable to prepare any other iodine derivative of orcin by this process .
It seems probable , however , that the method devised some years ago by Prof. Hlasiwetzf , and communicated by him at the meeting of the " Naturforscher und Aerzte in Innsbruck , " would yield the lower substitution compounds .
This was found to be the case ; for on agitating an ethereal solution containing equal molecular weights of orcin and iodine with dry precipitated mercuric oxide , the colour rapidly disappears , and monoiodorcin is formed ; this may be obtained by distilling off the ether and crystallizing the residue from benzol , in order to separate an uncrystallizable oily compound which accompanies it .
It is , however , still contaminated with a small quantity of mercuric iodide , which obstinately adheres to the substance , and can only be removed by recrystallization from a dilute aqueous solution of potassium iodide ; this difficulty arises from the circumstance that mercuric iodide is more or less soluble in most of the liquids usually employed as solvents .
For this reason I found it advisable to substitute plumbic oxide for the corresponding mercury compound originally proposed by Hlasiwetz .
