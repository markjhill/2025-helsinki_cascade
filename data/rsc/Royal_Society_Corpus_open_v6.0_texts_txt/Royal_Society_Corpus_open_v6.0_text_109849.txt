] Each of these methods , says the author , is to be considered as direct , although it proceeds through the medium of Cassini 's approximation , which , as bear used , can only be regarded as a first step in the computation .
No hypothesis is introduced into the process , and therefore no correction of error by trial is requisite .
Of three methods proposed , one combines the advantages of Keill 's series and Cassini 's approximation together , and is regarded by the author as the most simple in theory , and most expeditious in practice , which has yet been proposed .
