( Abstract .
) Paleeocoryne is a new genus containing two species , and belongs to a new family of the Tubulaiidae .
The forms described were discovered in the lower shales of the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire coal-field , and an examination of their structure determined them to belong to the Hydrozoa , and to be parasitic upon Fenestellae .
The genus has some characters in common with Bimeria ( St. Wright ) , and the polypary is hard and ornamented .
The discovery of the trophosome , and probably part of the gonosome of a tubularine Hydrozoon in the Palaeozoic strata brings the order into geological relation with the doubtful Sertularian Graptolites of the Silurian formation , and with the rare medusoids of the Solenhofen stones .
