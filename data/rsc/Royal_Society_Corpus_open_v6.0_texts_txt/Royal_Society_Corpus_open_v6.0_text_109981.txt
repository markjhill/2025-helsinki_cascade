] Since the first notice of the determination of the mean density of the earth by Newton , two experimental inquiries only have been undertaken in relation to it ; namely , in the case of the Schehallien experiment by the author and by Dr. Maskelyne ; and by Mr. Cavendish , who used a method invented by Mr. Mitchell .
Dr. Hutton proposes in this paper to show by a statement of , and observations upon , the two methods , that the preference , in point of accuracy , belongs to the mountain experiment over that of the small balls employed by Mr. Cavendish ; and the results of this experiment , duly corrected by that of Mr. Playfair 's lithological survey of the mountain , give the mean density of the earth equal to 5 times the density of water , and not 4 5 , a number unfairly assumed on some occasions , as the author 's final determination .
In adverting to the advantage that might result from a repetition of the mountain experiment in some other favourable situation , and with improved means , Dr. Hutton suggests the employment of one of the large pyramids of Egypt for the purpose .
The mass , he says , is sufficiently large , and the station for the plummet or zenith sector might be taken much nearer the centre of the mass than on a mountain , which would give a larger quantity of deviation of the plummet .
The regular figure and known composition of the mass would also yield facilities in calculating its attraction ; and , moreover , the deviation of the plummet might be observed on all four sides .
