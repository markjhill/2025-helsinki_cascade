Colonel Pasley 's paper was resumed and concluded .
The present paper is occupied with the detail of the experiments made by the author in the prosecution of the object of his former inquiry , already submitted to the Royal Society , into the best means of obtaining an artificial Water Cement .
These experiments d were tried on a larger scale than the former , and were applied more especially to the practical purposesof building .
He recommends that the cement should not be applied in two coats , the surfaces being less likely to adhere when this is done , than if the whole cement is applied at once .
He succeeded in various ways , in forming cements which appeared to be the same , in all their properties , with natural cements : and he has now employed them in buildings on a scale sufficiently extensive , and in situations sufficiently exposed to the weather , to be brought to the test of experience in the course of time .
Some experiments were also made by the author , with the view of forming an artificial lithographic stone , by a calcined mix ?
ture of chalk and carbonate of magnesia : but their density could not be rendered such as to answer the purpose intended .
On the whole he draws the general conclusion , that in all attempts to imitate the water cements of nature b } ' artificial means , carbonate of lime must be the essential ingredient ; next to which in point of importance are silica and alumina .
The author succeeded in form ?
ing a very good cement by uniting these three ingredients .
By the addition of a small proportion either of the protoxide of iron or of the oxides oflead , or of manganese , the qualities of the compound were very much improved ; these latter ingredients appearing to produce a more intimate union of all of them , and a more speedy and permanent induration of the mass .
