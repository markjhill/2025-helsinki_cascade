" Practical Remarks on Annealing Flint-Glass .
" By Apsley Pellat , Esq. , of the Falcon Glass Works , Holland Street .
Communicated by Joshua Field , Esq. , F.R.S. This paper is entirely occupied with practical details relating to the art of annealing flint-glass and depriving it of colour , the author stating that he leaves the rationale of these facts to be explained by philosophers .
He thinks , however , that they are reconcileable with the theory of Scheele , as explained by Bergman , and detailed by Murray in his work on Chemistry .
