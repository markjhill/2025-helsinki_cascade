The same irregularity has been previously pointed out by Masson for the gelatin solutions of the sulphates of magnesium and lithium .
The attempt is made to explain this deviation from the requirements of theory , and also the difficulty that Kohlrausch is unable to assign to dyad elements any value for the specific ionic velocity , which is the same when calculated from the measurements of different salts of the same metal , by the assumption , first advanced by Hittorf , that , in concentrated solutions of these salts ionisation takes place in such a manner that there are formed complex ions in addition to simple ones ; and the conclusion is drawn that , in all cases where any considerable change in transport number occurs with changes in concentration , complex ions are present to a greater or less extent .

361 point of hydrogen , gives as the melting point 16 ' absolute .
This value does not differ greatly from the value previously deduced from the use of hydrogen gas thermometers , viz. , 166-7 .
The lowest temperature recorded by gas thermometry is 14'*5 , but with more complete isolation and a lower pressure of exhaustion , it will be possible to reach about 13 ' absolute , which is the lowest practicable tempera-time that can be commanded by the use of solid hydrogen .
Until the experiments are repeated with a helium thermometer filled with helium , previously purified by cooling to the lowest temperature that can be reached by the use of solid hydrogen , the gas being under compression , no more accurate values can be deduced .

point of nitrogen ; the other on a simple arrangement for keeping the more volatile gases from getting into solution after separation by partial exhaustion .
By the latter mode of working something like 1 1/ 34000th of the volume of the air liquefied appears as uncondensed gas The latter method is only a qualitative one for the recognition and separation of a part of the hydrogen in air .
In a former paper on the " Liquefaction of Air and the Detection of Impurities , " 1 ' it was shown that 100 c.c. of liquid air could dissolve 20 c.c. of hydrogen at the same temperature .
The crude gas separated from air by the second method gave on analysis\#151 ; hydrogen 32'5 per cent. , nitrogen 8 per cent. , helium , neon , \amp ; c. , 60 per cent. After removing the hydrogen and nitrogen the neon can he solidified by cooling in liquid hydrogen and the more volatile portions separated .
There exists in air a gaseous material that may he separated without the liquefaction of the air .
For this purpose air has to he sucked through a spiral tube filled with glass wool immersed in liquid air .
After ' a considerable quantity of air has been passed , the spiral is exhausted at the low temperature of the liquid air hath .
The spiral tube is now removed and allowed to heat up to the ordinary temperature and the condensed gas taken out by the pump .
After purification ' by spectroscopic fractionation , the gas filled into vacuum tubes o-ives the chief lines of xenon .
The spectroscopic examination of the material will he dealt with in a separate paper by Professor Livemg and myself .
A similar experiment made with liquid air kept unc er exhaustion , the air current allowed to circulate being , to prevent liquefaction , under a pressure less than the saturation pressure of the liquid , resulted in crypton being deposited along with the xenon .
A study of fifteen electric resistance thermometers as far as the boiling point of hydrogen has been made , and the results reduced by the Callendar and Dickson methods .
The following table gives the results for seven thermometers , viz. , two of platinum , one of gold , silver , copper , and iron , and one of platinum-rhodium alloy .
It will he noted that the lowest boiling point for hydrogen was_ given by the gold thermometer .
Next to it came one of the platmmn theimo-meters , and then silver , while copper and the iron differ from the gold value by 26 and 32 degrees respectively .
The gold thermomet would make the boiling point 23'-5 instead of the 20 '5 given by th gas thermometer .
Then the reduction of temperature under exhaustion amounts to only 1 ' instead of 4 ' as given by the gas thermometer .
The extraordinary reduction in resistance of some of the metals at the i t rinint of hydrogen is very remarkable .
Thus copper has on y mKoU V30t rIatinuJx/ SSth to l/ 17th , silver l/ 24th the .idtance at melting ice , whereas iron is only reduced to 1/ 8th par o the same initial resistance .

and temperature within the limits we are considering is unknown , and no thermometer of this kind can he relied on for giving accurate temperatures up to and below the boiling point of hydrogen .
The curves are discussed in the paper , and I am indebted to Mr. J. H. D. Dickson and Mr. J. E. Petavel for help in this part of the work .
Helium separated from the gas of the King 's Well , Bath , and purified by passing through a U-tube immersed in liquid hydrogen , was filled directly into the ordinary form of Cailletet gas receiver used with his apparatus , and subjected to a pressure of 80 atmospheres , while a portion of the narrow part of the glass tube was immersed in liquid hydrogen .
On sudden expansion from this pressure to atmospheric pressure a mist from the production of some solid body was clearly visible .
After several compressions and expansions , the end of the tube contained a small amount of a solid body that passed directly into gas when the liquid hydrogen was removed and the tube kept in the vapour of hydrogen above the liquid .
On lowering the temperature of the liquid hydrogen by exhaustion to its melting point , which is about 16 ' absolute , and repeating the expansions on the gas from which the solid had separated by the previous expansions at the boiling point , or 20''5 , no mist was seen .
From this it appears the mist was caused by some other material than helium , in all probability neon , and when the latter is removed no mist is seen , when the gas is expanded from 80 to 100 atmospheres , even although the tube is surrounded with solid hydrogen .
From experiments made on hydrogen that had been similarly purified like the helium and used in the same apparatus , it appears a mist can be seen in hydrogen ( under the same conditions of expansion as applied to the helium sample of gas ) when the initial temperature of the expanding gas was twice the critical temperature , but it was not visible when the initial temperature was about two and a-half times the critical temperature .
This experience applied to interpret the helium experiments , would make the critical temperature of the gas under 9 ' absolute .
Olszewski in his experiments expanded helium from about seven times the critical temperature under a pressure of 125 atmospheres .
If the temperature is calculated from the adiabatic expansion , stai ting at 21 ' absolute , an effective expansion of only 20 to 1 would reach 6''3 , and 10 to 1 of 8''3 .
It is now safe to say , helium has been really cooled to 9 ' or 10 ' absolute without any appearance of liquefaction .
There is one point , however , that must be considered , and that is the small refractivity of helium as compared to hydrogen , which , as Lord Rayleigh has shown , is not more than one-fourth the latter gas .
Now as the liquid refractivities are substantially in the same ratio as the gaseous refractivities in the case of hydrogen and oxygen , and the refractive index of liquid hydrogen is about M2 , then the value for liquid helium should be about 1 '03 , both taken at then iespecti\e The Nadir of Temperature , and Allied Problems .
365 boiling points .
In other words , liquid helium at its boiling point would have a refractive index of about the same value as liquid hydrogen at its critical point , and as a consequence , small drops of liquid helium forming in the gas near its critical point would be far more difficult to see than in the case of hydrogen similarly situated .
The hope of being able to liquefy helium , which would appear to have a boiling point of about 5 ' absolute , or one-fourth that of liquid hydrogen , is dependent on subjecting helium to the same process that succeeds with hydrogen ; only instead of using liquid air under exhaustion as the primary cooling agent , liquid hydrogen under exhaustion must be employed , and the resulting liquid collected in vacuum vessels surrounded with liquid hydrogen The following table embodies the results of experience and theory :\#151 ; j Initial temperature .

It will be seen that by the use of liquid or solid hydrogen as a cooling agent we ought to be able to liquefy a body having a critical point of about 6 ' to 8 ' absolute and boiling point of about 4 ' or 5 ' absolute .
Then , if liquid helium could be produced with the probable boiling point of 5 ' absolute , this substance would not enable us to reach the zero of temperature j another gas must be found that is as much more volatile than helium as it is than hydrogen in order to reach within 1 ' of the zero of temperature .
If the helium group comprises a substance having the atomic weight 2 , or half that of helium , such a gas would bring us nearer the desired goal , In the meantime the production of liquid helium is a difficult and expensive enough problem to occupv the scientific world for many a day .
' J A number of miscellaneous observations have been made in the course of this inquiry , among which the following may be mentioned .
Thus the great increase of phosphorescence in the case of organic , bodies cooled to the boiling point of hydrogen under light stimulation is very marked , when compared with the same effects brought 366 Meeting of June 20 , 1901 .

about by the use of liquid air .
A body like sulphide of zinc cooled to 21 ' absolute and exposed to light shows brilliant phosphorescence on the temperature being allowed to rise .
Bodies like radium that exhibit self-luminosity in the dark , cooled in liquid hydrogen maintain their luminosity unimpaired .
Photographic action is still active although it is reduced to about half the intensity it bears at the temperature of liquid air .
Some crystals when placed in liquid hydrogen become for a time self-luminous , on account of the high electric stimulation brought about by the cooling causing actual electric discharges between the crystal molecules .
This is very marked with some platino-cyanides and nitrate of uranium .
Even cooling such crystals to the temperature of liquid air is sufficient to develop marked electrical and luminous effects .
Considering that both liquid hydrogen and air are highly insulating liquids , the fact of electric discharges taking place under such conditions proves that the electric potential generated by the cooling must be very high .
When the cooled crystal is taken out of either liquid and allowed to increase in temperature , the luminosity and electric discharges take place again during the return to the normal temperature .
A crystal of nitrate of uranium gets so highly charged electrically that , although its density is 2'8 and that of liquid air about 1 , it refuses to sink , sticking to the side of the vacuum vessel and requiring a marked pull on a silk thread , to which it is attached , to displace it .
Such a crystal rapidly removes cloudiness from liquid air by attracting all the suspended particles on to its surface .
The study of pyro-electricity at low temperatures will solve some very important problems .
During this inquiry I have had the hearty co-operation of Mr. Robert Lennox , to whom my thanks are due , and Mr. J. W. Heath has also given valuable assistance .
