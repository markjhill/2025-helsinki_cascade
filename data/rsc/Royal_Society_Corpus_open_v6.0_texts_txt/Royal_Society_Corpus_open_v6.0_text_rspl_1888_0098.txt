" On the comparative Action of Hydroxylamine and Nitrites upon Blood-pressure .
" By T. Lauder Brunton , M.D. , F.R.S. , and T , Jessopp Bokenham .
Received February 7 ' 1889 .
This communication forms part of an investigation on which one of ns ( Brunton ) has been engaged for some years past , and in aid of which grants have been received from this Society.* * * S In this investigation the action of various compound ammonias , !
and also of some nitrites , J and allied bodies , S has been examined .
The plan of research required hydroxylamine ( NH30 ) , forming as it does a link between these two classes of bodies , to be specially examined .
The action of-this body has recently become a subject of experiment by other workers , || and it therefore seems advisable to publish now one remarkable relationship between it and nitrites , reserving for a later communication other results of this research .
Two of the most stinking effects of nitrites are : their power ( a ) to alter the colour of the blood , and ( b ) to lower the pressure of blood within the vessels.** Both of these properties are also possessed by nitroglycerine , ft an(l Hav has shown that the effect of this substance is due to the fact that it is decomposed in the blood with evolution of nitrous acid .
JJ i Hydroxylamine is a body in which two affinities of nitrogen are saturated by hydrogen instead of by oxygen as in nitrous acid .
relation to nitrous acid will be seen by a comparison of their graphic formulae\#151 ; ... ... ' Hydroxylamine .

] .Hydroxylamine and Nitrites and Blood-pressure .
353 It was shown by Raimondo and Bertoni* to have the power of producing a chocolate-brown colour of the blood , of lessening its oxidising power , and of producing a change in its spectrum , changes similar to those observed by Gamgee as consequences of the action of nitrites .
] LoewJ found it to be a powerful protoplasmic poison .
From a consideration of its chemical properties , BinzS was led to think that it must be reckoned amongst the bodies which cause paralysis of cells in the nerve-centres , either by setting free active oxygen or one of the halogens , and his experiments showed the correctness of his hypothesis .
Raimondo and Bertoni thought that daring the reaction between hydroxylamine and blood nitrous acid was formed .
, and Binz obtained the reaction of nitrites from the blood of animals poisoned by it .
It therefore seemed probable that it would affect the blood-pressure in a similar way to nitrites , and on testing it we found that it does .
On injecting the hydrochlorate of hydroxylamine either into the veins or peritoneal cavity , it produces a fall of blood-pressure almost exactly similar to that produced by nitrite of amyl , as will be seen by a comparison of the accompanying curves , in which the fall of blood-pressure is so much alike that it is almost impossible to tell from a mere inspection of the tracings which is due to hydroxylamine and which to amyl nitrite .
As hydroxylamine itself is very unstable , and is readily converted into ammonia , we used the hydrochlorate , which we obtained from Messrs. Hopkin and Williams .
As hydroxylamine is made commercially by the reduction of nitrites , it appeared possible that the specimen we employed might be contaminated by nitrites , and that its action upon the blood-pressure might be due to impurity and not to the action of the hydroxylamine itself .
On testing the specimen we employed by starch-paste and iodine with acetic , sulphuric or hydrochloric acid we got no reaction , and Messrs. Hopkin and Williams also told us that it gave no reaction with metaphenylene-diamine .
We may therefore regard the specimen as pure , and attribute the fall of blood-pressure to the action of the hydroxylamine hydrochlorate , and not to any impurities contained in it .
