As part of the routine work connected with our investigation of the processes of photosynthesis in plants , an account of which has been given in a previous series of papers , it became necessary from time to time to make a large number of determinations of the amount of carbon dioxide present in the air .
Since these determinations were made by a method which admits of a high degree of accuracy , and also extend over a considerable period , we have considered it desirable to collect the results , which are valuable in showing he limits of variation in the amount of this constituent of the atmosphere , of which a somewhat fallacious idea has been frequently entertained .
The method of experiment has already been described in a previous paper , * and it will , therefore , suffice to say that it consists in the absorption of the carbon dioxide from about 100 to 300 litres of air by means of a solution of sodium hydroxide contained in a Reiset 's absorption apparatus , the amount of absorbed gas being subsequently determined by a process of double titration .
The experimental error incidental to the method falls well within + or \#151 ; 1 per cent , of the total amount of carbon dioxide estimated , so that the numbers representing the volumes of carbon dioxide per 10,000 volumes of air have certainly not a larger error than 0'03 parts per 10,000 .
The air was taken from outside the Jodrell Laboratory in Kew Gardens , at a height of 4 feet 6 inches from the ground , and without any previous filtration .
The results , expressed in volumes of carbon dioxide per 10,000 volumes of dry air , have been thrown into a tabular form at the end of this paper , the date of each observation being given .
( See Table II .
) The average value for the 91 experiments recorded is 94 volumes of carbon dioxide per 10,000 of air .
The lowest value obtained ( August 9,1898 ) was 243 , and the highest ( March 16,1899 ) was 3*60 per 10,000 .
This latter result , obtained during a fog , was a very exceptional one , and out of the whole # ' Koy .

number of the 91 experiments recorded , in only nine did the carbon dioxide slightly exceed 3-20 parts per 10,000 .
As a general rule it would appear that the carbon dioxide present in the air is somewhat greater in the winter than in the summer months , but the year 1901 was an exception in this respect , since during July of that year it averaged 311 parts per 10,000 .
On the whole we are inclined to regard the periods of maximum carbon dioxide as being dependent more on anti-cyclonic than on seasonal conditions .
The variations in the atmospheric carbon dioxide are small when regarded as absolute amounts , but they assume considerable importance in the light of what we now know about the relation of the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide in the air to the actual rate of assimilation by the green organs of plants .
In a previous communication* we have shown that under a given set of conditions favourable to photosynthesis a living chlorophyllous leaf assimilates from the surrounding air in a given time amounts of carbon dioxide which are directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas .
This is true up to limits of concentration of the carbon dioxide which lie altogether outside the variations which occur in Nature .
Hence we have reason to expect that any well-marked variations in the carbon dioxide-content of the air during the active period of plant growth would produce some effect on the rate of nutrition of the plant , f As a guide to the magnitude of the effects which may be expected from such variations as we are considering , we will take the mean carbon dioxide-content of the air for the month of July for each of the four years 1898 to 1901 * ' Roy .

t This argument is not affected by the conclusion arrived at in a former paper ( ' Roy .
Soc_ Proc. , ' vol. 70 , p. 397 ) that although a proportionately increased intake of carbon dioxide takes place in a leaf when surrounded by an atmosphere containing three to four times the normal amount of carbon dioxide , yet the plant as a whole cannot avail itself of this increased amount of newly synthesized plastic material , owing to defective correlation of its various functions under these artificial conditions .
Although a want of perfect adaptation of the plant in these respects undoubtedly exists in an atmosphere containing three or four times the normal amount of carbon dioxide , it by no means follows that the plant as a whole will not respond perfectly to the slight differences of carbon dioxide-content which occur under natural conditions .

1898 7 2-83 1899 9 2-88 1900 4 2-86 1901 7 341 We here see that in this month of active plant growth there was in 1901 an increase of 10 per cent , in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide over that of the three previous years .
Assuming all other conditions to have been the same , both climatic and meteorological , such an increase would certainly be reflected in a correspondingly increased assimilation of the plant .
This example , and the results which are tabulated below , indicate that in the percentage variations of the atmospheric carbon dioxide we have factors which can no longer be neglected by meteorologists and agriculturists .
Systematic daily observations on the variations of the atmospheric carbon dioxide at widely separated stations are much needed for the purpose of ascertaining how far these variations are uniform over large areas , and also to what extent these changes in the composition of the atmosphere are reflected in the growth of our crops when they take place during periods of active plant growth .
