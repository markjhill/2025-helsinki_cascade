Part II.\#151 ; The Energy Output of Labourers on Cold Storage Work .

, with the assistance of Miss G. de Decker* ( Received November 1919 .
) In pursuance of the investigation of dock labour initiated for the Food ( War ) Committee of the Royal Society last year , and thanks to the courtesy of several officials of the Port of London Authority and of several willing labourers , we were able to make two series of hourly observations of the CO2 output of four labourers engaged upon heavy work in cold storage .
A first short series was made during December , 1918 , at the East Surrey Docks ; a second and longer series at the Charterhouse Cold Storage Chambers , Smith-field Market during July , 1919 .
The data we have been able to obtain are obviously scanty , but , we believe , sufficient to prove the possibility of acquiring valuable information by an expeditious method , applied during normal work , and involving a minimum interference with that work .
Our attempt to submit such scanty results to statistical treatment may perhaps be regarded as premature ; we have , however , found it convenient , if only for the purpose of bringing out the necessity of more extensive observations , to work out the standard deviation and the + probable error in the arithmetic means of the two series of observations made under different conditions .
The first point to arrest attention in cold storage work is the great irregularity in the output of energy as indicated by great fluctuations in the exhalation of CO2 .
Cold storage work is piece-work and as such paid for on a higher scale than time-work ; it is considered trying work by the labourer , more so in summer than in winter , because of the greater fluctuations of temperature between storage chambers and external air .
The work consists principally in the moving from storage van to storage chamber of arrival goods ( quarters of beef , of mutton and lamb , boxes of poultry and cheese , etc. ) , the storage chamber temperature being usually constant at 16 ' F. , i.e. , -9 ' C. * The responsibility for this inquiry rests upon two persons , viz. , Dr. A. D. Waller , by whom it was initiated and is now described , and Miss G. de Decker , by whom the actual observations were made .
The expenses have been met by grants from the Royal Society and from the Medical Research Committee .

The Physiological Cost of Muscular The principal factor in the fluctuation of energy output is fluctuation of work ; the load varies from a very low to a very high level according as small or large consignments come in during the twenty-four hours .
The chief difference we have observed in cold storage work as compared with ordinary work in the open consists in the more marked character of the hourly increased output of CO 2 , to which attention was drawn in an earlier portion of this report , and which is best shown by a graph of the day ( or night ) output .
The CO2 ordinate climbs steeply from hour to hour , from its minimum at the beginning of work .
Our cold storage observations were undertaken with the definite expectation of finding a distinct increase in the physiological cost of work , and we must confess that the correlation that must be believed in has not come up to our expectations .
It seems to be masked by the effects of fluctuations of work done .
We shall not attempt , therefore , to measure the correlation , and shall simply state results .
Our first set of readings were made for a period of six days , January 30th to February 4th , at the East Surrey Docks ; they are given in the subjoined Table and graph .
Cold storage work forms a relatively small proportion of the labour of the East Surrey Docks ; the " load " fluctuates accordingly ; the men do not like the work , in spite of the fact that it is piece-work and highly remunerated .
The energy output of two of the labourers under observation , as indicated by their CO2 ordinate , measured at hour intervals , was surprisingly low .
A second set of readings were taken by one of us ( G. de D. ) , by courtesy still of the Port of London Authority , at the cold storage chambers adjacent to Smithfield Market , where the work is more continuous , consisting in the daily ( or rather nightly ) transfer of meat from cold storage to market , and in more or less irregular bouts of heavy labour occasioned by arrivals of van-loads of meat from ships arriving in harbour .
The labourer , standing by or tidying up on his basal wage , is suddenly called upon to work at full pressure on piece-work in a gang where each member is working for the benefit of himself and of his mates .
Physiologically , his energy output is now maximal .
These conditions of work afford an excellent opportunity of testing the value of Method B , which serves obviously to give indications of the increasing or diminishing work ; but they are not such as to allow of averaging from successive days or nights , as in the case of ordinary dock labour ( v. Part I ) .
We must evaluate the cost of cold-storage labour .from periods of really heavy work , rejecting altogether periods of " standing by , during which the energy output is undoubtedly subnormal .
Thus , the Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .

The average C02 ( gross ) for the last three hours was 6*7 c.c. per second , i.e. , allowing 4 c.c. per second for resting C02 , the working C02 was only 2*7 c.c.r equivalent to 54 Kals per hour ( = 27'96 Kals per hour per metre ) .
To ascertain the effect of low temperature upon energy output , we must take only periods of piece-work in cold storage , e.g. , in the case of Labourer No. 7 , the work during the mornings of August 5th , 6th , and 7th was at full pressure , the amount of meat that had to be stored was greater than could be moved during the normal hours , the pay was on the piece-work scale , and the physiological output of energy can be considered as maximal .
The figures 234 Dr. A. D. Waller .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular obtained may , therefore , be compared with those of Labourer No. 2 ( given above ) for coaling .
For these three mornings the average CO2 ordinate for the last three hours was 244 , or net 204 , signifying 402 Kals per hour , or 208'3 Kals per hour per square metre .
( King 's average for the first three hours of two forenoons of coaling was 2045 gross , or 16 45 net , signifying 329 Kals per hour , or 168'8 Kals per hour per metre .
) Labourer No. 6 worked continuously at high pressure during the nights of August 5th , 6th , and 7th , and the mean CO2 for the last three hours of these three nights was 26'53 ( gross ) or 22'53 ( net ) , signifying 506 Kals per hour or 246-2 Kals per hour per metre .
These are not figures selected to prove any case , but figures collected as a fair random sample under conditions of maximum heavy work in cold storage , fairly comparable with figures afforded by maximum heavy work ( coaling ) at ordinary temperatures .
Their comparison may be facilitated by casting them into tabular form .
Obviously they are too few in number to warrant any general conclusion or to be used as a statistical basis .

The energy output at the East Surrey Docks during the winter months January and February was , on the whole , much lower than that found at the Smithfield cold storage chambers during the summer months July and August .
We do not attribute the difference to the season , but to the difference of labour conditions .
The output of energy per man ( or per square metre of man-surface ) is greater at Smithfield because the daily aggregate of work done was greater .

Addendum 1.\#151 ; On a Numerical Value for " Efficiency ' .
' The calibration of a labourer is essentially completed when his rate of COg discharge has been determined .
A further step may be taken by measuring the efficiency of a given labourer for a given piece of artificial work of which the mechanical value is known\#151 ; Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon 241 in foot-pounds per minute or horse-power , * of , preferably , in kgrm.-metres per second .
I take as the measure of physiological efficiency the ratio kgrm.-metres per second/ cubic centimetres COa per second , i.e. , the number of kgrm.-metres per 1 c.c. C02 [ or by its reciprocal C02/ kgrm.-metre , i.e. , the physiological cost in C02 of 1 kgrm.-metre of work ] .
The expression kgrm-metre/ C02 is further simplified by conversion of the C02 value into its equivalent mechanical value in kgrm.-metres .
For this conversion I take the factor 2*5 , which gives a single numerical value of physiological efficiency .
Or the value of the kgrm.-metre/ C02 ratio multiplied by 40 gives at once in per 100 the " efficiency " value of the subject .
For example , a given subject ( A. D. W. ) , working for two minutes at the net cost of 25 c.c. C02 per second has a kgrm.-metre/ C02 ratio = 20/ 25 = 0'8 , and an efficiency = 0'8 x 40 = 32 per cent. His C02/ kgrm.-metre ratio is 25/ 20 , or 1 kgrm.-metre of his work ( at the rate given ) costs 1*25 c.c. of C02 On this principle , a further calibration of Labourer Ho. 1 is subjoined : 1st , by staircase work , and 2ndly , by walking on a horizontal path .

The " 20-metre staircase " in connection with the Physiological Laboratory of the University of London , used for estimating work in these observations , includes an allowance for the horizontal path involved in walking upstairs .
The staircase has 103 steps , 7-inch rise , 9-inch tread , and short landings , making up a total horizontal distance of 28 yards , of which the vertical value has been assumed at one-fifteenth .
The effective value of the 20 yards is thus 20 +1-867 yards , i.e. , 20 metres .
The value of the horizontal in terms of vertical was assumed as one-fifteenth in accordance with the findings of Zuntz and others , but from my own observations ( unfinished ) I am disposed to take a larger fraction , i.e. , about one-tenth , for the relation for moderate speeds , viz. , 100 yards per minute , on the flat , or 10 yards per minute vertically .
The point will be more fully considered in a future report on the energy output of walking and running on the flat .
If the fraction one-tenth should prove nearer the mark than one-fifteenth , a corresponding correction of the horizontal allowance will have to be made for the 20-metre staircase ; 244 Dr. A. D. Waller .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular it would then be 20-8 metres , and its work values as now calculated would have to be raised by 4 per cent. Ordinary walking at moderate speeds , between 3 and 4 miles per hour , is an exercise common to workers of all classes , " sedentary " and " heavy , " that affords a very convenient term of comparison between different persons , and with due precautions that can be conveniently utilised for their calibration in terms of CO2 .

The body surface being 1*90 sq .
metres , the cost was 152 Kals per square metre .
The net cost per horizontal kgrm.-metre comes out as 0*6 calorie approximately .
On inspection of this graph , it will be seen that the " resting C02 " = 3*6c.c Work Measured by the Discharge of Carbon Dioxide .

\#163 ; 00- o min. 5 This graph shows further , that the change from resting C02 ( 3'6 ) to working C02 ( 18-0 ) at the outset of work and the return at the end of work are complete in about 10 min. Practically the change may be considered as effected in about 5 min. The value ( gross ) of working C02 is given by any one of the last four ordinates , or better by their arithmetic mean , 18'475 .
The gross cost of work = 18'47 5 The resting C02 = 36 The net cost of work = 14'875 i.e. , walking at 3| miles per hour costs A. D. W. nearly 15 c.c. C02 per second , which , if kept up for 8 hours , must be reckoned as hard work\#151 ; approximately 2,400 Kals\#151 ; at 300 Kals per hour .
The superficial resemblance of this graph to a record of muscular tetanus will be obvious to any physiologist ; the record of a wave of C02 passing out of the body in consequence of a brief effort will be similarly recognised .
Objection may be raised to my interpretation of this second record to the effect that by reason of the increased pump action\#151 ; by increased pulmonary suction\#151 ; short samples cannot be trusted as indicating alterations of C02 production .
With the involuntary deepening of respiration occurring during 246 Dr. A. D. Waller .
The Physiological Cost of Muscular and after a brief spell of muscular effort , there is no doubt increased pumping , but there is also increased CO2 production in the background ; both effects are the physiological sequelae of the muscular effort , and the total resultant CO2 expired is to be regarded as being in measure with the effort that has produced increased breathing .
I possess a large number of data , extending back over many years , by which I have sought to ascertain the quantitative relations between work and cost of work\#151 ; work measured in kgrm.-metres per second , cost of work measured in cubic centimetres per second and translated into the mechanically equivalent kgrm.-metres\#151 ; from which I may quote an observation and graph on myself , which is given to serve as a picture showing the kind of time-relations of a single wave of CO2 exhaled by the lungs in consequence of a short , sharp muscular effort , i.e. , the ascent of a 20-metre staircase in one minute , i.e. , approximately 80 x 20 kgrm.-metres per minute , or 26'7 kgrm.-metres per second , or 0'33 horse-power .
These are rounded figures ; actual figures observed are given in the protocol .
The factor x 20 for the conversion of cubic centimetres CO2 per second to Kals per hour is taken as inclusive of an average temperature correction ( 15 ' ) for expired air at an average respiratory quotient ( 0'85 ) .
At 0'85 respiratory quotient the factor is 2T081 , i.e. , 5'4 per cent , above 20 .
At 15 ' the volume of C02 is 5'5 per cent , above that at 0 ' .
So that the factor 20 practically eliminates the two differences , and the result in Kals per hour is substantially correct .
The value of resting CO2 is , whenever possible , to be actually measured and used as a base-line from which to measure net CO2 .
Practically I take as base-line the CO2 reading of the subject after sitting at rest for 5 , or preferably , 10 minutes .
When this is not possible , I assume as base line the value 2 c.c. CO2 per second per square metre , i.e. , 40 Kals per hour per square metre .
This value , although perhaps a trifle high , does not sensibly impair the correctness of heavy work values = 20 or 30 c.c. per second , but it is obviously inadmissible for use when the net cost of light work = 5 to 10 c.c. per second is under examination .
In the latter case , at least two direct measurements of resting CO2 at 5 minutes ' intervals must be taken before work is begun and after work has ended .
