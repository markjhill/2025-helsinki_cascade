] Introduction .
The researches recorded in this paper were undertaken at the suggestion of Major Ross , who wished me to investigate the parasitological aspect of the numerical cyclical development discovered by him and Dr. D. Thomson ( 1910 ) in the trypanosome occurring in a patient suffering from Sleeping Sickness contracted in Rhodesia , particularly as regards the possible connection of the latent bodies of Salvin-Moore and Breinl ( 1907 ) with that cycle .
The investigations have been conducted in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , under a grant from the Tropical Diseases Research Fund .
A complete and generally accepted life cycle of Trypanosoma gambiense has yet to be written .
The following paper is offered as a contribution to the solution of this difficult problem , and deals with that portion of the life history of the parasite which takes place in a Vertebrate host .
The sub-inoculations in animals\#151 ; rats and guinea-pigs\#151 ; recorded herein were made from a patient suffering from Rhodesian Sleeping Sickness in Prof. Ross 's clinic in the Royal Southern Hospital , Liverpool .
The trypanosome from this source showed a marked morphological feature in the possession of a posterior nucleus in some forms , and for this parasite the name T. rhodesiense has been suggested by Stephens and Fantham ( 1910 ) .
A laboratory strain of T. gambiense was also used in these investigations for comparison .
Special attention has been paid to the observation of the living parasite , as well as to stained preparations .
Methods .
Fresh preparations of T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense were made from blood taken aseptically from animals , namely , tame rats and guinea-pigs .
The blood was kept in sealed cover-slip preparations , at or below blood heat ( 25 ' to 37 ' C. ) , and also at laboratory temperature .
The blood was someHistory of T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense , etc. 213 times diluted with a little physiological salt solution , or with a little isotonic sodium citrate solution .
Methylene blue was sometimes used for vitam staining .
Wet preparations of the parasite were made on cover slips after fixation with osmic acid vapour or corrosive acetic alcohol .
The chief stains used were iron hsematoxylin and those of Giemsa and Romanowsky .
Dry smears were employed for rough work .
In animals killed at certain stages of infection , the various internal organs were carefully examined both in fresh preparations and stained smears .
The enumerative methods used were those recently employed by R. Ross and D. Thomson and used by various workers in Liverpool , being an elaboration of R. Ross 's thick-film method made with measured quantities of blood ( 1 cubic millimetre divided into quarters ) .
The films were dehsemoglobinised , fixed in absolute alcohol , and stained by the Romanowsky method .
BesunU of Previous Work on Latent Bodies of Trypanosomes .
The various flagellate forms of Trypanosoma gambiense have been so often described by many competent workers that it is needless to discuss them further in detail .
Suffice it to say that long , thin trypanosomes may occur , especially at the beginning of infection in rats and guinea-pigs , and shorter , stout or stumpy forms later .
Trypanosomes intermediate in character also are found .
The so-called rounded , latent or encysted forms , which are non-flagellate , must be discussed in greater detail .
Marked attention to these non-flagellate forms of trypanosome was first drawn by Moore and Breinl ( 1907-8 ) in mammalian trypanosomes , though Dutton saw rounded forms of an Amphibian trypanosome on the Congo in 1903-5 .
Moore and Breinl ( 1907 ) , working on stained material , stated that latent forms occurred in the internal organs especially during the periods when the flagellates were decreasing or absent from the peripheral blood of the host .
These authors give a curve showing the variations in the numbers of T. gambiense in infected rats ; they do not , however , give any numerical data in support of the graph .
A few other workers have mentioned rounded bodies in connection with trypanosomes , among whom Hindle ( 1909 ) may be noted .
The significance of the latent bodies is still a disputed point , and it was recently stated in a review that more evidence was required to show that they " constitute part of a life-cycle in the Vertebrate host."* In the present paper the general statements of Moore and Breinl , regarding forms of T. gambiense in the internal organs of rats , are shown to * Sleeping Sickness Bureau , Bulletin No. 15 ( March , 1910 ) , p. 102 .

The Relation between Latent Bodies and the Number of Trypanosomes the Peripheral Blood , with Notes on the Parasites found in the Internal Organs of the Hosts .
Following on the work of E. Eoss and D. Thomson ( 1910 ) on the enumeration of the parasites in the peripheral blood of a patient suffering from Ehodesian Sleeping Sickness , the periodic increase in the number of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood of rats and guinea-pigs inoculated with T. rhodesiense or with T.gambiense has recently been found by Fantham and J. G. Thomson .
Eats similarly inoculated and exhibiting such periodic increase and decrease were killed at various points in the cycle , as set forth in the following tables:\#151 ; A. Eat 1.\#151 ; T. gambiense , Laboratory Strain , in Piebald f Eat , weight 150 grammes , inoculated with 50,000 trypanosomes .

From counts of the number of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood daily , and from examination of carefully prepared smears of organs , it is found that latent bodies are most numerous when the flagellate parasites are few .
If inoculated animals be killed at these periods , very few flagellate trypanosomes are found in the spleen and bone marrow ( see preceding tables ) , but many latent bodies are present in those organs , while rounding forms are seen especially in the lungs .
In the peripheral blood , on the upward slope of the curve representing the numbers of the parasites from day to day , the parasites increase in numbers by longitudinal division to a maximum .
At or about this period , the formation of rounded or latent bodies begins , and takes place especially in the internal organs .
If rounded ( latent ) bodies , derived from the internal organs of an infected rat , be placed in warm fresh blood drawn from a normal , uninfected rat , then growth of some of the rounded bodies towards the flagellate trypaniform stage can be seen under the microscope , as is detailed in a subsequent section of this paper .
Five guinea-pigs ( three inoculated with T. rhodesiense and two with T. gambiense ) , dying in various stages of trypanosomiasis , were carefully examined , and fresh preparations and smears of their internal organs were 218 Dr. H. B. Fantham .
Hist T. gambiense [ Oct. 15 , made .
Rounding and rounded forms of trypanosomes were seen , just as in infected rats .
Needless to say , a very careful examination of the internal organs of normal ( uninfected ) rats and guinea-pigs was made for the purposes of comparison and control .

] and T. rhodesiense as seen Rats and Guinea-pigs .
219 while at the other end the blepharoplast ( kinetonucleus ) gradually migrates nearer the nucleus , and then the non-flagellar or posterior end of the original trypanosome is cast off , together with the remains of the flagellum .
The rounded body , consisting of chromatin with a thin layer of cytoplasm , has then surrounded itself with a definite , very thin capsule ( " cyst " ) .
This process , as seen under the microscope , is either the natural mode of formation of non-flagellate bodies in the internal organs or closely approximates thereto , as intermediate stages exactly similar in the formation of these bodies are seen in stained preparations of the heart , lungs , and spleen ( Plate 15 , figs. 1-5 ) .
However , in the peripheral blood there occur rounded , oval or somewhat pyriform parasites ( figs. 17-20 ) , each with a single anterior flagellum .
Such forms may , for convenience , be called rounding herpetomonad forms , as Herpetomonas passes through similar stages in assuming a rounded non-flagellate form .
The rounded stages of Herpetomonas , thus formed , have been aptly termed post-flagellate stages by Captain Patton and by Dr. Annie Porter in their recent interesting researches on flagellates ( Crithidia and Herpetomonas ) .
The rounded , encapsuled stages of trypanosomes are post-flagellate stages .
That these rounded , post-flagellate forms are encapsuled in a thin membranous structure is shown by the fact that they resist maceration in water much longer than the trypaniform flagellates .
The formation of post-flagellate bodies ( figs. 2 , 3 , 5 ) is well seen in the lungs , whence they find their way in the blood stream to the spleen and bone marrow .
The Structure of Latent Bodies .
The post-flagellate ( latent ) stages of T. and T. rhodesiense , already mentioned , have a relatively simple structure .
The strictly latent or non-flagellate forms are usually oval in outline , and small , about 2 ya to 4 in diameter ( figs. 2-16 ) .
Less frequently are they quite rounded or spherical ( fig. 14 ) , while sometimes they are pyriform ( figs. 25 , 27 , 29 , 30 ) .
Internally there is a nucleus , which may show a karyosome , and beside the nucleus there is a blepharoplast or kinetonucleus ( fig. 6 ) .
In some latent bodies , especially the smallest ones , the kinetonucleus may not be visible separately ( figs. 11 , 13-15 ) , as it may be lying over the nucleus , or actually affixed thereto ( figs. 2 , 10 ) .
The juxtaposition of the nuclear bodies has been actually observed in some Pomanowsky-stained specimens , after careful wet fixation ( figs. 2 , 10 ) .
The relative positions of the nucleus and blepharoplast in rounding or rounded bodies may vary considerably .
A small quantity of cytoplasm occurs in the latent bodies .
220 Dr. H. B. Fantham .
History T. gambiense [ Oct. 15 , In the formation of rounded , latent bodies , as seen vitro , a portion of the body of the flagellate , after passage of the blepharoplast towards the nucleus , is thrown off , and the flagellum is discarded ( text-fig .
1 ) .
Examination of preparations of the internal organs ( lungs , heart , spleen ) of the host shows that a similar method of formation of the post-flagellate stages of the parasite usually occurs in the internal organs ( figs. 1-5 ) .
However , in the peripheral blood , after careful searching of a sufficient quantity of blood ( \#163 ; cubic millimetre ) , a few rounding or rounded parasites can generally be seen ( figs. 12 , 17-20 ) .
Also , in the internal organs , stages of the parasite intermediate between flagellate and non-flagellate forms may be seen ( fig. 33 ) .
The post-flagellate or latent bodies vary in size ( figs. 2-16 , 22 ) .
This variation is due to two causes : ( 1 ) the formation of non-flagellate parasites from trypanosomes of different breadths , and ( 2 ) the occasional division of large post-flagellate forms by binary fission , an example of the simplest schizogony ( fig. 23 ) .
This fission , so far as my researches go , is infrequent in the case of T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense .
It has been observed that division of flagellate trypanosomes may immediately precede the formation of latent bodies .
Broad forms of T. rhodesiense , with posterior nucleus , may form relatively large latent bodies .
As the nucleus is at or near the posterior ( non-flagellar ) end of the parasite , there is little of the body discarded in that region when rounding occurs .
The kidney shape of the nucleus of some specimens of T. rhodesiense is seen in their latent bodies ( fig. 27 ) , and the nucleus lies to one side of the rounding body ( figs. 17 , 18 ) .
It is not easy , however , to differentiate between the latent bodies of T. rhodesiense and T. gambiense .
Moore and Breinl describe a stainable band or black line connecting the nucleus and blepharoplast of certain specimens of T. gambiense at or near the maxima .
An " interaction " takes place between the blepharoplast and nucleus .
After this the formation of latent bodies proceeds .
During the researches now recorded , there was no good evidence found in support of Moore and Breinl 's views .
The stainable band was seen in some stout ( probably old ) parasites , and in parasites at periods near the death of the host .
It is possible , as Swellengrebel ( 1908 ) suggested , that the stainable line is a form of degeneration .
However , on the exact significance of the stainable band seen in such trypanosomes I prefer not to pronounce a definite opinion at present .

221 The Metamorphosis of Latent Bodies into Trypanosomes .
This process was observed in life on several occasions , though the complete passage from a rounded body to a fully flagellate moving trypanosome was only rarely seen ( three times ) , for it is difficult to imitate precisely the natural conditions favourable to such a metamorphosis .
However , by taking rounded bodies , usually obtained from the spleen of an infected rat , in a little physiological salt solution , and adding thereto an equal quantity of fresh ( normal , uninfected ) rat 's blood , some of the rounded bodies were seen on a warm stage ( 25 ' to 35 ' C. ) to grow , each becoming larger and sending out a process ( text-fig .
2 ) .
This pseudopodium-like process lengthens , and a flagellum is formed from an area close to the blepharoplast ( kinetonucleus ) .
At this stage the parasite forms at its drawn-out anterior end an undulating membrane along the edge of which the flagellum lies and the organism Text-fig .

The total time taken for the metamorphosis was about 1 hour .
somewhat resembles a Crithidia .
This transitory stage may be termed the crithidial stage .
The organism grows and the blepharoplast passes posterior to the nucleus , and the trypaniform stage is assumed .
The evidence of stained preparations ( figs. 32 to 40 ) fully supports this mode of formation of flagellate trypanosomes from non-flagellate latent bodies .
222 Dr. H. B. Fantham .
History of T. gambiense [ Oct. 15 , The latent bodies , which are the post-flagellate stages of one generation of trypanosomes , become the pre-flagellate stages of the succeeding generation of trypanosomes .
Such pre-flagellate , Crithidia-like parasites in various stages of metamorphosis may be seen in the peripheral blood of the host ( figs. 32 , 34 to 42 ) , when the parasites are increasing in numbers therein .
A basal granule ( blepharoplast of Minchin ) is seen at the base of the flagellum of some stained flagellating parasites ( fig. 37 ) .
It may be added that in dealing with an isolated case of an intermediate stage of a parasite between the flagellate and the rounded body , it is some- , times difficult to determine whether the given stage is pre-flagellate or post-flagellate , that is , whether the given parasite is proceeding in development towards the flagellate stage or away from it towards the rounded body .
The Significance of the Non-flagellate or Latent Forms of Trypanosomes .
Inoculation with Latent Bodies produces Trypanosomiasis .
B. Boss and D. Thomson ( 1910 ) report periodic variation in the numbers of the trypanosomes found in the blood of a patient W. A. , suffering from Bhodesian Sleeping Sickness .
Fantham and J. G. Thomson ( 1910 ) report similar periodic variation in the number of the parasites in the peripheral blood of sub-inoculated animals ( rats , guinea-pigs , and rabbits ) .
During the periods of decrease of the parasites in the peripheral blood , I find that latent ( non-flagellate ) bodies are present in relatively large numbers in the internal organs of the host .
The latent bodies are formed at or near the period of maximum increase of the trypanosomes in the peripheral blood .
The latent bodies are especially numerous in the spleen and bone marrow on the downward slope of the curve representing the numbers of the parasites in the peripheral blood of the host .
Change of the latent forms into trypanosomes takes place on the rise or upward slope of the curve .
There is , of course , a mutual action and reaction of the host and the parasite , the resistance of the host probably being greatest when the flagellate trypanosomes within it are beginning to decrease , thus helping to bring about the assumption of the rounded form by many of the flagellates , so that latent or resistant non-flagellate stages of the parasite are then numerous .
The occurrence of latent bodies also helps to explain the successful inoculation of animals with trypanosomiasis when no flagellates can be found in the blood inoculated from a previously infected animal .
Although it might be urged that flagellate trypanosomes , in numbers too few to recognise , may actually be present in the infected blood inoculated , yet it is possible to inoculate only latent , non-flagellate bodies , and give the inoculated animal 1910 .

223 trypanosomiasis .
In other words , persistent infectivity in the case of trypanosomes is explained by rounded bodies .
I have performed this experiment ( inoculation of latent bodies ) on two occasions .
In the first experiment a rat was inoculated with one drop of spleen-pulp ( from Rat 7 ) mixed with a little sterile physiological salt solution , the mixture containing no flagellates .
The inoculated rat developed trypanosomiasis on the 6 th day , dying on the 12th day .
The daily counts of this rat were as follows:\#151 ; Day 1 2 i !
3 i 4 5 6 GO 9 10 11 12 Parasites , per c. mm. \#151 ; \#151 ; | ' I \#151 ; i 4 i i 864 2196 4308 30,600 1 10,000 75,200 Secondly , a further experiment was tried , since it was considered that the parasites in one drop of spleen-pulp solution might be too numerous to count accurately , and that a few flagellate trypanosomes might be contained therein , for although a most minute search was made for flagellates in the fluid before inoculation , yet a very few flagellates might have remained undetected .
Accordingly , in the second experiment , 1 cubic millimetre of spleen-pulp solution in sodium citrate was inoculated intraperitoneally .
Careful examination of samples of the solution used , both fresh and stained , showed no flagellate trypanosomes , hut many rounded bodies .
The actual fluid used for inoculation also showed no flagellate trypanosomes when microscopically examined fresh .
The rat thus inoculated developed trypanosomiasis , parasites being found on the 8th day , and it died on the 18th day .
The daily counts of this rat are appended:\#151 ; Day i 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Parasites , per c. mm. 4 960 2800 12,000 Day 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Parasites , per c. mm. 49,200 18,200 6400 2120 20,600 50,240 128,000 The two rats inoculated with non-flagellate , latent bodies of rhodesiense showed incubation periods rather longer ( 5 to 7 days ) than usual ( 2 to 4 days ) with rats inoculated with flagellate T. rhodesiense .

History T. gambiense [ Oct. 15 ?
Sleeping Sickness also explains recurrence of trypanosomiasis after it has apparently died out in an infected animal .
In such cases the latent bodies are present in the host all the while in such organs as the spleen and bone marrow .
During these researches it has been found that flagellate trypanosomes ( 500,000 to 2,000,000 in number ) inoculated into a rat or a guinea-pig can be detected in the peripheral blood-stream ( in 1 cubic millimetre of blood ) of the host for some 10 to 12 hours , or even 18 hours after inoculation .
During and after this period , that is , during the incubation period of the parasite , a few rounded forms of trypanosomes can be found in a cubic millimetre of peripheral blood .
Biot ( 19101 writes of the " revivifying action " of physiological salt solution on trypanosomes ( Tlewisi ) , especially in fluid from the liver of a rat dead 6^ days ( kept in the cold , unopened ) .
Biot does not explain the phenomenon .
However , it is capable of explanation , for in the liver latent bodies of trypanosomes are present , which , under the relatively favourable environment of isotonic salt solution , flagellate and become typical trypanosomes .
In the treatment of trypanosomiasis by drugs , careful note must be taken of the occurrence of rounded , non-flagellate or latent forms of the parasite .
A drug needs to be found which will either prevent the formation of rounded ( latent ) stages or disintegrate those latent bodies already formed .
In this connection the work of B. Moore , Nierenstein , and Todd* on the combined use of salts of mercury and arsenic should be considered .
Note on the Degeneration of Trypanosomes .
All flagellate trypanosomes do not become rounded and form latent , non-flagellate bodies , but some of them degenerate and die .
The degeneration may take various forms\#151 ; some become ( a ) somewhat irregular and almost amoeboid with pale-staining cytoplasm and vacuoles ( figs. 44 , 45 ) , others ( / ) exhibit chromatolysis , wherein the nucleus becomes poor in chromatin and chromatoid granules occur in the cytoplasm ( figs. 46\#151 ; 49 ) , while others ( y ) exhibit marked vacuolation ( fig. 50 ) .
Such degenerating forms may be seen in various internal organs of the host , such as the lungs and spleen , especially during the period of formation of latent bodies .
It is also very probable that some of the latent bodies themselves die and do not flagellate , for some shrunken latent bodies , with undifferentiated contents , can be seen in the spleen .

225 Summary and Conclusions .
( 1 ) Non-flagellate stages of trypanosomes , such as T. ( Dutton ) and T. rhodesiense ( Stephens and Fantham ) , occur .
( 2 ) These non-flagellate stages ( " latent bodies " of Moore and Breinl ) are especially found in the lungs , spleen , and bone marrow , during periods of decrease of trypanosomes in the peripheral blood of the host .
( 3 ) They are in process of formation at or near the time when the trypanosomes are most numerous in the peripheral blood .
The formation of latent bodies takes place especially in the lungs , and they collect in the spleen and bone marrow of the host .
( 4 ) In the formation of non-flagellate stages , some of the cytoplasm and the flagellum of the trypanosome are disintegrated .
The non-flagellate body contains the nucleus and blepliaroplast ( kinetonucleus ) of the trypanosome .
( 5 ) Non-flagellate ( latent ) bodies can be seen to grow and flagellate , turning into trypanosomes , when placed in fresh , warm , uninfected blood .
( 6 ) Latent bodies of T. rhodesiense , inoculated into a rat , flagellate and produce trypanosomiasis .
( 7 ) The non-flagellate ( latent ) bodies of trypanosomes ( T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense ) are the post-flagellate stages of one generation of trypanosomes and the pre-flagellate stages of the succeeding generation of trypanosomes .
( 8 ) There is a life-cycle of trypanosomes ( T. gambiense and T. rhodesiense ) in Vertebrate hosts , comparable with those of Crithidia and Herpetomonas in the alimentary tracts of various Invertebrates .
The latent ( relatively resistant ) stages of trypanosomes occurring in Vertebrates are separate from , and in addition to , stages of the parasite which may occur in the Invertebrate carrier ( for example , Glossina ) .
( 9 ) In the treatment of trypanosomiasis by drugs , careful note must be taken of the occurrence of rounded non-flagellate or latent forms of the parasite .
A drug needs to be found which will either prevent the formation of rounded ( latent ) stages , or disintegrate those latent bodies already formed .

B. ( Received October 15 , \#151 ; Read December 8 , 1910 .
) These experiments were conducted with funds given by Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence , Bart. , for the purpose of testing the effect of cold on disease , and were suggested by Major R. Ross as a part of the studies made in connection with a case of Sleeping Sickness reported upon in an accompanying paper by him and Dr. David Thomson .
Although many researches have been made on the effect of atoxyl and other drugs , we believe that these are the first in which that effect has been measured by regular daily counts of the parasites by measured thick film methods .
I. Atoxyl .
From a study of the patient W. A. at the Royal Southern Hospital by Major R. Ross and D. Thomson , it will be noted that atoxyl failed to be of any marked benefit to the patient , and in the doses administered there was no noticeable trypanocidal action .
Various doses of atoxyl are recommended in treatment of human trypanosomiasis , and the patient ( W. A. ) received 4 grains as a maximum dose .
It was impossible in this case to push the drug further , as the patient quickly showed signs of the toxic action of the drug .
Louis Martin and Henri Darre* believe that atoxyl can cure light forms * ' Bulletin of Sleeping Sickness , ' 1910 , vol. 2 , No. 18 .
