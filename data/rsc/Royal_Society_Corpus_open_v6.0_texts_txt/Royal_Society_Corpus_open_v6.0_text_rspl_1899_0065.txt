( Abstract .
) The recent blue coral Heliopora presents striking resemblances in structure to the palaeozoic Heliolites .
All the earlier writers on corals accordingly regarded the two genera as intimately allied .
But some later authorities consider the resemblances as accidental , and that the corals have no special affinities .
Thus , according to F. Bernard , Heliopora and Heliolites belong to distinct subphyla .
Lindstrom admits .only one species of Heliopora , and regards the genus as quite isolated , .as essentially distinct in structure from , and as further separated from the latter by " the total absence of all connecting links from the end of the middle Devonian to the recent times .
" The author , however , considers that the original view of the close affinity of Heliopora and Heliolites is correct , that the two genera are essentially similar in structure , and that they are linked by a series of eocene and cretaceous corals .
Amongst these fossils is the genus Polytremacis , which is redescribed , and a new species of Heliopora froih the Cretaceous of Somaliland .
It is suggested that Heliopora has descended from the palaeozoic Heliolitidae by degeneration in size and increase in number .of the coenenchymal caeca .
