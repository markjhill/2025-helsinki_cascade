Letter addressed to the Secretary R.S. by Dr. W. ROBERTS , F.R.S. Received December 1 , 1881 .
In deference to the request of Mr. W. R. Dunstan , I wish to correct an error of omission in my paper " On the Estimation of the Amy-lolytic and Proteolytic Activity of Pancreatic Extracts , " printed in " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 32 , p. 145 .
Mr. Dunstan points out to me that I had overlooked a paper by himself and Mr. A. E. Dimmock on the " Estimation of Diastase , published in the " Pharmaceutical Journal " for March 8th , 1879 , wherein he described a process , in which ( as in my method ) the cessation of the iodine reaction is utilised for the purpose of gauging the activity of diastasic solutions on starch gelatine .
I had not previously seen this paper , and am now glad to have the opportunity of referring to it those who are interested in diastasi-metry .
