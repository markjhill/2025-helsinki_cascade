( Abstract .
) The authors , after reviewing briefly the two theories on the nature of sun-spots , which are still subjects of dispute , refer to the stereoscopic views obtained and the results published in their 'Researches on Solar Physics , ' and state the reasons which have led them to believe that sun-spots are cavities and at a lower level than the sun 's photosphere .
Their opinion has been recently strengthened by observations of a sun-spot on the 7th of May , which in disappearing produced in two successive photograms indentations in the west limb .
After proving by the measurements made , which , with the calculations , are appended to their paper , that there can be no doubt about the identity of the heliographical elements of the previously observed spot and the successive indentations , they prove from the established details of the phenomena of sun-spots that such indentations must under all circumstances be very rare occurrences , and state fully the conditions favourable to the recurrence of similar observations , inviting observers to give their particular attention to them .
