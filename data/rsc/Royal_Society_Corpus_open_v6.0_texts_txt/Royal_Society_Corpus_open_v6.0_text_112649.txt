" On the Elimination of Nitrogen by the Kidneys and Intestines during Rest and Exercise , on a Diet without Nitrogen .
" By E. A. PARKS , M.D. , F.R.S. Received January 23 , 1867 .
The experiments recorded in this paper were undertaken to test the results arrived at by Professors Fick and Wislicenus , with respect to the elimination of nitrogen during exercise on a non-nitrogenous diet , as recorded in the Philosophical Magazine for June 1866 ( Supplement ) .
Although these results are supported by the previous experiments of Dr. Speck , who has shown that if the ingress of nitrogen be restricted , bodily exercise causes no , or a very slight increase in the elimination of nitrogen by the urine , it appeared desirable to carefully repeat all the experiments , not only because the question is one of great importance , but because objections might be , and indeed have been , reasonably made to the experiments of Professors Fick and Wislicenus on the ground that no sufficient basis of comparison between periods of rest and exercise was given ; that the periods were altogether too short , and that no attention was paid to the possible exit of nitrogen by the intestines .
In making the experiments , I was fortunate in being permitted to use the services of two perfectly healthy soldiers belonging to the Army Hospital Corps , and doing duty at the Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley .
When soldiers are steady and trustworthy , as these men were , they are good subjects for experiments of the kind , as they are accustomed to very regular diet and occupation , and moreover , from their habits of obedience , carry out all instructions with great precision .
The satisfactory results of my experiments , as shown by the almost perfect agreement in the effect on each man , is owing essentially to the very great care with which these two intelligent men carried out every rule which was laid down .
One of these men , S. , is an admirable example of an average man ; he is 22 ?
years old , 5 feet 8 inches in height , weighs close upon 150 lb. , is strong , with large bones and firm muscles , with sufficient but not excessive fat ; he is very temperate , and is no smoker .
He has never been ill in his life .
The second man , T. , is also a perfectly healthy man , and has only been ill twice , once in China six years ago with tertian ague , and about three years ago with intermittent hemicrania .
But he is in size and weight a good contrast to S. He is 36 years of age , very well proportioned and active , but is only 5 feet 4 inches in height , and weighs only lbs. HIis size is not owing to any imperfection in make or nutrition , but to the fact that he comes of a small race , his father being small , and his mother remarkably so .
i-e has small bones , good firm muscles , but very little fat .
In fact , he is a thin man .
In the following experiments , the amounts of the total nitrogen of the urine ( by sodalime ) , of the urea , of the chloride of sodium , and on certain occasions of the phosphoric and sulphuric acids , were determined .
The urea was determined by Liebig 's solution , the chlorine being first eliminated , the phosphoric acid by acetate of uranium , the sulphuric acid by baryta and weighing .
The urine was collected from 8 A.M. to 8 A.M. , and great care was taken not to lose any , and to pass it at the exact time .
The amount of water , solids , and nitrogen passed from the bowels were also determined on several occasions .
All the ingesta were most carefully weighed and measured , and the amount of water in the crimb and crust of bread and in the meat was determined .
The nitrogen in the bread was also determined , but the long time demanded by the other processes prevented a complete analysis of the other food ; this was , however , a matter of no importance as regarded the immediate object of the inquiry .
The experiments were commenced on December 6 , 1866 , and were continued daily till December 23 .
First Period of ordinary regulated Diet and Occupation .
The men were first kept under observation for six days , in order to determine the variations in weight and in the excreta , and to see if the metamorphosis of tissue appeared to be healthy .
This was found to be the case ; in fact , more completely healthy urinary and intestinal excreta could not be conceived .
The weight of the body ranged nearly 1 lb. avoir .
, or 1 kilog .
above and below the mean amount in each man .
The daily average amount of food and drink was only slightly different in each man , and the quantity taken from day to day was very uniform .
The men were not placed on any absolute quantity , but ate according to appetite within narrow limits .

The smaller man eat therefore absolutely rather less , but relatively more .

1335 1020-5 25-925 12-098 13-409 1-313 11685 The excretion of nitrogen was fairly constant from day to day , the range of the urea being , in the case of S. , from 38'37 to 33'36 grms. , or between 2 and 3 grms , above and below the mean amount ; and in the case of T. from 27'68 to 24-906 , or nearly 1 grm. above and below the mean amount .
This shows the daily equality of diet and exercise .

'512 '239 -265 '026 The very close relation , indeed identity , as far as the total nitrogen is concerned , of the excretion per kilog .
of body-weight in these two men comes out very clearly , and shows that there must be a real connexion between body-weight and urinary excretion .
It is remarkable that while the heavier man passed 41 grms. more nitrogen daily from the kidneys than the smaller man , he did not eat any great excess of food .
Unfortunately , as the nitrogen in the food was not perfectly determined , it is impossible to know precisely whether the 52 grms. of excess of solid food taken by the larger man would contain 4k grms. more nitrogen .
As , however , the amount of meat was precisely the 1867 .
] 341 same , and as the smaller man only took I oz. or 14 grms. less bread , and 25 grms. less vegetables , this would seem to be unlikely , and , if so , some of the nitrogen taken by T. must have passed off in other ways .
The mean relation of the ureal to the total nitrogen was very close in each man , being , if the ureal nitrogen is taken as unity , as 1 to 1 1 , and as 1 to 1'108 respectively .
From day to day , however , the relation varied .
The intestinal excretion was examined only on one day , the last but one of the series .

198-47 29-916 168-55 1'98 The smaller man passed rather more solids , water , and more nitrogen than the larger man , and through this channel some of the nitrogen unaccounted for by the urine must have escaped .
Whether this would account for the whole of it cannot be stated , as the experiments in respect of the nitrogen in the food and in the intestinal excreta of the whole period were not sufficiently exact to determine this point .
On the day when the intestinal excreta were analyzed , the total discharge of nitrogen by the kidneys and bowels was .

T. has rather a larger excretion ( chiefly of water ) by the kidneys and bowels , and rather less by the skin , hut the difference in not great .
He has also a larger excretion of nitrogen by the bowels than S. Second Period.-Non-nitrogenous Diet and Rest .
On the day following the men were placed for two days on a non-nitrogenous diet consisting of arrowroot , sugar , and butter , from which the casein had been separated .
The only nitrogenous substance taken was that contained in infusion of tea .
I thought it better to allow the use of warm tea , without milk , both for the comfort of the men and because I was afraid of deranging the tissue-changes by too complete an alteration of diet .
The arrowroot was made into cakes with butter and sugar , and was also taken as jelly .
Butter and sugar were taken as desired .
I put no restriction on quantity , but left it to choice and appetite .

4592 4592 It is of no consequence to calculate the proportion to body-weight , as some starch and sugar passed off by the bowels .
During these two days the men were kept in complete rest .
They were allowed to get up for fear keeping in bed should make them feverish , but they sat quite still , or lay down on the bed , and did not leave the room during the time .
The weight decreased in the case of S. from 67'7 to 66*5 kilogrammes , and in the case of T. from 50'6 to 49'8 kilogrammes .
The Urinary Excretion was collected as usual on the first day , from 8 A.M. to 8 A.M. ; but on the second day it was collected from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. , and again from 8 P.M. to 8 A.M , SO that the last twelve hours ' urine was secreted forty-eight to sixty hours after the last meal of nitrogenous food .
The lull details are given further on , and I will now merely state the mean results .
On the mean of the two days the urea of twenty-four hours fell from 35 grammes to 16'765 , or more than one-half in the case of S. , and from 26 to 15 , or rather less than one-half in the case of T. The amount of urea in the last twelve hours was only 5 and 4'2 grammes for the two men .
The total nitrogen , or a mean of the two days , fell from 17'97 and 13'4 to 8'176 and 7 grammes in the two men , while in the last twelve hours it was only 3'017 and 2 17 grammes , or at the rate of only 6'034 and 4*34 grammes in twenty-four hours .
Calculated according to body-weight , the results are per kilogramme : U-rea .

The sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids were determined on the last day ; the latter acid was in almost precisely the same absolute mean amount in each man , viz. '9533 and '941 gramme ; the larger man passed , however , one-third more sulphuric acid , viz. '633 as against '427 gramme .
In the last twelve hours the chloride of sodium fell to 1 and '42 gramme .

The excreta were quite bilious , and had a greenish tint .

1155 1065-5 The considerable derangement of the usual balance is very evident ; it depended in part on the greater amount of water taken as compared with the former period , but not apparently altogether .
The water of the kidneys and the insensible perspiration were increased , while the intestinal water was lessened .
There was no sugar in the urine detectable by common tests .
The effects of the diet in the two men being thus very similar , a satisfactory basis of comparison was obtained for the period of exercise .
Third Period.-Ordinary Food and Occupation .
The men then returned to their former regulated diet and usual occupation for four days .
Very nearly the same amount of food was taken as in the first period .
At the end of four days the weight of the body in each man had returned almost exactly to its former amount .
The excretion of urea and the total nitrogen ( which is given in more detail further on ) followed a course very similar in each man .
On the first day after the return to nitrogenous diet the urea was in round numbers 14 and 12 grammes respectively below the mean of the first period , that is to say , it was nearly the same as during the first day of nonnitrogenous feeding ; it then , in the case of S. , increased day by day till it reached 29'67 grammes on the fourth day .
In the case of T. it increased for two days , but fell a little on the fourth day ; the total nitrogen , however , increased regularly every day .
The general result was that whereas in four days of the first period on a similar diet and exercise the excretion of nitrogen was 71'892 and 53'636 grammes respectively , during these four days of the third period the excretion of nitrogen in the urine was only 51-952 and 44-38 grammes ; so that in the case of S. 19-94 and in the case of T. 9'256 grammes of nitrogen were retained in the body for the nutrition of the nitrogenous tissues which had been brought into a state of nitrogenous inanition for two days by cutting off the supply of nitrogen .
At the end of the four days it was considered that the tissues had recovered their composition .
Fourth Period.-Non-nitr-ogernous Diet and EExercise .
Diet.--The diet during this period was of the same kind as in the second period .
The men were directed to eat what they pleased of arrowroot made into cakes , and jelly , sugar , and the oil of butter .
They took in the two days of December 17-18 , and 18-19 , the following amounts : Non-nitrogenous Food in two days , in grammes , S. T. AVater-firee arrowroot ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 796-6 586-8 Water-free sugar ' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .

344-878 260-584 The amount of water drank in the two days was. .
5159'5 4762'6 .
Both men eat more during this period , partly because they felt more hungry , partly because the arrowroot-cakes were better made .
T. especially took more butter , to which he felt a distaste previously .
The diet satisfied hunger ; there was no sinking or craving for other kind of food , but it was monotonous , and neither man wished to continue it .
Exercise.-During these two days the men took the following amount of walking-exercise , on level ground .
On the first day the exercise commenced at 9 A.M. , and lasted till 7.45 P.M. with intervals .
On the second day it commenced at 9 A.M. , and lasted till 9 P.M. The men then went to bed .
First day.-23'76 miles=38'23 kilometres .
The work done was calculated according to Professor Haughton 's formula , that walking on a level surface is equal to lifting s-Ath of the weight through the distance walked .
S. , weight with clothes , 73'68 kilogrammes .
Work done = 140839 kilogramme-metres , or 453'6 tons lifted a foot .
T. , weight with clothes , 56'33 kilogrammes .
Work done = 107655 kilogrammes-metres , or 346-74 tons lifted a foot .
Second day.-Distance walked 327 8 miles =-5274 kilometres .
Work done .
S. =194294 kilogramme-metres .
625S8 tons lifted a foot .
T.= 14 7515 kilogramme-metres .
= 475 tons lifted a foot .
The first day 's walking iwas done pretty well by both men .
On the second day both men did the first 20 miles well , but felt very much fatigued during the last 13 miles .
During the last 4 miles each man felt pain in the small of his back .
Both men could , however , have marched on the following day if necessary .
With regard to the amount of fatigue as compared with other occasions , T. would give no opinion , as he said he had no fair basis of comparison .
S. , however , was clear that he was much more fatigued than on other food .
In 1865 in Ireland he marched 26 miles on one day and 20 on the following , carrying his rifle , accoutrements , and forty rounds of ball-cartridge ( an additional weight equal to 18 lb. nearly ) , and yet he did not feel fatigued at all ; while on the present occasion , marching without weight except his clothes , he felt much exhausted .
Both men felt hungry ; the food satisfied them ; neither had any perceptible action of the skin ; the days were fine and rather warm .
During these two days S. lost almost precisely 2 kilogrammes in weight , and T. lost 3 of a kilogramme .
The Urinary Excretion.-The urine was collected as usual from 8 A.M. to 8 A.M. on the first day , and from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. , and from 8 P.M. to 8 A.M. on the second day .
In order to compare this , I have placed together the chief urinary constituents in the two periods of rest and exercise .

In each man in the first twenty-four hours nearly 1 gramme less was excreted by each man in the period of exercise as compared with that of rest ; the larger man excreted nearly 3 grammes more urea than the smaller one .
In the next twelve hours each man excreted very nearly ?
a gramme less in the period of exercise as compared with rest .
The absolute quantity was almost precisely the same in each man ; in other words , the bulk of the larger man now had no effect in the urea .
In the last twelve hours ( chiefly rest during night ) the urea increased in each man in the period of exercise , as compared with that of rest , the absolute increase in S. being 2 grammes , and in T. 1 gramme .
Taking the whole period , Excretion of urea in two days in the period 1 S. T. of exercise as compared with rest ... ...

-343 Total excess of nitrogen during exercise period .
1*589 In the case of T. the total nitrogen during exercise was like the urea below the period of rest in the first 36 hours , but in the last 12 hours the excess of nitrogen in the period of exercise was so considerable as to cause the nitrogen of the two days of exercise to exceed that of rest by 0'223 gramme .
I draw the conclusion , therefore , that in both these men there was in the first 36 hours a decrease in the amount of urea ; but in the last 12 or rest-hours of the 48 hours of the period of exercise , an increase .
That in the case of S. the total nitrogen was increased throughout the whole period of exercise , the total increase being 1'589 gramme , or 24'5 grains of nitrogen , while in the case of T. the total nitrogen , like the urea , was lower in the first 36 hours of the period of exercise , but increased greatly in the last 12 hours .
It may , indeed , be said that the difference between the amounts in the two periods is after all so inconsiderable as to be explained by the necessary errors of observation .
But the constancy of the results in the two men , and in the case of T. , the amount on the first day after the work-period , as given further on , seem to me to show the excess to be real .
On the same diet the heavier man excreted rather more urea and total nitrogen throughout than the smaller man , except in the first 12 hours of the second active day , when the urea was a trifle less .
The excretion of nitrogen in the urea , as compared with the total nitrogen , was ( the ureal nitrogen being taken as unity ) as follows:-S .
T. Period of rest ... ... ... 1 to 1'042 1 to 1 13 Period of exercise ... ... 1 to 1'126 1 to 1'178 In both cases there appears to have been a greater relative excretion of the nitrogenous substances other than ureal .

The sulphuric acid was slightly increased in each man , but the increase was not great , and is perhaps within the limits of error .
Chloride of Sodium .
As no chloride of sodium was taken with the non-nitrogenous diet , the amounts excreted represent on the second day the mere waste of the tissues .

No sugar was detected in the urine by the ordinary tests of liquor potassse and Fehling 's copper solution .

In both men the nitrogen was in excess in the period of exercise , but the difference was not great , and may probably be disregarded .

the intestinal egesta were also much larger ; the urinary smaller , especially in the case of T. , who passed nearly 800 cub. centims. less of urine , though he took more fluid as drink .
Neither of the men were conscious of any perspiration .
Fifth Period.-Ordinary Diet and Exercise .
The men were now again placed on their weighed diet , and took their ordinary exercise for four days , except that on the day following the walk of 33 miles they were tired and rested a good deal .
This period has now to be compared with the third period , which followed that of rest .
As the amount of diet is very important , I give the mean amount in each of the four days of the third and fifth period , in English ounces .

It is to be regretted that the diet was not precisely the same ; but the differences are not very great , and it was thought desirable to allow the men to satisfy their appetites .
They were more hungry after the work-period than after the rest-period .
The weight increased in this period .
In two days S. gained 1 kilogramme and T. 1I kilogramme , each man nearly getting his proper weight .

Unfortunately , on the third day , in the case of T. , the determination of the nitrogen by soda-lime was not satisfactory , and as some time elapsed before it could be again done , the amount has been omitted .
But supposing there was the same relative excess over the ureal nitrogen as in the other days , the total nitrogen would have been 13*97 grms. Adopting this number , the following are the results : .
T. Excess of urea in four days in after work-period ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 3-364 7-700 Excess of total nitrogen in four days in after work-period ... ... ... ... 1-492 4-560 The question now arises , was this excess of nitrogen excreted during the after work-period the result of the elimination of the products of destroyed muscle during the work-period , or was it the consequence of an excess of nitrogenous food in the four days following the exercise ?
S. took 1'31 oz. avoirdupois more meat cooked and 3 oz. vegetables in the fifth than in the third period .
The percentage of water in the meat was 57'49 , and if the nitrogen be taken at 2'955 per cent. , there would be in 131 oz. of cooked meat ll1 grm. of nitrogen .
In the vegetable there would be about 0-04 grm. of nitrogen .
But from this amount must be deducted '325 grm. of nitrogen not taken in the bread , making the total daily excess of nitrogen taken in the fifth period -815 grm. ; the daily excess of nitrogen in the urine was , however , only -375 grm. ; therefore , in the case of S. , it cannot be affirmed that any excess of nitrogen was derived from disintegration of muscle during the exercise .
In the case of T. , the daily excess of nitrogen was larger , amounting daily to 1*14 grm. , but as the man took 1'245 oz. more meat , 1 oz. more bread , and almost an ounce more vegetable ( in all 1*2 grm. of nitrogen ) , it is evident that here also the excess of nitrogen in the urine might have been derived from the food .
However , it is really probable that some of the very large excess of urea on the first day of this period , in the case of T. , was really owing to augmented elimination from the work .
No such excess is observable in the case of S. , who had , however , a larger elimination than T. in the previous twelve hours .
The Chloride of Sodium .
The chloride of sodium rapidly returned to its previous amount .

171-1 ... ... ... ... 191'7 The large intestinal excretion on the first day , in the case of S. , was owing to a little looseness of the bowels ; there were two stools on that , day , being the only instance of irregularity in either man .
Otherwise , as compared with the first period , there is no evidence in either case of any increased excretion ; on the third day , indeed , the nitrogen was below that of the first period in each case .
The balance of ingesta and egesta was as follows on the third day of this period : S. T. .

The conclusions which can be drawn from the above experiments are not altogether accordant with those of Professors Fick and Wislicenus .
The decrease in the urea during the first thirty-six hours of the exercise-period , as compared with the rest-period , on a diet without nitrogen , which occurred in these two men , is , I think , conformable with the results obtained by the two experimenters mentioned ; but this is not the case with the increase in the urea which I found in the last twelve hours .
Yet that this increase is real is shown , I believe , by the accordant results in the two men , and by the increase of the total nitrogen of the exercise-period as determined by soda-lime .
The relative greater increase in my experiments of the non-ureal nitrogen ( which makes me believe that an excess of nitrogenous compound other than urea , and possibly creatinine especially , was produced by the exercise ) is not perceptible in their experiments , yet I cannot but believe that the fact was so , as it comes out with great clearness in the two men .
The following Table shows this .
Relation of ureal to non-ureal nitrogen , the former being taken as unity .

1 to 1-08 1 to 1 06 ( ?
) ( three days ) .
The reason which makes me believe the results are real , is the fact that the individual relation of the ureal and non-ureal nitrogen is preserved ; that is to say , in T. the non-ureal nitrogen is , under normal circumstances , a little in excess as compared with S. ; the same relative excess is also found in the work-period .
The reason of these differences between Professors Fick and Wislicenus and myself is probably to be found in the short period of time during which their observations were carried on , and also because the urea was not determined by them in the night of the 30th to 31st of August .
But their conclusion is certainly borne out , that on a non-nitrogenous diet exercise produces no notable increase in the nitrogen of the urine-although , when the whole period is considered , it does produce a slight increase .
It may now also be said that , under similar conditions , exercise produces no increase in the excretion of nitrogen by the bowels .
The diminution in the amount of urea during the actual period of work , as compared with the rest-period , which , if I am not mistaken , is obvious in both our experiments , is a very curious circumstance .
It shows , not that on a non-nitrogenous diet the nerves and muscles are totally unaffected by exercise , but that changes go on which either retain nitrogen in the body or eliminate it by another channel .
Is it possible that , when the excess of nitrogen is restricted , the exhausted muscle will take nitrogen from the products given off from another portion of decomposing muscle , and thus the nitrogen may be used over and over again ?
or , after all , is nitrogen really given off in some form by the skin during exercise , as formerly supposed ?
Although it is thus certain that very severe exercise can be performed on non-nitrogenous diet for a short time , it does not follow that nitrogen is unnecessary .
The largest experience shows , not only that nitrogen must be supplied if work is to be done , but that the amount must augment with the work .
For a short period the well-fed body possesses sufficient nitrogen to permit muscular exertion to go on for some time without a fresh supply ; but the destruction of nitrogenous tissues in these two men is shown by the way in which , when nitrogen was again supplied , a large amount was retained in the body to compensate for the previous deprivation .
I believe also that in these two men the great exhaustion of the second day showed that their muscles and nerves were becoming structurally impaired , and that , if the experiments had been continued , there would have been on the third day a large diminution in the amount of work .
I have found that the period when a restricted supply of nitrogen begins to tell on the work differs in different men .
In one experiment I reduced the nitrogen in the food to one-half its normal quantity in two men : in one , no effect was produced on exercise in seven days ; in the other , a lessening of active bodily work was produced in five days .
Doubtless the previous nutrition of the muscle would influence the time .
Finally , it may be questioned whether the relation of elimination of nitrogen to exercise can be properly determined in this manner , i. e. by cutting off the supply of nitrogen .
The true method would probably be to supply nitrogen in certain definite amount , so that the acting muscle might appropriate at once what it required .
