] Having previously ascertained the teredo and the lamprey to be hermaphrodites , and that in these tribes the same individual both forms and impregnates the ova , the author shows upon the present occasion , that eels and barnacles are similar in their mode of generation .
In respect to the former , the author adopts the opinion of Sir Humphry Davy , that the common and the conger eel belong to the same species , their difference in size and colour depending upon the one living in fresh and the other in salt water .
Their organs of generation are precisely similar .
Sir Everard points out some errors into which anatomists had fallen in describing these , more especially with respect to the eel tribe , in which the kidneys being immediately behind the peritoneum , and closely connected , the whole mass has been mistaken for kidney .
In that species of barnacle called Lepas anatifera , the ovaria are situated round the oesophagus , and the ova are impregnated before they leave the ovaria .
The author concludes this paper with an account of the structure of the organs of generation in the earth worm , and of their mode of copulation .
These , as well as the other anatomical facts detailed in this communication , are illustrated by reference to a variety of drawings .
