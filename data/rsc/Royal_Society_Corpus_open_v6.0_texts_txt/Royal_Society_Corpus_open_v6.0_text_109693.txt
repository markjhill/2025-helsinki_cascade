] The separation , by electric powers , of substances chemically united , suggests the possibility , that since the same power is known to exist in the torpedo and electrical eel , it might be the means by which secretion in all animals is effected .
Since in these fish the abundance of nerves connected with the electrical organs proves that this power resides in them , and since the arrangement of many nerves in animal bodies has evidently no connexion with sensation , it seems not improbable that these may answer the purpose of supplying and regulating the organs of secretion .
With a view to determine what changes could be produced in the blood similar to secretion , Mr. Brand applied the power of twentyfour pair of four-inch plates of copper and zinc to blood , and extracted acid and alkali at the opposite wires .
A second experiment was made , with similar results , on blood still fluid , in the vein of an animal just killed .
A third experiment was made upon serum , with 120 plates highly charged , with the same result .
A fourth experiment was conducted in a similar manner , with 12 pair of plates , with sinmilar results .
In a fifth experiment , 30 pair of plates , very weakly charged , also extracted alkali and acid from serum exposed to them .
Since powers so weak are capable of separating the constituent parts of blood , it is suggested that the weaker powers existing in animals may produce the same effect , and thus occasion all the different secretions , and modify albumen into the states of the different animal solids .
