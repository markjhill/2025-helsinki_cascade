A paper was read , entitled , Supplement to a paper " On the Theo ?
retical Explanation of an apparent new Polarity in Light ; " by George B. Airy , Esq. , M.A. , F.R.S. , Astronomer Royal .
In a paper published in the second part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1840 , the author explained , on the undulatory theory of light , the phenomena observed by Sir David Brewster , and apparently indicating a new polarity in light .
That explanation was founded on the assumption that the spectrum was viewed out of focus ; an assumption which corresponded with the observation of the author and of other persons .
But the author having , since the publication of that memoir , been assured by Sir David Brewster that the phenomenon was most certainly observed with great distinct ?
ness when the spectrum was viewed so accurately in focus that many of Frauenhofer 's finer lines could be seen , he has continued the theoretical investigation for that case , which had been omitted in the former memoir , namely , when the spectrum is viewed in focus ; and he has arrived at a result , which appears completely to reconcile the seemingly conflicting statements , and to dispel the obscurity in which the subject had hitherto been enveloped .
