[ June 3 440 Election of .
II .
Soft-Iron .
Wires of about the same gauge as the steel were used , but , except one of them , bore only about 28 lbs. instead of 230 .
All of three or font kinds tried agreed with the steel in ( 1 ) .
The first tried behaved ( except a seeming anomaly , hitherto unexplained ) in the reverse manner to steel in respect to ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) ; it agreed with the steel in respect to ( 7 ) .
Another iron wire* , which , though called " soft , " was much less soft than the first , agreed with steel in respect to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , but [ differing from steel in respect to ( 3 ) ] showed greater effects of weights on and off when the magnetizing current was flowing than when it was stopped .
Other soft-iron wires which were very soft , softer even than the first , agreed with all the steel and iron wires in respect to ( 1 ) , but gave results when tested for ( 2 ) which proved an exceedingly transient character of the residual magnetism , and were otherwise seemingly anomalous .
The investigation is being continued with special arrangements to find the explanation of these apparent anomalies , and with the further object of ascertaining in absolute measure the amounts of all the proved effects at different temperatures up to 100 ' Cent. The Society then adjourned over the Election-day , to Thursday , June 10 .
June 3 , 187'5 , .
The Annual Meeting for the election of Eellows was held this day .
JOSEPH DALTON HOOKER , C.B. , President , in the Chair .
The Statutes relating to the election of Eellows having been read , Mr. A. J. Ellis and Admiral Ommanney were , with the ' consent of the Society , nominated Scrutators to assist the Secretaries in examining the lists .
The votes of the Eellows present having been collected , the following candidates were declared duly elected into the Society * It was tested magnetically with weights up to 56 lbs. , and broke , unfairly how-erer , when 63 lbs. were hung on .

( Abstract .
) The present memoir relates to multiple integrals expressed in terms of the ( s + 1 ) ultimately disappearing variables . .

Such an integral , in regard to the index -f- q , is said to be " prepotential , " and in the particular case q= \#151 ; | to be " potential .
