) Further experiments upon the effect of pressure upon arc spectra have been made with the pressure cylinder ( designed by Prof. J. E. Petavel , F.R.S. ) which was employed by the writer in the investigations of the iron* and copperf arcs , , in which an arc is formed between metal poles opposite a glass window through which the light is examined by means of the 21^ feet Rowland grating-spectroscope in the Physical Laboratories of the Manchester University .
A system of mirrors allows the image of the arc , however unsteady it may be , to be kept almost continuously in focus upon the slit .
Photographs of the silver arc in air have been taken under ( total ) pressures of 1 , 6 , 11 , 21 , 26 , 51 , 61 , 76 , 81 , 101 , 121 , and 201 atmospheres , and the results are given below for wave-lengths W 4000\#151 ; 4600 .

] The Effect of Pressure upon Arc Spectra .
IY .
The gradual disappearance of the line spectrum as the pressure is increased .
Y. Its replacement by a banded spectrum .
YI .
The development of the banded spectrum into a continuous spectrum .
B. The Line Spectrum .
I. Broadening \#151 ; Within the region XX 4000\#151 ; 4600\#151 ; 1 .
All silver lines broaden under pressure .
2 .
The broadening increases with the pressure ; different amounts of exposure make it difficult to determine if the increase is continuous and linear with the pressure .
3 .
The broadening of the silver lines between X = 4000 and X = 4600 is unsymmetrical .
4 .
Under pressure , three types of broadening are distinguishable:\#151 ; i. The wings of the lines become hazy and band-like and present structure .
ii .
The line broadens slightly , but preserves the character of a definite line , iii .
The line appears to become the violet edge of a band which stretches further towards the red as the pressure increases .
The initial line ultimately ceases to be distinct .
5 .
No simple relation has been found between the original intensity of a line and its width under pressure .
6 .
The magnitude of the broadening of the first sub-series line is as great as 120 A.U. at 20 atmospheres .
7 .
In lines of Type i , the structure is different for the two wings of the same line and also for different lines of the same type .
II .
Displacement\#151 ; 1 .
Under pressure the most intense portions of the silver lines which remain sufficiently definite for measurements to be made are displaced from the positions they occupy at one atmosphere .
2 .
Reversed as well as bright lines are displaced .
3 .
With increase of pressure the displacement is towards the red end of the spectrum within the region XX 4000 to 4600 under consideration , but a few displacements towards the violet have been measured in another part of the silver spectrum .
4 .
The displacement is real and not due to unsymmetrical broadening .
5 .
The rates of increase of displacements with the pressure are different for different lines .

[ Jan. 9 , III .
Reversal\#151 ; Within the region W 4000 to 4600\#151 ; 1 .
Those lines that are originally reversed show signs of reversal up to 20 atmospheres , but at a later stage the disintegration of these lines masks any absorption that may take place .
2 .
The reversals become broader under pressure , but the structure of the wings of the lines makes this indefinite .
3 .
The reversals show two types , both of which are unsymmetrical .
4 .
In one type the absorbed part is on the violet , and in the other type on the red side of the centre of the bright line at one atmosphere .
IV .
Relative Intensity\#151 ; 1 .
The silver lines show marked changes in relative intensity under pressure .
2 .
Though their original intensities are extremely different they have all practically ceased to exist as lines at a pressure of 25 atmospheres .
3 .
The lines of the first sub-series are relatively the most weakened , first becoming , as in the case of copper , very broad , diffuse bands , and ultimately being completely dissipated .
4 .
The line of the second sub-series vanishes without abnormal widening .
It does not give rise to a diffuse band as do the first sub-series lines .
5 .
In these respects , in the limited regions of the spectrum examined in the two cases , the two subordinate series behave similarly in the silver and copper arcs .
C. The Banded Spectrum .
This spectrum , first noticeable at 20 atmospheres , is an emission spectrum .
I. Broadening:\#151 ; 1 .
All the bands become broader as the pressure is increased .
2 .
It has not been determined if the broadening is continuous and linear with the pressure .
3 .
The broadening is , within the limits of the error of measurement , symmetrical .
4 .
The widths of the bands are very different , the largest measured being nearly 40 l.U. ; at 20 atmospheres they are seen to be composed of fairly fine lines .
II .
Displacement\#151 ; The width of the bands makes the exact determination of their centres a matter of great difficulty , and it is impossible to say with certainty if there is any displacement as the pressure is increased .
There is some slight evidence in favour of a small displacement towards the red .

III .
Reversal\#151 ; None of the bands show any signs of reversal under pressure .
IV .
Relative Intensity\#151 ; 1 .
The bands further from the lines of the first sub-series gain in intensity as the pressure is increased relatively to those near these lines .
2 .
The absolute intensity of these bands also increases with the pressure , and less exposure is required at high pressures .
3 .
The banded spectrum is intimately related to the lines of the first sub-series .
D. Brightness of the Arc. 1 .
The brightness increases as the pressure increases .
2 .
Other conditions being equal , the brightness is dependent upon the freshness of the air in the cylinder , and also upon the coolness of the poles .

) The spectrum of the gold arc in air has been examined in the region X = 3550 to X = 5100 A.U. under the following pressures :\#151 ; 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 150 , 175 , 200 atmospheres ( excess above one atmosphere ) .
I. Broadening\#151 ; 1 .
All lines in the gold arc spectrum are broader under high pressures than when under atmospheric pressure .
2 .
The broadening increases with the pressure .
3 .
The broadening is different for different lines ; some remain fairly fine throughout , others are greatly broadened , and others become so diffuse and hazy that they resemble bands at the highest pressures .
4 .
No fine structure such as was observed in the wings of the silver lines occurs in the gold arc .
5 .
Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical broadenings have been observed .
The latter may be either unilateral or bilateral .
6 .
A few instances of a broadening towards the violet have been noted ; in the majority of cases of unsymmetrical broadening the extension is greater on the red side .
7 .
Lines , whether symmetrical or unsymmetrical , broadened to the red or violet , preserve their type throughout the whole range of pressure .
8 .
In the case of some very strong lines two vibrating systems seem to enter into the composition of the broadened line , of which it is suggested that one is derived from the other by increased pressure .
The Effect of Pressure upon Arc Spectra .
II .
Displacement\#151 ; 1 .
Under pressure the most intense portions of those lines that broaden symmetrically or unsymmetrically towards the red are displaced from the positions they occupy at a pressure of one atmosphere , and the displacement ' is in the direction of greater wave-length .
2 .
Some doubt is felt about the sense and amount of the displacement of those lines that broaden towards the violet end of the spectrum ; they appear to be displaced towards the violet , as are some of the silver lines , but the displacements are in such cases very small .
3 .
The displacements that have been measured are real and not due to unsymmetrical Broadening , i.e. , the line is broadened about a displaced position .
4 .
Though the relation between the pressure and the displacement is approximately linear , there is evidence favouring a slightly greater rate of displacement at low than at high pressures .
5 .
The rates of displacement are different for different lines .
6 .
The lines of the gold arc spectrum can be grouped together according to their rates of displacement with the pressure .
7 .
Three groups can in this way be separated from one another , the displacements of Groups I , II , and III bearing to one another the approximate ratio of 1:2:4 .
A fourth group ( Group IY ) is formed by those lines that are broadened ( and displaced ?
) to the violet .
8 .
The lines of Group III differ amongst themselves in the amounts of their displacement .
9 .
The displacements per atmosphere of the lines of Group III are approximately proportional to the cubes of their respective wave-leugths .
10 .
The highest mean displacement per atmosphere measured is 7'8 thousandths of an A.U. , the greatest individual displacement , at + 200 atmospheres , being 1*26 A.U. III .
Reversal\#151 ; None of the gold lines within the region examined showed any sign of reversal under pressure .
IV .
Relative Intensity\#151 ; Changes in the relative intensities of lines occur under increased pressure .
Lists are given of those lines that are weakened and strengthened under pressure .
Y. Brightness\#151 ; 1 .
The brightness of the gold arc increases greatly with the increase of pressure of the surrounding air .

123 2 .
The coolness of the poles and the freshness of the air supply are important features in causing the arc to burn steadily and brightly .
YI .
Banded Spectrum\#151 ; Faint hazy patches of light appear upon the plates taken at the highest pressures in regions of the spectrum which at low pressures do not contain spectrum lines ; they constitute an incipient banded spectrum resembling that observed in the silver spectrum at much lower pressures , but are not a marked characteristic of the spectrum and are not accompanied by a disappearance of the line spectrum as in the case of the silver arc .

XI.-\#151 ; The Displacement of Salts from Solution by Various By H. E. Armstrong , F.R.S. , and J. Vargas Eyre , Ph. D. ( Received and read June 24 , 1909 .
) In a previous communication on this subject* we have described a series of observations made at 25 ' with ammonium , sodium and potassium chlorides and a few other haloids , the main result arrived at in the case of these chlorides being that the two precipitants , hydrogen chloride and ethylic alcohol , exercise the same kind of influence\#151 ; a conclusion of some interest in view of the fact that alcohol is a neutral " unionisable " substance .
In all cases , the precipitant appeared to have an exceptionally marked effect when used in relatively small amount .
The results obtained by Engel with hydrogen chloride at 0 ' also appeared to justify this conclusion .
As we could not but recognise that the determinations were subject to a variety of errors and that very small differences were involved in our estimations of the effect of small quantities of the precipitant , in extending the inquiry we have revised most of our earlier work .
We have used not only ethylic alcohol and hydrogen chloride but also methylic and propylic alcohols as precipitants of ammonium , potassium and sodium chlorides , both at 25 ' and 0 ' .
A few observations have also been made on the influence of salts and of glucose as precipitants .
Speaking generally , the results serve to confirm most of the conclusions of our earlier work and even show closer agreement in the behaviour of the different precipitants than was formerly pictured ; it is clear , however , that * These Studies , Paid II , 'Roy .
