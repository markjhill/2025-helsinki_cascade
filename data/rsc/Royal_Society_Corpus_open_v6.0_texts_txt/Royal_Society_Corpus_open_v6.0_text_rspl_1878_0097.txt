Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending October 31 , 1878 .
The Kew Committee has had its strength increased during the past i year by the accession of two new members , Professor W. Gr .
Adams m and Professor G. C. Poster , and is now constituted as follows:\#151 ; General Sir B. Sabine , K.O.B. , Chairman .
Mr. De La Rue , Vice-Chairman .
Prof. W. G. Adams .
Capt. Evans , C.B. Prof. G. C. Foster .
Mr. F. Galton .
Vice-Adm .
Sir G. H. Richards , K.C.B. The Earl of Rosse .
Mr. R. H. Scott .
Lieut.-General W. J. Smythe .
Lieut.-General R , Strachey , C.S.I. Mr. E. Walker .
Magnetic Work.\#151 ; The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout the year , but only few magnetic disturbances have been I registered , the period being one of almost continued magnetic calm , fl The most notable perturbation was that of May 15th .
The scale values of all the instruments were re-determined in 1 January , in accordance with the usual practice .
A slight alteration has been made in the cases enclosing the hori- 1 .zontal and vertical force magnets ; zinc cylinders with glass covers I being substituted for the glass shades lined with gold-leaf previously 1 employed , which were found to be very expensive to replace in case of 1 breakage .
The tabulation of the magnetic curves has not been continued 1 during the year , the time of the department being very fully occupied 1 with the verification of magnetic instruments .
The Committee have referred the whole subject of the reduction of 1 the accumulated magnetograph records to a Sub-Committee , with a 1 view of considering what steps shall be taken to utilize them to the I best advantage .
The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been | Report of the KCommittee .
81 b made as usual by Mr. Figg , and the results are given in Tables [ ( appended to this Report .
The catalogue of the documents and papers in the late Magnetic B Office , directed by Sir E. Sabine , having been completed , a selection iwas made of all those relating to marine observations , and at the prequest of the Hydrographer , these were transferred to the Hydro-pgraphic Department of the Admiralty .
The magnetic instruments have been examined and knowledge of \#166 ; their manipulation obtained by Lieutenants Speelman and van Hasselt , of the Dutch Navy ; Professor Greene , of the United States a Navy ; M. Hooreman , of the Brussels Observatory ; and Dr. T. E. riThorpe , F.R.S. The latter gentleman made a series of base observations at Kew tsbefore and after an extended tour , for the purpose of a magnetic usurvey along the fortieth parallel of latitude in the United States .
J A large magnet and a journeyman clock , the property of the Royal i Observatory , Greenwich , which have been for many years at Kew , f have been returned to the former establishment at the request of the liAstronomer Royal .
Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and various edata have been supplied to the Hydrographic Office , Mr. Adie , JMr .
Archbutt , Mr. Gordon , and Mr. Frost .
Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments for the ( continuous registration respectively of pressure , temperature , humidity , i'wind ( direction and velocity ) , and rain have been maintained in regular ^operation under the care of Mr. T. W. Baker , assisted by J. Hillier .
I The daily standard eye observations , for the control of the automatic ^records have been made regularly , as well as daily observations in 0 connexion with the Washington synchronous system .
The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly P carried on by Mr. Hawkesworth , and copies have been transmitted \gt ; weekly to the Meteorological Office .
1 , , In compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council ( to the Kew Committee , the Observatories at Aberdeen , Armagh .
3 Falmouth , Glasgow , Stonyhurst , and Valencia have been visited and f their instruments inspected by Mr. Whipple , who has also inspected i the telegraph-reporting and climatological stations throughout Ireland , an allowance has been made by the Meteorological Office to Kew , for j the time occupied by Mr. Whipple on this duty .
With the sanction of the Meteorological Council , weekly abstracts of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to and J published by " the Times , " " Illustrated London News , " and " Mid-I Surrey Times ; " and meteorological data have been supplied amongst I others to Mr. G. J. Symons , F.R.S. , Dr. Rowland , Mr. Mawley , and II the Institute of Mining Engineers .

'|| Rledrograph.\#151 ; This instrument has been in almost continuous action I through the year under the care of Mr. Harrison .
Certain improve- j ments in minor details , suggested by Sir W. Thomson , have been j introduced from time to time .
It has been thought desirable to make a determination of the scale value of the instrument throughout the whole extent of its range J The Committee not possessing a sufficiently powerful battery for tho purpose , the Electrometer was conveyed at Mr. De La Rue 's sugges-| tion to his Laboratory , where a complete determination of its scale value was made over the range of tension afforded by 1,200 chloride of silver cells .
A detailed account of the experiment was afterwardsj laid before the Royal Society , and printed in the " Proceedings , " vol. xxvii , p. 356.* At the request of Professor Mascart , a typical set of curves !
illustrating the action of the Electrograph during different kinds of J weather , was reduced and engraved by the Pantagraph at the f Meteorological Office , and forwarded for his use in illustration of the !
lectures he delivered before the Societe Meteorologique de France .
These engravings have since been reproduced , together with notes* respecting the instrument , in a Report on Atmospheric Electricity , !
drawn up by Professor Everett , for the Permanent Committee of the ?
Vienna Congress , which is about to be published by the authority of !
the Meteorological Council .
The late Captain R. G. Scott , R.E. , and since his decease , Captain R.l Y. Armstrong , R.E. , visited the Observatory and inspected the working !
of the instrument with the view of possibly utilizing the Electro-J meter in the study of atmospheric electricity at the various torpedo * stations round the coast .
Two Electrographs , similar in construction to the instrument at j Kew , have been constructed by Mr. White , of Glasgow , and afterJ examination at the Observatory , forwarded , the one to the Brussels ^ Observatory , the other to Zi-ka-Wei , China .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; The re-examination of the measurements of the !
Kew sun-pictures , as noticed in former Reports , has been steadily J carried on throughout the year by Mr. Whipple , assisted by Mr. J McLaughlin , who has been temporarily engaged for this purpose .
During the year upwards of 400 pictures have been measured , and 1 it is hoped that the end of the series will be reached in the early ; months of 1879 .
* With the view of rendering the indications of the instrument better adapted J| for treatment with the Harmonic Analyser , it is in contemplation to somewhat alter the existing bifilar suspension of the needle , and at the same time to adopt the new insulating stand devised by Professor Mascart ( " Nature , " vol. xviii , p. 44 ) -3 which will be substituted for the present supports of the water reservoir .
These j changes may cause a short discontinuity in the observations .
Report of the Kew Committee .
I \#165 ; Mr. Marth is still engaged on the reduction to heliocentric elements the pictures for 1864 to 1868 inclusive .
All of these operations have been conducted under the direction and the expense of Mr. De La Rue .
The eye-observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made daily , when possible , as described in the aReport for 1872 , in order for the present to maintain the continuity of the Kew record of sun-spots .
J Extra Observations.\#151 ; The Solar-radiation Thermometers are still ^\#166 ; observed daily , and a new form of the instrument designed by Pro-\#166 ; fessor G. C. Foster , is at present undergoing trial .
'l The question of observing Solar Radiation having been referred by )the Meteorological Council to the Kew Committee , a sub-committee 4has been appointed to take the whole subject into consideration .
oT The Campbell Sundial described in the 1875 Report , continues in ''faction , and the improved form of the instrument , giving a separate 4record for every day , of the duration of sunshine , has been regularly worked throughout the year and its curves tabulated .
m \#166 ; A paper comparing the relative amount of sunshine recorded by this tyljnstrument during the year 1877 , with the amount registered at the iJ\gt ; Rioyal Observatory , Greenwich , by a similar apparatus , has been read ufoy the Superintendent before the Meteorological Society , and published in their Quarterly Report , vol. iv , No. 28 .
It shows that the Btlifference in the total duration of sunshine observed at the two imitations , which amounted to 171 hours in the year , was in great mea-rojsure due to the preponderance of westerly winds , which carry the dopmoke of the metropolis over the Royal Observatory .
A copy of the Kew instrument , constructed by Mr. Browning for ai , he Brussels Observatory , has been compared at the Observatory ; and k| another instrument , with a new form of mounting , designed by Mr. *MR .
J. Lecky , F.R.A.S. , is at present being tried .
Wind Component Integrator.\#151 ; This instrument , at the time of the mast Report , was working temporarily , attached to the Kew Anemo-iiltpgraph .
This arrangement was found , however , to interfere with the Jfrjgregular action of the latter instrument , and accordingly its own cups and vane , sent over by Professor von Oettingen , have been fitted to it J oy Mr. R. W. Munro ; and with the exception of a small period , during jrlf/ which it was under repair ( one of the cups having been carried away oy a high wind ) , it has been in good action .
A comparison of its indications with those of the ordinary instrument will shortly be ipfchmade .
tl\#171 ; Plioto-nephoscope.\#151 ; This instrument , designed by Professor Stokes II find Mr. F. Galton for the purpose of photographing clouds at the \gt ; irime of their passage across the zenith , has been the subject of experiment for some time , with a view of its adoption as a means of triga84 Report of the Kew Committee .
nometrically determining the height of clouds .
The experiments are I still in progress .
Verifications.\#151 ; The Committee have to report that the work of this !
department of the Observatory is still increasing , and its field ex-j tending , the makers who send instruments for examination , from !
places both at home and abroad , is continually becoming morel numerous .

1 \#166 ; A Barograph and Thermograph have been examined , and their iscale values determined , for the Brussels Observatory ; also a similar hpair of instruments for the Zi-ka-Wei Observatory , and a Thermo-asgraph for the Japanese Government .
There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification , " 19 Barometers , 182 Thermometers , 4 Anemometers , and 1 Rain-jgauge .
A number of Aneroid Barometers , of a new pattern , have been ^received from MM .
Hottinger and Co. , of Zurich , for comparison .
The " Hall Mark , " figured in last report , has been etched , at the 9desire of the makers , upon a number of the Thermometers compared flat the Observatory .
\#166 ; A Hydraulic Press especially constructed for the purpose of sub-ejecting Deep sea Thermometers to pressures similar to those they ijexperience when sunk to great depths , has been erected in the workshop , by Messrs. Hopkinson and Cope .
It is capable of exerting l a strain equal to 4 tons on the square inch .
Several protected Ther-Jlmometers have been found to stand this test successfully .
Air Thermometer.\#151 ; The Committee are taking steps , to obtain a \#166 ; standard air thermometer .
il The old " Royal Society " Standard Barometer , with the flint and ^crown-glass tubes refilled by Hegretti and Zambra , has been compared \#166 ; with the Kew standard daily for several months .
Its scale has also a been measured and its error determined .
- Comparison of Standard Barometer\#151 ; The account of the com-ftparison of the Standard Barometers at Greenwich and Kew , which \#171 ; resulted in proving a close agreement between the standards of the Wtwo Observatories , was published in the " Royal Society Proceed-j|ings , " vol. xxvii , p. 76 .
With a view to determine the source of small variations in the ^correction to the working standard of the Observatory ( Newman 34 ) nand the large Welsh 's standards , numerous comparisons have been si made between the instruments , from time to time , but as yet without 1 success .
Professor B. Stewart has had similar series of readings made ^ between the Owens College ordinary Standard Barometer and one after the Kew model , also filled by Welsh 's system .
The results tend | to show a most close agreement between the two forms of instruReport of the Ke Committee .

APPENDIX I. Magnetic Observations made at the Kew , Lat. 51 ' 28 ' 6 " N. , Long. Oh lm 15s l W. , for the year October 1877 to September 1878 .
The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1 , and the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones .
The Declination observations have also been made with the same , Magnetometer , Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose .
The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33 , the needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3^- inches in length .
The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the values of the Horizontal Force , which , being combined with the Dip observations , furnish the Vertical and Total Forces .
These are expressed in both English and metrical scales\#151 ; the unit in the first being one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain ; and in the other one millimetre , one second of time , and one milligramme , the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0*46108 .
By request , the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given .
The value of log 7t3K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at temperature 60 ' F. The induction-coefficient is 0*000194 .
The correction of the magnetic power for temperature tQ to an adopted standard temperature of 35 ' F. is 0*0001194(\#163 ; o\#151 ; 35 ) + 0*000,000,213(*0-35)2 .
The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected magnets , when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar marked 1*0 foot and 1*3 feet , are 1*000075 feet and 1*300097 feet respectively .
The times of Vibration given in the Table are each derived from the mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in making 100 vibrations , corrections being applied for the torsion-force of the suspension-thread subsequently .
No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of vibration , these being always very small .
The value of the constant P , employed in the formula of reduction f=5'(1_-5)is-0'00179- In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental readings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected about a quarter of a mile north of the Observatory as a meridian mark , the orientation of which , with respect to the Magnetometer , was determined by the late Mr. Welsh , and has since been carefully verified .
The observations have all been made and reduced by Mr. F* G. Figg .
