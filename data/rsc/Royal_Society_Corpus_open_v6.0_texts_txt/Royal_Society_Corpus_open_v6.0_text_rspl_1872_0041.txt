\#171 ; On the Combined Action of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins.^ By T. E. Thorpe and John Young , of the Ander-sonian University , Glasgow .
Communicated by Prof. H. E. Roscoe , F.R.S. Received June 5 , 1872* .
1 .
In a preliminary communication read before the Royal Society on March 9th , 1871f , we described the combined effect of heat and pressure upon the solid paraffins .
We showed that when these substances are exposed to a high temperature in a closed vessel they are almost completely resolved , with the evolution of but little gas , into hydrocarbons , which remain liquid at the ordinary temperature .
This transformation may be easily effected on the small scale .
A few grms. of ordinary paraffin are sealed up in a piece of strong combustion-tubing bent in the form of the letter y : the tube is securely surrounded by stout wire gauze , and the limb containing the paraffin is gently heated along its entire length in a gas combustion-furnace .
If the heat is properly regulated , the paraffin rapidly distils over and solidifies in the cold portion of the tube .
The gas-flames are then turned down , the tube reverse , and the paraffin again distilled .
After a very few repetitions of this process the paraffin acquires the consistency of butter , and the waimt \#187 ; Read June 20,1872 .

of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins .
185 of the hand is sufficient to liquefy it , and after about a dozen distillations it remains permanently liquid .
Although there is no difficulty in thus ultimately effecting the resolution of the solid paraffin into liquid products , the rapidity of the transformation seems to be dependent upon conditions which we cannot yet say we have satisfactorily determined .
On one occasion , after all the paraffin had been distilled over and had solidified in the colder limb of the tube , the empty portion in contact with the flame became softened and blew out , when instantly , on the removal of the pressure , the solid matter became liquid , and slightly effervesced as if gas had been condensed in the substance by the pressure to which it had been subjected .
It seems to be absolutely necessary that the paraffin should be thus distilled over and condensed ; by merely heating it in the tube in such a manner that the condensed vapours flow back again upon the heated portion , the liquefaction of the paraffin is never accomplished .
About 6 grms. of a pure paraffin , melting at 41'*5 C. ( see section 12 ) , were heated in a sealed tube to about 200 ' for twelve hours , but the melting-point remained unchanged .
The same portion of paraffin was then transferred to a y-tube surrounded by wire gauze , and distilled backwards and forwards in the combustion-furnace .
After six distillations it was rendered completely liquid .
The total quantity of liquid obtained was about 6 cub. centims. On gently warming it , bubbles of gas were evolved , and the liquid was in full ebullition at 40 ' , but only about one sixth came over below 100 ' ; about cub. centims. distilled between 100 ' and 200 ' , and nearly the whole of the remainder below 300 ' ; the small quantity remaining solidified when the bulb was plunged into cold water .

It appears that only paraffins boiling at an extremely high temperature , and those usually solid under ordinary conditions , are thus susceptible of decomposition .
The readiness with which they yield liquid hydrocarbons appears to depend upon the complexity of their constitution .
We have not determined with certainty the limits of the decomposition ; but we find that the paraffin ( and olefine ) boiling at about 255 ' ( see section 11 ) may be repeatedly distilled backwards and forwards in a sealed y-tube without suffering the slightest change .
6-7 grms. of the mixture of hydrocarbons were distilled backwards and forwards twenty-one times ; but on opening the tube no gas wras evolved , and the boiling-point ( 252'-255 ' uncorrected ) remained unaltered .
A further proof of its unalterability on repeated distillation under pressure is afforded by its reaction with bromine ( see section 5 ) .
I. 9-38 grms. of the mixed hydrocarbons before distillation required 2*95 grms. of bromine before the liquid became permanently reddened ; 100 parts by weight would require 31*4 .
II .
8-605 grms. hydrocarbon before distillation required 2*672 grms. of bromine , or 100 grms. would require 31 of bromine .
Mean amount of bromine needed 31-2 per cent. 186 Messrs. Thorpe and Young on the Combined Action III .
5*13 grins , of the hydrocarbon after repeated distillation ( 21 times ) required 1-54 grm. of bromine , or 100 grins , would require 30 grms. 3 .
In the hope of throwing some light upon the constitution of the solid paraffins , we have repeated this process of transformation into liquid products upon a large scale .
The paraffin employed was obtained from shale ; it melted at 46 ' and solidified at 43 ' , and had a specific gravity of 0-906 at 13 ' , when solidified under an extra pressure of 0-75 millim. of mercury* .
It was burnt with copper oxide in a stream of oxygen , with the following results:\#151 ; I. 0-2980 grm. paraffin gave 0*9293 grm. carbon dioxide and 0*3980 grm. water .

14*84 14*77 14*81 99*89 100*00 99-95 * Considerable discordances exist in the statements by various observers of the specific gravities of the solid paraffins .
These differences are doubtless due more to the difficulty of obtaining the bodies perfectly homogeneous after melting than to any great variations in their true specific gravity .
When a piece of ordinary paraffin is examined , it is seen to be made up of an infinite number of small cavities ; and however carefully it may be cooled after melting , the interstices are invariably present .
From this circumstance it is obvious that any attempt to determine the real specific gravity of this body would give too low a result .
By solidifying the paraffin under pressure , the formation of the cavities may be , to a great extent , obviated .
We have effected the solidification in the apparatus figured in the margin .
Mercury was first poured into the tube up to the level A B , the bottom end of the tube being securely plugged by a cork C. The wider portion D of the tube was then filled with the melted paraffin , and a well-fitting caoutchouc cork fastened down by wire into the opening , care -being taken to exclude all bubbles of air .
Mercury was now quickly poured into the longer limb of the tube until it stood about 0'8 m. above the level of the metal in the wider tube , and under the pressure of this mercury the paraffin was allowed to solidify slowly .
By withdrawing the cork C , the mercury could flow out , and on warming the sides of the tube the plug of paraffin was easily ... , " detached .
Thus solidified , the body was almost entirely free from cavities , andp perfectly homogeneous were easily found ; these had a specific gravity o a of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins .
These numbers agree perfectly with those obtained by Anderson many years ago* from analysis of a paraffin identical in origin and melting-point ( 45'-5 ) with that employed by ns .

One of the bottles was charged with the paraffin , and was heated over an ordinary coal fire , the heat being so regulated that a pressure of 20 to 25 lbs. was maintained in the apparatus throughout the operation .
The volatilized products distilled over into the second bottle , which acted as a condenser .
In about four or five hours the operation was concluded , and the distillate had the appearance of a magma of oil , and of apparently unaltered paraffin .
This mixture melted at a comparatively low temperature , the warmth of the hand being sufficient to render it completely liquid .
Three and a half kilograms of the paraffin yielded about 4 litres of liquid hydrocarbons .
On distillation the mixture commenced to boil at 18 ' , but the quantity coming over below 100 ' was comparatively small ; by far the greater portion boiled between 200 ' and 300 ' .
A preliminary separation showed that the 4 litres were approximately made up of hydrocarbons boiling :\#151 ; 1 i fVAQ I. Below 100 ' ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 03 II .

Fraction boiling below 100'.\#151 ; After repeated distillations over sodium this portion was almost completely resolved into three fractions , boiling constantly at ( 1 ) 32-38 ' , ( 2 ) 65-70 ' , and ( 3 ) 94-97 ' .
The quantity of liquid boiling below 30 ' did not amount to 5 cub. centims. Although the distillation was conducted in winter , and freezing-mixtures of snow and salt were employed for the condensation , the greater portion of the product boiling at 32-38 ' came over at about 35 ' ; this boiling-point would indicate that the liquid is probably either quintane or amy-lene , or a mixture of these hydrocarbons .
In order to decide the point , the distillate was treated with bromine .
The liquid was violently attacked , and each drop of bromine combined with the hydrocarbon with a hissing noise ; so energetic was the reaction , that , in order to moderate it , it was necessary to immerse the hydrocarbon in a freezing-mixture .
When proper care was taken to cool the liquid , scarcely a trace of hydro-bromic acid was evolved .
In order to prevent the possible formation of higher brominated products , the addition of the bromine was from time to time interrupted , and the liquid submitted to distillation ; it invariably commenced to boil at about 32 ' , and the distillation was maintained until the thennometer stood at 50 ' .
The distillate was again treated with bromine in the cold , and again distilled , the process being repeated until it was without visible action upon the hydrocarbon , that is , Until the liquid was permanently reddened .
It was then washed With dilute potash solution , and rectified over sodium ; it boiled constantly at 35-37 ' ; the liquid was evidently , and in all probability normal quintane , the boiling-point of which is given by Schorlemmer at 37-39 ' , and by Warren at 37 ' .
The amount was far too small to attempt the preparation of any derivatives from it .
The brominated portion boiling above 50 ' was then distilled ; the thermometer rose rapidly to 180 ' , and the whole of the liquid came over below 200 ' .
After renewed distillation the liquid was found to boil constantly , but with slight decomposition , at 184-188 ' ; this compound is amylene dibromide , the boiling-point of which , according to Wurtz , is in the neighbourhood of 180 ' .

The fraction boiling between 65 ' and 70 ' , which was at least fifty times greater than that boiling at 32-38 ' , was then treated with bromine , the bromine was absorbed with the same avidity as in the preceding case , and it was equally necessary to cool the hydrocarbon in order to mo era e the reaction .
As soon as the liquid appeared permanently reddene , 1 was distilled .
The portion boiling below 80 ' was no longer attacked by bromine ; it was accordingly free from the accompanying of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins .

The distillate was then treated with aqueous potash to remove the free bromine , and when colourless the hydrocarbon was decanted , dried , and distilled over sodium ; it boiled almost entirely between 65 ' and 70 ' , by far the greater portion coming over at 67-68 ' .

16*28 16*16 100*00 Twro determinations of its specific gravity made by means of different bottles gave:\#151 ; ( 1 ) 0*6620 at 19'*5 , and ( 2 ) 0*6641 at 18 ' .
Compared with water at the same temperature , Pelouze and Cahours found 0*669 at 16 ' for the hexane boiling at 68 ' obtained from American petroleum .
Hexane from suberic acid , boiling at 69'*5 , according to Dale , has a specific gravity of 0*6617 at 17'*5 ; this agrees with that of |3 hexane obtained from mannite , viz. 0*6645 at 16'*5 .
Schorlemmer found 0*678 at 15'*5 for the hydride from cannel coal , which agrees perfectly with that obtained by Williams for the same hydride prepared from boghead coal , viz. 0*6745 at 18 ' .
On the other hand , Schorlemmer has found that the hexane prepared from mannite is probably identical with that obtained for secondary hexyl iodide by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid , and with the dipropyl obtained from primary hexyl iodide , for which he found the specific gravity 0*6630 at 17 ' ; and these are probably identical with the hexane of Pelouze and Cahours obtained from petroleum , and with the hydride found by Schorlemmer in cannel oil , all being normal hydrocarbons with the constitution ch3\#151 ; ch \#151 ; ch2\#151 ; ch \#151 ; ch \#151 ; cii8 .
The brominated hydrocarbon left in the flask after removing the hexane was then distilled : it commenced to boil at about 190 ' ; the thermometer gradually rose to 195 ' , and nearly the whole of the liquid distilled over below 205 ' .
As the compound showed signs of decomposition on boiling , hydrobromic acid being continuously evolved during the distillation , a considerable amount of tarry matter remaining in the flask , it was impossible to fractionate it further .
It was purified , howr-ever , by distillation in a current of steam ; it was nearly colourless , and on analysis yielded numbers agreeing with the formula C0Hla Bra .
0*8950 grm. of the bromide gave 1*3570 grin , silver bromide and 0*0090 grm. reduced silver .

Pelouze and Cahours found the boiling-point of this body to be 192-198 ' , and its specific gravity 1-582 at 19 ' .
These numbers are certainly too low ; the bromide had probably been slightly decomposed by distillation .
We have attempted to determine the relative amounts of hydride and olefine in the fraction boiling at 65-68 ' by means of the reaction with bromine .
The hydrocarbon was weighed out in a small distillation-flask , and Well cooled by a mixture of ice and salt ; bromine was then slowly added , and in minute drops , by means of the little apparatus seen in the figure \#151 ; a small caoutchouc ball about 5 cub. centims. in diameter , which can be compressed by the plate movable along the rods by means of the milled head-screw .
The mode of working the instrument is obvious ; by means of it the bromine can be easily transferred from the bottle in Which it is preserved to the hydrocarbon , and the amount added can be regulated with great nicety .
The bromine was added until the liquid was permanently .reddened , when the flask was again weighed to determine the amount of bromine employed .
13*30 grms. of the mixed hydrocarbons boding at 65-70 ' required 13-16 grmsbromine before the red colour was persistent .
This amount ofliromine is equivalent to 6-9 grms. of hexylene , and 13-3\#151 ; 6-9=6-4 as the amount of hexane present .
The mixture was now distilled , and all passing over below 110 ' ( at which point the liquid in the flask commenced to blacken ) collected in a weighed test-tube .
The weight of the distillate was 6-18 grms. From these numbers it would appear that the product boding at 65-68 ' is a mixture .of hexane and hexylene in about equal proportions .
_ 6 .
The fraction boiling at 94-97 ' was next treated with bromine m .the cold until the liquid was reddened .
The termination of the reaction was not so easily seen in this case ; the mixture blackened slightly , an more hydrobromic acid was evolved , although the hydrocarbon was carefully cooled by ice and salt .
The brominated mixture on dist ation Commenced to bod about 95 ' , and it Was heated to 130 , when t e iT** in the flask cdmmenced to decompose ; at this point , therefore , t e s lation was interrupted .

6*15 " From this experiment it would appear that the amount of olefine is slightly greater than that of the hydride in the fraction boiling at 94\#151 ; 97 ' ; but , from the circumstances of the experiment , we have reason to believe that the amount of heptylene thus indicated is slightly above the truth .
It was difficult to determine the final point of the reaction ; the hydride was not altogether unacted on by the bromine , and small quantities of hydrobromic acid were continuously disengaged during the process ; these circumstances would tend to increase the weight of bromine used , and consequently the apparent weight of the olefine present .
In extending our research to the determination of the constitution of these hydrocarbons , we have had occasion to repeat this experiment on a far larger scale and under more favourable conditions .
900 grms. of the mixed heptane and heptylene required 716 grms. of bromine ; this would be equivalent to 439 grms. of heptylene .
900 grms. of a mixture of heptane and heptylene in equivalent proportions would contain 444 grms. of heptylene .
The heptylene bromide could not be redistilled under the ordinary atmospheric pressure without decomposition ; it commenced to blacken at about 150 ' , and dense fumes of hydrobromic acid were evolved .
When distilled in a current of steam , it was obtained nearly colourless .
It cannot be preserved , however , without slight decomposition ; when exposed to light , it slowly darkens in colour and evolves hydrobromic acid gas .

Careful search was made for the other hydrocarbons , particularly for benzol and for the hexylene of Caventou , boiling about 80 ' , but without success .
The fractions intermediate between 70 ' and 90 ' could be resolved by repeated distillations into products boiling at 65-70 ' and 90-100 ' .
The amount coming over in the neighbourhood of 80 ' was very small ; in fact the entire quantity eventually obtained between 70 ' and 90 ' amounted to only a few grams .
About a gram of the small portion boiling at 80-82 ' was treated with strong nitric acid ; the liquid was very slowly acted upon , and when treated with alcohol , zinc , and hydrochloric acid , after washing and solution in ether , it failed to give the characteristic reaction for aniline ; nor on treating the remainder of the hydrocarbon with excess of bromine , and allowing the mixture to evaporate , could any solid bromide ( C6 H10 Br4 ) be obtained .
Hence we infer the absence of members of the CjiHsn , \#151 ; 2 and Hgn\#151 ; 6 groups in the liquid hydrocarbons obtained by the decomposition of solid paraffins .

Fraction boiling between 100 ' and 200'.\#151 ; As this portion amounted to about a litre , it was thought worth while to attempt a more rigorous separation of the hydrocarbons than is possible by the ordinary method of fractionation ; for this purpose a small condensing arrangement on Warren 's principle was constructed , and by means of it the hydrocarbons were separated at first at intervals of 10 ' , afterwards into portions boiling between 5 ' , and eventually into portions boiling between 2 .
The hydrocarbons were distilled over sodium , and the temperature of the worm was maintained about 20 ' lower than that of the vapour in the flask .
A considerable quantity of liquid was obtained boiling below 100 ; and this could be resolved into hexane and hexylene , heptane and heptylene .
The amount of liquid eventually obtained between 100 ' and 120 was very small .
About 120 grms. of liquid were found to boil constantly between 122 ' and 125 ' .

As it was impossible to distil the mixture under the ordinary atmospheric pressure , the bromide being decomposed by a very slight elevation of temperature , it was treated with alcoholic potash , and distilled per sum for some hours until a few drops thrown into water floated upon its surface .
Water was then added , the lighted portion separated , dried , and fractionated .
The largest amount came over between 120 and 140 , the next fraction from 140\#151 ; 100 ' being much smaller in quantity , wiiilst scarcely any liquid distilled over between 100 ' and 180 ' .
After this point the thermometer became more stationary , and a fraction almost as large as that at 120-140 ' came over between 180 ' and 200 ' .

The fraction boiling between 120 ' and 140 ' on repeated distillation was separated into octane , boiling at 122-125 ' , and a liquid of an alliaceous odour boiling constantly at 130-135 ' , which absorbed bromine with avidity .

It was remarked that as this fraction increased in bulk , and the neighbouring ones became more free from octane and octylene , they gradually acquired a very characteristic and unpleasant smell , quite different from the fraction boiling at 122-125 ' .
A portion of the mixed hydrocarbons was treated with bromine in the cold .
The same darkening was observed as in the case of the 122-125 ' fraction ; but it was by no means so marked as in that instance , and there was no difficulty in perceiving when a decided excess of bromine had been added .

Water was then added , the dark brown oil separated , dried , and distilled ; it commenced to boil at 150 ' , and fractions were collected between every 10 ' .
The largest fractions came over at 160-170 ' and 200-218 ' .
The portion boiling between 200-218 ' on repeated distillation boiled almost entirely between 208 ' and 212 ' , and had approximately the composition Ca II17 Br .

A second portion of the liquid , boiling between 145 ' and 148 ' , was treated with fuming sulphuric acid .
A considerable rise of temperature was observed , so that it was necessary to cool the mixture in order to prevent , as far as possible , the polymerizing action of the strong acid .
The supernatant oil was then decanted , washed with dilute soda solution , dried , and distilled over sodium .
About half the liquid came over below 170 ' , after which the thermometer rose very rapidly to above 340 ' , when the distillation was stopped .
On cooling , the dense oily liquid in the retort solidified .
The fraction boiling below 170 ' was redistilled over sodium ; it boiled almost entirely between 145 ' and 150 ' .
It was then mixed with the hydride obtained after treatment with bromine ( see preceding section ) , and the mixed liquids were again distilled over sodium .
The boiling-point 193 Messrs. Thorpe and Young on Combined Action was unchanged , the greater portion of the liquid distilling at 147 148 .

It should be remarked that no liquid boiling at about 145-148 was discovered by Pelouze and Cahours in American petroleum .
The nonyl hydride isolated by these chemists had the boiling-point 136-138 ' .
We have assured ourselves that there is no liquid boiling at about this temperature in the products obtained from solid paraffin .
The boiling-point of the nonane isolated by us agrees perfectly with that calculated on the assumption that the differences in the boiling-points of the simpler members of the CmH2m+2 become continually less by 4 , until the well-known difference of 19 ' is obtained .

The action appeared to commence immediately , the liquid darkened slightly in colour , and a large quantity of hydrochloric acid was evolved .
The chlorine on passing into the heated liquid appeared to burn , a flash of light appearing at the end of the delivery-tube as each successive bubble of gas passed into the hydrocarbon .
In order to prevent as far as possible the formation of high chlorinated products , the passage of the chlorine was occasionally interrupted and the liquid distilled ; the portion boiling below 200 was set aside , and that which came over below this point was submitted to the of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins .

It is highly probable , however , in spite of the concordance of these results , that the liquid obtained by us wTas a mixture of primary and secondary chlorides ; and the same remark is probably applicable to the product obtained by Pelouze and Cahours .
The fraction boiling at about 245 ' was in all probability C9 H18 Cl2 , produced by the further action of the chlorine upon the hydride ; the quantity , however , was insufficient to purify it for analysis .

This would make the amount of olefine too large .
The quantity of hydrocarbon taken was too small ; the experiment should have been repeated on a larger scale .
Our object , however , was to economize our material , as wre could find no ready method of separating the brominated compound from the unattacked hydride without decomposition .
Boiling with alcoholic potash gave a very indefinite result .
About 37 grms. of the mixed hydrocarbons were cautiously treated with nitric and sulphuric acids , and the mixture cooled to moderate the reaction .
After standing about 17 hours the clear amber-coloured oil wras separated , repeatedly washed , and distilled in a current of steam .
When about ^ of the liquid had passed over , the remainder in the flask suddenly decomposed , becoming almost solid , and fumes of oxides of nitrogen were abundantly disengaged .

Schorlemmer 's amyl ( decatyl hydride ) , obtained by the action of sodium on amyl iodide , boiled at 158-159 ' , and had the specific gravity 0-7275 at 14 ' .
It is very probable that this hydrocarbon is not the normal hydride , but stands to the decatyl hydride boiling at 168 ' in the same relation that the amyl hydride boiling at 30 ' does to the isomer boiling at 39 ' , or as the ethyl amyi boiling at 90 ' ( sp. gr. 0-6819 at 18'*5 ) does to the normal heptane boiling at 99 ' ( sp. gr. 0-6915 at 18 ' ) .
The normal decatyl hydride obtained by Pelouze and Cahours from petroleum had the specific gravity 0-735 at 15 ' ; the hydride found by Greville Williams in the oil from boghead coal had the specific gravity 0-7365 at 18 ' .

It has already been mentioned that , on the first distillation of the oils obtained by splitting up the 3^ kilogs .
of paraffin , a considerable amount of substance ( which could not be distilled within the range of the thermometer ) remained in the retort and solidified on cooling .
This substance in its crude condition melted at 31 ' , but on recrystallization from ether the melting-point became higher .
The whole of the substance was therefore cut up into small fragments , and spread upon filter-paper * These boiling-points are uncorrected , t These points of solidification are only approximative .
200 Messrs. Thorpe and Young on the Combined Action to remove adhering oil as far as possible , and repeatedly recrystallized from ether until the melting-point was unaltered .
It melted invariably at 41'-5 and solidified at 40'-5 ; it could not be distilled within the range of the mercurial thermometer .
It crystallized from ether in beautifully white satiny scales , and gave the following numbers when burnt with oxide of copper in a stream of oxygen:\#151 ; 0-3035 grm. gave 0-9590 grm. carbon dioxide and 0-419 grm. water .

15-34 100-53 Action of bromine upon the solid paraffin melting at 41'-5.\#151 ; A few grams of the substance were dissolved in bisulphide of carbon , and four minute drops of bromine added ; this small quantity of bromine sufficed to colour the liquid strongly .
On standing from 12 to 15 hours , the colour appeared unaltered , and the solution was not decolorized after heating from 60\#151 ; 70 ' for 12 hours .
On heating the liquid to 150 ' , the colour disappeared after a few hours ; and on opening the tube hydro-bromic acid was evolved .
About 10 drops of bromine were again added , and the liquid reheated to 150 ' ; but no diminution in the red colour of the solution was perceptible , although on opening the tube hydro-bromic acid fumes were abundantly disengaged .
This observation would appear to indicate that the hydrocarbon melting at 41'-5 is a member of the C " II2n+2 series .
Action of heat upon 41'-5 paraffin.\#151 ; Repeated crystallization from ether having failed to alter the melting-point of this substance , and the behaviour with bromine evidently indicating that it belonged to the marsh-gas series , we considered that it wrnuld be interesting to study the combined action of heat and pressure upon it .
The details of the experiment have been already given in section 1 .
After six distillations it was rendered completely liquid .
It began to boil at about 40 ' , and about one sixth came over below ' 100 ' , about one third between 100 ' and 200 ' , and the greater portion of the remainder below 300 ' ; the small quantity remaining in the retort solidified on cooling .

" bromine required before the liquid was reddened 30*7 " The action of the bromine was very energetic , and it was necessary to moderate the reaction by cooling the liquid .
It is evident from these experiments that the solid paraffin ( C " H2m+2 ) had been split up by heat and pressure into a mixture of hydrides and olefines .
of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins .

This mode of decomposition would .appear to be general , at least for the higher terms of the series of normal paraffins .
If these bodies be represented constitutionally by linking the carbon atoms together in a single chain , ch3\#151 ; ch \#151 ; ch \#151 ; ch \#151 ; ch2 ... ... ... ... ... ... .ch3 , then the simultaneous formation of hydride and olefine must be assumed to occur from the loosening of the affinities of certain of the groups of CHa .
Under the influence of heat these groups become dissociated ( vibrate without the spheres of their mutual attractions ) , and recombine to form saturated hydrocarbons .
Assuming ( for the sake of simplicity ) that this decomposition can occur so low down in the series as in the case of butane , it might be thus represented :\#151 ; H H H H H II H H H\#151 ; C\#151 ; C\#151 ; C\#151 ; C\#151 ; H=II\#151 ; 'C\#151 ; C\#151 ; H+C=(J illl II II H H H H H II H II We can offer but little direct evidence as to the exact manner of this decomposition\#151 ; whether it is attended by the gradual elimination of ethylene , a hydride containing a greater number of carbon atoms being left behind , or whether the paraffin is at once split up into the hydride and an olefine containing an equal number of carbon atoms as in the above equation .
Neither supposition is exactly substantiated by experiment .
If the action of heat gave rise to the former mode of decomposition , we ought to obtain a large quantity of ethylene after prolonged heating , especially when the liquid portion is rich in hydrocarbons of low molecular weight ; but , as we have already pointed out , the process of liquefaction is accompanied with the production of comparatively little gas .
On the other hand , an examination of the amounts of bromine required to render the hydrocarbons boiling below 200 ' permanently red , shows that the proportion of hydride to olefine in the several mixtures becomes gradually larger as the molecular weight increases .
It would appear , therefore , that the liquids boiling between 200 ' and 300 ' are not mixtures of hydrides and olefines in equal proportions , as are the fractions boiling at 65-70 ' and 94-97 ' \amp ; c. It would have been doubtless interesting to have determined the relative amounts of the 12 fractions isolated from the decomposed paraffin ; but when it is considered that their separation was only effected after several thousand distillations , it will be evident that the quantities obtained after such tedious treatment can afford no real indication of the amount present in the original liquid .
We have , however , a distinct impression that the amounts of liquid boiling at 94-97 ' and 122-125 ' were but slightly ( if at all ) less than the quantities boiling at 252-255 ' and 273-276 ' .
