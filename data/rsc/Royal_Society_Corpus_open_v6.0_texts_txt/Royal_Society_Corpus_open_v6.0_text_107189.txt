The Application of a Method of Differences to the Species of Series whose Sums are obtained by Mr. Landen , by the Help of impossible Quantities .
By Mr. , Benjamin Gompertz .
Communicated by the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne , D. D. Astronomer-Royal , F. R. S. Read February 13 , 18o6 .
HAVING some years back , when reading the learned Mr. LANDEN'S fifth Memoir , discovered the manner of applying a method of differences , to the species of series , whose sums are there obtained by the help of impossible quantities , and having since extended that application , I now venture to offer it to the consideration of others .
The practice of this method , in most cases , appears to me extremely simple ; and on that account , I am almost induced to imagine , that they have already been considered by mathematicians ; indeed since the greatest part of this Paper was written , I met with EULER'S Institutiones Calculi integralis ; two simple series are in that work summed by multiplications similar to those employed in the investigation of the principal theorems contained in this Paper ; but whether that learned mathematician has farther pursued the method , in that or in any other work , I have not as yet been able to ascertain .
I have purposely considered some of the series summed by Mr. LANDEN , to afford an opportunity of comparing both theresults and methods ; and because the series may have partiU2 cular cases in which both Mr. LANDEN'S means and my own fail : I have added towards the end a general scholium concerning the cause , circumstances , and consequences of such failure in my method .
The foundation of the theorems depends on the following well known lemmas .
No. I. 2 sine of vz .
sine of tz , is equal to cos. of t v. z cos. of t+ v. z. No. II .
e sine of vz .
cos. of tz , is equal to sine of t+ v. z sine of tv .

and if .
TIteoremn I. that if the coefficients of the sines ( a , b , c , &amp;c. ) or of the cosines ( a , a ' , b ' , c ' , &amp;c. ) be such that any order of differences taken according to the common method becomes = o , we shall then have the corresponding value , of the successive values of s , s ' , s , &amp;c. expressed in finite terms , and we shall consequently get the value of the series sought expressed in finite terms , and likewise all the intermediate values of s ' , s " , s , &amp;c. contained between s and the said corresponding suecessive value of s , expressed in finite terms ; hence if the values of a , b , c , &amp;c. or of a , a ' , b ' , c ' , &amp;c. be respectively equal to g ' r tbg r. r+ &amp;c. r , h , t , being all affirmative t t.tb ' t.t+b.t+zb2 values , and r-t a multiple of h , we may obtain the sum of the series .
In order to prove this , I shall put r , r , r , &amp;c. to represent r+h , r+2h , r+ 3h , &amp;c. t , t , t , &amp;c. for t+h , t+2h , t+3h , &amp;c. rrr r r ... ... ... r I ... ..2 ... .

Hitherto we have been considering , a series of sines and cosines , whose terms have all the same signs ; but if the terms of a series proposed were alternately positive and negative , it would be necessary to divide them into two series , the one of the positive term and the other of the negative ; in order to get the sum by Theorem I. But the sum of a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative , may be obtained from the sum of a similar series , whose terms are all positive by a mere substitution ; thus if the sum of the series , a sine of rz.b sine of r+ s. z+c sine of r+2s .
z- &amp;c. were required , put rz-=i8o ?

* &amp;c. ; and by the like substitution may the sum of a series of cosines , whose terms are alternately positive and negative , be deduced from the sum of a series of cosines , whose terms are all positive : all this requires the functional values of p and q to be distinct , otherwise the substitution cannot be effected ; but the said sum may be deduced at once by the following Theorem II. .

Though we have given two theorems , the one for a series whose terms are all positive , and the other for a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative ; they are both true whatever the signs of the terms be , provided that proper signs be used in the operation ; that is , if any term should have a contrary sign , to the sign of that term contained in the enunciation of the theorem used , then a contrary sign must likewise be prefixed to it in the operation ; thus , for instance , if for a series whose terms are all positive we should use Theorem II .
or for a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative we should use Theorem I. , for a , b , c , d , &amp;c. we must write a , -b , c , -d , &amp;c. and therefore a , a ' , Vb , &amp;c. =a , -a+b , c+b , --dc , &amp;c. =(suppose ) a , -a , b , , -c , &amp;c. a , a# , bf , &amp;c. _=a , -a , +ab , +ac , +b , .

And if we alternately use these theorems the operation will be performed by alternately taking sums and differences ; and this will amount to the same as taking the differences of the alternate terms , beginning always with two noughts : but , for the more readily comprehending this , we shall offer a theorem which moreover is the first of these theorems I discovered , but previously thereto shall propose Example 2 .

Now if we can prove that the same expressions , derived from the comparison of the coefficieints of the homologous powers of z , give the sum of the series p ' -r.pq +r .
-.p -* q &amp;c. whether r be a whole positive number Ye 3 63 or not , it will follow that the series , sine of pz-r sine of ... ..r +Il " sine of pqr.z p-.q.z+r .

And in order to prove this requisite , we shall first premise that if we have the sum of the series p ' -r.1 -+gr .
r+ , r+i r+ sequently will the sum of the series pm--r p+ql.n+a +r .
r p+.p+fqm+l &amp;c. be the expression xpA+pBr+pCr ' &amp;c. .qAr--qrr " &amp;c. of finite terms .
This being proved , it r+I follows , because the sum of the seriespm-r.p+ ?
W+rqm r , s p-f2qlf ' &amp;c. when m is equal to o , is equal to i-r+ r. &amp;c. = , by the binomial theorem , ' whatever r may be , that the sum of the series p--r.p +r- .
r ^ ?
&amp;c. namely , the said series when m is equal to i , may be expressed by - ' xa series of pure powers of r of a finite number of terms whatever r may be , and comes out by the bye x pqr , the same as above , and consequently by writing 1,2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , &amp;c. one after the other for , n. , we shall find that the sum of the series n-r.p +r .
--p+q , m &amp;c. may always be expressed by ~multiplied by a series of finite terms in the form A+--Br+Cr &amp;c. A , B , C , &amp;c. p , q , m , &amp;c. being independent of r ; and ma whole positive number .
And these will , we shall prove without running through all the infinite cases , be the very same expressions as those given above , by comparing the coefficients of the homologous powers of z. In order to this we observe , since we have just proved that the sum of the said series , whatever r may be , may be expressed by 9 ' x series A+Br+Cr2 &amp;c. of a finite inumber of terms , and from the comparison of the homologous powers , that when r is a whole number it may be expressed by 'x value a+{br+ cr2 &amp;c. of a finite number of terms , it follows that when r is any l65 , a whole number , that these two values must then be equal to each other , and. .
that A+Br2+Cr " &amp;c. containing a finite number of terms must be then equal to a+br+cr " &amp;c. containing a finite number of terms , and consequently the highest power of r and its coefficient must be the same in both series , otherwise by increasing r by the same in both , one side of the equation would become greater than the other , which is absurd ; consequently the highest power of r and its coefficient is the same in both , and will destroy each other , and conseluently the next highest powers of r and likewise their coefficients must be the same with each other , and will therefore be destroyed , &amp;c. Hence the powers of r and their respective coefficients being the same in both , the expressions themselves must be the same in every respect , whether r be a whole number or not .
Hence we have not only given two different means of summning the series pm-r.pqjn &amp;c. ( m being a whole positive number ) whatever r may be , which indeed was not our chief object , but we have likewise proved that the series sine of pr-r sine of p+q.z sine of p- .

of ' Scholium i. As the two first theorems depend on the differences of the coefficients of the imminediate terms or omitting none , the two last on the differences of the coefficients of the alternate terms or omitting one term ; so we may give theorems for the differences of the coefficients of Z2 17x the terms , omitting 2 , g , &amp;c. terms ; in fact , if r be a whole number , and the terms of the series be all positive , or any how positive and negative by sets , provided the same signs return in the same order after every set , consisting of r number of terms ; by continually multiplying by 2 sine of -^qz , we shall get new series by taking the differences of the coefficients of every term and the rth succeeding term beginning with r number of noughts ; except indeed that the coefficients of the terms will sometimes have the order of signs interrupted , namely , when a greater value is to be subtracted from a less .
But if every set should have the same order to signs contrary to those in the set immediately preceding , and consequently every set omitting one set continually , have the same order of signs , then by continually multiplying by 2 cos. of j-qz , we shall get new series by taking the differences of the coefficients of any term and the rth term from it .

And thus we might proceed to the discovery 2 of an infinite variety of theorems relative to the sines and cosines contained between any two limits in a circle , and the consequent inferences , the method being capable of a very extensive application ; but rather than tire the reader 's patience with what he may effect himself from what has been already said , if there should otherwise have been any difficulty , I shall propose Theorem V.

cos. of p 2-2q.z &amp; co , which is the first part of the theorem ; and by following the 175 steps backwards , and substituting pz-g 90 for pz throughout we get the second part Q. E. D. This theorem evidently supposes that the functional values of pz are distinct in the general expression for the sum of the series , before the substitution takes place , which may not be the case if p has any particular value , or even if p , q , and z have any relation to each other .
Theorem VI .
Given the sum of the series , a sine of 7rz+.b sine of , '-{+"-.z +c sine of 7r+ 2e.Z+d sine of w-+3-g .
z+ &amp;c. and likewise of a cos. of 7r-+b cos. of 7r+4.z^+c cos. of qr+2.z+ &amp;c. expressed generally and distinctly in terms of z for any particular values of x and z , except z--o , v and z having the same value in both series ; there will likewise be given the sum of the series , a sine of pz+b sine of p+q .
z+c sine of p+2q .
z &amp;c. and likewise of , a cos. of pz+b cos. of p+q.z+c cos. of p+q.^z &amp;c. generally and distinctly in terms of p , q , and z. For , calling the first series A and the second B , and putting z= q , we have by substitution , a sine of qx-+b.sine of +q.x-+c.sine ofq-+2q.x+d .
sine of { +3q .

x+d .
cos. of+q .
x+ &amp;c. =B .
A and B being now expressed in general terms of q and x , and particular values ; multiply the first by , 2 cos. of p. x and the second by e sine of p. x by means of lemma No. II .
and we get , a sine of px-a sine of p2-j--.x+b sine ofp-+-q.x- .

x+b sine ofp +q.x+b sine ofp-q x +c sine ofp2q sine of --2q.x &amp;c. 2B sine of P-.-x ; consequently , adding these two together , we have by dividing by 2 , a sine of px+b sine of pfq.x+c sine of p+2q x &amp; c , -A cos. of p. x+B sine of p- .
x , expressed generally and distinctly in terms of p , q , and x , the equation will therefore remain if we put z in the place of x throughout , and therefore the sum of the series , a sine of pz+b sine of pq.z &amp;c. is given expressed generally in terms p , q , and of z , which is the first part of the theorem .
Again , by multiplying the series , a sine of qx+b sine of 2 +q .
x &amp;c. =A , by o sine of pq x , by means of lemma No , I and the series , a cos. of q x-cos .
of q +q.x &amp;c. =B , qx by 2 cos. ofp~-x by means of lemma No. II .
we shall have a cos. of p. -a+b cos. of p2q.x-b cos. of p+q.x+ cos. of p_-q.x-c cos. of p-2q.x + &amp;c. = 2A cos. of -p x , and a cos. ofp-q .
x+a cos. of pb cos. of qq.x+b cos. ofp+q.x+c cos. of q---q .+c cos. ofp+gq.xq+ &amp;c. =2B cos. of p-x ; half the difference of these two series gives , a cos. ofpx+b cos. of p+q.x+c cos. of p+2q.x+ &amp;c. -=B cos. of p--q xA sine of p-- .
x expressed generally and distinctly in terms ofp , q , and x ; and consequently by writing z for x throughout , we have the sum of the series , a cos. of pz +b cos. of p+q.Z+ cos. of p+2q.z+ &amp;c. expressed generally and distinctly in terms z , p , and q. Q. E. D. Cor. i. It is evident that p and q may be taken any numbers either positive or negative , but X ought not to be equal to o , for we could not then effect the substitution z= - .
Cor. ii .
Putting , a cos. of pz+b cos. of p+q.z &amp;c. =-P , and a sine of pz+bineine ofp+q.z &amp;c. =Q , and also B ' and A ' for the values that B and A become , by writing z for x in those values , that is , z for z in the given expressions B and A we shall have P=B ' cos. of pZ z-A ' sine of p- .
, and Q =B ' sine of p-2 .
z+A ' cos. ofp. .
Cor. iit .
Hence we may again prove , that if we have the sum of the series , a sine of pz+b sine of p+q.z+ &amp;c. expressed generally in terms of p , q , and z , we may find the series , a cos. of pz+b .
cos. ofp+q.z+ &amp;c. expressed generally in terms of p , q , and z , and the contrary .
For having the sum of the first by writing r for p , X for q , we shall have the sum of the series , a sine of 4rz ?
b sine of 7r+-X.Z+ &amp; C. =A , expressed by z , and particular values ; in which writing for z , we get A ' , therefore having A ' and Q , we may , by help of Cor. ii .
find P in terms of p , q , and z , and particular values , namely , the sum of the series a cos. of pz+-b cos. of p-q.z &amp;c. and in a similar manner the contrary is proved .

Theorem II .
for the simple sines and cosines .
General Scholium .
It is necessary to obeserve , that there may be particular cases , in the summation of which these methods fail , and which , if not properly considered , may lead to great error , especially when new series are derived from those containing failing cases , by multiplying by fluxions , and finding the fluents of the expressions thence arising .
For if the correction should happen to be sought from any of the failing cases , the summation of the new series might not only fail in the failing case of the primary expression , but in every other .
From Example i. Theorem I. we have sine of pfz + sine of p+ q. z+ sine ofp + 2q .
z &amp;c. =cof - ; this when z= o , will be sine of o+ sine of o+sine of o &amp;c. or oo cos. of o __ +0 &amp; .
-2sine of o ; that is the sum of a series of noughts infinite , which is absurd .
Again , in Example .
Theorem I. Cor. i. cos. of nz + cos. of $nz + cos. of $nz &amp;c. = o , therefore if z be taken =o it will be i41+i &amp;c. --o which ought to be infinite , and in Cor. II .
z being =o we have i +X 1+1 &amp;c. - .
In order to explain the reason of these absurdities , and to prevent the errors they may produce , it is necessary to consider the subject more minutely , to which purpose Scholium If .
at the end of Theorem IV .
will afford great assistance : from that it appears , that the sum of the r first terms of the series cos. of nz + cos. of n+ q. z+ cos. of n +2 .
z &amp;c. = sine of n+r -q.z .
sine of n-_.z *a -z .
sin-l .
of qz ; ^ and by similar means that the z sine of -q%2 qz sum of the r first terms of the series sine of nz-+ sine of -os .
-fn+-r -. .
qz +cos .
of n- , q z n+q.z+ sine of n+2q+ c_ &amp;c. = o2 sine ot -qL now it is plain that if qz were either equal to o or a multiple of 36o0 , sine of -qz would be equal to o , and because r is a whole number , rqz would either be equal to o or a multiple of 360 ?
, and consequently the sine of n q-r-- .
q. z= sine of n--q.z and the cosine of n+r--.q.z= cos. of n-j.q.z , and therefore the sum of the series , cos. of nzcos .
of n+q.z &amp;c. -=(when qz=o or some multiple of 360 ?
) sine of n--'-'q-z---sine of n_ .
oz z sine'of.qz .
in every case , ( the same as in Example to Theorem I. ) except when qz=o or some multiple of 36o ?
; on account of there being something else to be taken into consideration , in that case .
Again , it appears by Example , of the said scholium , that the sum of the r first terms of the series , cos. of nzcos .
of n+q .
z+ cos. of n+2q.z &amp;c. cos. of n_q.zA cos. of n+r r-I. .
---cos .
o fn zI Cs .
ofn+r -q the upper or under sine to be cos. of iqz taken according as r is odd or even .
And by similar means the sum of the r first terms of the series , sine of nzsine of n+q .
z-+ sine of n+7q .
zsine of n+3q .
z &amp;c. is found = sine of n--Iq.z+ sine of n+ r-2.q.z s- ... .2z cos f ofnq-z the upper sign to be taken if r is odd but the under if even .
Here if qz=i8o ?
, or any odd multiple thereof , the cosine of jqz will be = o ; and if r be even at the same time the cos. of n+r---.q.z will be equal to the cosine of n-j.q.x and the sine of n-+r.q.z= sine of n2-qz ; but if r be odd we shall have the cos. of n+r--.q.z = cos. of n-jq.z and sine of n+r--q.= the sine of r.q.z ; consequently by substituting these values in the above expressions for the sum , due regard being had to the signs , we shall find that , whatever r be , the sum of either series will be expressed by 0 : but if z be any other value it appears that + the sine or cosine of n+r--.q.z depends on the value of r , and may be either positive or negative , by varying r ; and consequently should as above when r is infinite be considered o. And the sum of the series , sine of 185 Bb MDOCCCVI sine of n-q.z .
nzsine of n+q.z+ &amp;c. will be - .
of , and of cos. of cos. of n--1 q. nzcos .
of n +q.z+ &amp;c. = ^.1l .
ofs as in Example l Theorem II .
except when qz=some odd multiple of 18o , something else being in that case to be taken into consideration ; and thus are we to reason , in the failing cases of other expressions : but by the common rules for finding the value of an expression when the denominator and numerator vanish , we may find the value even in the failing cases ; thus by dividing the fluxion of the numerator by the fluxion of the *.* ~.~ .
-cos .
of n+ r.q.z+ cos. of n-q.z denominator in the expressions..z .
2..sine of lqz and d then makin'g qz=o , or [ z sine of qz some multiple of 36o ?
, we shall get simply , o for the sum of the r first terms of the series sine of nz+ sine of n+q.z+ &amp;c. , and r for the sum of the r first terms of the series cos. of nz+ cos. of n-q.z+ &amp;c. when z=o or some multiple of 360o , that is , o for the sum of the r first terms of the series , o+o+o &amp;c. and r for the sum of the r first terms of the series , -1 + 1+1 &amp;c. which is self-evident .
And thus may we proceed in other expressions when the sum of r terms can be obtained by a general value .
That these things should happen as above described , is likewise evident , from the investigations of the theorems ; for in Theorem I. for instance , we have s _= +2 sine of a qz-or + s. 2 sine of rqzl , r being a positive whole number ; therefore if the sine of jqz be =o , which will happen when q=o or some multiple of 360 ?
, it is plain that we should have s-= -+ s'xo , or + sxo , and consequently sz ought likewise to come out equal to o , and therefore s , would be == ; and consequently when sx in that case does not come out = o , it is certain that there must have been something neglected : and to show how this may happen , we observe that since Theorem I. and II .
require the differences of the coefficients of every term and the next succeeding term to be taken , it is evident that the last term will have nothing to be taken from , and will consequently remain through every new series ; in consequence of which there will be terms of the form A. sine or cosine of Trzqr .
, ( in which r is a whole number and infinite , the number of terms of the series being infinite , ) whose coefficient A will never be =o unless the series a , b , c , &amp;c. be converging : these terms are unavoidably omitted , by reason of their place being at an infinite distance , and can consequently never be arrived at ; but still unless it be equal to o , it should not be omitted ; which it cannot be unless , either in the above mentioned circumstance of the series a , b , c , &amp;c. being converging , or when the terms of the series of sines or cosines , are continually changing their signs , for different values of r ; which it will always do when qz is not equal to o or some multiple of 3o0 ?
; provided the coefficients a , b , c , &amp;c. are all affirmative : and consequently the said terms may be omitted in every such case , there being no reason for taking one sign rather than the other : but if qz were equal to o or some multiple of 360 ?
, since A. sine or cosine of w+--qr.z will then be simply AX sine or cos. of pz , and therefore if the same sign whatever r may be , when a , b , c , d , &amp; co ... ..^ to A , have all the same signs ; and consequently cannot Bb be then neglected unless in the case above mentioned of a , b , c , &amp;c. being converging , in which circumstance it will have no failing case : but had the coefficients a , b , c , d , &amp;c. been alternately + and - , the failing case would not happen when qz=o or a multiple of 36o0 , for then there being no reason for taking A of one sign rather than the other , it should therefore be taking equal to o ; but it will happen when sine or cos. of v+qr.z is alternately positive and negative , by continually increasing r by i : for then the coefficients of the terms of the form , sine or cos. of 'w-+qr.z being alternately positive and negative ; and likewise the terms themselves alternately positive and negative , the whole values resulting from them will have the same determinate sign , and this will be when qz=180 ?
or some multiple thereof .
And if a , b , c , d , &amp;c. be positive and negative according to some other Iaw , the failing cases may be found by the like reasoning ; which is likewise applicable to the other theorems .
These remarks pave the way to the correction of fluents necessary in the application of the doctrine of fluxions to these series .

In Example 2 , Theorem I. if for nz we write k+z , and for , q we write 1 , we shall have cos. of k+z+ cos. of k+f z sine of k"t .

; for though our primary equation fails only when z is o or some multiple of 360 ?
, and is true in every other case , whatever z may be , whether more or less than 360 ?
; still it cannot be so in this derivative equation : for suppose K to be the said supplemental value , which is equal to o in every other case but that mentioned above , the derivative expression , will in that case contain the supplement , the fluent of K. -z producing a correction which will remain when it is once introduced , though K may afterwards vanish , namely , when z becomes neither o , nor any multiple of 360c l89 and therefore every time z becomes , by flowing , any multiple of 360 ?

If the correction had been sought when z=i 80 ?
we should have it = -1+ &amp;c. _ Q , answering whilst z is from 90go to 270 ? .

Again , from Cor. i. Example 2 .
Theorem I. cos. of z+ cos. of Sz+ cos. of 5z+ &amp;c. is equal to o , failing ( from above ) when qz =o or a multiple of 360 ?
, and therefore when z=o or a multiple of 180 ?
: if we multiply by the z and take the sine of 3z slne of cz &amp; fluent we have sine of z+ -f 3Z s of S &amp; .

In Cor.n .
Example i. Theorem I. p being we have sine of z+ sine of $z + sine of 5z &amp;c. =s ineoffailing ( from above ) when qz or 2Z = o , or a multiple of 360 ?
, and therefore when z --= o , or a multiple of 180o ?
; if we multiply this by % and find the fluent we have , because z ( by -.__ y-1 .

and consequentlyy=i and the cosines of z , of 3z , of 5z , &amp;c. = o , we have it equal to o ; and this has no failing case since it will not fail when z= -o or any multiple of 180o in which primitive equation does .
If z be = 45 ?

provided g be affirmative ; but if g be negative , it will be when qz is some odd multiple of 180 ?
; a similar expression to this is given by Mr. LANDEN by his method .

We may farther add , that when series are obtained from others having failing cases by substitution , as in Scholium hiI .
to Theorem I. or as in Theorem V. and VI .
regard should be had to those failing cases , according to the manner of substitution , in order to find the , failing cases in the new series .
We might proceed to many more examples , in finding the sums of new series from others multiplied by fluxions , or we might give examples of finding the sums of new series by throwing others into fluxions : but my chief object in these latter examples was to obviate any difficulty that might appear in choosing the cases for the correction of the fluents .
There are other inferences to be drawn ) which I may perhaps consider at some future period .
