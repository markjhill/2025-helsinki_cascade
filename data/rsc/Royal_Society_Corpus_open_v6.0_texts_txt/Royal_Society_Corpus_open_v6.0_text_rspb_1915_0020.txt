) The following investigations were carried out with the object of determining whether the action of a ferment on a substrate is affected by surface tension .
Since in the living organism the action of ferments proceeds in a system in which surface development has reached a maximum , the problem is one of considerable theoretical importance .
So far as we are aware , it has not been studied .
The experimental difficulty is , of course , to allow the factor of surface tension to operate on the action of ferments in such a way that a sufficient amount of the digest can be obtained at the end of the experiment in which the progress of the ferment action could be determined .
Various devices were used to attain this object .
In some preliminary experiments the reaction was allowed to proceed in a capillary tube , in others in test-tubes filled with glass wool , with thin short capillary glass tubes or with glass beads .
The reaction as it proceeded in these tubes was then compared with that of a control in an ordinary test-tube .
A distinct effect was observed in these preliminary experiments with lipase , diastase , and yeast invertase , all of which showed a retardation .
The effect was then studied in some detail in the case of invertase .
The experiments with invertase were carried out as follows :\#151 ; Solutions of sucrose and invertase were mixed in definite proportions .
Part of the mixture was placed in a test-tube and served as a control .
The rest was put into test-tubes filled with glass beads , 3 to 4 mm. in diameter .
Care was taken that the level of the fluid was always well below the top level of the glass beads .
The tubes were then closed with a rubber stopper and incubated at a given temperature .
After a given number of hours , readings were taken with a polarimeter .
In every series of experiments the control tubes were read first , so that the slightly prolonged period of incubation in the tubes filled with beads would tend to diminish any retardation that might occur .
Special control experiments showed that the presence of glass beads did not affect the readings obtained with pure sucrose solutions .
Similarly the readings obtained with solution of invertase alone remained constant .
That the effect of the mutarotation of the glucose formed by the action of invertase could be neglected will be pointed out below .
The beads were washed after each experiment for several hours , first in hot running tap water , then with distilled water , and dried in an oven at about 180 ' C. Messrs. E. Beard and W. Cramer .
The invertase was prepared from yeast obtained from Distillers Co. , Ltd. , Edinburgh , by two different methods:\#151 ; ( 1 ) Preparation of Invertase from Fresh Yeast ( called " Invertase F " in the following Tables).\#151 ; A weighed quantity of yeast was added to a measured volume of chloroform water .
The mixture was kept at a temperature of 38 ' for 27 hours or longer .
It was then filtered .
The proteins were removed from the filtrate with kaolin .
The second filtrate was a clear yellow liquid , which was used as the solution of the ferment .
( 2 ) Preparation of Invertase from Dried Yeast ( " Invertase D " in the following Tables).\#151 ; Fresh yeast was pounded with distilled water and washed three times by decantation .
It was then collected in a Buchner funnel , washed with alcohol and ether and spread in a thin layer on a glass plate .
It was completely dried in a vacuum desiccator .
When dried the material was ground in a mortar , placed in an oven at 40 ' and gradually warmed during half an hour up to 100 ' .
The brown powder then obtained was kept in a stoppered bottle .
When a solution of invertase was required , weighed amounts of the brown powder were added to chloroform water and kept for about 24 hours at a temperature of 38 ' .
After filtration a clear yellow liquid was obtained , which represented a solution of invertase .
Eight different invertase preparations , all of which were strongly active , were used in these experiments .
In the Tables the various ferment preparations are designated ( 1 ) by the letter D or E , indicating whether they have been prepared from dried or fresh yeast respectively , ( 2 ) by the date of their preparation , and ( 3 ) by the percentage of yeast ( fresh or dried ) used with reference to chloroform water .
It was found that increasing the surface led to a distinct retardation in the inversion of cane sugar by invertase if the concentration of the substrate was relatively high , and that of the ferment relatively low .
With a high ferment concentration the retarding effect was not noticeable .
The following experiments are given as examples :\#151 ; Experiment A. 23.7.14 .

Since in all the following experiments relatively small concentrations of invertase were used , so that the process of inversion was slow , the effect of the mutarotation of glucose did not affect the readings .
This was verified by special control experiments in which dilute sodium carbonate was added to the solution before the readings were taken .
The retarding effect of surface tension was confirmed in a number of other experiments .
It is not necessary to quote these experiments in detail , as the effect is evident in the experiments given below which deal with the further analysis of the phenomenon .
In the action of an enzyme on a substrate one may distinguish two separate phases : firstly , the combination of the enzyme and the substrate , and , secondly , the chemical change which proceeds in this compound of enzyme and substrate .
A 'priori surface tension may have an effect either on the first phase or on the second phase or on both .
We will consider first the possibility of surface tension action on the second phase of enzyme action .
Just as the catalytic action of an enzyme has been likened to a lubricant producing its action by diminishing friction , so the effect of surface tension might be like that of a brake , retarding the process by increasing the friction .
If that were so , one would expect to find that retardation disappears when the brake is removed , i.e. when surface energy is reduced to the dimensions which obtain in the control .
To test this point a number of test-tubes filled with beads were charged with the mixture of substrate and ferment .
After a given number of hours , when a distinct inhibition had become noticeable , the fluid ( or part of it ) was removed from one of the test-tubes filled with beads , and inversion allowed to proceed as usual in a test-tube without beads .
An example will make the arrangement clear .

It is still evident after the removal of beads , Messrs. E. Beard and W. Cramer .
but not so marked as in the test-tubes in which the surface remained extended .
Similar results were obtained in a number of other experiments , with other preparations of invertase .
A very different result was obtained , however , in the following experiment carried out with the same preparation of invertase but at a higher temperature and with a slightly lower ferment concentration .

The conclusion to be drawn from these experiments is that the retarding action of surface tension on the inversion of cane sugar by invertase is made up of two components .
One component leaves the system cane sugar-invertase Surface Tension and Ferment Action .
unchanged when surface tension ceases to operate .
The action of this component would be in accordance with the first alternative suggested above , namely , that surface tension acts as a brake on the chemical process which proceeds in the substrate under the influence of the ferment .
The action of the second component involves a permanent alteration in the system cane sugar-invertase .
How is the action of this component to be interpreted ?
We have considered hitherto only the possibility that surface tension inhibits the second phase of an enzyme action , namely , the chemical change which proceeds in the substrate after it has become combined with the enzyme .
We may now examine what effect surface tension could have on the first phase of an enzyme action\#151 ; the combination of enzyme and substrate .
The question is then : Is it a priori possible that surface tension could inhibit the combination of enzyme and substrate , and if so , how can this possibly be tested experimentally ?
It is a well known fact that ferments tend to go into the surface layer , so that the concentration of the ferments is higher on the surface layer than in the remainder of the solution .
This property of ferments is expressed by the statement that ferments are " surface active .
" By increasing the surface , therefore , more ferment will be driven into the surface layer .
Cane sugar , on the other hand , is practically not surface active , and its distribution in the solution will , therefore , remain unaltered when the surface is increased .
Theoretically , therefore , it would seem possible that by extending the surface a certain amount of invertase is driven into the surface and thus prevented from combining with the cane sugar .
The point is capable of being tested experimentally .
If new surfaces are created the ferment is , as just stated , driven into the surface layer .
If , for instance , a ferment solution is shaken so that foam is formed , the concentration of the ferment in the foam is greater than that in the rest of the solution .
If now the foam is allowed to subside , the concentration of the ferment in the solution rises again , although the original value may not be reached .
But if new surfaces are created by the introduction of solid substances , a second phenomenon may come into appearance .
The ferment not only goes into the surface layer bounding the solid , but may become adherent to the solid , so that when the new surfaces are destroyed by withdrawing the solid , the ferment remains adherent to the solid and is withdrawn with it .
This is the phenomenon of adsorption , which is exhibited in a marked degree by a number of ferments brought into contact with solids such as charcoal , collodion membranes , suspensions of mastix .
It is not necessary to VOL. LXXXVIII.\#151 ; B. 2 Y Messrs. E. Beard and W. Cramer .
discuss here the conditions on which adsorption depends .
In connection with the present problem the phenomenon of adsorption is of interest only in so far as it presupposes as a preliminary condition a concentration of the adsorbed material at the surface of the adsorbing material .
It must also be borne in mind that such a surface concentration may occur without adsorption taking place , as in the case of foam , for instance , where the surface separates a gas and not a solid from the liquid .
We shall , therefore , use the general term of " surface concentration " to describe the alteration of concentration produced in a system by altering the surface energy , and the term " adsorption " in order to designate the special result which is caused under certain conditions by surface concentration .
If it can be shown then that under the conditions of our experiments invertase is adsorbed by glass beads , we would have evidence that the factor of surface concentration accounts , at any rate partially , for the retardation of the ferment action observed in our experiments .
If , on the other hand , no adsorption is observed , no conclusions can be drawn either for or against this possibility , as one may conceive of surface concentration occurring without adsorption .
To test this point , experiments were carried out , in which invertase was kept in contact with glass beads .
Another portion of the same ferment preparation was allowed to stand in a test-tube by itself at the same temperature as a control .
After a definite number of hours the ferment solution was removed from the glass beads and its activity compared with that of the control .
The former preparation will be described in the Tables as " contact invertase , " the latter preparation as " control invertase .
" The following experiments may be given as examples of the results obtained:\#151 ; Experiment E. 14.5.14 .

This experiment is of interest because it shows , in addition to the disappearance of invertase owing to adsorption , a destruction of the ferment even in the control at higher temperatures ( 40 ' ) .
This destructive effect is apparently enhanced by increasing the surface .
This effect would explain the results obtained in Experiment C ( 15.6.14 ) , where there was not only an almost complete inhibition of the action of the ferment , but where this inhibition persisted even after the factor of surface energy was again removed .
The experiments just quoted , which were carried out with two different preparations of invertase , gave a distinctly positive result with reference to Messrs. E. Beard and W. Cramer .
adsorption .
With two other preparations no evidence of adsorption was obtained .
The following experiment is given as an example:\#151 ; Experiment H. 20.5.14 .

In this experiment the inhibition produced by increasing the surface disappeared again when the surface was reduced to the dimensions of the control .
The same absence of adsorption was observed with a second preparation of invertase .
This preparation showed the usual inhibition of its action by surface tension , and as in the previous case this inhibition disappeared in two experiments when the factor of surface tension was removed .
In a third such experiment in which less invertase was used the inhibition persisted partially .
General Remarks .
The observations demonstrate that the action of invertase on cane sugar is retarded by increasing the surface of the system .
They show further that this retardation is due partly to a surface concentration effect : the surface-active ferment is driven into the surface and thus prevented from combining with the surface-inactive cane sugar .
If one looks upon the combination of substrate and enzyme as a surface concentration effect , as Bayliss does , one can readily understand that this combination can be inhibited by the same force acting in the opposite direction , so that these observations form incidentally a confirmation of the conception formulated by Bayliss .
A question which cannot yet be answered with certainty is whether the retardation observed in these experiments can be explained entirely as a surface concentration effect , or whether surface tension acts also by retarding the chemical process taking place in the substrate , that is , the second phase of ferment action .
That surface tension retards certain chemical processes , for Surface Tension and Ferment Action .
instance , the formation of chloroform from chloral by alkali , is a well known fact .
In the present case it has been found that the action of invertase on cane sugar may be retarded even although the effect of adsorption is not noticeable under the conditions of the experiment .
It has also been found that in some cases the retardation disappears almost completely when the influence of surface tension is removed after it has been operative .
Observations such as these would be most readily explained by assuming that the second phase of ferment action has been inhibited by surface tension and not the first phase .
But even when there is no evidence of adsorption we cannot exclude the possibility of surface concentration occurring without adsorption .
In other words it seems possible that the ferment goes into the surface layer of the liquid without becoming adherent to the solid and without being removed with latter .
Such a condition would also explain the observations referred to above .
We have convinced ourselves by a number of preliminary experiments that the retardation by surface tension is a phenomenon shown by other ferments besides invertase .
The conditions in the case of other ferments have not been studied by us in detail .
But it is evident that the effect obtained may differ with the nature of the ferment , of the substrate , of the products of ferment action , and of the surface .
If for instance the substrate itself is surface active , the conditions will differ markedly from those which obtain when the substrate is surface inactive .
