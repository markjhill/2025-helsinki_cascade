IV .
Of the Posture-Master .
IN the Pall Mall at London , lived one Clark ( called , The Posture-Master ) that had such an absolute Command of all his Muscles and Joints , that he can dis-joint almost his whole Body ; so that he imposed on our famous Mullens , who looked on him in so miserable a Condition , that he would not undertake his Cure : Tho ' he was a well grown Fellow , yet he would appear in all the Deformities that can be imagined , as Hunch Backed , Pot Bellied , Sharp Breasted ; he dis-jointed his Arms , Shoulders , Legs and Thighs , that he will appeared as great an Object of Pity as any ; and he has often imposed on the same Company , where he has been just before , to give him Money as a Cripple ; he looking so much unlike himself , that they could not know him .
I have seen him make his Hips stand out a considerable way from his Loins , and so high that they seemed to invade the Place of his Back , in which Posture he has so large a Belly , as tho ' one of our Company had one of a considerable Size , yet it seemed lank compared with his : He turns his Face into all Shapes , so that by himself he acts all the uncouth , demure , odd Faces of a Quaker 's Meeting : I could not have conceived it possible to have done what he did , unless I had seen it ; and I am sensible how short I am come to a full Description of him : None certainly can describe what he does , but himself .
He began Young to bring his Body to it , and there are several Instances of Persons that can move several of their Bones out of their Joints , using themselves to it from Children .
