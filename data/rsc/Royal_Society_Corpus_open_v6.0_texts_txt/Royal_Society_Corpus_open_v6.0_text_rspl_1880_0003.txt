Terpenes , with composition C15H24 , have a greatly increased absorptive power .
3 .
Neither the terpenes themselves nor their oxides nor hydrates , , exhibit absorption bands under any circumstances when pure , but always transmit continuous spectra .

Isomeric terpenes transmit spectra which generally differ from one another in length , or show variations on dilution .

The process of diluting with alcohol enables the presence of bodies of the aromatic series to be detected in essential oils ; and even in some cases the amount of these substances present may be approximately determined .

I do not propose to discuss in this paper all the pigments which have been said to occur in urine , as their consideration would extend over a considerable space ; and I shall , therefore , limit my observations to those which I have myself studied , and which are discoverable by means of spectroscopic observation .
Notwithstanding the efforts of physiological chemists , at home and abroad , no one has been hitherto able to isolate the pigment known as urobilin .
After many unsuccessful attempts , I have at length succeeded in isolating a pigment , which , on account of its spectroscopic and chemical reactions , , appears to be urobilin in a pure state .
Although it has not been obtained in sufficient quantity to allow of a formula being assigned to it , I believe that I shall soon be able to obtain enough for this purpose .
A preliminary examination has shown that it contains carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen .
Preliminary Remarks.\#151 ; If nitric acid be added to a solution of bile before the slit of the spectroscope , the solution at once undergoes a change of colour , becoming green , blue , violet , red , and , lastly , yellow or brownish-yellow , and the spectrum is characterised by having two bands : a broad shadowy band , composed of two in orange and yellow , and a black band at Fraunhofer 's line F. In a short time the shading in orange and yellow begins to fade , and at the time the oxidation process is completed , and the colour of the solution Colouring-matter of Human Urine .
has become yellow , nothing but the band at F is left .
Jaffe ( " Zeitsch .
f. Chem. , " v , 6G6 ) succeeded in isolating the pigment which gives the feeble bands on each side of D , and also that which gives the band at F. The pigment which gave this last band , when isolated , was brown-red in colour , soluble in alcohol , ether , and chloroform ; the solutions Figure reduced from Chart I. ( See p. 36 .
) being a fine red colour , giving , when acidulated , a dark band at F. By treating a solution of dog 's bile with hydrochloric acid , the same observer obtained a red fluid , which became yellow on the addition of alkalies , and which , before alkalies were added , was marked by giving the same dark band as before , but after the addition of alkalies , especially caustic soda , this band was replaced by another one nearer the red .
Since Jaffe described these appearances , Maly* has asserted * " Ann. Ch. Pharm. , " clxi , p. 368 ; clxiii , p. 77 .
Dr. C. A. MacMunn .
Researches into the that he can produce urobilin , or , as he called it , hydrobilirubin from bilirubin , the red colouring matter of human bile ; * and , although his researches have been called in question by some physiological chemists who profess to have repeated his experiments with a negative result , yet the conclusions drawn by him are practically correct , and have led , in my hands , to the discovery of urobilin in the bile of various animals , in human urine , and to its complete isolation from the latter fluid .
Most specimens of high-coloured urine , provided the high colour is not due to blood or unchanged bilirubin or biliverdin , show , when examined with the spectroscope , a dark band at F , which disappears completely when the urine is treated with ammonia , and which is moved towards the red end of the spectrum by treatment with solution of caustic soda .
The band can be made to reappear after the ammonia treatment by the addition of nitric , hydrochloric , or acetic acid .
Since almost all specimens of urine which I examined showed a band at F , I had concluded that this band was due to urobilin , but I could not account for the fact that ammonia did not always cause its disappearance .
I now find that there are pigments urine which give a hand at F. This discovery was made while I was engaged in studying urobilin , for , on treating normal human urine , which was of a pale straw colour , in the same manner as that adopted for the separation of urobilin , I found a pigment of a brownish colour , which , when dissolved in ether , gave two faint bands , one of which was placed over F , the other between h and D ( see 18 of figure ) .
The band at F was not made to disappear by ammonia , nor did acids intensify it .
As a similar band is found in blood serum , in yelks of eggs , in butter , cheese , \amp ; c. , which is due to Thudichum 's " lutein , " I see no objection in accepting that author 's name , urolutein , for this pigment .
My object in mentioning this is to call attention to the fact that urobilin is not the only pigment which gives a band at F ; but urobilin appears to be the only pigment which behaves on treatment with acids and alkalies in the manner I have described .
The presence of this pigment urolutein in urine containing urobilin as well , has also led to the statement which appears in some text-books of physiological chemistry , that caustic soda , when added to urine containing urobilin , causes two bands to appear .
The reason is , that caustic soda moves the urobilin band towards the red , but leaves untouched the band of mrolutein ; consequently , two bands are seen instead of one .
When urobilin alone is present , ammonia causes the complete disappearance of the band at F , and caustic soda moves it towards the red .
Accordingly , a preliminary examination will enable us to determine whether * By reduction with sodium amalgam and subsequent treatment with hydrochloric acid .
Colouring-matter of Human Urine .
29 urobilin alone is present , and the neglect of this observation has led to disappointment .
Examination of the Bile-Spectra of various Animals.\#151 ; If urobilin be formed from bile , the ( question naturally arises , is urobilin present as such in the bile of any animal ?
If so , its biliary origin is made more certain .
To enable me to reply to this question , I proceeded to examine this fluid in various animals , usihg in each instance fresh bile , and examining the spectra by means of a Sorby-Browning microspectroscope , and checking observations\#151 ; when the amount of fluid at my disposal was sufficient for the purpose\#151 ; by means of a one-prism chemical spectroscope .
The bile of the following animals was examined :\#151 ; man , pig , dog , cat , guinea-pig , rabbit , mouse , sheep , hedge-hog , ox , crow , blackbird , chicken , goose , wild duck , duck , frog .
Among these animals , the bile of the following gave a characteristic spectrum:\#151 ; guinea-pig , rabbit , mouse , sheep , ox , crow .
The darkest green or golden-red bile gave the least characteristic spectrum .
I have fully described , in the " Spectroscope in Medicine , " the colour and spectrum of each specimen , but I shall here merely mention those facts which throw light upon the origin of urobilin , namely , that by careful dilution or by examination in a sufficiently thin depth , a band at F is always visible , that this band is made darker by acids , and is made to disappear by adding ammonia .
This is very striking in the case of the bile of the mouse ( Chart II , sp. 12# ) , which gives a black band , resembling exactly that seen in febrile human urine .
If Chart II be inspected , the most noticeable appearance is the presence of this band in so many spectra .
And one cannot help also noticing the general resemblance between these bile-spectra and those shown in the figure , which are the spectra of urobilin in various solutions , and treated by various reagents .
I also attempted to extract urobilin from the liver of the pig , by means of various solvents , the pounded liver having been extracted with water , alcohol , ether , chloroform , and acidulated alcohol respectively , but without success .
Separation of Urobilin from Human Urine.\#151 ; Before describing the method which I adopted for the separation of urobilin , I may make one or two preliminary observations .
The reagents used were perfectly pure , and pure ethyl alcohol was used in every instance ; this is a matter of great importance , as methylated spirit is not suitable for the separation of such easily decomposed bodies as urobilin .
The readings of the spectra are those of a photographed scale adapted to the micro-spectroscope ; and before taking the readings , the precaution was always adopted of narrowing the slit until the sodium * The Chart II referred to above is reproduced in the " Spectroscope in Medicine and accordingly does not accompany this paper .

Researches into the line stood at the same number on the scale .
Of course this would have been unnecessary if the jaws of the slit had been made to open -equally .
The readings are also given in wave-lengths , the latter having been calculated by means of an interpolation curve ; they are expressed in millionths of a millimetre .
Since preliminary observation had shown that there are two pigments in urine which give a band at F , it was necessary , if possible , to get a specimen of urine which contained urobilin only .
Accordingly , the urine of a case of phthisis was chosen , which gave the band at F , in very slight depths ; this band could be made to disappear by ammonia , and was moved towards the red by caustic soda .
The .colour of the urine was orange-red .
The urine therefore contained urobilin , and on six different occasions I separated urobilin by the following method from it ; on each occasion the result was the same .
I may mention that no play of colours was produced by nitric acid .(containing nitrous .
) Experiments.\#151 ; 230 cub. centims. of urine was precipitated by neutral lead acetate , and filtered , the filtrate which still showed the urobilin band was precipitated with basic lead acetate and filtered ; the filtrate now showed no band .
The precipitates were united and .extracted with alcohol acidulated with sulphuric acid , and again thrown on a filter .
The filtrate was a fine , clear red fluid giving in slight depths a well-marked black band at F. Some of this fluid was put into a separating funnel , a large quantity of water added , and then ehloroform ; the whole well shaken and allowed to stand , the red chloroform layer separated off and examined , when it was seen to give the same black band .
The remainder of the alcoholic fluid was treated in the same manner .
I had now a fine red fluid , being a solution of urobilin in chloroform , with , however , a little turbidity at its surface , which disappeared after filtration , which was twice repeated .
An attempt was made to separate some of the colouring matter from the chloroform with acidulated water , but with a negative result .
The chloroform was now distilled off , the residue redissolved in chloroform , which was again distilled off ( in both cases over a water-bath ) .
The residue was brown-red in colour , glistening on the surface , perfectly amorphous , and gave , when examined on the stage of the micro-spectroscope , with a strong light condensed upon its surface , a black band at F. It is perfectly soluble in alcohol , chloroform , nitric acid , hydrochloric acid , acetic acid , lactic acid , acidulated water , partially in ether , both ethereal solution and residue when dissolved in alcohol , giving same spectrum ; partially in benzol and in water ; insoluble in bisulphide of carbon .
The chloroformic solution gives no precipitate with chloride of barium , nor after treatment with ammonia .

At a less depth , the band at E is seen to have disappeared .
This band shown in the figure ( 2 ) reads from 23 to 29 ( or wave-length 592\#151 ; 564 ) .
When excess of ammonia was removed by means of a small pipette , and the solution was acidified with acetic acid , the band at F reappeared .
Alcoholic Solution of same Pigment.\#151 ; This solution was of a red colour , and gave , when examined at a suitable depth , two bands , and at a less depth another black band at F. The readings of the bands at the first depth were as follows:\#151 ; Extent , 9 to 37 ( or wave-length 686\#151 ; 534 ) 1 Band e , 21 to 23 ( or wave-length 604\#151 ; 592 ) / See figure ( 4 ) .

This solution then gives the same spectrum as the ethereal solution , the slight differences in positions of bands being due to different refractive power of solvent used , and when ammonia was added , the same effect as in the case of the ethereal solution was produced .

This also gave a band near D when treated with ammonia , which also caused the disappearance of band At first it seemed possible that the appearance of these bands 6 and 8 might have been due to the action of heat on the pigment during the evaporation , but on evaporating the chloroformic solution unden the receiver of the air-pump the same result was arrived at .
Action of Caustic Soda on Solutions.\#151 ; If the solutions were examined in a depth sufficient to show band at F distinctly and caustic soda were added , in each case this band disappeared and was replaced by another nearer the red .
Thus in ethereal solution the band read 42 47 ( or wave-length 517\#151 ; 502 ) ; and in chloroformic solution the- band read 43\#151 ; 48 ( or wave-length 513\#151 ; 499 ) ; and in alcoholic solution 41'5\#151 ; 47 ( or wave-length 519\#151 ; 502 .

As all these solutions contained the same pigment , the next step .
Colouring-matter of Human Urine .
33 was to determine the elementary composition of this pigment ; accordingly the residue from the chloroformic treatment was carefully analysed , when it was found to contain : Carbon .
Hydrogen .
Oxygen .
Nitrogen .
Sulphur .
The occurrence of the last element led to the supposition that it must have been due to the treatment with sulphuric acid .
I therefore came to the conclusion that if this supposition were correct there would be an absence of sulphur in the pigment prepared by a method in which hydrochloric acid would be used instead of sulphuric .
Separation of Urobilin by means of Hydrochloric Acid .
This method was exactly similar to the first , with the exception , that instead of using alcohol acidulated with sulphuric acid , I now used alcohol acidulated with hydrochloric acid , and the pigment was separated on four different occasions ; the residue obtained resembled exactly that got by the first method , both as to its appearance and as to its solubility in different media .
The spectra of these solutions differed ( as I expected they would ) in regard to the band near D , but that at I1 was exactly the same as before , and acted in the same manner when treated by ammonia and sodic hydrate respectively .
I now proceed to the spectra observed in the solutions of urobilin obtained by this method .

Colouring-matter of Human Urine .
In a slight depth the band at F had disappeared .
The pigment was also soluble in nitric acid and in lactic acid ; in the former there were no bands , except that at F , visible ; in the latter they resembled those of the acetic acid solution .
All the spectra which I have described will suffice to show that the same pigment was evidently present in every solution ; there were many more observed and measured , but they were not of sufficient importance to call for their being mentioned here .
It now became necessary to test the urobilin prepared by the hydrochloric acid process for sulphur , which was accordingly done ; and not only was sulphur found to be absent , but the presence of chlorine was detected , showing that my inference was correct , and that the sulphur found in the urobilin prepared by the sulphuric acid process was due to the sulphuric acid used in its preparation , and that the chlorine found in the urobilin prepared by the hydrochloric acid process was due to the hydrochloric acid .
But in neither case was there free sulphuric acid or free hydrochloric acid , and hence the conclusion follows that the urobilin was in combination with those acids respectively .
I think it will be allowed that the bands visible only at certain depths of the solution belong to the same pigment that gives the band at F , hence they all belong to urobilin .
As they are not visible in the aqueous solution , we can understand why they are not visible in urine .
And I may also mention that , although water only appears to take up a pigment giving a band at F , yet after evaporation of the water and solution of the residue in alcohol , ether , or chloroform , the same bands again become visible .
Summary .
1 .
Urobilin has been separated from urine .
2 .
It has been separated in combination with hydrochloric acid and with sulphuric acid respectively .
3 .
The spectra of solutions of urobilin obtained by these methods respectively differ in the position of certain feeble bands , but agree in all having a black band at F , which can be made to disappear on adding ammonia in excess , and which is replaced by another band nearer the red end of the spectrum on the addition of sodic hydrate .
4 .
Urobilin is an amorphous brownish-red pigment , which contains carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , and nitrogen .
It is soluble in alcohol , chloroform , acidulated water , acids ; partially in ether , benzol , and water , i.e. , if the pigment be separated in combination with hydro-- chloric or sulphuric acid .
5 .
Urobilin appears capable of existing in different states of oxidation .
6 .
Urobilin is derived from one of the colouring matters of bile .
36 Researches into the Colouring-matter of Human Urine .
7 .
Urobilin is the colouring matter of the bile of the mouse .
Before concluding this paper I should like to call attention to a peculiarity which the band a. of urobilin exhibits : in certain depths it appears very broad , but in less depths it is seen that the portion of the band nearest the violet has disappeared .
In other words , the redward part of the band is the most persistent and is the last to disappear on dilution .
Thus , taking the alcoholic solution of urobilin prepared by the second process mentioned before , we find that when the extent of the spectrum is 8 to 80 ( or wave-length 694\#151 ; 432 ) this band reads 42\#151 ; 67 ( or wave-length 517\#151 ; 453 ) , but when the extent is 7 to 85 ( or wave-length 702\#151 ; 425 ) then the band reads 47 to 53 ( or wave-length 502\#151 ; 485 .
) Urobilin , like haemaglobin and haematin , appears to be a very unstable body , which easily splits up on treatment with reagents into decomposition products , each giving a peculiar spectrum .
This accounts for the differences observed in the spectra obtained by the different methods I have described .
