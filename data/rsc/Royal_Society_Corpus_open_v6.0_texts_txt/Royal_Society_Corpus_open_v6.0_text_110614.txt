A paper was read , entitled , " On the Laws of Mortality .
" By Charles Jellicoe , Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget , M.D. , Sec. R.S. The author , considering that the variations and discrepancies in the annual decrements of life which are exhibited in the tables of mortality hitherto published would probably disappear , and that these decrements would follow a perfectly regular and uniform law , if the observations on which they are founded were sufficiently nu ?
merous , endeavours to arrive at an approximation to such a law , by proper interpolations in the series of the numbers of persons living at every tenth year of human life .
The method he proposes , for the attainment of this object , is that of taking , by proper formulae , the successive orders of differences , until the last order either disap ?
pears , or may be assumed equal to zero .
With the aid of such differences , of which , by applying these formuke , he gives the calcula ?
tion , he constructs tables of the annual decrements founded princi ?
pally on the results of the experience of the Equitable Assurance Society .
