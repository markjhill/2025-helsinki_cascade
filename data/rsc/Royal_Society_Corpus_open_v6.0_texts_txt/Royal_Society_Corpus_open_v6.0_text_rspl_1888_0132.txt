economical production of currents by the direct oxidation of bnstible gases , , does not seem at pres to be a problem likely to be readily solved .

( Abstract .
) The author has continued his experimental enquiries , of which the results were communicated to the Society under the same title in 1881 .
In the to the paper he glves a summary of his previous observations , which led } conclusion that the property , by virtue of which the excitabL ctures of the leaf respond to stimuIation , is of the same nature with that possessed by the similarlyendowed structures of animals .
He proceeds : tostate that the main purpose of his )sequent iestigations has been to determine the relation between two sets of phenomena which might , in accordance with the language commonly used in animal physiology , be termed respectively those of the " " resting current\ldquo ; and of the " " action
