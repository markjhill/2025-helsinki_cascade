On the 12th November , 1902 , when examining a specimen of .cerebro-spinal fluid taken by lumbar puncture during life from a well-marked case of sleeping sickness , I was surprised to observe a living trypanosoma .
Since that date I have made as many observations in this direction as possible , and the results are to my mind sufficiently surprising to excuse me for presenting this preliminary note .
These trypanosomes are not in large numbers , so that to find them it is necessary to draw off ' at least 15 c.cs .
of the cerebro-spinal fluid .
It is better to reject the first few c.cs .
as they are apt to contain blood .
When the fluid comes away clear , 10 c.cs .
are collected and centrifuged for 15 minutes .
At the end of this time there is found at the bottom of the tube a slight deposit of whitish sediment , and in some cases also a minute trace of blood .
The liquid above the sediment is poured off and the sediment .examined under a moderately low power of the microscope .
As the .trypanosomes are at first fairly active they are easily detected .

506 Dr. A. Castellani .
Discovery of Trypanosoma [ May 8 , 1903 .
] in the Ccrebro-spined Fluid Sleeping Sickness .
507 Table I shows that in 34 cases of sleeping sickness , the trypanosomes were found in the cerebro-spinal fluid taken by lumbar puncture \#166 ; during life in 20 cases , giving a rate of 70 per cent. On two occasions I also examined in the same way fluid from the lateral ventricles and in both cases found the same parasite .
In blood I found the trypanosoma once with certainty .
It may be thought that the trypanosomes are found in the cerebrospinal fluid on account of the trace of blood which sometimes forms part of the sediment .
But it will be seen from the table that in several .cases there was no trace of blood .
Table II shows that in 12 cases of ordinary disease , the cerebro-spinal fluid taken during life by lumbar puncture , in no case contained trypanosoma , and it is important to note that 3 of these controls were .cases of the usual trypanosoma fever , as described by Forde , Dutton , Manson , Daniels , \amp ; c. Here it may be remarked that trypanosoma fever is by no means uncommon among the natives in Uganda , 3 cases having been met with , by Dr. Baker , one of the colonial surgeons here ( Entebbe ) , within the last 3 weeks .
I understand that Dr. Baker is publishing this most interesting observation .
It must be clearly understood that these cases of trypanosoma fever bear no resemblance in their clinical features to sleeping sickness .
The trypanosoma found in the cerebro-spinal fluid of sleeping sickness does not as far as I have been able to make out differ materially in size and shape from the species one finds in the blood of trypanosoma fever , Trypanosoma Gambiense(Dutton ) , but possibly it is to be differentiated from this one , because in it , as a rule , the micro-nucleus lies nearer the extremity and the vacuole is apparently larger .
Besides , its movements are not apparently so active , but this fact might be due to the effects of the centrifuge .
In case it should prove to be a new species , the trypanosoma I have described might be called from the country where I have found it first \#151 ; -Tr Relation of the Trypanosoma to Sleeping Sickness .
At the post-mortem examination of 80 per cent , of the cases where I found during life the trypanosoma , I grew from the blood of the heart and from the liquid of the lateral ventricles the variety of streptococcus I described many months ago in my first note .
Up to that time I had never found the trypanosoma , but this is easily explained by the fact that I did not use the technique I have described in this note , viz. , examination of a quantity of liquid after long use of the centrifuge .
Influenced by my last investigations I would suggest as a working hypothesis on which to base further investigation that sleeping sickness 508 Trypanosoma present in Cases of Sleeping Sickness .
is due to the species of trypanosoma I have found in the eerebro-spinal fluid of the patients in this disease , and that at least in the last stages there is a concomitant streptococcus infection which plays a certain part in the course of the disease .
Note by the Secretary lloyal Society .
As so far supporting the observations by Dr. Castellani recorded in the above communication , it may be desirable to state that Colonel Bruce , to whom in Uganda Dr. Castellani made known his discovery of the Trypanosoma , and who is now continuing the investigation begun by Dr. Castellani , has sent to the Royal Society a telegram , received May 4 , stating that since Dr. Castellani left , in thirty-eight cases of sleeping sickness , he had found trypanosoma in ever } ' case in fluid obtained by lumbar puncture , and that he had found trypanosoma in the blood in twelve out of thirteen cases of sleeping sickness .
