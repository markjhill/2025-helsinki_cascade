Sec. R.S. The observations recorded in this paper are of two kinds ; first , those for the relative total force , which were made with a pair of Lloyd needles and an inclination-circle , seven inches in diameter , with two verniers reading to single minutes ; and secondly , those for the absolute horizontal force made with a unifilar magnetometer .
After a detailed description of these instruments , the results of the observations are given , occupying several pages of tables .
