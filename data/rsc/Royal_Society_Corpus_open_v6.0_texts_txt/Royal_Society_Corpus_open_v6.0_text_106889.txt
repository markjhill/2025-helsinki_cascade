Read Jalauary 9s 794b ft'll_ HE ' geographical surveying of Dennlark was begun in the rear z76e Tlle foundations-of-geographical maps are the trigonometrical operations , or great trianglesf whose bases uTere measured with ( Ieal rods .
The angles of the triangles were observed with a circular instrument of z foot radius S the divi sions of this instrument are double in go and 96 degreesb With this instrument the angles may be observed to a lesserror than S " , and the sum of all the angles in every triangle very seldom have had a difference of 15 " from 180 degrees .
For this reason the bases , measllred at several places in Seland and Jutland75 have very well agreed with the corresponding sides , computed through a long series of triatlgles , begurl from theobservatory at CopenhageIl .
I believe that a distance , found by those trigonometrical operatiolas , is to lJe depended upon to 2 oooolth part of the whole .
I beg leave to observe , that the Danish astronomers and geographers , for gl years , hate been before hand in making use of circular instruments , which now begin to be of a more general use in astrorlozzlical ... \ ad geographical observations .
The royal observatory at Copenhagen has , sitce the year 178zn beerz adorlaed With a C ; s : 43 3 circular instrument of 4 feet radius , which at least at that time was the only circular instrument of that size .
By the trigonometrical operations , the merldian of=CopenF hagen , and of several other places , and a perpendicular to the meridian of the observatory , are draw:zl .
The special position of villages , farms , and cottages , the situation of the coas-t9 woodsf rivers , ponds , moors , roacls , are laid down by the plain table , orl a scale of 20O0 Danish or Rhenish feet to one decimal inch .
After a reduction to Wth part , toa scale of o Danisl mile to : e| inches , we have pulilished g geographical maps , which , as well for the geometrical exactness , as for the beauty of engra^7ing , seem not to be unworthy of the approbation of torelgners .
I have described the izastrumentsn and the methods of our $eometrical surveying , and ot the trigonometrical operations , ill a trea-tise published in the Dalaish lallguage at Copenhagen 177g ) and translated into the Gerinan by Major ASTER at Dresden , 1787 .
II1 this paper I only shall lay before the Royal Society a new method 3f coml ?
uting the longitude and the latitude of places , laid dow by trigonometrical opera tions .
Let ESIH ( Tab. VIII .
) be an ellipsis ; EH half the less axiss IH half the greater axis XA the observatory at Copenhagen ; AV its vertical linethe angle V the complement to the latitude of the observatory .
tThen by t1-1e nature of the ellipsis .
AV = ( il ; sln zHv + e ; cos ; v ) I AN is a great circle , perpendicular to the meridian of Copenhagen .
The tangent to the same meridian AF =AV x tang .
V. AmnOpeeXD is a series of triangles in the direction of the parallel ofCopenha ; ens gtur x. @*G is -a series of triangies in the direction of the meridian GDE of a place Ga whose longitude and kitude are to be calculated .
For the first series of wiangies may be taken the parallels divided into small parts AB c BC o CD ; and for the second series may be talen the merIdlan GD ; because the arches of those circles are known by the triangles , and^computed-from the trigenometrical operations .
