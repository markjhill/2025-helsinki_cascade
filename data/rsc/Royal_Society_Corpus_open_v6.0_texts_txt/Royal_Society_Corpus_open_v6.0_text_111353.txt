( Abstract .
) The author defines the term roots as applied to a system of n1 equations =0 , I= O , &amp;c. , where b , A ) , &amp;c. , are quantics ( i. e. rational and integral homogeneous functions ) of the n variables ( x , y , z,. .
) and the terms symmetric functions and fundamental symmetric functions of the roots of such a system ; and he explains the process given in Professor Schlafle 's memoir , " Ueber die Resultante eines Systemes mehrerer algebraischer Gleichungen , " Vienna Transactions , t. iv .
( 1852 ) , whereby the determination of the symmetric functions of any system of ( n-1 ) equations , and of the resultant of any system of n equations is made to depend upon the very simple question of the determination of the resultant of a system of n equations , all of them , except one , being linear .
The object of the memoir is then stated to be the application of the process to two particular cases , viz. to obtaining the expressions for the simplest symmetric functions , after the fundamental ones of the following systems of two ternary equations , viz. first , a linear equation and a quadratic equation ; and secondly , a linear equation and a cubic equation ; and the author accordingly obtains expressions , as regards the first system , for the fundamental symmetric functions or symmetric functions of the first degree in respect to each set of roots , and for the symmetric functions of the second and third degrees respectively , and as regards the second system , for the findamental symmetric functions or symmetric functions of the first degree , and for the symmetric functions of the second degree in respect to each set of roots .
