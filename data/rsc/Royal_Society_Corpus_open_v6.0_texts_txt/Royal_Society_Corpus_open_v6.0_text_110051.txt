] The Triumph arrived at Cadiz in 1810 , and in the following March a Spanish vessel , laden with quicksilver , was wrecked under the batteries , then in possession of the French .
The Triumph 's boats were sent to her assistance , and about 130 tons of the quicksilver carried on board .
The metal was secured in bladders packed in barrels , but the bladders having been wetted grew rotten , and the metal escaped in large quantities , got mixed with the provisions , and very soon affected the crew with ptyalism , ulcerated throats , &amp;c. The different animals on board were also affected .
From the extent of the mischief it was evident that the air of the confined part of the vessel contained mercurial vapour , and accordingly those who slept and messed in the orlop and lower decks were more severely affected than those chiefly confined to the upper deck ; while the men who lived and slept chiefly under the forecastle , escaped with a slight affection of the gums .
