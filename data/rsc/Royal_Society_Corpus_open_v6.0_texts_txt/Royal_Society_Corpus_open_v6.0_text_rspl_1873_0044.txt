Hennessey on [ Apr. 16 , It will be observed that the diagrams of the separate words , although they become modified when grouped together , are more or less discernible in the lines continuously spoken ; and the similarity of sound at the termination of the first three lines , which constitutes the rhyme of the verse , is represented in the similarity of form , or in the character of the form , of the terminations of the diagrams of these three lines .
The subject might be pursued much further by showing the diagrams of the same words spoken by different individuals , the outlines produced by the words and sentences of other languages , the effect produced by change of accent , \amp ; e. My object , however , has not been to pursue the subject into minute detail , but to show that the articulation of the human voice is accompanied by definite pneumatic actions , and that those actions , many of which are insensible to ordinary observation , are capable of being recorded .

" Note on the Periodicity of Rainfall .

Interested in the inquiry proposed by Mr. Meldrum , as to whether rainfall varies with the sun-spot area , I examined the register kept at the office of the Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India , and am enabled , through the courtesy of Colonel J. T. Walker , R.E. , to communicate the results .
These are probably not devoid of peculiar interest- , from the abnormal conditions presented by the stations of observation , which are far inland , and on , or adjoining , lofty mountains , as appears from the following brief descriptions .

Mussoorie station is on the southernmost range of the Himalaya Mountains , lat. N. 30 ' 28 ' , long .
E. 78 ' 7 ' , height 6500 feet ; this range rises suddenly and forms the northern boundary of the Dehra Boon ( or Dehra valley ) , which is some 18 miles wide and 40 miles long , and is bounded to the south by the Sewalik range of hills , about 3500 feet high .
Dehra station is 2200 feet high , 10 miles south bf Mussoorie station , and in the Dehra valley .

Owing to the absence of the observers in the winter months from Mussoorie station , the rainfall is not recorded there during that period ; this , however , is of little consequence to the inquiry in hand , for the total annual fall occurs almost entirely in June , July , and August .
I accordingly give in Table I. the total fall at Mussoorie between May 1 and October 31 of each year ; and in order to make these totals comparable at the two stations , if desired , the fall for January , February , March , April , November , and December is excluded from the Dehra totals .
this quantity excluded may be set down at some 6 inches , or only 1874 .

some 75 per cent , of the annual fall .
Excepting five years at Dehra and two at Mussoorie , all the observations have been taken under my own superintendence , \so that 1 can vouch for their accuracy .
Rejecting decimal places as redundant , the rainfall is as follows ( in inches ) for 20 years at Mussoorie and for 13 years at Dehra :\#151 ; Table I. Sun-spot area* .

Adding to the fall in the epochal year ( i. e. maximum or minimum ) the fall for one preceding and one succeeding year , we shall get what may be termed three-year sums ; similarly , by including two years on each side of the epochal year , we find five-year sums % : the results are as follows :\#151 ; Table II .

288 On the Periodicity of Rainfall .
[ Apr. 16 , Notwithstanding the exceptional localities of the stations , the above results are generally in keeping with the Meldrum theory : the Dehra observations for 1860 and prior years are unfortunately wanting ; but it will be seen in Table I. that heavy falls occurred in the two years succeeding the epochal year 1860 .
5 .
It may , however , be questioned whether stations inland are ineligible to test the theory under notice .
No doubt far more rain falls on certain parts of the globe than on others , and Mussoorie and Dehra are included in the former : but a large rainfall is in fact a recommendation , presenting as it does a large measure of the periodicity in question ; so that stations under this condition appear highly eligible unless the rainfall is subject to abnormal fluctuations , apart from the supposed influence of sun-spot area ; indeed , were it practicable to measure the total rainfall on the whole globe , the total results would present the most effective argument for periodicity .
Projecting the facts of Table I. , with the help of ordinates and abscissae we obtain the appended diagram , where I am unable to introduce , in lieu of the year , numerical values of sun-spot areas from want of complete results , such as those obtained by Messrs. De La Rue , 1874 .

Balfour Stewart , and Loewy .
Recognizing the sun as the governor of our system and the source of terrestrial heat and light , it appears certain that at least some of the circumstances attending our globe are directly or indirectly the results of solar conditions , of which we can read but too few , and interpret still fewer rightly .
In the present instance we see that , as in other curves , a certain rainfall maximum may be less than minima not immediately preceding or succeeding ; and this alone suggests the desirability of comparison with actual magnitudes of sun-spot areas ; but the introduction of this more accurate test would doubtless prove a waste of time , unless the approximate relation at present under view can be maintained .

( Abstract .
) The object of the investigation is to inquire into the mode of origin of Bacteria and toruloid vegetations .
The inquiry is divided into three sections .
Section I. On the sterilization by heat of organic liquids and mixtures.\#151 ; When beef-tea or a decoction of turnip is boiled for a few minutes and afterwards preserved from extraneous contamination , it passes into a state of " permanent sterility .
" This state is characterized by loss of power to originate organisms with conservation of the power of nourishing and promoting the growth of organisms .
All organic liquids and mixtures seem capable of being brought to this state by exposure to the heat of 212 ' F. ; but the length of time during which exposure to this heat is necessary to induce sterilization varies greatly according to the nature of the materials .
Ordinary infusions and decoctions were sterilized by boiling for five or ten minutes ; but milk , chopped green vegetables in water , pieces of boiled egg in water , and other mixtures were not sterilized unless the heat was continued for twenty to forty minutes .
Hay-infusion was sterilized , like other infusions , by boiling for a few minutes ; but when the infusion was rendered alkaline with ammonia or liquor potassae , it was not sterilized except after an exposure to the heat of boiling water for more than an hour .
Sometimes it germinated after two hours , and once after three hours of such exposure .
There appeared to be two factors of equal importance in the induction of sterilization\#151 ; namely , the degree of heat and the duration of its application .
These two factors appeared to be mutually compensatory in such fashion that a longer exposure to a lower temperature was equivalent to
