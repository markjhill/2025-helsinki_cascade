" On the Occlusion of Hydrogen Gas by 7Meteoric Iron .
" By TIIHOMAS GRAHAMi , F.R.S. Received May 16 , 1867 .
Some light may possibly be thrown upon the history of such metals found in nature as are of a soft colloid description , particularly native iron , platinum , and gold , by an investigation of the gases which they hold occluded , such gases being borrowed from the atmosphere in which the metallic mass last found itself in a state of ignition .
The meteoric iron of Lenarto appeared to be well adapted for a trial .
, This well-known iron is free from any stony admixture , and is remarkably pure and malleable .
It was found by Wehrle to be of specific gravity 7'79 , and to consist ofIron ... ... ... ... ... 90-883 Nickel ... ... ... ... ... . .

It weighed 45-2 grammes , and had the builk of 5'78 cubic centimetres .
The strip was well washed by hot solution of potassa , and then repeatedly by hot distilled water , and dried .
Such treatment of iron , it had been previously found , conduces in no way to the evolution of hydrogen gas when the metal is subsequently heated The Lenarto iron : was enclosed in a new porcelain tube , and the latter being attached to a Sprengel aspirator , a good vacuum was obtained in the cold .
The tube being placed in a trough combustion furnace , was heated to redness by ignited charcoal .

The gas burned like hydrogen .
It did not contain a trace of carbonic acid , nor any hydrocarbon vapour absorbable by fuming sulphuric acid .
The second portion of gas collected , consisting of 9-52 cub. centims. , gave by analysis-lydrogen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .

98'6 9'64 , , 100600 The Lenarto iron appears , therefore , to yield 2-85 times its volume of gas , of which 86 per cent. nearly is hydrogen .
The proportion of carbonic oxide is so low as 4i per cent. The gas occluded by iron , from a carbonaceous fire , is very different , the prevailing gas then being carbonic oxide .
For comparison a quantity of clean horseshoe nails was submitted to a similar distillation .
The gas collected from 23 5 grammes of metal ( 3'01 cub. centims. ) wasIn 150 minutes ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 540 cub. centirms .
In 120 minutes ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 2-58 , , In 4 hours 30 minutes ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 7'98 , , The metal has given 2'66 times its volume of gas .
The first portion collected appeared to contain of hydrogen 35 per cent. , of carbonic oxide 503 , of carbonic acid 7'7 , and of nitrogen 7 per cent. The latter portion collected gave more carbonic oxide ( 58 per cent. ) with less hydrogen ( 21 per cent. ) , no carbonic acid , the remiainder nitrogen .
The predominance of carbonic oxide in its occluded gases appears to attest the telluric origin of iron .
Hydrogen has been recognized in the spectrum-analysis of the light of the fixed stars , by Mfessrs .
Huggins and Miller .
The same gas constitutes , according to the wide researches of Father Secchi , the principal element of a numerous class of stars , of which a Lyre is the type .
The iron of Lenarto has no doubt come from such an atmosphere , in which hydrogen greatly prevailed .
This meteorite may be looked upon as holding imprisoned within it , and bearing to us hydrogen of the stars .
It has been found difficult , on trial , to impregnate malleable iron with more than an equal volume of hydrogen , under the pressure of our atmosphere .
Now the meteoric iron gave up about three times that amount , without being fully exhausted .
The inference is that the meteorite has been extruded from a dense atmosphere of hydrogen gas , for which we must look beyond the light cometary matter floating about within the limits of the solar system .
