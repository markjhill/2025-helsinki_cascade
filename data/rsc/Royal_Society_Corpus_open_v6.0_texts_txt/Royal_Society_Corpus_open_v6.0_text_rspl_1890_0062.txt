It possesses , moreover , the great advantage of not taking in the low band of sky near the horizon , and thus avoiding a principal element of uncertainty in other observations .

The octant actinometer consists of three quadrantal planes , MOS , MOI , and IOS , joined at their edges so as to form a hollow trihedral , and mounted so that one of the edges , OS , can be brought to point to the sun ; the plane MOI will then coincide with the plane of minimum intensity .
The instrument has another adjustment , by which it can turn round OS as an axis , and if one of the planes MOS , IOS be brought to coincide with the plane of symmetry , the other will coincide with the plane of the sun 's altitude .
I take a small square of sensitised paper , and cut it along CO ; then slipping the part COB under AOO , so that B coincides at C , it forms a rectangular trihedral of paper .
This is placed in a small exposure trihedral of cardboard , and covered by a thin metal trihedral in the trihedral of the octant ( I make several of these trihedrals of sensitised paper , so as in the field to take quickly a series of observations ; the trihedral of paper is , of course , carefully covered till the instrument is in adjustment ) ; exposed to the action of the sky for ( say ) thirty seconds , the readings on the planes MOS and IOS will be each 30 ia , and that on the plane MOI will be 30 .

" Determinations of the Heat Capacity and Heat of Fusion of some Substances to test the Validity of Person 's Absolute Zero .
" By Spencer Umereville Pickering , M.A. , F.R.S. Received November 6 , 1890 .
The relations existing between the heat of fusion of a substance and its heat capacity in the liquid and solid condition were demonstrated by Person , in 1847 ( 'Ann .
Chim .
Phys. ' ( 3 ) , vol. 21 , p. 315 ) .
He showed that the heat of fusion must diminish as the temperature 12 Prof. S. U. Pickering .
Determinations to test [ Dec. 11 , is lowered , the decrease per degree being equal to the difference between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid , and that , therefore , there must be a certain temperature at which the heat of fusion will be nil , this temperature being given by t\#151 ; -\#151 ; ^- , in which t is the melting point of the substance , l its heat of fusion at t , and C and c its heat capacity in the liquid and solid conditions respectively .
At this temperature a liquid could not freeze , since there would be no difference between it and the solid , and Person argued that there would then be no heat at all in it , and that this temperature was the absolute zero .
He then made determinations with various substances , which tended to show that this temperature was the same for all bodies , and was situated at \#151 ; 160 ' C. The analogy between this zero and that deduced for gases is , however , very imperfect ; the total heat in a gas is measured by its temperature reckoned from \#151 ; 273 ' , whereas it is only the difference between the total heat in a liquid and solid that is measured by its temperature reckoned from \#151 ; 160 ' , and , instead of considering the latter as the absolute zero , it is preferable to regard it as the critical temperature for the solid-liquid conditions ( see ' Chem. Soc. Trans. , ' 1889 , p. 32 ) ; and indeed , since we have now succeeded in obtaining liquids at temperatures below \#151 ; 160 ' , it is quite impossible to regard \#151 ; 160 ' as the absolute zero , or to believe that the heat capacities of all bodies would indicate this same temperature for that of no solidification .
Gruldberg ( ' Bidrag til Agarnernes Molekylar Theorie , ' ch .
v , p. 484 ) has defined the critical point of the solid-liquid states as that at which the volumes of the liquid and solid are identical , and at which the heat of fusion is nil , a certain pressure , as well as a certain temperature , being required to fulfil these conditions .
It appears to me , however , that the question of pressure may practically be left out of consideration ; pressure will , of course , affect the temperature in question , but to such a small extent that the ordinary atmospheric pressure , under which the data necessary for the calculations are obtained , may be regarded as nil , and it also appears to me that the definition depending on the heat of fusion being nil includes the idea of equal volumes , for it seems hardly possible to conceive two conditions of the same substance , each possessing the same kinetic and potential energy , which could yet differ from each other in volume or any other property .
The analogy , however , between this temperature and the critical temperature for the liquid gaseous conditions is at best but an imperfect one .
If we start with a crystalline solid below this temperature and heat it , it could never pass by insensible degrees into a liquid ; the molecules in a crystal possess a definite arrangement , those of a liquid an indefinite arrangement , and , between these two , no inter1890 .

mediate state appears possible ; on the other hand , when we start with a liquid and cool it , it becomes in many cases ( see ' Chem. Soc. Trans. , ' 1890 , p. 340 ) so viscous that even at\#151 ; 80 ' to \#151 ; 100 ' it can scarcely be termed a liquid , and by further cooling it would probably become so firm that it would be regarded as a solid .
This affords a striking illustration of what may be meant by the gradual passage of a liquid into a solid , but the solid thus obtained would evidently not be identical with the crystallised solid , nor could it be obtained by beating the crystals from a lower temperature ; as the data on which the calculations are based do not refer to this solid but to the crystalline one , I think it preferable to avoid the use of " critical temperature , " and to term that given by the equation C-c the " temperature of no crystallisation .
" For the purpose of extending the applications of a law governing the freezing points of solutions which I have lately propounded ( ' Chem. Soc. Proc. , ' 1889 , p. 149 ) , it was necessary to determine this temperature in certain cases .
The present communication contains the details of these determinations , and they afford evidence that it is not a constant for all bodies , as Person imagined .
The values which Person obtained with various substances were as follows:\#151 ; * Water ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... \#151 ; 159'\7t Phosphorus ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
\#151 ; 1510,7 Sulphur ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .

\#151 ; 165'-3 Dodecahydrate of sodium phosphate \#151 ; 161o,0 Potassium and sodium nitrate ... \#187 ; \#151 ; 161o,0 The concordance of these values is certainly very striking , especially when the diversity of the substance examined and the difficulties of the determinations are considered ; but a closer examination of the results cannot fail to suggest that the concordance must in some instances have been accidental .
The difference between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid , C \#151 ; c , is often very small , and even ordinary experimental errors in either of the quantities would make a large difference in the results , while in some of Person 's determinations the experimental errors must have been'of more than ordinary magnitude , for these determinations occasionally lasted between one and two hours , during which time the loss by cooling must have been very * ' Ann.

Determinations to test [ Dec. 11 , large .
Special sources of error and uncertainty might be pointed oat in each particular case ( except that of water , perhaps ) , but there is one fatal objection to all Person 's results , namely , that the heat capacity of both solids and liquids varies considerably with the temperature , and that he made his determinations at any temperature which happened to be most convenient , that , for instance , at which the heat capacity of the solid was determined varying between 11 ' and 280 ' below its melting point .
One case will be sufficient to illustrate the effect of this .
With solid phosphorus determinations have been made by Kopp ( 'Liebig 's Annalen , ' Suppl. 3 , p. 1 ) and Regnault ( 'Ann .
Ohim .
Phys. , ' vol. 73 , p. 56 ; and ( 3 ) vol. 26 , p. 269 ) , and the latter , at any rate , must command as much confidence as Person 's ( indeed Person adopts some of Regnault 's determinations with this substance ) ; these results are\#151 ; c \#151 ; 02020 at ( + 36 ' to +13 ' \#151 ; )+240,5 C ... Kopp , o = 01895 " ( + 7'15 " +30'-21 = ) + 18'-68 . .

Person , c = 01699 " ( \#151 ; 77'-75 " +10 ' =)\#151 ; 33'-88 . .
Regnault , and , taken in their order , they give \#151 ; 1969 ' , \#151 ; 292 ' , \#151 ; 152 ' , and 102 ' for the temperature of no crystallisation , * which results clearly show that no value can be attached to Person 's figure , \#151 ; 152 ' .
Person 's and Regnault 's results lie in a fairly straight line which gives c = 01979 at the fusing point , and \#151 ; 719 ' as the temperature of no crystallisation , but it is impossible to accept even this value , as there are not sufficient data for calculating the heat capacity of the liquid at the fusing point .
C , c , and l should evidently be determined at the same temperature , and this temperature must necessarily be that of fusion ( t ) , but , inasmuch as the heat capacities near this temperature may be abnormally high owing to the fusion or solidification being sometimes a gradual process , the determinations should not be made too near the fusing point,11 and the only means of ascertaining their true value at this point is to determine them at several different temperatures , and from the rate of change thus obtained to calculate their value at the fusing point itself .
This method has been adopted in the present work .
* C = 0-2045 ( 98 ' to 48 ' ) , l = 5'034 , and t = 44'-2 .
t The values obtained by Person for beeswax afford a striking instance in point ; from \#151 ; 9 ' to + 50 ' the heat capacity of this solid increases from 0"43 to 1"72 , exceeding at this latter temperature that of the liquid ( 0'50 ) by a very large amount .
Ice shows a similar increase , but in a much smaller degree ( see Person , ' nn .

15 Substances Investigated .
The substances investigated were sulphuric acid , the monohydrate of sulphuric acid , the tetrahydrate of calcium nitrate , benzene , and naphthalene , the last mentioned being the only one in which C , c , and l had been determined by previous investigators .
The sulphuric acid was the same as that used in my determinations of the freezing points of this substance ( ' Chem. Soc. Trans. , ' 1890 , p. 337 ) , the stock acid having been diluted by the addition of ice so as to contain exactly 100 , and , for the monohydrate , 84'488 , per cent. H2SO4 .
The calcium nitrate was prepared by repeated crystallisation ; the percentage of anhydrous salt in the fused crystals having been determined by evaporation and heating at 250 ' , the excess of water which the fused salt was found to contain was driven off by a gentle heat .
The melted salt will remain liquid at ordinary temperatures for many days , although its solidifying point is 42''4 .
The naphthalene and benzene were special preparations made by Messrs. Kahlbaum : repeated crystallisation was not found to alter the melting point of either to any appreciable extent .
Method Employed .
The substance was placed in a cylindrical platinum bottle measuring 9x2 cm .
, and holding about 30 c.c. Its mouth was closed by a caoutchouc stopper , through which passed a thermometer with a very narrow bulb , long enough to extend from the top to the bottom of the bottle , thereby giving the mean temperature of the contents more accurately than an instrument with a short bulb would have done .
The bottle was placed in a double test tube , and the latter in a double bath containing warm water or a freezing mixture , as the case might be .
After the bottle had attained the required temperature , and this had remained constant for some time , it was removed from the test tubes and plnnged into the calorimeter , an operation which occupied only two or three seconds .
To prevent the deposition of hoar-frost on the bottle while it was being cooled , the inner test tube in which it was placed had a bulb blown at the bottom , in which was kept some sulphuric acid .
The calorimeter contained either 600 or 1800 c.c. of water , the quantity being adjusted so that the rise or fall of the temperature in it was about 1 ' , the smallness of the change being favourable to the accuracy of the determination by rendering the loss of cooling , or gain by heating , very small .
This loss or gain was estimated by determining the rate of cooling at the initial and final temperatures , both thermometers being read at intervals of one minute , and having been compared with each other before the determinations .
The rate of cooling during the time when the temperature was rising or falling was taken to be the mean of lf\gt ; Prof. S. U. Pickering .
Determinations to test [ Dec. 11 , that at the initial and final temperatures ; it was generally very small , since the temperature of the air was kept at a point such that there was heating at the initial temperature , and cooling at the final temperature , or vice versa .
The time occupied in obtaining almost identical temperatures in the bottle and calorimeter varied between two and twenty minutes , the whole determinations , including the interval allowed for determining the two rates of cooling , occupying fifteen to forty-five minutes .
Such a duration militates very much against the accuracy of the results .
The calorimetric thermometer read by estimation ( 0'05 mm. ) to 0''0005 ; the stirring apparatus and other appliances were the same as those described elsewhere ( ' Chem. Soc. Trans. , ' 1887 , p. 293 ) .
The water equivalent of the platinum bottle and its thermometer was ascertained by direct experiment to be 2'223 grams .
The last mentioned thermometer possessed a range of 30 ' , one estimation figure being equivalent to 0''01 , and , as the rise or fall measured sometimes exceeded 30 ' , it was in such cases set so as to register the initial temperatures of the bottle , the final temperature of this being taken to be the same as that of the calorimetric water , previous determinations having shown that the two temperatures were identical within the reading error of the instruments when this rate of cooling became constant .
The temperature of the calorimeter was generally about 18 ' .
The determinations were all made in duplicate .
The mean error of a single observation was found to be about 0'8 per cent , of the total rise or fall measured ; this corresponds to an error of 0''0075 in the alteration of temperature registered in the calorimeter , or 0''22 in that registered in the bottle ; considering the long duration of the determinations and the magnitude of the total correction for cooling which had to be applied , such an error must , I think , be regarded as small .
In many cases the error in the heat capacity found is the same as that in the rise or fall measured , 0'8 per cent. , of its value , or , on the average , 0'0032 of the heat capacity per gram ; in other cases it is much greater , for the heat evolved sometimes included the heat of fusion , and , after subtracting this , the whole error remained concentrated in the smaller quantity , which represented the heat capacity .
In some cases , again , the heat capacity for a given interval had to be found by taking the difference between two different determinations , and in such cases the error was greater .

Such results as apply to ranges of temperature partially embraced in other determinations are enclosed in square brackets , and are used for deducing those values opposite to which no experimental data appear .
The two values given for the heat capacity at 0r ( the freezing point of the substance ) are those which would be deduced from the determinations at the two higher and two lower temperatures respectively .
Where the determinations include the heat of fusion the differences between the individual experiments ( not the means ) are used in calculating the heat capacity ; those determinations are divided into two series , A and B ( see Table II ) , each of which is differentiated separately ( Table II continued ) , and the means of these two series of values taken ; then the experiments A and B are taken together alternately , and the two other series thus obtained give another series of mean results , the mean of these two means being finally taken .
The heat of fusion was determined from those experiments in which the initial temperature was nearest to the temperature of fusion .
The general results are collected in Table A , where those in the first five lines give the values for 1 gram of substance , and those in the second five the values for a gram-molecular proportion of it .
Details .
Before discussing the general results , the following details may be noticed:\#151 ; Sulphuric Acid.\#151 ; The value found for the liquid at 19''53 seems to be rather too high , and this makes the value deduced for 26''74 too high , and that for 41''25 too low .
The value for 0 ' has here been deduced diagrammatically , the probable error ( Table A ) being determined from the errors of the duplicate determinations .
Both the values for the solid at the initial temperature of \#151 ; 16'-8 appeared somewhat anomalous , and they were consequently omitted in the calculations .
In taking the mean value for r = 0 ' , a double weight has been assigned to the value deduced from the determinations at the two higher temperatures .
The probable error ( given in Table A ) in this , and most other cases , has been deduced in the ordinary way from those two values .
The heat capacities of neither the solid nor the liquid show any signs of an abnormal increase as we approach the melting point .

The heat of fusion was determined by placing the bottle with the superfused liquid in the calorimeter til ] the temperature of the latter had been attained , raising the stopper of the bottle , and inserting a minute crystal of the solid salt ; crystallisation then took place at the temperature of the calorimeter , 25 below the normal freezing point , and its value at this latter was calculated by adding to the observed value 25(C\#151 ; c ) cal .
, C c being 0"1481 at an average temperature of \#151 ; 12'"5 .
This method , where practicable , is more accurate than that usually adopted .

'The results here obtained are compared in Table B with those given by other observers .
Except where it is stated otherwise , they refer to the temperatures at which the substances melt under normal conditions .
The concordance exhibited by this table is in most cases fairly good , though Berthelot 's values for the heat of fusion of sulphuric acid and its monohydrate seem wholly inexplicable .

Prom Table A ( p. 18 ) it will be seen that the heat capacity of solid benzene is greater than that of the liquid , so that 0\#151 ; c becomes a negaJ tive quantity .
This is somewhat remarkable , for in other known in.f stances , such as that of beeswax , where fusion is a gradual process , and the heat capacity of the solid becomes abnormally great as the me 1 tingj point is reached , this abnormality makes itself evident in the augmenting rate at which the increase occurs , whereas with benzene no such abnormal increase is noticed , although the determinations extend as[ far as 36 ' below the melting point : the only sign of anything ] unusual is that the rate of increase is considerably greater than that ] in the other cases investigated .

He gives the fusing point as \#151 ; -7'*32 , the heat of fusion as 16*185 , and sufficient data to calculate the heat capacity of the liquid as O1C05 + 0*00028^ , but for that of the solid his data are insufficient ; they may be taken as indicating , though very doubtfully , 0*1038 + 0*00047\#163 ; , a value which gives C \#151 ; c negative ; or , if we take the mean of them , we get 0*0843 as the heat capacity at \#151 ; 48'*96 C. , a value which gives \#151 ; 992 ' for the temperatnre of no crystallisation : as the heat capacity at the temperature of fusion must be greater than at \#151 ; 48'*96 , we may safely say that a temperature lower than \#151 ; 992 ' is indicated as that of no crystallisation .

The probable error of my own results was calculated by taking half that which would be caused by taking such of the extreme values for C , c , and l given in Tables I to X as would affect the result in the same direction .
