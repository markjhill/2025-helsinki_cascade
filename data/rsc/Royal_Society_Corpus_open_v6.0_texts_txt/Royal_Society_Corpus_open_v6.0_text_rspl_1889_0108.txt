not such close approximations to orifices in truly thin plates as to warrant the acceptance of this result without apparatus of more elaborate construction .
Moreover , there is a possibility of slight leak in the grooves of the shutters , which ought not to be disregarded .
The observations are , however , sufficient to show that a properly constructed apparatus is capable of making measurements of the effective areas of orifices with a very considerable degree of precision .
It is well known that if the orifice be not an aperture in a thin plate , but in the form of a tube , straight or bent , the flow through the orifice can be represented by an equation of the same form as if the orifice were a thin plate aperture , viz.:\#151 ; H = RV3 , but in the case of a more complicated orifice R cannot be so easily calculated from the dimensions ; the value of R might , however , be determined experimentally for an orifice of any shape and dimensions by a pneumatic bridge of suitable size , and the result might be expressed , as M. Murgue suggests for the case of mines in the work already referred to , by stating the area of the thin plate orifice to which the given orifice is equivalent .
The comparison of calculated values of R with observed values obtained by a pneumatic bridge would enable us to determine a number of pneumatic constants that are at present only comparatively roughly ascertained , such , for instance , as the coefficient of air friction in tubes of different diameters , the constants of different forms of orifice , the effect of bends and elbows in pipes , and of gauze or gratings covering an orifice .
And it would not , I think , be difficult to arrange the apparatus in such a way as to determine the law of resistance of a disc to the passage of air and its variation with velocity .
The velocity can be increased to any extent that may be necessary by using a centrifugal fan to produce the head instead of the gas burner .
I am intending , if possible , to have my present apparatus altered in some of its details , so that the orifices may be more definitely expressed in terms of thin plate apertures , and then to use it for the determination of some of the pneumatic constants I have referred to .

" On the Effect of Tension upon Magnetic Changes of Length in Wires of Iron , Nickel , and Cobalt .
" By Shelford Bidwell , M.A. , F.R.S. Received April 8 , 1890 .
Preliminary .
A former communication to the Royal Society ( \#163 ; Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' No. 243 , 1886 , p. 257 ) contains an account of some experiments relating to the magnetic extensions and contractions of iron wires 470 Mr. S. Bidwell .
On Effect of Tension [ Apr. 24 , under tension .
Wires of several different sizes and qualities were suspended inside a magnetising coil , and were loaded with various weights ; and in each case observations were made of ( 1 ) the smallest magnetising current which caused sensible change of length ; ( 2 ) the current producing maximum elongation ( if any ) and the value of such elongation ; ( 3 ) the critical current which was without effect upon the length of the wire ; and ( 4 ) the contraction produced by a certain strong current .
The results indicated that the maximum elongation became smaller as the load was increased , disappearing altogether when the tension exceeded a certain limit ; and that contraction began to take place at a correspondingly earlier stage in the magnetisation .
These results were chiefly of interest as disproving Joule 's conjecture , which has often been quoted as if it were an experimental fact , that , under certain critical tension ( differing for different specimens of iron , but independent of the magnetising force* ) , magnetisation would produce no change whatever in the length of the wire .
The subject , however , seemed worthy of more complete investigation , and I have lately undertaken a series of experiments in which the changes of length undergone by a stretched iron wire were traced continuously as the magnetising force was gradually increased from a small value up to about 375 C.G.S. units .
Similar experiments were also made with a nickel wire and with a thin strip of cobalt , the behaviour of these metals under tension never having been previously studied .
Apparatus .
The apparatus employed was the one described and figured in my former paper .
The diagram there given , together with a short description , is , for convenience , here reproduced ( see fig. 1 ) .
Experiments .
For reasons which need not be repeated here , it was found necessary to support the magnetising coil in the manner shown in the figure , its whole weight being borne by the experimental wire .
The minimum load on the wire was therefore represented by the weight of the coil , together with the pull of the lever , the two amounting to 136 kilo .
Greater tension was produced by attaching weights to the hook H. The iron used was a piece of soft annealed wire , 0 7 mm. m diameter and 10 cm .
in length , between the clamps .
The weights * At least within the limits of the forces employed by Joule , estimated to range from 7 to 114 C.G-.S .
units .

Fig- .

The magnetising coil , CC , is supported by a stopper , A , which is inserted into the bottom of the coil .
Through an axial hole in A is screwed a brass rod , terminating in a stirrup , S , beneath which is fixed a hook , H , for the suspension of weights .
A second brass rod , suspended by a pin at P , passes freely through a stopper , B. The wire under experiment , X , is clamped between the ends of the brass rods .
The knife-edge at the bottom of the stirrup acts upon a brass lever , R , one edge of which turns upon the knife-edge D , the other actuating a short arm , E , attached perpendicularly to the back of the mirror M. The mirror turns upon knife-edges about its horizontal diameter .
By means of a lantern the image of a fine wire is , after reflection from the mirror , projected upon a distant vertical scale and serves as an index .
Dimensions:\#151 ; SD = 10 mm. , DE = 170 mm. , ME = 7 mm. , distance from mirror to scale = 4706 mm. , each scale division = 0*64 mm. , length of X = 100 mm. successively attached to it were equivalent to 1950 , 1600 , 1170 , 819 , 585 , and 351 kilos , per square cm .
of section .
The nickel wire was 100 mm. long , and 0'65 mm. in diameter ; it was supplied by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey .
The loads under which it was examined were 2310 , 1890 , 1400 , 980 , 700 , and 420 kilos , per sq .

On th Effect of Tension [ Apr. 24 , The cobalt used was a narrow strip measuring 100 mm. by 2'6 mm. by 07 mm. ; its cross section being , therefore , 1*82 sq .
mm. It was not possible to obtain this metal in the form of a wire ; and for the piece of thin rolled sheet from which the strip above-described was formed , I am indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Henry Wiggin and Co. , of Birmingham , who had it specially prepared for me .
The loads employed for the cobalt strip were equivalent to 772 , 344 , and 75 kilos , per sq .
cm .
The first of these was represented by an actual weight of 31 lbs. , * which was as great as the apparatus seemed capable of bearing without risk of injury .
In all the experiments the loads were successively applied in decreasing order of magnitude , and before every single observation the wire or strip was demagnetised by reversals , without , of course , being removed from the coil.f The results obtained for iron are given in Table I , and also shown in the curves in fig. 2 .
Those for riickel are given in Tables II and III , and in figs. 3 and 4 .
In fig. 3 the curve for 700 kilos , is represented by a dotted line for the sake of distinctness .
Table III and fig. 4 are constructed from data obtained from a complete set of curves , like those in fig. 3 ; they show the magnetic contractions that would occur under increasing loads in constant magnetic fields of 125 , 185 , and 360 C.G.S. units respectively .
These magnetic contractions would , of course , be superposed upon elongations of a purely mechanical nature , due to the tensional stress .
The results for cobalt are contained in Table IV and fig. 5 .
In the figure the contractions corresponding to the various loads are indicated by different kinds of marks , and a single curve has been drawn as smoothly as possible through the whole of them .
In all the tables and figures magnetic fields ( which are those due to the coil alone ) are given in C.G.S. units , and increments and decrements of length are expressed in ten-millionths of the length ( 10 cm .
, or about 4 inches ) of the experimental wire or strip .
In figs. 2 and 5 , therefore , the height of each little square corresponds to 1/ 10,000 mm. , or 1/ 250,000 inch , and in figs. 3 and 4 to 1/ 2,000 mm. or 1/ 50,000 inch .

39 '5 Discussion of the Tables and Curves .
Iron.\#151 ; The curves in fig. 2 clearly show the effect of tension in diminishing the maximum elongation and hastening the contraction .
With the two greatest loads used there was no preliminary elongation at all .
The curve for an unstretched iron rod is generally found to cut the axis at about 300 ; probably , therefore , if the wire used in these experiments could have been tested with no load , its curve would lie a little above that for the load of 351 kilos .
Nickel.\#151 ; The results for nickel are of great interest .
In fields below about 140 units increase of load is always accompanied by decrease of magnetic contraction , the earlier portions of the six curves in fig. 3 following one another in inverse order of the magnitude of the several loads .
But , although the initial slope of the curves diminishes with increasing loads , the " turning points , " where the ratio of the contraction to the magnetic field is a maximum , occur later with great than with small loads , so that in a field of 360 the order of the relative values of the contractions for the three smallest loads is actually reversed , the contraction being greatest with the heaviest load and least with the lightest .
It appears probable that , if the experiment had been carried far enough , the curve for 1400 kilos , would have crossed one if not all of the three curves lying below it .
Whether the tw o remaining curves for 1890 and 2310 kilos , would behave similarly is more doubtful .
Possibly they would have become parallel to the horizontal axis before the others were reached .
I think it may fairly be assumed that if the experiment could have been made with the wire quite unstretched , we should have obtained a curve having a steeper initial slope than any of those in the 478 Mr. S. Bidwell , On Effect of Tension [ Apr. 24 , diagram , but also reaching its turning point sooner , and tbere%e intersecting at least three or four of the others .
Such an assumption is confirmed by some results obtained with a nickel rod 0 3 cm .
in diameter , which have been given in a former communication , * and are reproduced in Table V , Table " V.\#151 ; Unstretched Nickel Rod , Contractions in Magnetic field ten-millionths in C.GLS .

233 343 ._____________ ... 240 A curve plotted from this table will be found to begin its descent between the curve for 420 kilos , and the vertical axis , and after crossing the others to intersect that for 1400 " kilos , at H \#151 ; 355 .
But of course experiments made with two different specimens of nickel are not striotly comparable .
In fig. 4 the results for nickel are presented in a somewhat different form , the curves showing"the magnetic contractions of the wire under various loads in certain constant ^fields .
The values for no load are taken from Table V , and the portions of the curves which depend upon the accuracy of these values are distinguished by dotted lines .
It will be-seen , however , that these portions are mot of much importance .
From these curves we at once see that in a field of 125 units , increase of load always causes decrease of magnetic contraction .
In a field of 185 , magnetic contraction increases as the load is raised from nothing up to about 700 -kilos , per square cm .
, 'again decreasing with greater loads .
And in a field of 360 units this singular reversal is exhibited in a still more marked degree , the maximum magnetic contraction occurring with a load of about 950- kilos , per square cm .
The reversal phenomena observed in connexion with - the magnetic contraction of nickel are Strikingly analogous to those which'occur in the magnetisation of a stretched iron wire , and which are1 commonly associated with the name of Villari.f * ' Phil. Trans. , * A , 1888 , p. 228 .

When an iron wire subject to a magnetising force in the direction of its length is stretched by a certain force , the magnetisation of the wire is increased or diminish according as the magnetising force is less , or greater than a .certain critical v ue 1890 .
] upon Magnetic Changes of Length Wii^es .
479 Professor .T .
J. Thomson has shown* that the Villari effect is dynamically connected with the changes of length undergone by an iron rod when magnetised , an iron rod being lengthened in a weak magnetic field and shortened in a strong one .
Now cobalt behaves oppositely to iron in this respect , a rod of cobalt becoming shorter in a weak field , longer in a strong one.f Professor Thomson , therefore , predicted that a Villari reversal would be found to occur in cobalt and that it would be of the opposite character to that in iron .
Some experiments made by Mr. Chree^ with a cobalt rod under pressure gave results in accordance with Professor Thomson 's expectation .
But no reversal of the effect of magnetisation in diminishing the length of an unstretched nickel rod has ever been observed .
Such a rod always becomes shorter in a magnetic field , w'hether strong or weak .
It appears to attain its shortest length in a field of about 750 units , but it does not.pass a minimum and become longer again in stronger fields , like cobalt .
Applying Professor Thomson 's reasoning , therefore , to.the case of nickel , we should expect that it w'ould be found not to exhibit , any Villari reversal , either of the nature of that in iron , or of that in cobalt .
Both Sir William Thomson and Professor Ewing have in fact looked for one and failed to find it .
But in a paper read at the meeting of the Physical Society , on 21st March , 1890 , S Mr. Herbert Tomlinson gave an account of some experiments which , as he believed , showed that a Villari critical point really existed in nickel , though it was only to be reached by the application of comparatively great magnetising forces .
If Mr. Tomlinson is right , 1 venture to suggest that his results may possibly be brought into harmony with Professor J. J. Thomson 's mathematics by consideration of the experiments described in the present paper : for , as I understand Professor Thomson 's argument , he has hitherto taken no account of the effects of mechanical stress upon magnetic changes of length .
Cobalt.\#151 ; The results for cobalt show that the changes ; , of length which this metal undergoes when magnetised are almost , if not entirely , unaffected by tensional stress , at least within the limits of the experiments .
Having regard to the very marked influence of tension upon iron and nickel , this cannot but be regarded as a most remarkable fact .
( depending upon the magnitude of the stretching force ) for which stretching produces no effect .

[ Apr. 24 , Summary of Results .
lron.\#151 ; Tension diminishes the magnetic elongation of iron , and -causes contraction to take place with a smaller magnetising force .
Nickel.\#151 ; In weak fields the magnetic contraction of nickel is diminished by tension .
In fields of more than 140 or 150 units , the magnetic contraction is increased by tensional stress up to a certain critical value , depending upon the strength of the field , and diminished by greater tension .
Cobalt.\#151 ; The magnetic contraction of cobalt is ( for magnetic fields up to 500 C.G.S. units and loads up to 72 kilos , per sq .
cm .
) practically unaffected by tension .

Received April 14 , 1890 .
Soon after I had completed the radio-micrometer and shown its great superiority over any form of thermopile and galvanometer , I was naturally anxious to carry out some research which would clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument .
The determination of the heating powers of the stars seemed most promising , for Dr. Huggins had , in 1869 , * made experiments on the heating powers of some of the stars which , though they did not conclusively show that a thermopile was capable of measuring so minute a radiation , yel made it exceedingly probable that the effects observed , if not very exact in quantity , were at any rate real .
Dr. Huggins , however , described his experiments and formed his conclusions with the utmost caution .
A year later Mr. Stone described experiments which he had made with the great equatorial at Greenwich.t He at first used small thermopiles , but soon found , as we should expect , that a single pair was more sensitive to radiation brought to a point than a pile of many pairs .
In attempting to obtain great sensibility by giving the galvanometer a long period he found it almost impossible to use the apparatus on stars at night .
Every slight change in the sky , even though quite invisible to the eye , so disturbed the galvanometer that it was impossible to distinguish effects due to the stars from those caused by the varying clearness of the sky .
Mr. Stone largely obviated this difficulty by placing in the focal plane of the object glass a couple of thermo-electric pairs so connected that a heating of the exposed face of one would produce an effect opposite * ' Roy .
