Page The following experimental research upon the pharmacological action of the venom of the common Krait ( Bungaruscceruleus ) , was performed in the Pharmacological Laboratory of the University of Edinburgh , and we are greatly indebted to Sir Thomas R. Fraser , not only for facilities in the performance of that work , hut also for the encouragement he has uniformly given us .
Previous examination of the action of this venom appears to be limited to the work recorded in the papers recently published by Captain Leonard Rogers , LM .
S.t He states that the symptoms following poisoning by this venom are identical with those following poisoning by Cobra venom , whereas our results , as shown below , seem to indicate that while these symptoms are similar , still they differ so much in relative degree as to render it doubtful if they can in future he spoken of as identical .

11.11.04 For the Krait venom used in the experiments we are greatly indebted to the Madras Government , who placed Dr. P. P. Pinto on special duty for the purpose of collecting venom .
We take this opportunity of expressing our thanks to this gentleman , for we are aware how difficult it is to obtain specimens of this poison .
The total amount available was 0*077 of a grm. , which was the venom furnished by expression from the dissected glands of two snakes .
This gives a total of 0*0385 of a grm. per snake and corresponds very closely with what one of us has found to be the ordinary yield of this species .
It is obviously much less than the average yield from a large Cobra .
Experiments were performed :\#151 ; ( 1 ) To determine the minimum lethal dose of the dried venom for frogs and small mammals\#151 ; rats and rabbits being chosen .
( 2 ) To determine the protective power of Calmette 's anti-venomous serum against Krait venom compared with its power of antagonising Cobra venom .
( 3 ) To determine whether any intravascular clotting or haemolysis occurred in the circulating blood , following a letbal dose .
( 4 ) To determine the action of the venom on the isolated vessels of the frog .
( 5 ) To determine the action of the venom on the isolated ventricle of the frog .
( 6 ) To ascertain generally the causes which influence the vital functions of mammals exposed to the action of the venom and which bring about death .

A point of special interest is the rise of the lower eyelids .
This is due to an elastic recoil of the lids when the depressor of the lower eyelids is paralysed .
The interest attached to this point lies in the fact that Cobra venom and another Colubrine venom produce the same symptom , while it is invariably absent in the course of Daboia poisoning .
We have therefore concluded that the minimum lethal dose of our specimen of dried Krait venom was , in the case of the frog , about 0*0005 grm. per kilo .
; in the case of the rat , 0*001 grm. per kilo .
, and in the case of the rabbit as low as 0*00008 grm. per kilo .
Our supply of the venom was too small to allow us to determine the lethality in other animals .
The relatively great lethal action of Krait venom for the rabbit as compared with the rat is remarkable and shows a great divergence from the relative lethality of Cobra venom for the same animals as determined by one of us , who found the M.L.D. of a specimen of Cobra venom for rats 0*0005 grm. per kilo .
, and for rabbits 0*0006 grm. per kilo .

) Calmette 's antivenomous serum therefore , in the amounts eflectual against Cobra venom , appears to be ineffectual against Krait venom .
The integrity of the endings of the phrenic , vagi and sciatic nerves was examined in the majority of animals which died , the various nerves being exposed just at death .
Induction stimuli were applied , and invariably there was noted definite diminution in the response to such stimuli\#151 ; fibrillary twitchings of the diaphragm , for example , occurring with a stimulus to the phrenics where in the noimal animal a complete contraction of that muscle would occur ; and the vagal stimulation required to stop the heart was almost invariably greater than that requiied in the case of normal animals , whilst in some even the maximal stimulus failed to do more than slow the heart .
In the case of rabbit No. 15 , which recovered , there was definite evidence of paralysis of the extremities .
This was at first more noticeable in the fore limbs , and the paralysis seemed to pass off in the same order , the hind limbs being the last to recover .
The comparative effect on skeletal muscle and nerve of the action of the venom was investigated on the frog 's gastrocnemius with the sciatic nerve attached .
The sensitiveness to stimulation by a Faradic current was ascertained in the case of the nerve and the muscle respectively , and the nerve was then placed m a fresh solution of the Krait venom dissolved in 0*65 per cent , tap-water saline where it remained for 22 hours , the muscle being carefully kept from contact with the poison and placed in normal saline .
The strength of the venom solution used was 1 : 10,000 .
At the end of 14 hours the excitability of the nerve was unimpaired and at the end of 22 hours was only very slightly impaired .
At the same time , with a similar nerve-muscle preparation , the muscle was placed 2 u 2 in the venom solution , and in 2 hours and 20 minutes it had become much less excitable , though the excitability of the nerve was unimpaired .
At the end of 3f hours no response could be elicited by stimulating the nerve , and it required strong direct stimulation of the muscle to cause any contraction .
After 5|- hours no contraction of any part of the muscle occurred with the strongest direct stimulation .
It will be observed therefore , that the muscle was gradually poisoned .
The ends of the nerve within the muscle appeared to have been poisoned before the muscle had lost its power to contract and before the nerve trunk was appreciably affected .
In order to define more nearly the loss of excitability of the nerve and muscle a similar experiment was performed with more frequent observations .
The same characteristics in the action were observed .
After 2 hours the excitability of the nerve was unimpaired , but during the next 20 minutes it diminished rapidly and was entirely lost .
The muscle had gradually become less responsive , and finally ceased to contract even on the strongest stimulation , 1 hour after the nerve ends had been poisoned and 3| hours after the muscle had been placed in the poison .
Immediately after death the muscle was found when tested by litmus paper to be acid in reaction.* Our previous conclusions are therefore confirmed .

ON THE ACTION OF THE VENOM OF BUNGARUS CCERULEUS .
The blood was examined in several cases immediately after death and in no case was any appearance of ante-mortem clotting found .
Blood dims from blood taken from the left side of the heart of ra ts immediately after death following a lethal dose of Krait venom showed , on examination of the red blood corpuscles , no evidence of haemolysis having occurred .
The corpuscles showed no abnormality , and serum separating spontaneously from blood in capillary tubes showed no haemoglobin staining .
The blood even from the left side of the heart was extremely venous in appearance .
Action on Blood Vessels .
One of us has shown that Cobra venom produces a marked constriction of the blood vessels of the frog when perfused through them in very dilute solution , the limit of this being reached at a strength of 1 : 10,000,000 .
It is of interest , therefore , to compare a similar action which we have found to be produced by Krait venom .
The brain and spinal cord of a frog having been carefully destroyed from half an hour to an hour before the beginning of the experiment , the thorax was opened and a cannula placed in one aorta ( the other being ligatured ) .
The venae cavae were cut and the cannula was attached by glass tubes to a series of Marriotte 's flasks , by which the level of the fluids to be perfused was maintained at a constant height of 17 centims. The normal calibre of the vessels was ascertained by causing 0'65 per cent , sodium chloride solution to flow through them for from 10\#151 ; 20 minutes until the flow was uniform , the outflow being collected in graduated measures and the amount noted every 60 seconds .
The venom dissolved in the same strength of saline solution was then perfused for from one hour to one hour and a-half .
.We had , unfortunately , too small a quantity of the venom to define the limits of its action with accuracy , but our experiments show that it produced an effect similar to that of Cobra venom but very much less in degree .
In the strength of 1 : 500,000 we were unable to find any certain evidence of constriction , but in the strength of 1 : 250,000 the flow diminished to \in 23 minutes and to J in 69 minutes .
There was no recovery when the normal saline was again perfused .
With a strength of 1 : 100,000 the flow diminished to \in 35 minutes , and with a strength of 1 : 50,000 the flow diminished to ^ in 38 minutes .
Perfusion of the Frog-ventricle Krait Venom .
This was carried out in a modification of Schafer 's plethysmograph .
Blood mixture was used for the normal , and as a vehicle for the venom .
It consisted of 1 part of ox blood diluted with two parts of Busch 's modification of Ringer 's fluid .
Rana esculent a was the animal used to provide the heart .
Experiment 1.\#151 ; A frog-ventricle was perfused with a solution of Krait venom of a strength of 1 : 10,000 .

Experiment 2.\#151 ; A frog-ventricle was perfused with a solution of Krait venom of a strength of 1:100,000 .
The tracing was continued for 52 minutes after the venom perfusion began .
The result was entirely negative .
One of us# has shown that Cobra venom acts powerfully on the frog-ventricle , killing it in systole , when used in strong solutions , and acting as a tonic and stimulant * * Captain R. H Elliot , " A Contribution to the Pharmacology of Cobra Venom ; " communicated to the Royal Society , January , 1904 ; abstract at ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' vol. 73 , p. 183 .
when the strength of the venom was weaker .
Thus a 1 : 100,000 solution of Cobra venom killed the frog-ventricle in 20 minutes , in a position of tight systole , whilst a 1 .
10,000,000 solution distinctly quickened the beat .
We have here a similar though far weaker action .
It would have been desirable to test the action of stronger solutions of the venom .
This we were prevented from doing by the smallness of our stock of venom .
Kymograpliic Experiments .
Experiment 1 .
A rabbit , weighing 3'75 kilos .
, was etherised ; blood pressure was taken by the carotid , and respiratory movement was registered by means of a double stethograph .
0-004 grm. of Krait venom was dissolved in 1 cub. centim. of Ringer 's fluid and injected into the left external jugular vein , the injection lasting 40 seconds .
The blood pressure before the injection registered 126 millims. of mercury ; 1 minute after injection it had fallen to 92 ; it then recovered steadily and stood at 116 millims. in the 5th minute after injection .
Meanwhile respiration had been getting slower and shallower , and practically ceased in the 8th minute .
An asphyxial rise of blood pressure then took place , a rise to 128 millims. being registered .
A drop in pressure followed , the level reaching 82 millims. in the 10th minute .
There was no evidence of cardiac inhibition on the blood-pressure tracing to explain the early fall , and it was only when asphyxiation was well marked that the heart-beat slowed .
Under artificial respiration the blood pressure rose , and attained its former high level .
When the artificial respiration was temporarily stopped , at intervals , a steep rise of pressure invariably occurred ; a resumption of artificial respiration brought the pressure back to its former level again at once .
Slowly and steadily the pressure fell , though the heart-beat remained comparatively rapid .
After 1 hour 20 minutes of artificial respiration the experiment was stopped .
In the meantime the stoppage at intervals of the artificial respiration had clearly shown that no respiratory effort whatever was being made by the animal .
Whilst it was still under the anaesthetic the chest was opened and the phrenic , vagal , and sciatic nerves were tested with the secondary current .
Neither the phrenic nor sciatic nerves responded to even maximal stimuli by so much as the production of a muscular twitch .
Maximal stimulation of the vagi slowed , but did not stop the heart .
Since the M.L.D. of Krait venom for rabbits is 0-00008 grm. per kilo .
, this animal received over thirteen times the subcutaneous M.L.D. intravenously .
Experiment 2.\#151 ; A dog , weighing 9 kilos .
, received an intravenous injection of 0-005 grm. of Krait venom dissolved in 5 cub. centims. of Ringer 's fluid .
The tracings in order from above are : ( 1 ) Intestinal volume recorded by a plethysmograph ( Schafer 's ) ; ( 2 ) blood pressure taken in the carotid ; ( 3 ) respirations recorded by a double stethograph ; ( 4 ) 10 seconds time-marks ; ( 5 ) signal .
The injection was made by the left external jugular , and took 72 seconds .
There was an immediate fall of blood pressure , accompanied at first by a fall and later by a distinct rise in intestinal volume .
There is no slowing of the beat , so we apparently have not got cardiac inhibition to deal with .
The rise in intestinal volume will explain the fall in general blood pressure , if we may suppose that the first fall in intestinal volume ( a matter of 20 seconds only ) was due to a dilatation in another portion of the splanchnic area which had not yet reached the loop of gut under observation .
Another possible explanation will be given presently .
An extract from this portion of the tracing is here shown .
The presence of Traube-Hering curves in the blood-pressure tracing supports the view that we have to do with a central vaso-motor dilatation .
This dilatation continued throughout the experiment , and was increased when a second injection of 0 005 grm. of the venom was given 30 minutes after the first injection .
In spite of this the general blood pressure remained high throughout the experiment .
This is apparently to be explained by the direct constriction of the systemic arterioles by the circulating venom .
We have already dealt with this action .
Extracts from the tracing are given on pp. 337 and 338 .
The accompanying table gives a short analysis of the tracing .
Respiration was first excited and then gradually paralysed , just as occurs in Cobra poisoning .
The experiment was stopped after 55 minutes , and the nerve-ends were tested by the secondary coil .
The phrenics responded with the coil at 300 millims. from the primary coil , the sciatics at 280 millims. , and vagal inhibition was got at 120 millims. The two first were , therefore , distinctly blunted in sensitivity ; in the last this is doubtful:\#151 ; Time in minutes .

There was a speedy fall of blood pressure .
Slightly preceding .
this there was a rise in the plethysmographic lever denoting a rise in intestinal volume ; then followed a passive fall of intestinal volume , and immediately afterwards a great rise thereof .
This rise in intestinal volume continued during the 17 minutes the tracing was taken , but the blood pressure recovered in spite of it .

Experiment 6.\#151 ; A cat , weighing 2"2 kilos .
, was etherised ; blood pressure was taken in a carotid artery ; the chest was opened and the movements of the auricle and ventricle were recorded by means of levers attached to their walls by silk threads ; artificial respiration was maintained throughout ; the injection was made through an external jugular vein , time was registered in 10 seconds .
After obtaining a normal , 0-002 grm. of Krait venom was injected , in 1 cub. centim. of Ringer 's fluid ; the injection took 18 seconds .
There was an immediate fall of blood pressure , and at the same time there was clear evidence of a weakening of the auricular beat , accompanied by some slowing of the heart .
The ventricle did not appear to be affected .
The force of the auricular beat recovered rapidly , was normal in the fifth minute , and during the next 4 minutes was decidedly in excess of what it had been before the injection .

ON THE ACTION OF THE VENOM OF BUNGARUS CCERULEUS .
^44 MAJOR R. H. ELLIOT , MR. W. C. SILL A R , AND MR. G. S. CARMICHAEL .
Summary of We are now in a position to consider the very diverse influences which act upon the blood pressure in Krait poisoning , and we find a very different state of affairs from that which holds in Cobraism .
( 1 ) The heart-muscle , or its nerve-end mechanism , is acted on directly by Krait venom .
This action is strictly comparable to that of Cobra venom , but is much less strong .
The tracings , taken with the mammalian heart exposed and with levers attached to the auricular and ventricular walls , show , however , that an important increase of cardiac force is in this way brought about .
A decided increase of heart rate was also observed in several tracings .
( 2 ) There are indications of a feeble cardio-inhibitory action .
This supervenes so rapidly , when it is seen at all , that it must almost certainly be of central origin .
The action of this venom is thus again brought into line with that of Cobra poison , and is much more feeble than that of the latter in this particular phase of its activity .
So much so indeed , that the inibition is quickly and easily masked by the direct effect of the venom on the heart , the latter action is manifested more slowly .
It is probable that inhibition of the heart is responsible for the early fall in blood pressure , which is sometimes noticed before the plethysmographic lever has recorded any change in intestinal volume .
The slight extent of the inhibition , even when it is observed , may be judged from the fact that it is only the auricle which shows the change , the ventricle curve not being perceptibly affected in our tracings .
Moreover slowing of the heart was never well marked and was often absent .
( 3 ) The direct action of the venom on the arterial muscle , or on its nerve-end mechanism is , as we have shown above , such as to produce vaso-motor constriction .
This effect can be clearly got with solutions of 1 : 250,000 and below , but we failed to get it at 1 : 500,000 .
It is therefore much weaker than the corresponding action of Cobra venom , which can he demonstrated in a solution of 1 : 10,000,000 .
( 4 ) The injection of Krait venom is followed by a very'early and decided fall of blood pressure .
This fall has been shown to be mainly due to a dilatation of the vessels of the splanchnic area , and is almost certainly central in origin .
It is obvious that the direct tonic effect of Krait venom on the heart and vessels tends to raise the general blood pressure .
On the other hand , the slight cardio-inhibition and the powerful action on the central vaso-motor ( leading to dilatation of the splanchnic area vessels ) , are responsible for the marked early fall so constantly met with .
The two latter forces come into action before their opponents have time to manifest themselves .
There is yet another factor to be taken into account , viz. , the influence of the poison on the respiratory mechanism .
We regard this as the most important element in the whole case .
ON THE ACTION OF THE VENOM OF BUNGARUS CtERULEUS .
Our experiments have shown that death in Krait poisoning is due to failure of the respiratory mechanism and , moreover , that when this failure occurs , the phrenic and other motor nerve-ends are still active , though their sensitivity is always more or less impaired , and often very decidedly so .
We , therefore , conclude that the interference with respiration , which culminates in the death of the subject , is due to a direct action of the venom on the respiratory centre .
This view is borne out by the rapidity with which respiration is often affected in these experiments .
The limited quantity of poison at our disposal prevented us from pushing this question farther , as we would like to have done .
We hope at a later date to apply Krait venom directly to the exposed medulla oblongata with a view to ascertain whether the centre can l e directly poisoned in this way without the nerve-ends being at all affected .
One of us has shown that such is the case with Cobra venom .
We are , however , distinctly of the opinion that the blunting of nerve-end sensibility , which we have observed , is sufficient to add materially to the embarrassment of an already damaged respiratory centre .
Respiratory failure , slowly developed , brings in its train all the phenomena of slow asphyxiation .
The circulation of venous blood through the medulla oblongata tends to slow the heart by acting on the vagal cardio-inhibitory centre .
It must also stimulate the vaso-motor centre , and so tend to cause arteriolar constriction , and a consequent rise in blood pressure .
These two latter forces will , of course , act in opposition to each other , whilst both are superadded to those which we have already discussed .
It is , therefore , very evident that the problems which lie hidden in a blood-pressure tracing taken from a Krait poisoned animal are very complex .
The main features are , however , obvious enough .
The early fall of pressure is due to a central vaso-moter action on the splanchnic area , assisted and sometimes probably preceded by a small measure of cardio-inhibition of central origin .
The recovery of pressure which follows is attributable ( 1 ) to an increase in cardiac force brought about by the direct action of the venom on the heart , and ( 2 ) to the direct constrictive action of the venom on the vessel walls .
Later , as respiration progressively fails , the asphyxiation of the medulla oblongata is thrown into the scale in favour of vaso-constriction .
Nevertheless , the direct action of the venom on the vaso-motor centre is so powerful that one never sees the sustained high levels and the final great rises of blood pressure which are a common feature of a tracing in Cobra poison experiments .
