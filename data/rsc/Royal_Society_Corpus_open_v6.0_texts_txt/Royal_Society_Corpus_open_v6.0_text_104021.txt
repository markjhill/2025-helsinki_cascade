IV .
An Experiment to show that some Damps in Mines may be occasioned only by the burning of Candles under Ground , without the Addition of any noxious Vapour , even when the Bottom of the Pit has a Communication with the outward Air , unless the Outward Air be forcibly driven in at the said Communication or Pipe .
By the Reverend J. T. Desaguliers , LLD .
F. R. S. EXPERIMENT I. IN a Cylindric Glass-Receiver , open at both Ends , whose lower End is plunged in Water , and upper End covered with a Plate with an Hole of near an Inch Bore , a Candle of Six in the Pound will not burn quite the Time of one Minute before it goes out .
EXPERIMENT II .
A Candle will burn almost as long when the Receiver is quite covered .
EXPERIMENT III .
The Receiver having the Hole of the Plate open , and a Pipe at Bottom communicating with the external ternal Air , will burn but a little longer than in the first Experiment ; and if you blow in at the Pipe with your Mouth , it will go out rather sooner .
EXPERIMENT IV .
Blow in at the Pipe with Bellows , and the Candle will burn as long as you will .
