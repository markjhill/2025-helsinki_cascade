[ Apr. 26 , is , of course , the possibility that the other fibres , which have been followed all along the cord to the last abdominal ganglion , also send branches through the nerve roots of this ganglion and serve a similar purpose .
The presence of collateral branches upon them seems to me to be opposed to this view .
The problems , however , suggested by the foregoing remarks can only be finally solved by means of physiological research .
My observations were made in the laboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth , with the assistance of a grant made by the Government Grant Committee .
I hope shortly to publish a more detailed account with fuller illustrations .
V. " The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses .
" By Veterinary-Captain F. Smith , F.R.C.V.S. , F.I.C. , Army Veterinary Department .
Communicated by Professor McKendrick , F.R.S. Received March 7 , 1894 .
The eyes of the horse are of great physiological interest , for there are certain features in connection with them not found in other animals .
While equine vision is principally monocular , it is quite undoubted that the horse can see objects situated to the right and left of his body at one and the same time ; it is also equally certain that by directing both eyes forward , and producing a powerful internal squint , vision may be rendered binocular for objects situated directly to the front .
The corresponding points in the retina of the human eye , do not hold good in the case of animals which have their eyes situated laterally in the head and at some distance apart .
The pupil of the horse is a horizontal slit , which in full sunlight becomes so contracted that , with the presence of the corpora nigra , it is difficult to understand how sufficient light finds its way to the retina .
A monocular retinal image in full sunlight must be a broken or imperfect one , for , filling up the centre of the horizontal pupil , are some large , black , soot-like bodies , the corpora nigra just referred to .
These are attached principally to the superior pupillary margin of the iris , and completely block out the centre of the pupil when the latter is closely contracted .
The horse is , I believe , the only animal possessing corpora nigra , and the function of these bodies is quite obscure .
It is essential that the horizontal pupil should always be kept horizontally placed , no matter what position the head may occupy ; every upward and downward movement of the head necessitates a rotation of the eyeballs to ensure the pupils remaining horizontal , 1894 .
] The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses .
415 and this rotation is produced by the oblique muscles of the eye .
As the horse can move its head vertically through an angle of about 90 ' , ( the pupil all this time remaining horizontal ) it can be seen how important is the function of these oblique muscles .
Though in direct sunlight the pupil closely contracts , yet in ordinary artificial light it dilates .
This phenomenon can be turned to practical advantage in an ophthalmoscopic examination .
Further , I have found that if daylight be thrown into the eye by means of a mirror the iris does not , as a rule , contract ; this may be proved by placing a horse in a stable and excluding daylight from all but one source , and utilising that source to illuminate the eye by means of a mirror ; a complete examination of the fundus can now be made , , owing to the dilatation or , at any rate , non-contraction of the pupil .
For the last two years I have used no artificial light in my ophthalmoscopic work , and in the enquiry I am about to detail the whole was carried out in broad daylight .
I have met with cases where the pupil has contracted on throwing a beam of daylight into the eye ; such do not amount to more than 6 per cent , or 8 per cent , of the eyes examined .
Horses no doubt possess the power of accommodation , but I have never been able to satisfy myself that the instillation of atropine paralyses this power as it does in man ; in fact , I think I can go so far as to say that in many cases no action is produced by this drug-on .
the ciliary muscle , though the pupil be widely dilated .
In a small proportion of cases I believe I have been able to observe some defect in accommodation under atropine .
My attention to this point was especially directed by a remark made by Messrs. Lang and Barrett* to the effect that a cat , the pupils of which they had thoroughly dilated with atropine , had no difficulty in pursuing and catching a mouse .
Though it is difficult to apply such a satisfactory test to the horse , yet I have adopted measures which should , undoubtedly , have demonstrated any paralysis of accommodation had such existed .
The physiological pecularities of the horse 's eye , which I have ventured briefly to draw attention to , induced me to examine the nature of the refraction , especially as a knowledge of it was calculated to be of practical importance and utility .
Disorders of vision are vex-y common amongst horses ; the most careful examination of such eyes often fails to reveal any pathological condition , but I think it will be possible to show that the natm-e of their refraction is calculated to throw light on an obscure condition .
We must accept it as practically correct that disordei-s of vision in * " The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Mammalia , " by W. Lang , F.R.C.S. , and \lt ; T. W. Barrett , M.B. , ' Royal London- Ophthalmic Hospital Reports , ' vol. 11 , Part II .

[ Apr. 26 , horses commonly exhibit themselves by " shying , " a vice which may be attended by considerable danger .
I shall hope to show that there is now a reasonable prospect of determining the canse of " shying " in the absence of pathological changes in the eye ; further , that in that important branch of the veterinary art\#151 ; the examination of horses for soundness\#151 ; it should be possible to detect the kind of eye against which an intending purchaser should obtain a special warranty ; and , lastly , as it is possible not only to determine the nature of the refraction , but also the amount of error which exists , we shall be able\#151 ; when the needful public prejudice is overcome\#151 ; to prescribe glasses for horses with every reasonable prospect of improving their vision .
This is not the first time the refraction of the horse 's eye has been examined .
Professor Berlin , of Stuttgart , published two papers on the subject , * of these I have only been able to consult the second one .
About the same time J. Hirschberg published his observations on the refraction of horses ' eyes.f In this country Messrs. Lang and Barrett , to whose paper I have already alluded , published an account of the refraction of the eyes of animals , including the horse .
It is from their paper that I obtained two of the above references .
These observers obtained results which I have not been able to verify , and I think the reason of this admits of easy explanation:\#151 ; In the case of Berlin the refraction was obtained by a direct examination of the fundus of the eye with the ophthalmoscope , a procedure the result of which appears to depend very largely on the refraction of the examiner , and his capacity for relaxing his accommodation .
In Lang and Barrett 's excellent work the refraction was measured by means of " retinoscopy .
" They devoted their attention to the eyes of mammalia generally , but the number of horses tested by them was too small to admit of any general deductions being drawn .
According to Berlin , the majority of horses are slightly hypermetropic ; he only met with eight cases of myopia in as many years .
The amount of hypermetropia , according to this observer , is small , as a rule , lying between 1 D and 2 D. The largest amount found by him was 2'25 D. * " Refraction und Refractions-Anomalien von Thieraugen , " ' Tagblatt der 52 Versammlung Deutscher Naturforscher und Aertze in Baden-Baden/ p. 317 .

Character of the 417 Of myopia , Berlin found in one case as much as 3 D , and in another , 275 D. Hirschberg , adopting the same method of enquiry as Berlin , viz. , direct examination of the fundus with the ophthalmoscope , found a considerable amount of astigmatism in the eyes of horses .
Lang and Barrett , in the six eyes they examined , found one was emmetropic , three hypermetropic and astigmatic , and two had slight mixed astigmatism .
The astigmatism only once equalled 1 D. and the horizontal was always the least curved meridian .
In the enquiry I am recording , the number of horses examined was 54 ; these 54 horses , from one cause or another , furnished me with 100 eyes .
Of the 54 animals , 31 were mares and 23 were geldings ; their ages varied from 4 years to 16 years ; the largest number of horses of one age ( 5 years ) was 13 , 7 horses were 6 years old ; 7 horses 7 years , 6 horses 8 years ; the remaining numbers for each age varied from 1 to 4 .
Before recording the results of this enquiry , I think it necessary to describe the method by which retinoscopy is carried out on the 'horse .
It has been shown by Messrs. Morton and Barrett* thac the results of retinoscopy are liable to considerable error unless practised at the right portion of the fundus .
The observations made by these and other observers ' !
are of the greatest value , for they have drawn attention to the difference in the reflex obtained in the human subject at the yellow spot and at the optic disc , and have settled that retinoscopy is only reliable when practised at the visual axis of the eye .
In the horse I found very early in the enquiry , that confusing and conflicting results might be obtained with the same eye when retinoscopy was practised at different parts of the fundus , for the reflex given at the optical axis wTas not the same as that obtained when the fundus was looked at obliquely .
We have no knowledge whether the optical axis and visual axis of the horse are identical\#151 ; for the purpose of this enquiry it has been assumed that they are .
The horse has no yellow spot , so that a valuable guide is lost in determining the position on the fundus at which to judge the reflex ; on the other hand , the error of taking the reflex at the disc is not likely to occur , owing to the difficulty of seeing the disc with the head in the ordinary position .

[ Apr. 26 , The area of the most acute vision in the horse is probably the " tapetum , " and that portion of the tapetum which lies in the optical axis of the eye is the part where all the observations contained in this paper have been made .
The horse to be examined is brought into an ordinary stable , and any windows likely to be reflected in the cornea are covered up .
The observer stands facing the source of daylight , the eye to be examined being in shadow ; standing opposite to the centre of the pupil ( and looking at it in such a direction that a line passing through the eye would come out well below the base of the opposite ear ) , the light is reflected on to the retina at a minimum distance of 4 feet .
A brilliant yellow reflex is obtained from the tapetum , by means of which we can readily fix our position relative to the pupil .
No means of restraint are employed , and though for a minute or two the horse works the eye under examination to and fro , thereby alternately altering the reflex , yet it soon comes to a standstill as he gets used to the reflection from the mirror .
The observer , by practice , automatically regulates his position , so as always to be opposite the centre of the longitudinal pupil , and to ensure that during any change he may make in his position he does not come nearer to the eye than the prescribed distance , a 4-foot gauge is lying on the floor at his feet , in the direction of the horse 's head .
The reflex is taken in the horizontal and vertical meridians of the eye ; it is very seldom that any difficulty is experienced in determining the direction in which the shadow is travelling ; the real difficulty is in determining between two opposite shadows given consecutively in the same oye and in the same meridian .
I think this latter phenomenon is caused by the horse using its ciliary muscle ; with patience the true reflex of the resting eye will be obtained .
Having determined the direction of the shadows in both meridians , a trial lens is now placed in a frame and held in front of the eye under examination .
The glass is brought quite close to the cornea , the centre of the lens corresponding to the centre of the cornea ; the observer , standing at a minimum distance of 4 feet , throws the light into the eye and determines the reflex through the lens .
As we approach the lens which corrects the ametropia , some difficulty may be experienced in determining the direction taken by the shadow ; sometimes it neither passes " with " nor " against the mirror , but dies away from the circumference , producing an appearance resembling a dissolving view .
In human practice this characteristic reflex , I believe , is considered to be due to astigmatism .
No part of the above examination is made under atropine ; as previously explained , the pupil as a rule dilates sufficiently for a complete examination of the fundus to be made , and , so far as 1894 .
] The Refractive Character of the Eyes of Horses .
419 paralysis of accommodation is concerned , little , if any , is produced even by repeated instillations of this drug .
My results have been calculated according to the rule given by Morton : For hypermetropia deduct +1 D from the weakest convex lens which causes the shadow to move with the mirror ; for myopia deduct +1 D from the strongest concave lens with which the shadow continues to move with the mirror .
The following table ( p. 420 ) exhibits the results of the enquiry .

The amount of error shown in these different refractions is small , so much so that many eyes might be regarded as emmetropic .
In only about 33 per cent , of the myopic eyes did the amount of error exceed 1 D. The number of astigmatic horses is remarkable , viz. , 74 per cent. , but we cannot agree with Hirschberg that the amount found is " intense .
" Of 59 astigmatic eyes only in nine did the error exceed The following horses in my table gave a history of " shying , " viz. , Nos. 9 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 32 , 42 , 48 , and 54 ; from this list I have excluded three doubtful cases , but it must not be supposed that all the above horses " shied " so badly as to constitute a vice ; nor Prof. W. C. Williamson .
Correction of an [ Apr. 26 , must I be understood to say that all shying is due to defective eyesight ; further , it is possible for defective vision to be present without shying occurring , notably in Case 23 and several others .
Berlin considered the majority of horses to be hypermetropic ; I have only met with one case of very low hypermetropia out of 100 eyes .
Conclusion .
1 .
The chief visual defect in horses is myopia with or without astigmatism .
2 .
The amount of error is not great .

" Correction of an Error of Observation in Part XIX of the Author 's Memoirs on the Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal Measures .
" By W. C. Williamson , LL. D. , F.R.S. Received March 28 , 1894 .
During the past two or three years we have acquired a much more accurate knowledge than we previously possessed of the structure of the leaves of the Lepidodendroid plants of the Coal Measures ; and my last memoir , published in vol. 184 ( 1893 ) of the Philosophical Transactions , contains some new and not unimportant details on this subject .
These facts were obtained from some finely preserved specimens of Lepidodendron Harcourti and of a Lepidophloios recently added to my cabinet .
But the value of these observations was seriously vitiated by an apparently small but very fundamental error into which I had fallen , an error which cannot be left uncorrected without misleading some of the palaeontologists who honour me by consulting my writings on these subjects .
The students of fossil botany have long distinguished the leaves of the Lepidodendron from those of the Genus Lepidophloios by the shape of the leaf-scar left on the pulvinus or leaf-cushion on the fall of the deciduous leaf .
These scars are always more or less quadrilateral in form , two of their angles following in opposite directions the long axis of the parent stem or branch , the other two pointing transversely across that axis .
In Lepidodendroid leaves there is little difference in the lengths of these pairs of decussating angles , but in Lepidophloios the two transverse ones are much more prolonged than the vertical ones are , making the transverse diameter of the leaf-scar greatly exceed that in the opposite direction .
Whilst attached to the stem or branch of a Lepidodendron these leaves always point upwards towards its apex ; and when I wrote the memoir referred to above , I had no reason for supposing that this was not also the case with the foliage of Lepidophloios , and my two
