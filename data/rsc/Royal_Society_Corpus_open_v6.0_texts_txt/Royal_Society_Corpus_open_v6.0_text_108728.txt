On the Calculus of Symbols , with Applications to the Theory of Differential Equations .
By W. H. L. RUSSELL , Esq. , A.B. Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received December 20 , 1860 , -Read January 24 , 1861 , THIE calculus of generating functions , discovered by LAPLACE , was , as is well known , highly instrumental in calling the attention of mathematicians to the analogy which exists between differentials and powers .
This analogy was perceived at length to involve an essential identity , and several analysts devoted themselves to the improvement of the new methods of calculation which were thus called into existence .
For a long time the modes of combination assumed to exist between different classes of symbols were those of ordinary algebra ; and this sufficed for investigations respecting functions of differential coefficients and constants , and consequently for the integration of linear differential equations , with constant coefficients .
The laws of combination of ordinary algebraical symbols may be divided into the commutative and distributive laws ; and the number of symbols in the higher branches of mathematics , which are commutative with respect to one another , is very small .
It became then necessary to invent an algebra of non-commutative symbols .
This important step was effected by Professor BOOLE , for certain classes of symbols , in his well-known and beautiful memoir published in the Transactions of this Society for the year 1844 , and the object of the paper which I have now the honour to lay before the Society is to perfect and develope the methods there employed .
For this purpose I have constructed systems of multiplication and division for functions of non-commutative symbols , subject to the same laws of combination as those assumed in Professor BOOLE'S memoir , and I thus arrive at equations of great utility in the integration of linear differential equations with variable coefficients .
I then proceed to develope certain general theorems , which will , I hope , be found interesting .
I have applied the methods of multiplication , as just explained , to deduce theorems for non-commutative symbols analogous to the binomial and multinomial theorems of ordinary algebra .
Lastly , I have shown how to employ the equations deduced in the earlier part of this paper in the integration of linear differential equations .
I have , for this purpose , made use of methods closely resembling the method of divisors which has so long been used in resolving ordinary algebraical equations .
The whole paper will , I hope , be found to be a step upwards in the important subject of which it treats .
I shall just observe , that the symbolical combinations used in this paper may also be applied to the calculus of finite differences , as may be seen in Professor BOOLE'S memoir .
On the Principles of Symbolical Algebra .
Let ( g ) and ( 7r ) be two functional symbols combining according to the law fJ(7r)u =f(7r-n ) ?
" u , where ( u ) is the subject .
We shall suppose throughout this paper that d =xz 7-r=x Let P , Q , and R be three functions of ( 7r ) and ( g ) , such that PQ acting on any subject is equivalent to R acting on the same subject , or PQ=R .
We shall say that P externally multiplies Q , and is an external factor of R. In like manner we shall say that Q internally multiplies P , and is an internal factor of R. We shall also say that R is externally divisible by P , internally by Q. We easily see the truth of the following symbolical equations depending on the laws of combination assumed above:(ga7)(g7%V)g = g+ ( T +a)/ Au ( ga)(ga)-1=goc-a(_ a)-- , .
We shall commence with instances of symbolical multiplication and division , when the multipliers and divisors are monomials .
The following is an instance of external multiplication:,7r(C +er+r )= -(7r+2 ) +g ?
( 7+ , ) 3 +7 r ' ; the following is an instance of internal multiplication:(22~_3~g2+ ( 7r2+7 ) ) gr2= 27r23g2(7r2 + r)+ ( ++)( + 2 ) ; the following of external division : ( ~-)-I'(4(+ 2)-2 ?
g3t(7r+ )+ 3S27r3)-=g-'-2grr+ 3r2 ; the following of internal division:(37r + 32(7+7 ) + 7r ) + 1)2)(r)'=g2+ 3r + 7 .
We shall tlow consider cases where the multipliers and divisors are polynomials .
The following are instances of external multiplication:+trr +-7r -(7 + 1 ) 7r - ?
( ~+l)-~~ -e(7r+ 1)l2 , _ ?

The results of the four last examples may be written thus:(g-5r)(g+5)=g~-p_g ( g5-)(5r-(5 + 1 ) ) = ( g~--( .

I now come to two propositions of great importance .
First , to determine the condition that -1(7r)+ o(7r ) shall divide the symbolical function , n(r ) + fP-1(r)+ + -2_5-2( ) + &amp;c. + 1(7r ) + ( p , r ) internally without a remainder , 4,1( )+ o40())f ( r)++ '_n-l(r ) +S--2()+. . ?

Hence we see how we may resolve the symbolical function nkr( ' ) +r- , _( )+ pPn-2( ) +..+ ' ' ( x ) + o(r ) into factors in all possible cases .
72 Put )o( )-==A+Bot+CCo+ &amp;c. , ,(ir ) =A , +B1r+ C12r+ &amp;c. , and substitute in the above equation , and equate the resulting coefficients of r to zero .
We shall thus be furnished with equations for determining the values of A0 , B , , &amp;c. , A , , B , , &amp;c. in all cases in which the above symbolical function is capable of resolution .
We thus obtain the values of -0(4r ) , 4(r ) , and of the symbolical quotient .
We next ascertain if the symbolical quotient admits of an internal factor , and repeating the process we at length resolve the above symbolical function into factors of the form ( '4 &gt; ( +)(r ) + ( )(7r))(A4)+ ( r)+ ) ) ... ( e( )+4 o( ) ) .

It is evident that for every increase in the degree of the highest power of ( 7r ) , the labour of the investigation becomes immensely greater , and the result far more complicated .
It is , however , of considerable utility in the integration of differential equations , and we shall refer to it again at the close of this paper .
75 On some General Theorems , I shall now give some theorems in general differentiation and expansion , Since ( =)( g2 ' r. to n factors , we have ( 2 - ) " 1 ( -2)( --4 ) ... ..2ns+2 ) " ' ( .W ' ; l ' ( --)-+-3).."(sr2+:1 ) ; whence we easily see that -z( ( -1)(7-)(-3 ) ... .(-2n+ 1)= +( I )"2-l( ) g~( l--12.)( r -2)1.--3 ) ...

this theorem might be more shortly proved by applying VAN7DERMONDE 's theorem to the equation ( 2D))r=(D+D ) ) , I have retained the demonstration in the text merely for the sake of the method , now come to the theorems respecting expansion , which I mentioned in the beginning of the paper as analogous to the binomial and multinomial theorems in ordinary algebra .
To expand ( g2+ O(7r))n in powers of 7r , where 0(7r ) is a function of ( 7r ) , and ( n ) is a positive integer .
Let us assume ( 2 +g O())n= &lt; p)(g ) + p()(g ) .

The same methods of course will apply to all binomials included under the form ( g-+g ~(5r ) ) " .
I have found that there is no difficulty in calculating the forms of the coefficients , beyond the labour expended in performing the finite integrations .

We thus reduce the proposed differential equation to forms already treated of by Professor BOOLE .
We may much simplify the process already explained for treating the symbolical quantity g p(r ) + &amp;c. + 0Po( ) , by remarking that '(7r ) must be sought among the divisors of &lt; ( ir ) , oi , ( r ) among the divisors of P0(Xr ) ; and we shall make use of this principle in the following application of the preceding theory to the solution of differential equations .
We shall denominate the equation deduced in the former part of this memoir , 1o(~ ) 1 o(n)~0(~ ) , ( ) ' , ( 0r ) ( P'-1)+':( ? ?

To integrate the differential equation , d3u d2u du x2( +1)3 dS +3x(x +1)3 d+ ( +x +4+ 3x ) d-(2x3)t= X. The symbolical form of this equation is r'3C_+ ?

The divisor of 0r3 is ?
r only , the divisors of ?
( ?

+l ; hence putting ( )=-,7 4/ or=7T--1 , we find the criterion of the symbolical quantity 4i1(r)+Q(9r ) to become ( l)-3{(-1)3+1 } +{ 3(Xr-2)+('r-2 -12 }-(r3)3=0 , an identical equation .
Hence r +(r1 ) is an internal factor of g3 , R3 + 2(3 _ 1 ) + 3e(+ + 1)+l ( ~2-l ) ; and the equation may be written , effecting the internal division , { ?
2(_ 1)2+g( +l)(23-3)+ T(+l)}(g ?
+(x-1))u=X ; or if g ?
+('( --1))=t , , { g2(-1)2+ Q(Z + 1)(2-3 ) +(r + l)}u =Xx .
The only divisor of ( 7r--)2 is 7Z-1 , the divisors of r(7r+1 ) are r and 7r+1 ; and by trial it is found that the divisor g(7r ) +(7+1 ) satisfies the criterion , and is therefore an internal factor .
Hence , effecting the internal division , ( g(r2 ) +7)((7r-l)+( + 1))Nu =X , and the differential equation becomes ( ( r-2)+ 7)(g(~r-l)+(r+ 1))(geT+(-))U=Xx , or { ( X22+X ) 2x}{(2+ ) -(x-1)}{(2+x)1}-l }=Xx .
Hence , performing the inverse calculations , we find for the complete integral ; _ dx(f +1)2(1 df Xdx f-X+lJ 3 J1( +l 1)3 ' the three arbitrary constants being included under the signs of integration .
In case this method does not succeed , we may sometimes resolve the symbolical function into factors by assuming u=(7r+-)v and proceeding as before , determining ( a ) from the criterion , as will be shown in the following examples : To integrate the differential equation d.u du &amp; 2(X+ 1)3 d 3+a(4X3+11 2+10f +3)d+2a9+10x2+5x-3=X .
The symbolical form of the equation is 3(r2+ 3 +2)+g2(3r2+ 8r+10)+g(32'+ 7Tr+5)+2+ 2r3-X .

Next consider the differential equation du du ( ax+23+xa2 ) 6(x2+x ) d +6(x+2)=X ; the symbolical form of this equation is f2z(Ql)u-+2(r-1)(r3)u}+(@3)(a -4)u=X .
Let z=(Tr+-)v , and the equation becomes 27r(7r-1)( +)v -+2g(r 1)(7r-3)(7r+ )v+(7r-3)(4)(7r+f)v=X .
Let -,1(7r)=7r-1 , 0((7r)=7r-3 , and the criterion becomes ( 3)(7r-4)( , +E)_{2(--2)(7r-4)}(r+E-1 ) ( Wr3)(7r4 ) + -2 ) ( _3 ) { ( 7r-2)(7r-3 ) } ( r +-2)=0 .
Putting 7r=0 in this equation , we have e=0 , and this value renders the above equation identical , &amp; ( r i)+( -3 ) is an internal factor of the symbolical function 272(_ )+2g7(r-1)(7r-3)+7(7r3)(-_ 4 ) ; wherefore , effecting the internal division , the equation becomes { g(7r-.1)(2+r(r-4 } { g(7-1)+(r-3)}=X .
This equation may be written J( -2)( 3)(s 4)1 1 ' ( -l ) 1l X('---4 '('--2).,.(9+l ) --.I ) ' I ; I ) +(r 3))=x , in which the inverse calculations are all practicable .
As a final example we take the differential equation d2u du ( x +4x4+5x+2x2 ) d2 +(2x4+ 3X3 + 5x2 -6 ) d+(l )2=x The symbolical form of this equation is g/ ( 7r+1)u+e(4+ 1 ) +g(52 _57+ 2 ) +( -1 )(2 -- .
1 ) = X. If we put u-=7rv , the equation becomes ( + 1)(r-1 ) ( ( ~1)+ r)(gr +(2r1))v=X , in which the inverse calculations necessary for the solution of the equation ' are all practicable .
In cases where the assumption u-=(r-+)v does not lead to the solution of the equation , we may assume t=(7r+~l)(7r+~2)v , and proceed as before .
We may also treat linear differential equations by ascertaining the condition that I()T7r+4-0(g ) may be an internal factor of this symbolical expression,.( ) .

I have shown how this is to be effected when n=2 or 3 .
For higher degrees the investigation would be very laborious .
In all cases in which the second member of the differential equation is zero , this internal factor , supposing it to exist , would conduct us to a particular integral .
