( Abstract .
) This paper contains a description of three small specimens of Neuropteris heterophylla , Brongt .
, each of which shows a fragment of a terminal portion of a pinna bearing a large Rhabdocarpous seed , about 3 cm .
long and from 1T0\#151 ; 1'40 cm .
wide .
Their general form is oblong , but they taper from the centre into a micropylar point .
To the fragments of the stems is attached one\#151 ; in one case two\#151 ; pinnules , identical in form and nervation to those of Neuropteris , heterophylla , Brongt .
One of the specimens also shows a subtending bract-like leaf .
These specimens further show that the example previously described by the writer as the fructification of heterophylla , which also bore characteristic barren pinnules of that species , must be the " male inflorescence " of the plant , though the structure of the bodies supported on the naked dichotomous branchlets cannot be clearly made out .
Neuropteris heterophylla is , therefore , a typical member of the Cycadofilices .
The specimens bearing the " seeds " came from the middle coal measures of the South Staffordshire coal field and are preserved in small ironstone nodules .
They were communicated to the writer for examination by Mr. H. W. Hughes , F.G.S. , Dudley .
