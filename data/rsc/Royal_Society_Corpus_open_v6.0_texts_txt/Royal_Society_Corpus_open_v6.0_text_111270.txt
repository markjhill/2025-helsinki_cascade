( Abstract .
) In attempting to purify cuminic acid by boiling with chromic acid , I observed that this acid experienced , on the part of this reagent , a progressive alteration .
By twenty-four hours ' ebullition , cuminic acid is completely converted into an acid insoluble in alcohol and ether , for which I propose the provisional name of insolinic acid ; purified by the ordinary processes , this body furnished on analysis the following relations : C 1H404 ; but the analysis of the salts demonstrates that this formula must be doubled , insolinic acid being a bibasic acid .
I have examined the following salts : Insolinic acid ... ... ... ... C18E H8 O Silver salt..C18 ... ... .

C18 ( H6 K Na ) 08 When considered by itself , insolinic acid has but slight claims on the attention of chemists ; biut when viewed in connexion with other groups of bodies , it acquires increased interest .
Some years since , Gerhardt pointed out that to the homologous series of monobasic fatty acids C , , H2 04 , the lowest terms of which are formic and acetic acids , there runs parallel a homologous series of bibasic acids , C,2H 1-2O , , the simplest member of which is oxalic acid .
These two series of acids are connected by the closest ties , and very conclusive experiments have demonstrated that the members of the former may be easily converted into those of the latter ; such is the case of the transformation of butyric into succinic acid , effected by M. Dessaignes under the influence of oxidizing agelts .

C20 His O8 The existence and the mode of formation of insolinic acid prove that to the series of monobasic aromatic acids , C H , 104 , the lowest known term of which is benzoic acid , there corresponds likewise a series of bibasic acids , C,2 H,2_-s-2 08= C2 Hn2-1o 0s .
Of this series few members are at present known , but the group of aromatic acids is itself very imperfect and limited .
The two series comprise at present the following terms : Benzoic acid ... ... . .

e ... ... ... ... ** C020HioO If we take the carbon as the standard of comparison , it is evident that the bibasic insolinic acid corresponds to the monobasic acid , which stands between toluylic and cuminic acid .
In addition to this unknown acid , toluylic acid only is represented in the series of bibasic acids .
There are , in fact , two bodies which may be regarded as representatives of toluylic acid , namely , phthalic and terephthalic acids .
Benzoic and cuminic acid are not yet represented .
