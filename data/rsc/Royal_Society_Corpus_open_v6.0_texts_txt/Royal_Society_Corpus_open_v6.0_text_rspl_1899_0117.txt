] Kiihne and Steiner in their work on the olfactory nerve of the pike , t published in 1880 , showed that the laws of electromotive action in medullated nerve , as formulated by Du-Bois Reymond , held good in the case of non-medullated fibres .
Having demonstrated the resting current in a suitably prepared olfactory nerve , they proceeded to compare the value of this current with that obtained from medullated nerves of the same fish as well as from the sciatic nerve of the frog .
The result showed a much higher E.M.F. for non-medullated than for medullated nerves , their diameter being about equala result confirmed by Biedermann and others working on the non-medullated nerves of Anodonta .
, Kiihne and Steiner found that the resting current diminished rapidly , hut a new transverse section restored it to , and in some cases even augmented , its original E.M.F. On stimulation with induction currents , a negative variation of high value was obtained .
The response was unfailing while the nerve was fresh , provided that the stimulating electrodes were not applied too near the peripheral end of the nerve where its character becomes modified .
While working at Leipzig during the early part of 1899 , Professor Hearing was good enough to suggest that I should use the nerve which bad given such good results in the hands of Kiihne and Steiner for a further study of electromotive phenomena in non-medullated nerve , and especialty with reference to the occurrence in such fibres of the " positive after-variation " which his own researches Jand those of HeadS had made familiar in the case of medullated nerve .
Hearing had himself occasionally observed this effect in 1885 , while using the olfactory nerve for experiments on electrotonus .
The positive after-offect occurred most frequently on mechanical stimulation of the nerve by cutting , more rarely it followed when induction currents were used .
In the present experiments , the pike used ranged from 1^ to 2| kilos .
* " Non-medullated " is used in its ordinary sense as applied to grey nerve , and without prejudice to the conclusions of Gad and Hey mans that such nerves may be slightly myelinated , conclusions which Ambronn and Held have confirmed by means of their " optical method .

Observations on the in weight .
As described by Kxihne and Steiner the E.M.F. of the resting current of the olfactory nerve was found to be very high , and .
a few experiments , made by the " opposition method " of those authors , gave results similar to theirs ; that is to say , the resting current of the non-medullated nerve overpowered that of a medullated nerve of approximately similar thickness , whether taken from the fish itself or from a frog .
The galvanometer used was a sensitive and quickly reacting instrument by Siemens and Halske , of Berlin , a modified form of the D'Arsonval pattern .
It was used with a telescope in the usual way .
Method.\#151 ; To prepare the olfactory nerves : the head of the pike was cut off , the lower jaw removed , and the head fixed to a small board .
The bones of the upper surface of the skull , from the brain down to the nostrils , were removed with bone forceps , care being taken that only bone was cut away , the cartilage below being left uninjured .
The cartilage thus exposed forms a thin capsule over the lobes of the brain , becoming thicker towards the olfactory lobes , and forming , where these are prolonged into the olfactory nerves , a substantial sheath which encloses the nerves entirely , and through the semitransparent walls of which the nerves are just visible .
To expose the nerves a fine sharp scalpel was used , with which the upper surface of the cartilaginous sheath was sliced away , great care being taken not to cut too deeply and so injure the nerves themselves .
Having removed in this way their upper covering , the two grey nerves are found lying side by side in their canal : they run parallel for the greater part of their length , then fork , right and left , to enter either nostril .
Before attempting to remove the nerves , it must be carefully ascertained that they are freely exposed in their entire length , with no overhanging shreds of cartilage to catch and injure them .
The way being clear , the end-organ of each nerve is separated from its nostril and serves as a handle by which the nerve is lifted from its canal ; a clean scissor cut then severs its central end from the olfactory lobe , and the nerve is ready for experiment* ( see Plate ) .
The central end of the nerve was led off from transverse and longi tudinal sections by brush electrodes ; their distance apart was usually 5 mm. The stimulating electrodes were of platinum wire , with Hering'sf extra loop to cut off unipolar effects .
The induction coil was supplied by a single Daniell cell , the distance between primary and secondary coils varying from 6 to 0 c.m. A good olfactory nerve , freshly prepared , gave in response to single stimuli , electrical or mechanical , a negative variation that was perfectly legible on the galvanometer scale , but it must be noted that * If , as sometimes happened , the two nerves were united near their central end they were used together as one nerve .

Electromotive Phenomena o Nerve .
381 only while the nerve was quite fresh could such responses be obtained by single stimuli .
The momentary mechanical stimulus consisted in a clean cut through the nerve with fine sharp scissors , the blades of : which had been moistened with normal saline ; the nerve was supported , , so that there should be no pull upon the led-off portion .
In the tables of experiments given below , a few cases will be noticed in which there is a back swing + beyond the position of rest .
This-is partly instrumental swing , but partly also due to a slight positive after-effect .
The galvanometer used , although highly damped , was not perfectly dead-beat , and the small after-effects could not be accurately estimated .
All that can be said is that there is a slight tendency towards positive after-effects on good nerves when quite fresh ' later the back swing tends to fall short of the position of rest .
With tetanising induction currents the positive after-effect was only ; once observed with any certainty .

Through the kind co-operation of Dr. Siegfried Garten , Assistant in the Leipzig Laboratory , I was enabled to make observations with the capillary electrometer on the response of the olfactory nerve to single stimuli .
The j photographic records of three such observations \#166 ; are given below .
The curves as reproduced are rather less than half their original size ; they read from left to right .
The negative variation appears as an upward movement of the mercury meniscus .

The negative variation is seen as two responses incompletely fused , obviously owing to the fact that the stroke of the scissors affected the two nerves successively .

Observations on the These experiments brought out very evidently what I am disposed to regard as a principal difference between medullated and non-medullated nerve .
Whereas in medullated nerve successive effects diminish very slightly or not at all , or actually increase ( " staircase effect " ) , non-medullated nerve always exhibits a comparatively rapid decrease of successive effects .
Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate this point .

The galvanometer used in these experiments was a Thomson , of Muirhead 's pattern , and was dead-beat .
It was used with or without photographic apparatus , the spot of light being in the last case reflected on to a large transparent screen in the half-darkened room .
The highly damped Thomson reacted too slowly for such fleeting effects as the response of the nerve to single stimuli to be made visible , but being dead-beat was most suitable for the study of positive aftereffect .
With a normal olfactory nerve in its fresh state the positive aftereffect was never observed with this instrument , but a most striking development of the phenomenon followed on subjecting the nerve to a stream of carbon dioxide .
The nerve was enclosed in a small moist Electromotive Phenomena of chamber with inlet and outlet tubes , and was led off in the usual way .
The stimulation by platinum wires was given at one minute intervals .
Yfter a few normal responses\#151 ; the character of which was a large negative deflection often with incomplete return to the position of j.Qg-j-_carbon dioxide was driven into the nerve chamber j its immediate effect was a marked diminution of the negative variation and the appearance of a positive after-variation , which increased in size for several minutes , attaining often as much as three times the size of the negative variation .
At this point of highest development of the positive after-effect , the back swing was very rapid , and began before the close of stimulation .
The positive after-effect then began to pass off , and a few minutes later the deflection was once more purely negative .
Larger doses of carbon dioxide produced anaesthesia of the nerve , but with returning excitability the positive after-effect appeared as above described .
At the period when the distinct positive after-effect had passed off a curious phase was sometimes noticeable immediately aftei stimula don , viz. , a quick to-and-fro movement , suggesting the struggle of two opposing processes before the slow return of the spot of light towards its position of rest .
For instance , in the last line of figures in Experiment G the spot stands at 19*5 ; on stimulation it moves - to 9*5 , then after the stimulus + to 11 , - to 10 , and slowly back-to 18 .

Another condition in which the olfactory nerve gave positive aftereffects was after being kept for some time in normal .
saline .
Isolated grey nerve appears to be far less resistant than white nerve , but the olfactory sometimes retained its excitability for as long as four hours after excision , and the electrical response of such a kept nerve was usually a negative effect followed by a large positive after-effect .
In frog nerve there is also a development of positive after-effect in stale nerve ; but whereas such effects are in this case markedly reduced if not abolished by a new transverse section , in the case of the olfactory nerve the positive after-variation persists after fresh section .
A few experiments were made to test the effect of ether and chloroform vapour on the negative variation of non-medullated nerve .
The galvanometric effect was promptly abolished by brief administration of ether or chloroform vapour .
Recovery after anaesthesia occurred to some extent\#151 ; more markedly in the case of ether than in that of chloroform .
I wish to take this opportunity of thanking Professor Hearing for the means of study which I enjoyed at Leipzig , and for his kindness in sparing me much of his own valuable time .
I would also thank Dr. Waller for kind help and suggestions .
