Part I. These investigations were made in order to learn how the temperature of the body comports itself in health ; since to every one it must be obvious that without such knowledge it is impossible to determine with any approach to certainty what variations in the temperature are to be accepted as indications of disease .
It is necessary to state here some particulars of the manner these investigations were conducted , and of the precautions taken to avoid error .
The subjects of our observations were confined to bed during the times when the investigations , continued on some occasions for several days , were made .
They were well covered with bed-clothes , and , indeed , as far as possible throughout the time they remained in bed , were kept under the same conditions , so that any alterations in their temperature could not be ascribed to any exposure , or to any variation in the temperature of the room , or to other accidental and preventible causes .
The thermometer was generally placed in the axilla , though on some occasions the temperature of the mouth under the tongue and of the rectum was noted at the same time .
These observations are sufficiently numerous to enable us to say that , due care being taken and sufficient time allowed , the temperature of the axilla is always identical with that of the mouth and with that of the rectum , four to six inches above its termination .
A non-registering thermometer was retained in the axilla and read situ until the completion of each series of these observations ; and the temperature was noted hourly , or nearly so , from 9 a.m. to a late hour in the evening , usually to 12 p.m. On some days hourly observations were made during both night and day .
The time of taking food and the kind and quantity were always accurately recorded .
It is well to mention that some of the persons who were the subjects of this investigation were convalescents from various diseases , but had fairly recovered , and might be considered to be in tolerably good health .
That the subsequent remarks may be more clearly understood , we first give a short account of the general course the temperature followed in one of the boys whose case is recorded in this paper ; and to render the account more intelligible , we attach a chart of his temperature variations , taken hourly for two entire days .

188 Prof. S. Ringer and Mr. A. P. Stuart on the This chart indicates that the temperature does not remain at about the same degree throughout the day and night , but shows that a considerable diurnal variation occurs .
The temperature reaches its highest point at about 9 a.m. , and continues much the same during the chief part of the day ; while in the evening it uniformly and greatly falls and remains at its lowest depression during several hours of the night ; but subsequently , in the early morning hours , it again uniformly and quickly rises .
This diurnal rise and fall constitutes the only great variations .
We now pass on to speak first of the observations , continued hourly without any intermission throughout the day and night , made on two lads , named respectively Alfred Mountain and Alfred Rundell .
By adopting this plan we shall learn what conclusions we may safely draw from those less complete observations which were discontinued at Alfred Mountain was twelve years of age , of a robust build , well nourished and hearty .
He had a patch of tinea deealvans , with which exception he was in perfect health .
The other lad , Alfred Rundell , thirteen years old , was of a rather delicate constitution , but he had a good appetite and was in his accustomed health .
To render our statement the more clear , and to enable our readers to judge for themselves of the correctness of the conclusions arrived at , we have thrown all the results of the observations into the form of Tables , but the details are recorded at the end of this section t. Tn the first column of the following Table is given the name of the boy ; in the second the time the observation lasted ; in the third the maximum temperature of the day ; in the fourth the amount of diurnal variation ; in the fifth the hour when the evening fall began ; and in the sixth column the hour of the commencement of the morning rise .

189 Hen hourly without any break , from 9.30 a.m. of January 12 to 8.15 i January 15 .
Ths amount of daily variation of January 15 is estimated from the west temperature of the previous evening ; but on all the other days e daily variation is estimated from the highest temperature of the day the lowest of the following night .
From this Table we gain information on several points .
Maximum Temperature of the Day .

It will be subsequently more fully shown that during the early morning hours the temperature quickly rises , and then during the greater part of the day remains at about its highest point .
In the evening it again quickly falls , until the lowest temperature of the day is reached .

This Table proves , still more strongly than a foregoing one , that if our observations are continued till 8 p.m. our observations will include the mg.vimnm daily temperature of the day in boys of the age of these lads .
It shows also that in persons of their age the evening fall usually begins between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. ; but it likewise shows that exceptions occur , for the evening fall may begin either before or after the time stated .
The fall , however , happens more frequently before than after .

7 " From this we may conclude that in lads of about 12 years old the morning rise usually begins between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. The chief part of the rise was completed by 9 a.m. After this hour the temperature usually remained at much the same height , until the evening fall began .
Thus on 4 days the temperature remained much the same from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.=8 hours .

Hence it would appear that in boys of the age of 12 the temperature continues at about its maximum for 7 to 8 hours .
The Time at which the Maximum Depression was reached varied greatly in these lads .

Temperature of the Human Body in Health .
191 On six of these eight days the lowest temperature of the day was rtched by 12 p.m. ; on two days this was not attained until 1 a.m. ; but tJ fau ^ the temperature after 12 p.m. on these two occasions was but gght , in each case amounting to only 0o,4 Fahr. It thus appears that if in other persons of about the age of these lads fr observations be continued till 12 p.m. , we shall obtain the whole , or larly the whole , of the daily variation of the body temperature .
The temperature does not begin to rise immediately after its minimum ts been reached , but remains at about its lowest point during several lurs before the morning rise begins ; thus on 2 days it remained at about its minimum 2 hours .

Thus we have learned that observations continued from 9 a.m. to i p.m. give us not merely the highest temperature of the day , but like-ise the hour when the temperature begins to fall the chief , and in any cases the whole , of the evening fall .
With this information we are labled to use some other though less complete observations , in which te temperature was not observed during the night after 12 p.m. We lall thus be able to confirm or to correct by a larger number of observa-ons the foregoing conclusions .
On the Temperature of Healthy Persons of different Ages .
In this section we give the results of observations of persons of various ges in whom the temperature was taken only till 12 p.m. On two ten , however , of about forty years of age , the observations were con-nued throughout the night and day ; and*we are therefore able to com-are the temperature of the whole twenty-four hours of persons of liferent ages .
The observations were made on the following persons : James Redfern , a child five years old , convalescent from rickets .
His ppetite was good .
The ends of the bones were still enlarged , and there ras some flattening and depression of the axillary regions of the chest , Thomas Thompson and Alfred Rundell , aged respectively 11 and 13 , fere both in excellent health .
Frank Leg , 23 years old , convalescent from a very slight attack of heumatic fever .
He was free from pain , and his appetite was good .
Cornelius Farmelow , 40 years of age , and Alfred Purse , 55 years old , eere both in good health .

0'*87 From this Table it appears that the daily variations in old people is considerably less than that of young people ; in fact the variations in persons over 40 is only half that of persons under 25 years .
On the other hand , the daily maximum temperature is much the same both under 25 and over 40 .
But the difference is not merely in the amount of depression , but in the manner of its occurrence .
In young people we get in the evening a very rapid fall , and the minimum temperature of the day is quickly reached ; often , indeed , in three or fours hours .
In persons over 40 , whose temperature was taken through the day and night , so rapid a fall rarely occurs ; but the temperature usually declines very slowly , and as soon as the minimum is reached it again begins to rise , so that not only is the amount of the evening fall less in these older persons , but the period of the depression is also shorter , generally very much shorter .
It may here be noted that on some days , even when the temperature was observed for twenty-four hours , no diurnal variation occurred in persons over 40 years of age .
But the temperature of these older differs in yet another respect from that of younger persons ; thus apparently the diurnal fall does not observe any particular time , but occurs sometimes in the middle of the night , and at other times in the morning at about 9 a.m. Pabt II .
Concerning the influence of Food on the Temperature of Healthy People .
In a previous section a considerable diurnal variation in the temperature , often amounting to two degrees , has been shown to occur .
It is important to ascertain whether this variation is produced by food or is due to other causes .
Our present section is devoted to the solution of these questions .
We shall at first turn our attention to the observations made on the lads Rundell and Mountain .
As these were continued night and day , without any interruption , and as we have accurate accounts of the quantity and the nature of their food , it is obvious we shall obtain much more trustworthy conclusions from these than from less elaborate and exact observations .
These two lads were about twelve years of age .
The observations Temperature of the Human Body in Health .
] 95 .om which we now draw our conclusions will be found in full at the id of the sections treating of the temperature of health , and on the Lfluence of baths on the heat of the body .
We hope to show the high probability that the diurnal variation of the jmperature is altogether independent of food ; and , while attempting to jtablish this , we shall speak first of the influence of breakfast , secondly E the tea , and lastly of the dinner .
Concerning the behaviour of the temperature before and after break-ist , it may be stated that these boys took breakfast at 6 a.m. , dinner fc 12 , and tea at 5 p.m.\#151 ; no food being allowed at other times , with one xception , which at the proper place will be noted and referred to .
Is the daily rise of the body temperature due to food ?
During the arly morning hours , before breakfast , the temperature rose considerably j adeed rather more than half the diurnal rise took place before 6 a.m. , be breakfast time of these lads , showing that some of this rise is not !
ue to food .
This part of the rise , it must be apparent , could not e produced by food , unless , indeed , it be attributed to the tea of the revious evening , a supposition impossible to maintain , as ten hours lapsed between the tea and the beginning of the morning rise .
The hief influence of a meal on the body is expended during the third to he fifth hour , and then gradually declines and usually ceases altogether a ten hours , a fact shown by the variations in the urea of the urine inter a meal .
During the three first hours the quantity of urea gradually acreases , then for an hour or more the maximum quantity is maintained , inter which it gradually grows less , till the standard of inanition is .eached .
Now in all our observations during the early hours of the evening , when the influence of the evening meal was greatest , the temperature ell considerably , and the rise of temperature did not begin till the effects \gt ; f food must have entirely ceased .
We are thus driven to admit that half the daily rise is due to other causes than food .
The annexed Table gives a summary of the observations elsewhere recorded in detail , and includes the whole of the morning rise , which was tlways accomplished by 9 a.m. The first column gives the name of the lad ; the second the hours before breakfast during which the temperature rose ; the third the rise before breakfast ; the fourth the hourly rise ; the fifth the hours of observation after breakfast ; the sixth the rise during this time ; the seventh the hourly rise after breakfast ; and the last column gives the food taken during the investigation .

0-328 \#187 ; Average 0-264 To what extent was the elevation following breakfast due to that meal ?
Probably to a very small extent ; for 1st .
The rise after breakfast was somewhat less than the rise before it , the Table showing that the average hourly rise of all the observations before breakfast was 0o,328 Pahr .
, while the hourly average rise after this meal was 0o-264 Pahr .
It thus appears that , apart from food , the causes which influence the diurnal variation are adequate to explain the rise which happened after breakfast .
2nd .
The rise after breakfast if due to food should be in proportion to the quantity taken ; but no such relation occurred .
The rise , as the Table shows , was somewhat greater after a cupful of very weak tepid tea than after a fairly hearty meal .
3rd .
On the morning when these boys took only a cupful of tea , they may be considered to have practically gone without breakfast ; yet on these days the rise took place as usual , showing that the greater part of the after breakfast rise , and in all likelihood the rise on other days , must be independent of food .
Still restricting our attention to the observations on Mountain and Bundell , we pass on to consider how far the evening fall in the temperature is affected by the evening meal .
These boys took tea at 5 p.m. , always a very hearty meal , often the largest of the day , and generally consisting of two , often of three-eggs , bread and butter , with tea or cocoa .
They had no supper , and were allowed to fall asleep at their pleasure , and were not awakened when the temperature was read off .
Due care was taken that they were well covered with bed-clothes .
In sixteen observations the temperature after tea fell immediately and Temperature of the Human Body in .
; ontinuously , until it reached the lowest point of the night .
In many eases the evening fall had begun before the tea ; in one case only did it rise after the meal , and on this occasion to the extent only of 0'*2 Fahr. , and for a very short time .
On these occasions , as the fall occurred immediately after , and notwithstanding a hearty meal , and moreover as the boys were in all respects placed in the same conditions throughout the day , it is obvious that we must admit that there are certain circumstances irrespective of food which determine the diurnal variation of the temperature .
Is all this fall due to these unknown circumstances ?
Or must we admit that a portion of the previous rise is due to the food , and as its heat-producing effects wear off , and as the inanition period is reached , a fall takes place equal in amount to the previous rise determined by the food ?
We will now give reasons which lead us to conclude that the total of the fall is due to circumstances wholly apart from the food .
The question to decide is , how much of the evening fall is to be accounted for by those circumstances ( irrespective of food ) that determine the diurnal variation , and how much , if any , is due to the withdrawal of the influence of food on the body .
It must be evident that the fall which occurred while the influence of the food was at its highest must be wholly attributed to other circumstances .
We need hardly dwell on this point ; for if the fall is due to the diminished or exhausted influence of the food , such a decline 'could not occur when the meal was exerting its greatest effects ; therefore that part only of the fall which took place when the effects of the meal had begun to diminish or had ceased can be attributed to the withdrawal of the influence of food .
But in all cases the principal part of the evening fall occurred while the influence of the tea must have been at its height , and in many instances the whole of this fall had taken place at this time\#151 ; the chief part of this evening fall having on all occasions occurred before 11 p.m. , and was , indeed , very often by this time at the lowest point .
Thus in those cases only where the fall continued after 11 p.m. , a very small portion , if any , of this fall could be due to the declining influence of food .
In this Table we give , in the first column the date , in the second the amount of fall after 10 or 11 p.m. , and in the third the hour of the night when observations were discontinued .

\gt ; 5 Summary of this Table .
Observations recorded on ten days when no bath wras taken:\#151 ; In 5 of these no fall after 10 .
' " 1 a fall of 0'*2 " " " 2 " 0'*4 " " " 2 " 0'-8 " " Observations recorded on 9 days when baths were taken in the morning:\#151 ; In 2 there was no fall after 10 to 11 p.m. " 4 a fall of 0o,2 occurred " " " 1 0'*4 11 X 11 V/ 11 11 11 1 0'*6 11 ^ 11 \J 11 1 1'*0 11 x 11 x v 1 ) 11 11 ^ These two Tables may , we think , be fairly thrown together , for we cannot understand how baths given in the morning should interfere with the evening temperature .
Thus we have 19 series of observations ; and in 7 of these no fall occurred after the chief influence of the meal had ceased .
In 5 cases a fall of 0o,2 occurred ; but we think a variation so slight may be disregarded , as it might , and probably was often , caused by some accidental circumstance , as the movement of the body in bed or some similar cause\#151 ; an assumption strengthened by the fact that this slight decline was often noted only once , and at the time of the next observation the temperature had recovered itself .
These observations , therefore , may be thrown together , giving the result that in 12 of the 19 observations the food appears to have had no influence on the evening fall .
Of the remaining 7 observations , after * the supposed influence of the food had passed away , \#151 ; In 3 there was a fall of 0'*4 " 1 " " 0'-6 " 2 " " 0'-8 " 1 " " 1''0 Temperature of the Human Body in Health .
199 It appears , then , that the fact of the fall being in the majority of ises independent of the food , is presumptive evidence that the fall 'hich occurred on some occasions after 11 must be due to other causes aan the withdrawal of the influence of food .
The Influence of Dinner on the Temperature .
Observations made on the temperature before and after dinner ornish * further illustration of the non-influence of food on the tem-erature of the body .
If food can raise the temperature , we should ertainly expect this to occur after dinner , especially in Mountain 's case , t ' we bear in mind that his breakfast was so small , that its effects on the ody must have ceased altogether before 12 , his dinner hour ; and hence he influence which food can be supposed to exert on the temperature yould in his case be manifest after dinner .
The appended Tables give the results of the observations made on ^fountain and Bundell .
" We have not restricted ourselves to those days when the temperature was continuously taken through both night and lay , this limitation being evidently unnecessary , but we have used all die observations made on these lads .
In every case their breakfast was oaken at 6 a.m. , and their dinner at 12 , or shortly after this .

So slight a rise of 0'*2 is so easily produced by accidental causes , that , as we have before said , it may be almost disregarded , On this supposition , then , it appears that on six of the ten days the rise was nil or practically unappreciable , and on other days the rise was very small .
It may be fairly said that we shall elicit surer information as to the influence of the dinner , if we observe how the temperature comported itself between three and five o'clock , when the food influence on the body may be supposed to be at the maximum .
The following Table exhibits the temperature during these hours , in the case of Mountain :\#151 ; On 2 days the temperature remained unaltered .

j Here we close our investigations on the influence of food on the lads Mountain and Rundell .
We cannot absolutely say that food does not in any ease raise the body temperature ; yet it is clear that its influence in this respect , if any , on persons in health and well nourished is very slight indeed .
We may further add that these observations are opposed to .
the statement made by Dr. John Davy , to the effect that a'fall in the temperature occurs immediately after food .
We give a few further tabular observations on the after-dinner temperature made on Redf era , Gibbs , Thompson , Farmelow , and Games , jj Temperature of the Human Body in Health .

In five the temperature rose , the average rise being 0o,4 .
Breakfast / as taken at 6 a.m. , and no further food allowed afterwards until 12 .
It aay be objected , in respect of these observations , that the influence of the reakfast had not passed away by dinner time , and that the temperature levated by this meal was maintained by the dinner .
As the influence i ; \gt ; f the breakfast may not have passed off by dinner time these observa-ions are not so trustworthy in the settlement of this question of the nfluence of food on the temperature as those made on Mountain .
We jive them , however , for what they are worth , believing they serve in some legree to corroborate our previous conclusions .
It is , however , right to refer to some observations in which a very considerable rise occurred after a late breafast .
These were made on three persons in ill-health .
One man , 35 years af age , suffered from hemiplegia ; another , 32 years , with hemiplegia ind dilated heart ; and the third , 21 years old , was the victim of some obscure disease .
His spleen was very much enlarged , and he occasionally passed large quantities of blood with his urine .
These patients abstained from food from tea ( 5 p.m. ) one day till breakfast on the following day , taken either at 10 a.m. or a little later .
These observations , for the sake of clearness , are thrown into a Table .
1$ The first column shows the time before breakfast the temperature was i# taken ; the second gives the temperature of the body at the time of | is| commencing each observation ; the third shows the amount of the rise before breakfast ; the fourth gives the rise after breakfast ; and the fifth I* column shows the duration of the rise .

It thus appears that after breakfast the temperature of these men rose considerably , the average being 0'*8 , sufficient , it may be said , to show that the food is capable of causing an elevation in the temperature of the body , especially as in many of the days no rise took place before breakfast , the temperature having been taken at this time for several hours .
We are constrained to admit that perhaps this rise in the axilla was due to the food ; although opposed to this admission , we might urge the fact that on three days , when the temperature of Jones and Tarves was taken during the morning hours , while they were kept fasting , an average rise of 0'*7 occurred , being almost identical with that which took place on other days when they partook of food .
Assuming that this rise in the axilla was really due to food , How was the rise caused ?
~Was it due to a general elevation of the body temperature , owing to increased consumption of the food ?
or was it due to other causes ?
It could hardly be due to increased oxidation of food , for we should expect the elevation to be most marked at the time during which the food was most rapidly absorbed and carried to the tissues .
But in these men the rise in the temperature occurred much sooner than this , being completed on an average in an hour and twenty-eight minutes , and in several cases in fifty minutes , in some even in thirty , although there was a considerable rise on these days yet at the time the influence of food would be expected to be most marked the temperature either remained unchanged or in some instances it even fell .
Further , it may be remarked that were the rise after breakfast due to combustion of the food , we should expect that a similar rise would occur after the dinner , which was a heartier meal than the breakfast ; but the rise after dinner was much less than that after breakfast .

0'37 It may , however , be fairly objected to this argument , that the influence f the breakfast on the body had not ceased before that of the dinner egun , and that the dinner prevented the possible fall after the break-\#187 ; st if dinner had not been taken .
Thus , to summarize very generally the conclusions we have arrived t:\#151 ; There is a diurnal cycle in the temperature of the body , much more vident in young than in middle-aged or old people ; in elderly people , ndeed , the daily variation is often very slight , and sometimes altogether ibsent ; further , this diurnal variation is due to other causes than food , which if operative in any degree in producing elevation of the temperature , is so , if at all , to a very small extent .
Pabt III .
On the Influence of Cold Baths on the Temperature of the Body .
We undertook these experiments from a wish to learn the influence of the cold bath on the temperature of the surface and internal parts of the body , and to ascertain if it were possible , in any degree , to cool the whole body ; and if so , to what extent the temperature could be lowered , and how long this depression would continue .
Our observations were made in the winter months .
The temperature of the person fixed upon for experiment was first carefully ascertained either in the axilla , the rectum , or under the tongue .
He was then immersed in a bath of a temperature of 60 ' Fahr. for a time varying from 1 to 35 minutes in the several series of experiments .
The body was covered by the water up to the chin .
Immediately on the return to bed the temperature was again ascertained , and every few minutes afterwards .
In some instances we took the temperature under the tongue during the immersion ; but these notes we fear are not quite correct , although we spared no pains , for the patient 's teeth chattered so much as to prevent the steady closure of the lips .

68 5 95-3 37 mins.\amp ; r This Table exemplifies , as was to be expected , that the cold baths considerably cooled the surface of the body , and that the longer the immersion the greater was the depression of the temperature of the skin .
Thus this Table shows that on some occasions the temperature of the axilla fell to 87 ' Pahr .
; but a depression so great occurred only when the bath was continued for a considerable time , for a period , indeed , varying from 15 to 35 minutes ; and even this amount of depression was of short duration .
To illustrate this effect we give three extracts from the preceding Table .
A bath of 60 ' Pahr .
.for one minute reduced the temperature of a child five years old to 95 ' Pahr .
, but in 13 to 25 minutes the temperature of the axilla had nearly recovered itself .
With a bath of the same temperature continued five minutes we reduced the temperature to 92 ' ; but in 48 to 75 minutes after leaving the bath the axillary temperature had nearly recovered .
Nay , even after a bath of 35 minutes the temperature only fell to 89 ' , and recovered itself in 135 minutes .
The greater part of the lost heat was very quickly restored , and then the axilla more slowly regained the rest of the lost temperature .
Influence of Gold Baths on the Temperature of internal parts of the Cold baths reduce the temperature of internal parts of the body , but Temperature of the Human Body in Health .
205 iie reduction is considerably less than that of the surface .
Thus we \gt ; wered the temperature under the tongue or in the rectum from 0'*6 o 2''8 Fahr. , the amount of depression being , of course , proportional to he duration of the bath .
The duration of the depression varied greatly in different persons .
Thus on some occasions the lost heat was restored in an hour ; in others jot for several hours , three , four , or more ; but very soon after leaving he bath the greater part of the lost heat was restored , the remaining light depression passing off much more slowly .
Our observations slicited the rather curious fact that the time the body takes to recover ts temperature holds no relation to the amount of depression ; thus in some instances , when with great depression , the recovery was speedy , while on other occasions , with but slightly depressed temperature , the recovery was slowly effected .
We noticed , too , that many times the internal parts did not become cooled under the actual operation of the bath , but the temperature of the internal parts fell gradually for some time after the bath .
The explanation we would offer of this curious fact is , that during the bath much heat is withdrawn from the surface , and the cold contracting the blood-vessels lessens greatly the quantity of blood passing through the skin .
Heat is thus not abstracted from deep parts by cooling of the blood , but simply by conduction .
On quitting the bath , the blood-vessels of the skin become widely dilated , and the blood then passing quickly through the cold skin becomes cooled , and reduces the temperature of deep parts .

Influence of Hot-water and Vapour Baths on the Temperature of the Body .
We next turn our attention to .
the influence of hot-water and vapour baths on the temperature of the body ; and we shall first attempt to ascertain the influence of hot baths on the temperature of the body , both at the time of immersion and during the rest of the day .
We have , as usual , extracted and tabulated the chief data from the charts appended to the end of this section .
The temperature was obtained by placing the thermometer under the tongue while the person was in the bath .
The method of taking the temperature is always noted in the charts .

207 From this Table we learn that in all cases the temperature of the body :\gt ; se in the hot bath , this elevation , as might be expected , varying with ie temperature and duration of the bath .
It varied from 1 ' Fahr. to '*6 Fahr. ; or , to put it in another and more striking way , we raised the ody temperature to 103 ' and 104 ' Fahr. , a severe fever height .
Is it pos-ible to bring the temperature of the body to that of the bath ?
As it is im-ossible to remain in a very hot bath sufficiently long to enable us to deter-line this question , we must examine those experiments in which the emperature of the bath was not very high .
We were compelled in a hort time to discontinue the experiment with a very hot bath on account \gt ; f the great weakness induced by it .
Yet as the temperature continued o rise so long as the patient remained in the hot water , it is probable hat , if adequate time could have been allowed , the temperature of the \gt ; ody would have become identical with that of the bath .
The charts show that a bath of moderate temperature , as 101 ' to .02 ' , will raise the body temperature to that of the bath .
Whilst naking several of these series of observations the bath temperature was 'ecorded simultaneously with the temperature of the body , and the igures are given in the charts , as with Mountain on Jan. 3rd , 4th , and 5th , and with Mooney and Luff on Jan. 22nd .
Thus it is clear that the temperature of the body may be raised to that of a bath at 101o,8 .
Influence of Hot-water Bath on the Temperature of the Body during the rest of the day after the Bath .

If these results are compared with those obtained from the observations made on the same lads on the bathless days , it will be seen that the two sets of figures entirely agree ; that , in fact , hot-water baths , except at the time of immersion , exert no influence on the body temperature .
On the Influence of Hot-vapour Baths on the Temperature of the Body .
The temperature of the body is always raised by the hot-vapour bath , the amount of elevation , as might be expected , being proportionate to the heat and duration of the bath , as shown in the following Table j\#151 ; VOIi .

103 ' to 105 ' In some of the observations we have stated only the time occupied in effecting the rise , as on these days .the bath , before it was entered , was first heated to the temperature at which it was maintained ; while on the other days the bath was entered immediately the steam was turned on , being thus occupied while the temperature of the room was rising .
These experiments enable us to learn the rapidity with which the body may lose heat ; for as the body of the person experimented upon was heated considerably higher than could be maintained by physiological processes , so this unnatural elevation is speedily lost by evaporation , radiation , and conduction .
As the loss of heat sustained varied with the temperature to which the body was raised , we shall speak first of the cooling of the body from a high temperature , and next from a temperature a little above that of health .
It was found that heat was much more quickly lost under the first than under the latter conditions .
We now give a Table to show the rapid loss of heat when the temperature of the body has been raised considerably , for instance to 102 ' and 104 ' Pahr .

As an interval of five minutes sometimes elapsed between the testings , we can hardly speak with the exactness indicated by the figures .
It is better to say the body may lose a degree of heat in less than five minutes .
The following Table shows that the loss of body heat is much less rapid when the body is less heated , one degree being lost in 40 minutes:-\#151 ; Temperature of the Human Body in Health .

ill We shall now try to ascertain the source of this increase of body heat finder a warm-water or hot-vapour bath .
Our experiments with vapour-baths afford the more complete solution ; iif\#174 ; : d the following remarks will be limited to them , though it is evident indtl at they will also hold good in the case of hot-water baths , inti This increase in the heat of the body may be due to 1 .

Both of these circumstances .
Some of the increased heat was undoubtedly due to an accumulation heat in the body .
It is evident that a person in a hot-vapour bath of the temperature of e body , and when breathing the steam , could lose no heat by evapo-tion , or radiation , or conduction , the only means of withdrawing heat om the body .
If the production of heat is not diminished pari passu ith its loss from the body , then heat will accumulate , and the tempera-re of the body will be raised .
Two observations show this to be the case .
Thus with Mooney on in .

[ May 3 , Here it was impossible that the heat which raised the temperature oi the body could be obtained from the bath , itself never hotter than the bodies of the boys before undergoing the experiment .
If the formation of heat was lessened so as exactly to meet the diminished loss by conduction and radiation , the heat'of the body would have continued at the same point ; but this was not the case , and thus it appears that the formation of heat cannot be suddenly lessened to such an amount .
Thus the increased heat of the body ensuing from a vapour-bath is certainly in part due to accumulation of heat , which under other circumstances is lost by evaporation and radiation .
Is all the heat imparted to the body by the vapour-bath to be accounted for in this way ?
Some part must , in the nature of things , be absorbed from the bath , and is evidenced in our experiments , the elevation being too rapid to be caused solely by an accumulation of heat in the body .
