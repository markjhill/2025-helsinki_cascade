417 I. Introduction .
The amino-alcohols of the general type ( OH)CCH3RCH2i !
iI'(CH3)2 were originally obtained by Fourneau* by the reaction between the secondary or tertiary amines and the corresponding chlorhydrins ( 0H)CCH3RGH2C1 ( R representing any hydrocarbon grouping ) .
Their salts do not crystallise well , but if the hydrogen of the hydroxyl grouping be replaced by benzoyl , the derived salts , especially the hydrochlorides , can be obtained in a pure crystalline condition .
Such salts produce local antesthesia , the ethyl derivative , OBzC .
CH3.C2H5CH2lSr(CH3)2HCl , or stovaine , being especially used in surgical practice .
In a former communication by Yeley and Waller , f the activities of stovaine , its methyl homologue , and cocaine were compared as regards their effect on the contractility of isolated muscle ; it was shown that the toxic effects of the three drugs were all equal within the limits of experimental error , but the variation of effect by altering the concentration was rather less than that to be expected .
A few months later , Gros , t using a different method of excitation , namely , tetanic , obtained similar results as regards the equal activity of cocaine and stovaine , though the concentrations in the two cases were widely different , namely , n/ 500 to w/ 1000 ( Yeley and Waller ) and 125 ( Gros ) .
M. Fourneau recently sent to the former of us fine crystalline samples of stovaine and its homologues for the purpose of investigation ; we desire to express our appreciation of his kindness and international courtesy .

As regards the corresponding methyl ester , Fourneauf wrote:\#151 ; " II contient tous les groupements de la cocaine " ( namely a tertiary amino , an oxybenzoyl , OBz , and a methylated carboxyl , COOCH3 , grouping ) " c'est d'ailleurs un anaesthesique puissant , mais l'accumulation des groupes acides autour de la fonction amin4e detruit tellement la basicity de celle-ci que la molecule est tres acide au tournesol .
" In other words , the salt may be regarded as intermediate , as regards its constitution , between stovaine on the one hand and cocaine hydrochloride on the other , though , as regards its properties , differing ' from both of them in giving an acid reaction ; this point will be more fully discussed in the sequel .

Physical Properties .
The physical properties of the several compounds investigated are\#151 ; ( i ) the densities of the salts themselves ; ( ii ) the affinity value of Fourneau 's salt , and , as to the physiological properties , their effects on ( i ) the contractility of isolated muscle , ( ii ) blood pressure , and ( iii ) respiration .
The comparative effect of these drugs on nerve is dealt with as a separate subject in a further communication .
Densities of the Salts.\#151 ; These were determined by displacement of toluene , using a specific gravity bottle of 10 c.c. capacity , rather more than 1 gramme of each salt being used ; the necessary correction for air displacement was made , and each experiment performed in duplicate ; a bottle of like capacity and nearly identical weight was used as a tare .
It is not , of course , pretended that such determinations are of the order of accuracy which can be obtained in the case of liquids with a U form of pycnometer , but the curious absence of data for the densities of salts of organic compounds was * For the sake of brevity , the words " homologue of stovaine " will be omitted in the case of the compounds ( i ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) , and ( v ) ; for the same purpose , compound ( vi ) will be designated in the text as Fourneau 's salt .

) It is evident from the above results that the densities , both for the paraffinoid and benzenoid derivatives , decrease with increase of molecular weight , but this decrease does not vary uniformly with each CH2 group added to the molecule ; the value of the amyl derivative is lower than that to be expected , but four determinations were made for the salt in the case of any error .
Affinity Value of the Base of Fourneau 's Salt.\#151 ; On account of the writer 's results as to the acidity of the salt towards indicators the hydrolysis and affinity values were determined by the methyl-orange method* devised by the former of us .
The hydrolysis found was 1 per cent , at dilution V = 4x 103 ; hence the affinity value of the base K\amp ; can be calculated by Arrhenius ' dilution formula and Kohlrausch 's data for ionisation of water as Kj = 0-99 x 4.103 x 4-9.10"15/ ( 0-01)2 = 7'9.lO"8 , The above value is comparable with that of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride = 9'7 .

Certain Physical and [ Dec. 10 , Fourneau 's view that the accumulation of acidic groupings around the amino-function destroys the basic character of the latter is confirmed by quantitative measurements .

Physiological Properties .
A. Contractility of Isolated Muscle .
On dissolving in the usual manner in physiological tap-water saline solution , a turbidity resulted in the case of the salts of the higher molecular weight ; this was due to the precipitation of the base by the alkali of the water , as previous investigations have shown that , though these compounds are not hydrolysed by water , yet a trace of the order of 1 per 10,000 of free alkali will cause separation of the base .
But if such solutions are allowed to stand for some days , the turbidity slowly and almost completely disappears except in the case of benzyl stovaine .
The records obtained for all the compounds were similar in type , the only features worthy of note being ( 1 ) that the end or abolition point was often not very well defined , and ( 2 ) that the variation caused by alteration of concentration was less marked than for most other drugs .
The times required for abolition are collected together in the following table ; in Column I the names of the compounds are given , in II , III and IV the concentrations in normality , and the same in percentage reckoned as base , and the times in minutes required for abolition .
The temperature , unless otherwise stated , was 18 + 0-5 ' .

The general conclusion to be drawn from these results is that the substi tution of the ethyl grouping in stovaine by the amyl , phenyl , benzyl , and 1910 .
] Physiological Properties of , etc. 417 ( COOC3H7 ) groupings produces a decrease of rate of action while that of methyl is less marked , the differences observed being within the limit of experimental error .
As regards the amyl , phenyl , and benzyl derivatives , it is possible that the differences observed may be due to the precipitation of the bases as pointed out above .
B. Effect on Blood-pressure and on Respiration .
Though it was not possible to carry out , , a complete investigation into the physiological action of these bodies , it nevertheless seemed of interest to employ some of the material at our disposal for the purpose oT comparing their respective effects , with those of cocaine , on the circulation and respiration of the mammal .
The number of observations is not large enough to warrant close quantitative estimation of their individual toxicities , but suffices to enable comparison of the type and ( to some extent ) of the degree of their effects .
In all cases the animals employed were cats , under complete anaesthesia , and the drugs were administered by injection into the saphenous vein .
Cocaine .
As is well known , cocaine in sufficiently small doses is a cardiovascular and respiratory stimulant .
On cats with intact central nervous system , blood-pressure was raised by doses of 0'05\#151 ; 07 mgrm .
per kilo , body weight , lowered by larger doses ; whilst on a completely pithed cat injections produced no fall in doses up to T9 mgrm .
per kilo .
On the respiratory movements , the depressant action of the drug has appeared with smaller doses than on the blood-pressure .
Stovaine and Methyl Stovaine .
These drugs have not , wdth us , raised blood-pressure or stimulated respiration in any dose .
Small doses , when effective , led to fall of blood-pressure of varying amount and duration , together with a momentary pause in respiration , which was followed by a rhythm of greater frequency and smaller amplitude than that before injection .
A single ( first ) dose of stovaine amounting to 5 mgrm .
per kilo , has proved fatal , but provided that the initial doses were small , single injections amounting to three times as much did not cause death , and a total dose of 40 mgrm .
per kilo , can be tolerated .
With methyl stovaine an initial ( single ) dose of 8'4 mgrm .
per kilo , did not produce any obviously dangerous effect .
As on muscle* and on * Yeley and Waller , loc. cit. 418 Dr. Yeley and Mr. Symes .
Certain Physical and [ Dec. 10 , nerve , * these drugs have also on the circulation and on the respiration similar and approximately equal effects , methyl stovaine being , if anything , slightly the 'less active of the two .
Amyl Stovaine .
In comparison with the two preceding drugs , small doses of amyl stovaine have produced ( molecule for molecule ) a greater fall of blood-pressure , but distinctly less interference with respiration .
Initial doses of 5'8 and 9'3 mgrm .
per kilo , were well tolerated , and 41 mgrm .
per kilo , has failed to kill .
The effects are neither in type nor in degree , those of an acutely toxic drug .
We have found amyl stovaine to be a powerful local anaesthetic.* Phenyl Stovaine and Benzyl Stovaine .
Only one observation was made in each case .
With phenyl stovaine a brief rise of blood-pressure preceded the invariable fall , and both drugs produced some dyspnoea .
With benzyl stovaine Traube-Hering and Cheyne-Stokes rhythm was noticed in the blood-pressure and respiration respectively .
Both drugs are powerful local anaesthetics , but offer no advantage over amyl stovaine .
Fourneau 's New Salt .
As already pointed out , this body is ( in chemical structure ) intermediate between cocaine and stovaine .
In its effects , on injection , it also resembles both these drugs , the latter more closely than the former .
Small doses may ( or may not ) produce a trifling initial rise of blood-pressure , but any such rise is small in comparison with the slight fall that invariably follows it .
This fall is less than that caused by equivalent doses of the preceding drugs .
On respiration , its effect closely resembles that of stovaine and of methyl stovaine , but the momentary pause is followed by closer return to the normal rhythm .
It ?
effects on blood-pressure and on respiration are therefore less marked than those of cocaine , stovaine , and the homologues of the latter .
As elsewherej* stated , it is a powerful local anaesthetic .

of Fourneau 's salt .
The effect of amyl stovaine is perhaps exaggerated by the smallness of the animal .
In short , on the central nervous system and on the circulation , Fourneau 's salt is less active , and methyl stovaine is .
at most , no more active , than stovaine .
On the central nervous system , amyl stovaine is less active ; on the circulation , its depression is somewhat greater in degree , though more gradual in onset .
These three bodies will be further investigated , on more nearly clinical lines , for the purpose of ascertaining whether their anaesthetic properties may fittingly be employed in medical and surgical practice .
