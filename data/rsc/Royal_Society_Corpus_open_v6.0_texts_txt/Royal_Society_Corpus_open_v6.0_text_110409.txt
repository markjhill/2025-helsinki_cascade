A paper was read , entitled , ( i On the Principle of Construction and General Application of the Negative Achromatic Lens to Telescopes and Eyepieces of every description .
" By Peter Barlow , Esq. , F.R.S. This paper is intended as a more full illustration of the principles on which the negative achromatic lens is constructed and applied , than has been given in the extract from the author 's letter to Mr. Dollond , contained in the paper of the latter , lately read to the Society , on his ingenious application of that lens to the micrometer eyepiece .
The author shows that its advantages are not contined to this instrument , but that it is applicable to any eyepiece positive or negative to the erecting eyepiece , and , indeed , to any telescope of fluid or glass , and also to refractors .
