]\gt ; The pressure in the tube was very low , so that the glass walls fluoresced , the 4686 line appearing only outside the capillary , in accordance with the hrown beans o interferometer , and the ring system was focussed by means of an achromatic lens on to the slit of the spectograph , which consisted of a large Hilger constant deviation spectloscope provided with a camera attachment .
With this instrument a series of photographs could be taken on the same plate .
experiments were conducted as follows:\mdash ; The interferometer plates were set at a small difference of path and a erraph was taken .
The difference of path was then successively increased and a series of exposures was made .
From the series of photographs thus obtained the limiting order could be estimated .
In estimating the limiting order , it will be seen that since on each exposure the order number increases with decreasing wave-length , it is usually possible ( if the differences of path have been suitably chosen ) to pick out some line in which the are just visible .
The determination cannot be made with a high degree of accuracy , but all the photographs taken have yielded concordant results .
