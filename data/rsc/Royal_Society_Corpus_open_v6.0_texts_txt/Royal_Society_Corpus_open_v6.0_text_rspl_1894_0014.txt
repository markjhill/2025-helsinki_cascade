' 41 On Copper Electrolysis in Vacuo .
" By William Gannon , M.A. , " 1851 Exhibition " Scholar , Queen 's College , Galway .
Communicated by Arthur Schuster , F.R.S. Received November 14 , \#151 ; Read December 7 , 1893 .
The following research upon the electrolysis of .
copper sulphate in vacuo was commenced nearly two years ago , at the suggestion of Dr. Schuster , and the experiments were made in the Physical Laboratory of the Owens College .
The electrolysis of copper salts is interesting , not only theoretically as affording a verification of Faraday 's Law of Electrolytes , but also practically on account of its constant use in the graduation of currentmeasuring instruments , such as tangent galvanometers and ammeters .
It is known that copper sulphate in solution does not conform rigorously to the simple form in which Faraday 's law is generally expressed .
Gray , * who made a detailed examination of the electrolysis of copper sulphate , found that the weight of the deposit is very variable in neutral solutions for the same current and the same interval of time ; and he also showed that , in solutions containing a little free sulphuric acid , this inconstancy was removed , but that the weight was a function of the temperature of the solution and of the current density at the cathode .
His results with acid solutions are graphically represented by curves ( partly reproduced at the end of * ' Phil. Mag. , ' vols .

this paper ) , an inspection of which shows that the deposit is heavier the higher the current density and the lower the temperature .
( " Current density " is defined as the ratio of the value of the current in amperes to the total immersed surface of the cathode plate .
) A very possible explanation of this anomaly is furnished by the work of Gore* and Gray , + who independently found that copper dissolves to a very appreciable , though variable , amount in solutions of copper sulphate .
The secondary chemical reactions which follow\#151 ; chiefly the formation of basic salts\#151 ; complicate the electrolysis .
This corrosion of copper plates in the sulphate solution is much diminished if a little free sulphuric acid is present , with the result that the electrolysis of acid solutions yields more consistent results than are obtainable with nearly neutral solutions .
Now , Schuster J found that the loss in weight of copper plates in a solution of copper sulphate does not occur if the air be removed from the solution .
It is therefore very probable that it is the oxygen of the air present in the solution that causes this chemical corrosion ; and hence it was of interest to examine if any difference could be found between the weights of the deposits of two copper voltameters , one of which would be placed in vacuo .
Schuster and CrossleyS showed that the silver deposit is slightly greater in vacuo than in air ; and the experiments tabulated in this paper point out , with certain limitations , a similar result .
The plan of these experiments was simple .
The same current passed through two voltameters connected in series , one being under the ordinary atmospheric pressure and the other in a partial vacuum .
The voltameters , in most of the experiments , consisted of ordinary glass beakers , containing the solutions of copper sulphate , into which dipped three parallel copper plates of the same size , the centre one acting as the cathode , and the side ones forming a double anode .
The plates were held in position by means of German silver clips pressing against vertical brass supports which were attached to an ebonite framework .
One voltameter was placed in an inverted bell-jar , into the neck ( lower part ) of which was fitted an india-rubber cork .
Through the cork , which was coated with Faraday cement , passed three glass tubes , one connected with an exhaust pump and the remaining two containing the leads .
In some of the experiments another tube was introduced , through which was passed into the jar a stream of nitrogen gas previous to exhaustion ; but as this did not give any better results , it was discarded .
At the bottom of the bell-jar inside was a support for the beaker , and on the latter rested * * Nature , * vol. 25 , p. 473 .

the framework with the three plates .
In addition to the voltameter , the jar contained a small mercury gauge .
The upper rim of the jar was ground , and previous to exhaustion was coated with grease , upon which pressed a ground-glass plate .
The current was derived from storage cells , and was measured by a tangent galvanometer or a Thomson 's magnetostatic centiampdremeter ; it was adjusted to the proper value , and kept constant throughout an individual experiment by having in circuit a carbon rheostat and a set of specially prepared resistances of different values .
The copper plates were made of commercial sheet copper ( 24 B.W.G. ) : they were cleaned with emery paper , nitric acid , caustic potash , tap water , and , finally , distilled water , and a deposit was laid on them before being weighed for an actual experiment .
The deposit was treated in the way recommended by Gray ; I found it advantageous to have the distilled water hot , as on removing the plate the deposit dries more quickly , and.consequently the possibility of oxidation occurring is diminished .
The plates , after being in the balance case for a variable period\#151 ; never less than three hours , generally over night\#151 ; were weighed on a 16-in .
Oertling balance , which weighed accurately to 1 tenth-milligram .
The solutions were made by dissolving ordinary commercial sulphate in distilled water and filtering ; the solutions with no free acid added were used immediately , so as to conduct the electrolysis before the formation of basic salts ; the acid solutions contained 1 per cent , free sulphuric acid .
When all the joints were air-tight , by being closed with cement , no difficulty was experienced in retaining the partial vacuum constant throughout each individual experiment .
Leakage of the*current at either voltameter was tested for throughout the experiments , and this point was considered satisfactory when , both voltameters being under atmospheric pressnre , the deposits did not differ by more than 1 or 2 tenth-milligrams .
Particular attention was paid to the handling of the plates before and after each experiment , especially in the replacing in , or removal from , their clips .
By means of a small rod , acting as a lever , friction was prevented between the clips and plates , and hence the slight danger of -loss of copper prevented .
Immediately after the current was stopped in each experiment , the framework holding the plates was quickly removed from the solution and plunged into distilled water so as to remove all solution from the plates\#151 ; oxidation occurs very rapidly if any solution remains on the plates , even for a very short time .
My first object was to ascertain if any difference in the weight of the deposit was caused by placing one voltameter in , without any special regard to the current density ( which throughout all the experiments was the same at both cathodes ) .
The experiments arranged in Table I show an appreciable , though inconstant , differ- Table I 1 Date .

In ten experiments , with the sulphate solution containing no free acid , nine gave a greater deposit vacuo than in air , one giving a negative difference .
In this experiment ( February 18 ) the deposit was not of the usual colour , and it is possible it was oxidised .
Great care was necessary in washing the vacuum deposit , as often the copper was deposited in a loose form at and near the edges ; in the experiments of March 17 and 18 a little of the vacuum deposit was lost in drying between the folds of blotting paper .
It was not to be expected that the experiments in this table would show very concordant results ; as , even presuming that the deposit in vacuo is constant , the inconstancy of deposits in air from neutral solutions would cause an inconstant difference .
In order to get a constant deposit in air , I next added acid to the air solutions and compared the deposits from these with the deposits from a neutral solution in vacuo .
Table II includes experiments conducted in this way : in the experiments of February 24 and 29 some of the vacuum deposit adhered to the blotting paper and was lost .
I cannot account for the negative result of February 25 .
The remaining experiments show fairly concordant differences .
It will be observed from Tables I and II that , with the exception of those experiments in which some of the deposit was mechanically lost , the percentage difference is greater with acid solutions in air than with neutral solutions , which agrees with Gray 's observations that the deposit ( in air ) in neutral solutions is generally higher than in acid solutions .
I have brought together the experiments included in Table III , although the results are very inconsistent and puzzling .
It will be seen that , if the neutral solutions have been used in previous experiments and acid added to them for a fresh experiment , the difference between the weights of the two deposits varies not only in amount but also in sign .
An explanation of this may be that electrolysing a neutral solution changes its chemical constitution , and that adding acid afterwards does not remove all basic salts .
Accepting this possible explanation , I abandoned for the present using neutral sulphate in either voltameter .
In all the remaining experiments described in this paper , both solutions were freshly prepared , not previously used in any experiment , and contained 1 per cent , free sulphuric acid .
The results I have obtained in this way are more concordant and very interesting .
A deposit obtained from a neutral solution in vacuo shows the same looseness in deposition as in air ; but the addition of a little free acid causes the copper to be deposited in a compact form , which is not liable to be lost in the washing or drying .

73 The following tables are not arranged in the order in which the experiments were made .
Table IV includes four experiments in which the current density was approximately 0*007 ampere per square centimetre of " active " cathode , or 1 ampere to 135 sq .
cm .
All the experiments gave the vacuum deposit higher than the air deposit , and the percentage differences agree fairly .
The mean value = 0*16 per cent , at a mean temperature of 18'*1 .
Table V includes three experiments in which the current density was 0*006 ampere per square centimetre .
It will be seen the vacuum deposit is higher than the air deposit in the three experiments .
Mean value of difference = 0*10 per cent , at a mean temperature of 16'*5 .
Table VI includes four experiments at a current density of 0*005 ampere per square centimetre .
' Again the vacuum deposit is higher than the corresponding air deposit. .
Mean value of difference = 0*14 per cent , at a mean temperature of 17'*5 .
Table VII includes five experiments at a current density of 0*004 ampere per square centimetre .
All the vacuum deposits are higher than the corresponding air deposits .
Mean value of the difference = 0*17 per cent , at a mean temperature of 19 ' .
Table VIII includes five experiments at a current density of 0*0033 ampere per square centimetre .
Again deposit in vacuo is higher than the deposit in air .
Mean value of difference == 0*14 per cent , at a mean temperature of 15'*5 .
Table IX includes seven experiments at a current density of 0*0027 ampere per square centimetre .
The same results obtained here as in the preceding tables ; but the experiments of April 12 and 13 do not agree very well with the others .
Mean value of difference = 0*16 per cent , at a mean temperature of 16'*6 .
Table X includes nine experiments in which the strength of current was approximately 0*01 ampere per square centimetre .
This table is very interesting , as showing that near this particular current density the previously observed differences cease to exist .
The nine experiments never gave a greater difference between corresponding deposits than 1 tenth-milligram .
The voltameters were carefully tested for leakage before and after these experiments ; and the experiment of April 7 ( Table IX ) , in which there was a percentage difference of 0*12 , follows that of April 5 , without any alteration in the arrangement of the apparatus .
In addition , the experiments of December 2 and 3 were made with a different bell-jar and a different arrangement from that used in the previous experiments .
It may be fairly concluded that at this density no difference in the deposit exists .
Table XI includes three experiments at a density of 0*02 ampere per square centimetre .
It will be seen that there is practically no difference between the deposits .

Table XII includes three experiments at a density of 0*013 ampere per square centimetre .
The deposits show no difference in weight .
It would thus appear that , at current densities above 0*01 ampere per square centimetre , there is practically no difference in weight of the deposits obtained from solutions of copper sulphate ( made acid ) , one of which is under ordinary atmospheric pressure , and the other under reduced pressure ; but at densities below this there is a very appreciable difference , the deposit in a partial vacuum being always greater than the corresponding deposit in air .
No experiment with acid solutions ever gave the vacuum deposit less than the air deposit .
Why this difference should exist at certain densities and not at others is not very clear .
The chemical corrosion above referred to will be more marked in the air solutions at weak current densities , where the duration of the experiments is three to four hours , but it would not be expected that it would be altogether missing at densities where the duration of the experiments is less than forty minutes and less .
My experiments do not completely reveal the cause of the relations existing between the deposit and current density .
They clearly show , however , that the oxygen present in the solution has a certain diminutive action on the weight of the deposit , and that this action is prevented ( partly or wholly ) by conducting the electrolysis in vacuo .
The removal of the oxygen of the solution prevents the copper plates , and more particularly the copper deposit , from dissolving in the solution ; but it does not prevent ( apparently ) what some physicists speak of as an electrical corrosion , which occurs only when the current is passing through the solution .
It is of interest to draw a curve representing the deposits obtained in vacuo with different current densities .
This I have done by On Copper Electrolysis in Vacuo .
means of the data in Table XIII .
In this table I have collected the chief results of my experiments .
By means of G-ray 's values I have reduced the observed differences to a temperature of 15 ' C. , and then calculated the values in vacuo .
The curve thus obtained is more uniform in its course than the curves for air .

With two copper voltameters containing freshly made neutral solution of copper sulphate , one of which is under reduced pressure , the copper deposit in the partial vacuum is higher ( for the same current , current density , and temperature ) than the deposit under the atmospheric pressure ; but the percentage difference is not constant .
2 .
If a little free sulphuric acid be added to the air solution , the percentage difference is more constant and higher than in 1 .
3 .
The addition of acid to both voltameters causes the ' percentage difference to be constant within experimental errors .
The experiments conducted under this condition show that\#151 ; i. For current densities above O'Ol amp\amp ; re per square centimetre of active cathode , there is no practical difference between the two deposits .
ii .
For current densities below 0'01 ampere per square centimetre , the vacuum deposit is very appreciably higher than the air deposit .
iii .
A curve drawn representing the deposits obtained in vacuo at different current densities is more regular than the air curves , and for densities below 0*01 ampere per square centimetre is approximately a straight line .
