" On Chemical Affinity , and the Solubility of the Sulphate of Baryta in Acid Liquors .
" By F. CRACE CALVERT , Esq. Communicated by WILLIAM ALLEN MILLER , M.D. , F.R.S. Received October 27 , 1855 .
Solubility of the Sulphate of Baryta .
The author observes that sulphate of baryta is not an insoluble salt , as is generally admitted , for he has found that 1000 grs. of nitric acid , of spec .
grav .
1'167 , are capable of dissolving 2 grs. of sulphate of baryta ; and what renders the knowledge of this fact still more useful in analytical chemistry is , that the insolubility of this salt is affected even by the weakest nitric or hydrochloric acids ; for whilst 0'062 gr. of sulphate of baryta only requires 1000 grs. of nitric acid , of spec .
grav .
1'032 , to hold it in solution , the same quantity of salt requires 50'000 grs. of pure distilled water to dissolve it .
What is not less useful to know is , that the solubility of sulphate of baryta is affected in a higher degree by the bulk of the acid than by its strength .
The two following tables , taken from amongst many others contained in the paper , will not only illustrate this fact , but will also give an insight into the way in which the experiments were conducted .
The first table illustrates the influence which increasing bulks of the same nitric acid exert on the formation of sulphate of baryta , and the second table the action which increasing strengths of acid have : TABLE XVI .

These tables clearly show the influence which a given strength of nitric acid has on the solubility of the sulphate of baryta ; for there is a precipitate in three minutes in all the jars of the first table , whilst we have a precipitate only in the first four jars of Table II .
Another fact which is observed in these tables is , that whilst 240 divisions of the alkalimeter of nitric acid , spec .
grav .
1'167 , are capable of dissolving , or preventing the formation of , 4'46 grs. of sulphate of baryta , 240 divisions of an acid , of spec .
grav .
1'032 , only retained in solution 0'086 gr. It follows from these facts , that in future the practice of rendering liquors acid with nitric or hydrochloric acids , must be discontinued when sulphates are to be determined , or separated from chromates , phosphates , &amp;c. Influence of Mass on Chemical Affinity .
The researches of the author , to illustrate the influence which mass exerts on chemical affinity , are extensive ; a few of the results arrived at are here given .
The following table will clearly show the marked influence which increasing volumes of nitric acid have in preventing the formation of sulphate of baryta : TABLE IV .

None Thus in this table we perceive , that as the bulk of acid increases , more time is required for a precipitate to appear , although there is a large excess of substance employed on the quantity necessary to give an instantaneous precipitate ; and it is curious to observe how wide is the space of time in each successive jar for a precipitate to appear , and in jars numbers 9 and 10 no deposits were formed after twenty-four hours .
As the quantity of precipitate decreased rapidly in each successive jar , they were gathered , and their amount determlined with due care ; and these are the facts observed : TABLE V.

But the relative bulk of acid is not the only influence which affects the affinity of sulphuric acid for baryta , as the relative quantities of nitrate of baryta and sulphate of potash put in presence also exert an action .
This fact is illustrated by the following results , taken from three different tables , in which the same quantities of acid were used , but different proportions of salts : TABLE IV .

grav .
1'167 , and the respective quality of salts employed , but that the relative quantity of matter put in presence has a decided influence on chemical affinity ; and these observations not only corroborate perfectly the results obtained by Mr. Bunsen on the influence of volumes on the combination of gases , and the observations which show a like influence on the carbonates , but also are , I believe , the first instance which has been noticed of irregularity of solubility of a substance in increased multiple bulks of a liquid .
