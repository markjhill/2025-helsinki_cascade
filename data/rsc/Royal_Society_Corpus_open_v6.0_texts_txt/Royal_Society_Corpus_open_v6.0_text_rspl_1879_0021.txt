151 I. " On the Existence of Liebreich 's Protagon in the Brain .
" By Professor Arthur G-amgee , M.D. , F.R.S. , Owens College , Manchester , and Ernst Blankenhorn , Ph. D. Received April 29 , 1879 .
In the year 1865 , Dr. Oscar Liebreich published an important paper* upon a new proximate principle which he had separated from the brain .
Unlike the numerous bodies , possessed of ill-defined properties which had , by different writers , received the names of cerebrin , cerebric acid , lecithine , or phosphorized fats , this new body could be extracted by an easy process in a state of purity , and to it , probably as indicating it as the first definitively ascertained specific constituent of brain , Liebreich ascribed the name of Protagon ( rrpuTayos , leading in advance ) .
The substance was obtained by the following process .
An animal was bled to death from the carotid , and a stream of water was passed through the vessels of the head , so as to wash the blood out .
The brain , freed from its membranes , was then pounded in a mortar and shaken in a flask with ether and water at 0 ' C. It was allowed to stand at a temperature of 0 ' , until the ether had separated , and the treatment with ether again and again repeated .
The brain matter having been separated by filtration from ether and water , was digested with 85 per cent , alcohol , at a temperature of 45 ' C. The fluid was filtered hot and allowed to cool at 0 ' C. A flocculent precipitate then separated , which was collected on a filter and treated with cold ether , until it ceased to dissolve cholesterin .
The insoluble mass was dried in vacuo , and dissolved in spirit at 45 ' C. The alcoholic solution was filtered and allowed to cool very gradually , when protagon separated in the form of microscopical needles , differing a little in arrangement and form according to the concentration of the solution .
The substance thus obtained could be recrystallized repeatedly .
As a result of his analyses Liebreich ascribed to protagon the formula C116H241N022P .
The following exhibits the percentage composition of protagon according to this formula and the mean of all Liebreich 's analyses :\#151 ; Calculated for C116H241N4O22P .

[ June 19 , Protagon is soluble with difficulty in cold , but more easily in warm alcohol and ether .
At higher temperatures than 55 ' C. , alcohol appears to decompose protagon .
In water protagon swells and presents the appearance of an opaque jelly , ultimately dissolving so as to form an opaque solution .
Liebreich found that protagon was soluble in glacial acetic acid , which deposited it again in a crystalline form , when subjected to the action of cold .
When boiled with a solution of barium hydrate protagon is decomposed , yielding glycerin\#151 ; phosphoric acid , fatty acids of which he isolated stearic acid in a state of purity , and a base to which he gave the name of neurine , and to the platinum compound of which he ascribed the formula C5H14NCl3Pt .
This base was afterwards shown to be identical with the base which Strecker had separated from bile and termed choline .
Although the absolute accuracy of a large number of Liebreich 's facts has been placed beyond question , the cardinal fact itself\#151 ; that protagon is a definite phosphorized principle contained in nervous matter\#151 ; has come to be universally denied .
By Diaconow , Hoppe-Seyler , and Thudichum it is denied that any such definite substance exists , and Liebreich 's protagon is held to be a mechanical admixture of a phosphorized body termed lecithin , C^HgoUPOg , with a nitrogenous , non-phosphorized , body termed cere-brin .
The* presence of phosphorus in protagon is said to be due to contamination with lecithin , and in support of this view it is alleged that by extracting protagon with ether , the substance loses more and more phosphorus ; according to Diaconow and Hoppe-Seyler 's admission , the phosphorus does adhere most obstinately and cannot be entirely got rid of , though Dr. Thudichum thinks he has , by mere extraction with ether , obtained cerebrin ( or cerebrines ) quite free from phosphorus .
It is not our intention in this communication to enter into a full criticism of the views of those who have preceded us in the investigation of the existence or non-existence of protagon , and we shall confine ourselves to a statement of a few of the chief objections which appeared to us as insurmountable obstacles in the way of accepting Diaconow 's and Hoppe-Seyler 's statements .
Liebreich 's protagon was described by its author as a white non-hygroscopic substance , which could , by suitable treatment , be constantly obtained in a crystalline form , and this description will be shown in the sequel to be absolutely correct .
Cerebrin is a body most imperfectly known , obtained by its discoverer , Muller , * by pounding up brains with baryta water to the con- * Dr. Wilhelm Muller .

] sistence of a thin milk and then boiling ; a precipitate forms , which is extracted with boiling alcohol .
On cooling , the fluid deposits an abundant precipitate ; this is treated with ether , to separate choles-terin and fats , and then recrystallized from boiling alcohol .
Of this body Muller published two analyses , which led him to assign to it the formula C34H33N06 .
It is described by Hoppe-Seyler as a light , white , highly hygroscopic powder.* But what right have we to assume that a body obtained by boiling so complex an organic mixture as a brain with caustic baryta is a proximate principle of the brain , i.e. , that it exists preformed in the brain ?
The surmise is as bold as it is improbable .
Lecithin is described by Diaconow himself as a non-pulverizable , yellowish-white , highly hygroscopic body.f Is it not strange that two usually amorphous highly hygroscopic bodies should , when mixed , give rise to a constantly crystallizable absolutely non-hygroscopic mixture ?
And this is exactly what would be the case were the hypotheses of Diaconow and Hoppe-Seyler correct .
According to Diaconow , by repeated extractions with ether , the P contained in protagon may be made to sink to 1 per cent. , whereas , according to Liebreich 's formula , it should contain 1*5 per cent. Actually , in the three determinations which he made , Liebreich obtained 1*1,1*1 , and 1*5 , as the amount of phosphorus in 100 parts , but , unfortunately , he seems to have concluded that the highest number was correct and made it the basis of his calculation .
In the year 1877 , one of us , assisted by Mr. Leopold Larmuth , Platt Physiological Scholar , commenced in the Physiological Laboratory of Owens College , a series of experiments intended to determine whether Liebreich 's protagon existed or not .
This preliminary investigation showed that by Liebreich 's process there is always obtained a body having the physical properties of protagon , and containing phosphorus in a proportion sufficiently near to that indicated by him ; it was found that the amount of phosphorus in specimens of protagon which had been crystallized from alcohol four or five times , was not smaller than that present in protagon which had only once been crystallized , though a thorough treatment with ether preceded each recrystallization .
These first experiments so far as they went , were perfectly satisfactory .
It appeared , however , quite essential , before forming a definite opinion , to extend them very considerably and especially to * " Auf diese Weise dargestent bildet das Cerebrin ein leichtes weisses sehr hy-groscopisches Pulver , " \amp ; c.

[ June 19 , prove the definite nature of protagon by a large number of analyses , indicating not merely the amount of phosphorus , but also that of the other elements present in it .
This investigation we have lately been able to carry out with all necessary minuteness , and having , to our entire satisfaction , established the real existence of protagon , we communicate the results obtained before proceeding to a fresh study of the products of decomposition of that body .
Process employed in the preparation of Protagon in the present research .
At first we commenced by repeating exactly the process of Liebreicb in all its details ; one of the steps of that process we had found fraught with peculiar difficulty , and we soon ascertained that it could be dispensed with without prejudicially affecting the success of the operations .
The step to which we refer consists in agitating the freshly pounded brain repeatedly with water and ether at 0 ' 0 .
, so long as the ether dissolves considerable quantities of substance , then filtering and placing the insoluble matter into 85 per cent , alcohol at 45 ' C. When pounded brain is so treated with water and ether it swells up and the separation of the ether is most incomplete .
The process of filtration is one which is attended with great difficulty , even when carried out in the only way in which we found it possible , viz. , in the woven bags sold for household purposes for straining jellies , \amp ; c. By the kindness of Professor Osborne Reynolds , F.R.S. , a small model of a centrifugal hydro-extractor , similar to that used in sugar refineries , was constructed for us in the engineering workshop of the Owens College , and was driven by the laboratory steam-engine , and this was for some time efficiently employed in separating the portion of the brain insoluble in water and ether from these fluids .
It was , however , obvious that however prolonged the ether washing , it never succeeded in freeing the brain from cholesterin and other matters soluble in ether , and that the removal of these bodies from protagon was most readily effected at a later stage of the operations .
As , ultimately modified , our process was as follows:\#151 ; Perfectly fresh ox 's brains were freed from blood and from adhering membranes as completely as possible , and were then digested for many hours ( 18 to 24 ) in 85 per cent , alcohol in a large incubator kept constantly at 45 ' C. The fluid was filtered whilst hot , and the insoluble matter was again treated with fresh quantities of spirit , the proceeding being repeated four or five times , as long , indeed , as the filtrate when cooled to 0 ' deposited a fair quantity of white flocculent precipitate .
This precipitate was collected on a filter , and being then transferred to a stoppered bottle was thoroughly and repeatedly agitated with ether , in order to dissolve cholesterin and other bodies soluble in ether .
The ether having been removed , first by decantation 1879 .

and then by filtration , the substance left undissolved by it was first of all dried between sheets of filtering paper in air , and afterwards over sulphuric acid or phosphorus pentoxide .
The resulting mass , which had a snow-white colour , was reduced to powder , moistened with a little water , and digested for many hours with alcohol heated to 45 ' C. From the filtered liquid , if this be allowed to cool very , the protagon separates in the form of microscopic crystals , mostly arranged in rosettes , the appearance and arrangement of which differs somewhat , as Liebreich very exactly pointed out , according to the degree of concentration of the solution .
The once crystallized protagon thus obtained was collected on a filter , washed with ether , and dried first of all in air and ultimately over P205 .
It was then recrystallized as many times as required , the process always commencing by pulverising :and thoroughly shaking with cold ether .
It appeared to us of special importance not merely to subject to ultimate analysis several different samples of protagon , but specially to subject to ultimate analysis protagon after the second crystallization , and the same protagon after being recrystallized a third time .
In our analyses the C and H were determined by combustions made with lead chromate , with an abundance of reduced copper in the fore part of the combustion tube .
The N determinations were made by Dumas ' method , the phosphorus was determined in some cases by Carius 's method , in others by fusion with sodium carbonate and saltpetre .
The results of every combustion , save two , in which unavoidable accidents occurred , are given below .
