A. Trichromic Vision .
The trichromie in my classification of degrees of colour-perception are those who have only three colour sensations\#151 ; red , green , and violet .
They see only three colours in the bright spectrum and describe it as consisting of red , red-green , green , green-violet and violet .
They apply the designation red-green to the orange and yellow regions of the spectrum and green-violet to the blue region .
There are many degrees and varieties of trichromic vision ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
I have classified the colour-perception of individuals as dichromic , trichromic , tetrachromie , pentachromic , hexachromic , and heptachromic .
This classification is made by estimating the number of definite colours seen in a bright spectrum , and the persons belonging to each class behave in every way as if they possessed the number of colour sensations indicated .
On my theory of colour-vision each colour sensation is separate and distinct and not compounded of two or more fundamental colour sensations .
For instance , there is the strongest evidence that yellow is a simple sensation ( 18 , 24 , 25 , 26 ) and that spectral yellow light does not excite the red and green sensations .
B. Anomalous Trichromatism .
The term anomalous trichromatism is used in the sense of the Young-Helmholtz theory in which all colour sensations are supposed to be made up of different proportions of three fundamental sensations .
A trichromat on this theory is therefore a person with normal colour-perception .
An 1912 .
] Trichromic Vision and Anomalous Trichromatism .
165 anomalous trichromat is a person who is supposed to have three fundamental sensations but they have not the same proportions as in the normal-sighted .
Those are designated anomalous trichromats who , when making the equation X 670 + X 535 = X 589 , use proportions of red and green different from the normal .
At the same time the subjects of this abnormality object to the normal equation .
Those who put too much red in the mixed colour are called red-anomalies and those who put too much green in the mixed colour green-anomalies .
Anomalous trichromatism was discovered by Lord Eayleigh ( 6 ) , who stated that the colour vision is defective only in the sense that it differs from that of the majority .
In 1904 Guttmann ( 8 ) stated that the anomalous trichromats were colour weak and described a number of symptoms similar to those given by me as associated with trichromic vision .
I then examined a number of persons with Eayleigh 's apparatus ( 14 ) and found that many colour-blind persons , both dichromic and trichromic , can make a match which agrees in every particular with that of a normal sighted person .
I could find no evidence that colour weakness was necessarily associated with anomalous trichromatism .
I examined 15 students from Hewnham College on the same afternoon , the conditions being precisely the same for each .
There was considerable variation in the observations and those who made an anomalous equation in every case strongly objected to the normal match .
I could find no evidence of colour-blindness in any of those examined .
All saw yellow in the spectrum .
Of the 15 examined , five made the normal match exactly and one required slightly more green , the others more red in proportions varying in different cases ; there was considerable difference between the two extremes , one requiring nearly twice as much red as the other in the mixed colour .
This year Lord Eayleigh kindly lent me his colour-mixing apparatus and I examined 100 women students , 25 belonging to the London County Council training college and 75 to University College .
The last 75 were examined in precisely similar conditions .
The illumination was incandescent electric light and the equation did not vary from day to day .
All were examined with Lord Eayleigh 's colour-mixing apparatus ; 51 were examined by some kind of test for colour-blindness , and 36 of these were examined by my lantern .
I have designated as " anomalies " those who , on an average of a number of observations , had a deviation of more than one whole division from the normal and did not agree with the normal equation .
The colour-mixing instrument of Eayleigh was arranged so that 0 corresponded to full red and 25 to full green .
Then by the laws of double refraction the exact proportions of red Dr. F. W. Edridge-Green .
[ Nov. 15 , and green in any mixture can be ascertained .
For instance , 12 73 corresponds to a ratio of intensity 1-061 green/ red , and 10*371 to 0*5829 green/ red .
The other figures can be easily understood by remembering that a difference of one-tenth of a division corresponds to a difference of about 2\ per cent , in the ratio of intensities of red to green when the figures are in the neighbourhood of normal vision .
Out of the hundred examined , 86 made the normal equation or within one division on either side of it , 12 were anomalous trichromats , 10 being red-anomalies and 2 being green-anomalies .
Two others on an average of live observations appeared as anomalies ( one 1*3 red , the other 2'0 green ) , but , as they both agreed with the normal equation , they do not come under the definition .
Excluding the last mentioned , who were to a certain extent colour blind , none of the anomalies were found to be colour defective .
Of those who made the normal match 9 were found to be colour defective .
No. 1 of the green-anomalies was examined very carefully on three occasions ; there was no evidence of colour-blindness ; she passed my ordinary lantern test and also my triple lantern with ease and accuracy , and saw red and green through small apertures as far as I did .
She also passed my bead test .
Examination with Spectrometer.\#151 ; Pure yellow was isolated at 5770 to X 5882 .
This is quite normal .
The area of greatest luminosity was \ 5697 to X 5795 ; this is considerably to the green side of the maximum of the normal luminosity curve .
She marked out 18 monochromatic divisions in the spectrum .
This is the normal number ; she also named all the colours red , orange , yellow , green , blue , and violet correctly .
I have also examined a large number of men and find that when there is a large mean deviation there is colour weakness .
The following case is instructive as an example of a high grade green-anomaly without any trace of colour weakness .

A 407 It will be noticed that the region regarded by the normal-sighted as orange-yellow is named and seen by him as greenish yellow .
This gives an explanation of the anomalous trichromatism .
If the region to be matched appears greener than usual , it will obviously require more green and less red in the mixed colour .
These were the results of single observations ; the available time would not admit of more and they clearly confirm the other tests .
Dr. F. W. Edridge-Green .
[ Nov. 15 , The Relation between Trichromic Vision and Anomalous Trichromatism .
Anomalous trichromatism should be clearly defined as the condition in which anomalous matches are made by a person who refuses to accept the normal match .
Much confusion exists on this point ; a person who agrees with the normal equation cannot be regarded as an anomalous trichromat oven though he agrees at the same time with the anomalous matches .
This is only evidence of colour weakness , inasmuch as both equations are regarded as satisfactory .
There are many anomalous trichomats who are not colour weak and there are many trichromics who make absolutely normal equations .
Trichromic vision in my classification is therefore not synonymous with anomalous trichromatism .
There are also persons who will make the normal equation in one set of circumstances and anomalous equations in another ( 14 ) .
There are also those who will make normal equations when the red employed is X670 but will make an anomalous equation with a red of larger wave-length , as for instance X 690 , putting twice as much red in the mixture compared with the normal equation in similar circumstances ( 16 ) .
Anomalous trichromatism when too much red is put in the mixed colour may correspond to defect in the perception of certain red rays , namely those employed in the mixed colour .
I have shown ( 5 ) that when there is shortening or much defect in the perception of red the junctions of the other colours are shifted towards the violet end of the spectrum .
The yellow , therefore , corresponding to the D line , is seen as a much redder colour than the normal , and if we consider that the green is similar to the normal it is obvious that more red will be put in the mixture than by the normal-sighted .
This shortening of the spectrum may be associated with normal vision in other respects or with any degree of defective colour differentiation , that is to say , it may be associated with dichromic , trichromic , tetrachromie , penta-chromic , hexachromic or heptachromic vision .
A similar condition is also found for the violet end of the spectrum .
It is obvious that a man , who has shortening of the red end of the spectrum or defect in the perception of red , is colour weak as far as red is concerned .
Unless , however , he has defective hue perception he may make no other error than that directly connected with the defective perception of certain red rays .
It is different with those who make an anomalous match in which too much green is put in the mixed colour .
As found by Rayleigh ( 6 ) , Kollner ( 20 ) , v. Kries ( 10 ) , Nagel ( 13 ) , and myself ( 14 ) , a man may make an anomalous match without presenting any other colour defect .
I have found 25 per cent , of men to be more or less colour weak , and it is , therefore not surprising that anomalous trichromatism 1912 .
] TrichromicVision and Anomalous Trichromatism .
169 is frequently associated with colour weakness .
The colour weak are also particularly liable to fail in making an equation , but in addition to making the anomalous equation they are in most cases satisfied with that of the normal .
Anomalous trichromatism cannot be due to the diminution of a green sensation in the sense of the Young-Helmholtz theory .
Apart from the fact that I have shown that yellow is a simple and not a compound sensation ( 18 , 24 , 25 , 26 ) , there would be no reason why more green should be required in making the compound yellow , since the simple yellow would also contain less of the hypothetical green sensation .
If whilst the yellow remains as in the normal the sensitiveness to green light were diminished or to red increased we should have an explanation of the facts .
Schuster ( 19 ) found that the position selected as pure yellow was the same with the green-anomaly as with the normal-sighted .
Whilst there are red-anomalies who show weakness for red , there are others who do not , and this may be explained by an increased sensitiveness to green whilst the red and yellow remain as in the normal .
Summary .
1 .
Trichromic vision is not synonymous with anomalous trichromatism .
2 .
Many persons with otherwise normal colour-perception make an anomalous equation .
3 .
Many colour-blind persons ( dichromics and triehromics ) make an absolutely normal match with no greater mean deviation than the normal .
4 .
Colour weakness is not characteristic of anomalous trichromatism but of trichromic vision .
5 .
Anomalous trichromatism and colour weakness are not synonymous .
6 .
A large mean deviation indicates colour weakness .
7 .
Anomalous trichromatism appears to be due to an alteration in the normal relations of the response to the three colours ( lights ) used in the equation .
If the eye be more or less sensitive to one of the components of the mixed colour whilst the other has its normal effect , an anomalous equation will result .
An anomalous equation will also result when the yellow is more allied to green or red than is normal .
