" On the Secondary Carpals , Metacarpals , and Digital Rays in the Wings of existing Carinate Birds .
" By W. K. Parker , F.R.S. Received January 11 , 1888 .
In a paper On the Morphology of Birds , " already sent in to the Royal Society , but not yet published , I have described certain additional parts in the wings of Gallinaceous birds .
One of these lies on the radial side of the first metacarpal ; the other two are on the ulnar side of the second and third metacarpals .
These parts , which at first caused me considerable surprise , being wholly unexpected by me , are only part of what I have since found in other families .
During the past year I have worked out the development of the skeleton in the Duck tribe ( " Anatidae " ) , in the Auk tribe ( " Alcidue " ) , and in the Gull tribe ( a Daridse " ) , and to some degree in some other families .
The subject appears to me to be of great interest , and I have , through various English and American friends , obtained many scores of embryos and young birds , \amp ; c. , that I may be able to trace * * This line is seen as a pretty bright line in the spectrum of the Limerick meteorite , but its origin has not yet been determined , although comparisons have been made with most of the common elements .
So far , it has not been observed in any other meteorite .
1888.J Wings of existing Carinate Birds .
these parts in every main group of the Class .
Normally , both , the existing Carinatse and Ratitee , and such extinct forms as have been worked out\#151 ; Archaeopteryx\gt ; Hesperomis , Ichthyornis\#151 ; show that the primary form of the bird 's wing is simply tri-digitate .
In this I agree with Baur , who has helped me greatly in this matter , both by his valuable papers and also by personal discussion with me .
The normal 44 manus " of a carinate bird contains two permanently distinct carpals : three carpals that lose their independence by ankylosis with the metacarpals , and three digital rays extending from the three fused metacarpals .
In some birds , e.g*y the Passerinae , the pollex of the first digit has only one phalanx attached to its short metacarpal , the second only two , and the third only one , phalanx .
In others , Plovers , Gulls , Cormorants , \amp ; c. , an additional or ungual phalanx is found on the first and second digit ; and in some birds , e.g. , Numenius , during their embryonic state , a small nucleus arm is seen on the Ond of the aborted phalanx of the third digit .
In my as yet unpublished paper I have mentioned a sub-distinct tract of very solid fibro-cartilage , which evidently corresponds with what has been called u prae-pollex " by Kehrer and others.* I am satisfied , now , that this very notable part is the remnant of the skeleton of the spury so remarkably developed in the Palamedidse , certain Geese , Plovers , and Jacanas .
This part therefore need not interfere with the consideration of the true secondary digital parts .
Among the last communications received by me from Dr. Baur , I find in print what I had already learned from him orally .
In some 44 General Notes " published in the 4 American Naturalist , September , 1887 , p. 839 , I find the following paragraph : 44 The oldest Ichthyopterygia had few phalanges and not more than five digits ; [ the ] radius and ulna were longer than broad , and separated by a space .
Later , through the adaptation to the water , more phalanges were developed , more digits appeared , mostly by division of the former , or by new formation on the ulnar side .
I have never found a new digit developed on the radial side .
" These are most important facts , some of which , namely , the bifurcation of the digital rays , I had received some light upon , before , both from Dr. Gadow and from Professor D'Arcy W. Thompson.t I find that the carpusy metacarpus , and digital rays are all apt to increase in number beyond what is normal .

On the Wings of existing Carinate Birds .
[ Jan. 19 , Long ago I found , in one of the Palamedidse , CJiauna two ulnar carpals , apparently an " ulnare " proper , and " centrale .
" More recently in the embryo of a more normal Chenomorph\#151 ; the Falkland Island Goose ( Chloephaga ) I found the ulnare nearly divided into two segments .
On the other side of the carpus in an embryo Kestrel ( Falco culus ) and in a young Sparrow-hawk ( I found a radiale in two pieces , the outer of which in the latter was degenerating into the large " os prominens " which is found in the tendon of the " tensor patagii " muscle of rapacious birds .
In the embryos of Gulls , Auks , Guillemots , \amp ; c. , the large " distal carpal " of the index or second digit sends forward a long wedge of cartilage towards an additional metacarpal nucleus .
Evidently this is the rudiment of another carpal seeking to be attached to its own intercalary metacarpal .
Further on , on the large second digit , the flat dilated part of the proximal phalanx , on its ulnar side , also , is developed from a distinct tract of true cartilage , but soon loses its independence ; it forms the plate on which some of the primary quills are fixed .
Further on , on the ulnar side , near the small well-developed ungual phalanx of the embryo , but later , after hatching , a small oval cartilage appears , and is ossified independently .
A similar tract of cartilage is formed on the pollex or first dio-it , also , but is somewhat smaller than that on the second ; it is on the ulnar side and near the ungual phalanx .
In the feeble third digit I only find a rudimentary secondary metacarpal , on the ulnar side ; this is very constant throughout the CarinatcB ; and sometimes , as I have already mentioned , there is a small rudiment of a second phalanx on that digit which , in the Lizard , has four phalanges.* In seeking for evidence of the manner in which these high and noble hot-blooded feathered forms arose from among the Archaic Reptilia , I think that something has been gained , in what I have stated above .
The skull brings evidence of the same sort , during its development , and it is to ancient long-beaked forms , and not to modern short-faced types of Reptilia , that we must look for any near relationship of the Reptiles in the Birds .
In the Guillemot ( JJria troile)I have satisfied myself that there has been a considerable amount of secular shortening of the beak ( rostrum and fore part of mandibles ) , and if we look at Dr. Marsh 's figures of Hesperornisand Ichthyornis we shall see what long bills these toothed birds possessed .
* The figures of these parts , and also of the rest of the developing skeleton in these birds Ducks , Auks , Guillemots , \amp ; c.\#151 ; are ready for publication . .

] But there is no part of a developing bird 's skeleton that is not rich with suggestive facts of this kind , as I propose to show in due time .
