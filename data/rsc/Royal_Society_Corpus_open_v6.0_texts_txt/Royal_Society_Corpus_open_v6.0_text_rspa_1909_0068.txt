) Part I. It is well known that if a piece of iron be subjected to a considerable magnetising force and then be tested for permeability corresponding to a lower force , the permeability so obtained may differ widely from the permeability which would have been obtained had the material been previously demagnetised .
The effects of previous history have been studied by a good many experimenters , notably by Searle.* The object of this part of the present paper is to examine the effect of previous history upon the dissipation of energy by magnetic hysteresis .
Suppose in fig. 1 that a piece of iron is carefully demagnetised and that the hysteresis loop No. 1 corresponding to a force H is obtained .
This loop is symmetrical about the origin in all respects and its area gives the loss usually referred to in testing work .
Suppose that the last value of the force H is positive and that it be increased to a value Hi , reversed a few times , and reduced to zero from its positive value .
After re-applying the force H and reversing it a sufficient number of times to produce stability , a loop such as No. 2 will be obtained .
As is well known , this loop shows * See 'Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , ' vol. 34 , Part 170 , p. 55 , " Studies !

[ May 4 , a reduced change of magnetic induction and , consequently , a reduced permeability .
Suppose , now , that the iron is carefully demagnetised and that a magnetising force supplied by an independent source is applied very gradually , so that when added to the original force H it gives a force H3 such that the change of magnetic induction corresponding to a change of the force H is exactly equal to the change observed with loop 2 for the same change of H. The loop obtained will appear as No. 3 in fig. 1 .
We have now obtained two loops , Nos. 2 and 3 , each having the same change of magnetic induction , and each having the same net change of force H. The change from loop 1 to loop 2 has been brought about by inter-molecular force , whereas the change from loop 1 to loop 3 has been brought about by the application of an externally applied constant force H3\#151 ; H. If the effect of inter-molecular force were capable of being exactly equivalent to the externally applied constant force , one would expect to find that the energy required to perform a complete cycle would be the same in each case ; that is , the area of loop 2 would be equal to the area of loop 3 .
Two rings built up of stampings of Stalloy and Lohys respectively have been experimented upon and have already formed the subject of a communication.* The method of test employs a ballistic galvanometer and has * See 'Roy .

The distinguishing feature of Stalloy is that it contains about 3 per cent , of silicon , and Lohys is a good grade of transformer iron . . .

3 already been described.* Each experiment involved the following operations :\#151 ; 1 .
The ring was carefully demagnetised by placing it in circuit with an alternator having a frequency of 50 , f and gradually reducing the magnetising force to zero from a value of 6 to 9 C.G.S. units , which is much larger than that corresponding to maximum permeability .
This operation usually takes a quarter of an hour to perform and when it is subsequently mentioned that the ring was demagnetised it is meant that the above operation has taken place .
2 .
After reversing a chosen force H about 100 times loop 1 was obtained , and the force left positive and removed .
3 .
A higher force Hi was then applied in a negative direction , reversed 50 times and reduced to zero from its positive value .
This operation determined the amount of the previous history .
4 .
The force H was again applied negatively and reversed 200 times .
Several values of the total change of magnetic induction corresponding to a reversal of H and to the reducing of H from its positive and negative maximum values to zero were obtained , and if these did not repeat , another 100 reversals of H were applied and so on until stability was obtained .
5 .
Loop 2 was then obtained and its absolute value B4 was found as follows:\#151 ; The magnetising force was reduced from its positive maximum value H to zero , and the change of magnetic induction noted .
The change of magnetic induction produced by applying a positive force much longer than H was measured .
This larger force was then reversed twice and the corresponding changes of magnetic induction observed .
The same force was then reversed 50 times , after which the changes of magnetic induction were again noted .
If these last changes had the same value as the first it was assumed that the absolute value on the*B axis was the difference between one-half of the total change produced by reversal of the larger force and the change found originally when the force was increased from zero to its larger value .
The absolute value B4 was obtained by adding the change observed when the force H was originally removed .
The ring was then demagnetised .
6 .
The force H was applied positively , and by aid of a tertiary coil a force H3\#151 ; H was applied gradually ; at each step reversals of H were made and the resulting change of magnetic induction noted .
About 50 reversals of H were made at each step until the proper value of the current in the tertiary coil was nearly reached ; several hundreds of reversals were then .

[ May 4 , given .
Finally , such a value of H3\#151 ; H was obtained that the resulting change of induction 2 B3 was equal to 2 B2 .
7 .
Loop 3 was then observed , care being taken to see that the maximum value of B3 was the same at the end of test as at the commencement .
The absolute value of the loop B5 was then obtained as before and the ring demagnetised .
The results are plotted in fig. 2 , in which the abscissa is the value of Hi , the force applied to obtain previous history , and the ordinate is the difference of the area of loops 2 and 3 expressed as a percentage of the area of loop 2 .
Each curve corresponds to the reversal of a given value of H which is noted in the figure .
Fig. 2 .
In fig. 1 the symmetrical loop 4 , correspondirfg to a force H4 , has a value of magnetic induction equal to B2 or B3 .
In a large number of cases the changes of magnetic induction for loops 2 and 3 respectively are equal .
In others , where there is a small difference , the area of loop 3 has been corrected by an application of Steinmetz ' law .
Fig. 3 has been taken from fig. 2 and shows the relation between the percentage difference of area and the values of H for a given previous history Hi .
It will be noticed in fig. 2 that of the chosen values of H the intermediate value 0*552 gives the largest ordinate . . .

5 The conclusion arrived at is that iron may be in one or other of two states according to treatment .
In each state it gives exactly the same change of magnetic induction for the same change in the magnetising force , and yet the Fig. 3 .
energy required to effect the cyclical change is different in the two cases .
The magnitude of the effect depends upon the value of the reversed force and the value of the force producing previous history .
In all cases where there is a difference in the energy dissipated , the iron requires more energy when in the state following the application of a larger force to produce previous history .
With regard to the relative shapes of the loops it may be remarked that when the unsymmetrical loop No. 2 is plotted about an origin common with loop No. 3 , the difference in area is brought about in the following manner .
In all cases within the limits of the experiment the right-hand side of loop No. 3 lies within the right-hand side of loop No. 2 .
With regard to the left-hand side of the loops it may be remarked that when the previous history is large for a comparatively small value of H , loop No. 3 lies wholly inside loop No. 2 .
As the value of H is increased for large previous history this effect is ultimately reversed .
When the previous history is small , the left-hand side of loop No. 3 is wholly outside that of loop No. 2 .
Figs. 4 and 5 show the effects for a large previous history , and fig. 6 for a small previous history .
Fig. 7 is interesting as it shows the relation between the required force due to the tertiary coil H3\#151 ; H and the previous history force Hi .
Each curve has marked upon it the corresponding value of H. Fig. 8 shows the relation between the absolute values B4 , B5 ( see fig. 1 ) and previous history force Hi .
It will be noticed that they are similar to those in fig. 2 .
Fig. 9 shows the relation between the absolute values B3 , B4 , and 6 .

Part II .
This part of the paper deals with an effect attributed to magnetic viscosity already observed and well known .
If , when observing a loop for magnetic hysteresis , the force be varied from one maximum value through zero to a value equal to the then coercive force , and if the key in the secondary circuit containing the ballistic galvanometer be closed at known instants after such change , a deflection will be observed in some cases after 10 or more seconds have elapsed.* This effect has been examined in the present cases and has been found to be very small .
Table I gives the change of magnetic induction ( expressed as a percentage of the total change ) observed when the galvanometer key is closed at stated times after the magnetic force is changed from its maximum value through zero to the then value of the coercive force .
Table II gives corresponding results when the magnetic force is varied from its positive to its negative maximum value .
The results previously obtained from solid specimens of pure iron and soft cast steel are included in Tables I and II .

Further experiments are being made to discover how far these effects in a material of given composition are dependent upon the degree of lamination .
The above experiments were carried out in the Siemens Electrical Engineering Laboratory , King 's College , London .
