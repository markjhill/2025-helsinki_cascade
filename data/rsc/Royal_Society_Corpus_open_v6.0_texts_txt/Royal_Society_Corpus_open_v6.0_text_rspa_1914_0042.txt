The Magnetic Properties of Iron .
The large specific effects produced by traces of different gases seem to indicate that ( b ) may be an important factor .

The experiments cannot be held either to prove that the emission of electrons from hot carbon is an immediate consequence of chemical action between the carbon and the surrounding gases : or to invalidate those theories which regard this effect as a physical property of the hot solid .
The Magnetic Properties of Iron when Shielded from the Earth !
s Magnetism .
By Ernest Wilson .
( Communicated by Prof. J. A. Fleming , F.R.S. Received January 10 , \#151 ; Read February 26 , 1914 .
) The primary object of the experiments described in this paper is to examine the magnetic properties of iron under small magnetic forces when shielded from the earth 's magnetism .
In a previous paper* experiments were described in which these magnetic properties were examined at low forces , and hysteresis loops obtained at maximum values of the magnetic induction as low as 0'937 .
The specimen , which was of the same material as used in the present experiments , was exposed to the influence of the earth 's magnetism , and it is this influence which has now been removed as far as possible .
The specimen is of ring form and is built up to an axial length of 38*8 cm .
of stampings of an alloy of iron known as " Stalloy , " containing 3 per cent , of silicon .
The internal and external diameters of each stamping are 7*6 and 12'75 cm .
respectively , and the thickness varies from 0"34 to 0*14 cm .
The secondary winding is next to the stampings and has 177 turns of copper wire 0 81 mm. diameter insulated by cotton impregnated with paraffin .
The primary or magnetising winding has 10 turns of copper strip 19 mm. wide and 0T3 mm. thick covered with insulating tape .
The shield is built up to a length of 47 cm .
of stampings of transformer iron 0*62 mm. thick .
The internal and external diameters of each stamping are 305 and 40*6 cm .
respectively .
At each end are discs of soft iron 40-6 cm .
diameter which together with two square end plates make up an overall length of 56 cm .
The shield is firmly clamped by four bolts passing through * * Roy .

The Magnetic Properties of the end plates .
For the insertion of the primary and secondary windings a few of the stampings nearest to the end discs have a small piece cut away so as to form a narrow opening into the shield .
The specimen is supported symmetrically within the shield and their common axis is placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian .
Throughout the experiments the ballistic galvanometer has been used .
When it was desired to demagnetise the specimen , an alternator was used whose wave-form is a smooth curve having a maximum ordinate somewhat larger than that of an equivalent sine curve , and the current was gradually reduced by variation of resistance until it was of the order 4 x 10-4 amp\amp ; re , the alternator being finally allowed to come to rest with its excitation left on .
In Table I will be found , for the respective experiments which are numbered , the magnetic induction B and in some cases the permeability / a corresponding to the given force H. In Table II will be found the figures obtained at the higher forces .
In Table III will be found the results obtained from the hysteresis loops .
/ Preliminary " experiments were made when the specimen was inside the shield in the virgin state , that is to say , as received from the makers and in a demagnetised state , the maximum magnetic force impressed upon the specimen being 0'59 C.G-.S .
unit .
At this stage it was discovered that the insulation of the secondary winding was defective , and this threw a criticism upon the experiments .
It is necessary to mention this because the previous magnetic history of the specimen is important , and the results will be alluded to later . .
The specimen was re-wound , and the experiments made thereafter may be placed in the following order .
Experiment 1 : Specimen out of shield and exposed to the influence of the earth 's magnetism .
Hysteresis loops obtained .
Experiment s : Specimen in shield .
Hysteresis loops obtained after careful demagnetisation from a force of 059 .
Experiments 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 : Specimen in shield and showing how high permeability was produced .
Experiments 6 , 7 , 8 : Specimen in shield and showing the effect on permeability of allowing it to rest in a highly magnetised state .
Experiments 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 : Specimen in shield and showing the effect of allowing it to rest in a less highly magnetised state .
Experiments 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 : Specimen in shield and showing the effect of allowing it to rest in a demagnetised condition .
Experiments 18 , 19 , 20 : Specimen in shield .
Hysteresis loops obtained after a moderate rest in demagnetised condition .

I. Permeability .
Experiments 1,2 : Before placing the specimen in the shield , Experiment 1 was made after demagnetisation from a force 0*3 at 52 complete periods per second .
For each of the forces mentioned in Table I a hysteresis loop was obtained , the details of which are given in Table III .
When in the shield the specimen was demagnetised from a force of 0*59 , and Experiment 2 was made .
Hysteresis loops were again obtained for the same forces as in Experiment 1 .
The permeability curves 1 , 2 , are plotted in fig. 1 , and correspond to Experiments 1 , 2 , respectively .
For comparison , the curve of permeability obtained in the previous paper ( cit. ) is also plotted .
This curve is somewhat higher than in Experiment 1 , and in this connection it should be noted that the demagnetisation had been made from a much higher force than 0*59 .
Hear the origin it differs in shape from those obtained in Experiments 1 , 2 .
Experiments 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , on the production of high permeability : Up to this point it should he noted that the highest force ever applied to the specimen has been 0*59 , and , at the close of Experiment 2 , the specimen was left magnetised as the result of a force 0*0935 , and eight days elapsed before further experiments were made .
At the end of this time a magnetising force of 0*8 , due to a continuous current , was applied , reversed a few times , and removed .
Such a force as 0*8 applied to a demagnetised specimen has , in ordinary magnetic testing , a degrading or polarising effect , that is , the magnetic induction corresponding to a given smaller force is then lower than it would have been had the iron been in a demagnetised state originally.* In the shield , however , the reverse is the case , the specimen having been previously exposed to the earth 's magnetism , and not subjected to so high a force as 0*8 .
A comparison of the figures obtained in Experiments 2 and 3 , Table I , shows the increase in the permeability at the low forces .
A comparison of curves 2 , 5 , in fig. 1 shows in the early stages how great is the increase in permeability caused by carefully demagnetising the polarised specimen .
Experiment 6 was next made to investigate the effect on permeability at higher forces than those given in Table I. It is practically a continuation of Experiment 5 and the figures are given in Table II .
In fig. 2 the curve 6 shows the result obtained , and , for the purpose of comparison , the values of the permeability obtained in the earlier paper ( loc. cit. ) .
A maximum permeability of 5750 corresponding to a magnetic induction of 5500 is indicated , whereas the old experiments on the unshielded but * ' Roy .
Soc. Proc. , ' A , vol. 83 , p. 1 ( 1909 ) .
182 Prof. E. Wilson , The Magnetic Properties of carefully demagnetised specimen show a maximum of 4600 for a magnetic induction of 5000 .
In the case of a specimen of almost pure iron a permeability of 5480 , corresponding to a magnetic induction of 9100 , was obtained , * and this is a high value .
Experiments 6 , 7 , 8 , deal with the effect of resting the Specimen when in a magnetised condition .
Experiment 7 was made immediately after ExperiFig .
h meant 6 was completed , that is without demagnetising the specimen , and in Experiment 6 the force was taken up to T8 .
The result shows how greatly the permeability is affected in the earlier stages by the application of this previous force of 1*8 .
The specimen was again polarised by a force of 1*8 and left in this condition for about 18 hours .
Experiment 8 was then made * 'Roy .

183 and continued to the higher forces as before , and the figures are given in Table II .
Curve 8 , fig. 1 , shows how greatly the permeability is reduced in the early stages , and Curve 8 , fig. 2 , shows the later stages .
It will be seen that for a magnetic induction of 5500 a permeability of 5900 is obtained , and this is even greater than that shown by Experiment 6 .
Curves 6 , 8 , cross one another at an induction of about 3500 , and coincide when the induction is about 10,000 .
The similarity of Curve 8 in fig. 1 with that taken from the earlier paper is interesting .
In the one case we have the specimen carefully demagnetised and exposed to the earth 's magnetism , in the other the specimen is polarised and shielded .
It is worthy of note that when in the polarised condition of Experiments 7 , 8 , ca , reful 1,000 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 %ooo 8/ 000 9,000 10,000 Brpax .
Fig. 2 .
demagnetisation is required to restore maximum permeability at the lower forces .
Experiments 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , show the effect of two periods of rest when the specimen is left polarised by the application of a force of 0'0935 .
It will be seen that when left the specimen tends to degrade itself or to experience a fall of permeability in the earlier stages , but it gets into a fairly stable state after a long enough interval .
This will be apparent if Experiment 12 be compared with Experiment 16 of the next section .
Experiments 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , show the effect of resting in a carefully demagnetised condition for periods of 3 , 1848 hours and 13 days respectively .
The same ( degrading ) process is at work in the earlier stages , but after 48 hours ' rest the specimen is more stable .
The continuation of Experiment 17 is given in Table II .

The rest of 13 days has produced the most noticeable effect at the lower forces . .

] II .
Hysteresis .
In the previous paper ( loc.cit .
) when the stalloy specimen was exposed to the earth 's magnetism , it appeared that the Steinmetz index increased from its ordinary value of 1*7 to 2'69 , when the magnetic induction reached the value of 0-94 .
The present experiments show that after demagnetisation in or out of the shield the value of the index rises to a maximum in the neighbourhood of a magnetic induction of 3 and then diminishes .
The preliminary experiments made when the specimen was in the virgin state bear out the same remark .
The shape of the loops is well worthy of study .
The loops in fig. 3 are selected from those taken in Experiments 18 and 19 , Fig. 3 .
and it will be seen that as the induction is reduced the shape is altered .
The character of loop 1 , for instance , when the maximum induction is 88*3 , is more like that of the loop with which one is familiar in ordinary testing , but it has sides which for a short distance are practically parallel straight lines .
This is the beginning of a pronounced alteration in shape .
Loop 2 , fig. 3 , shows this carried to a further stage .
Loop 3 is remarkable in that its sides are practically two parallel straight lines , and the index has nearly Iron when Shielded from the Earth 's Magnetism .
187 passed its maximum value .
Eeference should be made to an interesting paper on this subject by Dr. W. M. Thornton.* The Steinmetz equation is that the ergs per cycle per cubic centimetre are equal to \#171 ; B^ , where a and ft are constants and B is the magnetic induction .
The values of a and ft are given in Table III .
As to what would be the values of the index ft if the experiments could be carried further cannot be said at present .
It should be mentioned that the coercive force has been taken from the point where the mean curve cuts the axis of H. It is well known that at this point on the curve the magnetic instability is such that tapping the specimen causes a change in the magnetic induction .
When the force is varied from a positive or negative maximum to zero this instability in some cases asserts itself and would , if a mean curve were not drawn , indicate a somewhat smaller coercive force .
A few loops have been obtained as a continuation of Experiments 18 and 19 at the higher forces when the specimen was in a demagnetised condition and after a rest in that condition of one and a half days .
The particulars are given in Table III , Experiment 20 .
By comparing them with the figures obtained in the earlier paper it will be seen , for instance , that for a magnetic induction of 8200 , the ergs per cycle per cubic centimetre are less when in the shield in the ratio 1300/ 1688 , and the permeability is greater in the ratio 5070/ 3850 .
The coercive force Ho and the residual magnetic induction Bo are less .
The experiments throw light upon the early stages of the ordinary curve , which shows the relation between the coercive force and the intensity of magnetisation ; it resembles the curve connecting the functions H and B of magnetic materials .
Conclusion .
The experiments show that the earth 's magnetism may seriously affect the magnetisability of iron .
Comparing the results obtained in these experiments when stalloy ( in ring form ) is magnetised and then carefully demagnetised whilst shielded from the earth 's magnetism , with the results of similar experiments made on the same material in a carefully demagnetised condition but exposed to the earth 's magnetism , the ratio of the permeabilities has a maximum of 1*79 when the magnetic induction has a value 172 , and the ratio of the maximum permeabilities is 1*24 .
A maximum permeability of 5900 was obtained when the specimen was shielded and magnetised by a previous force of 1*8 C.G.S. units , and this is 1*28 times the maximum permeability obtained from the demagnetised and exposed specimen .

188 The Magnetic Properties of Iron .
dissipation of energy by magnetic hysteresis for a given magnetic induction is less when the stalloy is in the shield and demagnetised than when it is first demagnetised and then exposed to the earth 's magnetism .
The Steinmetz index , after rising to a maximum of about 3 for a force of about 0'008 C.G.S. unit , begins to diminish as the force is reduced , and at about this point the hysteresis loops begin to experience a change in shape , becoming practically straight parallel lines .
[ Note added March 10 , 1914.\#151 ; As was mentioned during the reading of the paper , the high permeability , has persisted since the specimen was taken out of the shield on February 17 , 1914 .
Experiments which are just completed show that it still exists .
