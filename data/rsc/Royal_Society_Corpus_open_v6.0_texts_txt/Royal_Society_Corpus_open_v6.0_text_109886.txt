] After alluding to the erroneous notions of Linnaeus and other naturalists , concerning the animal that forms the shell called Argonauta , and to his own opinion that it is an internal shell , the author proceeds to show that this shell is not the produce of the species of Sepia often found in it , for the ova of this Sepia are not those of an animal of the Order Vermes Testacea .
The blood of oviparous animals , while in the egg , is aerated through its coats ; but in the Vermes Testacea , if the shell were formed in the egg , the process of aeration would be impeded ; so that the animal 's shell is formed after it has left the egg .
Animals that live in water require some defence while the shell is forming ; they are therefore enclosed in a camerated midus .
That of the Helix ianthina , taken in the voyage to the Congo , is described by Sir Everard Home .
The ova are deposited upon its own shell ; sometimes one only , sometimes several , contained in one chamber .
The animal found in the Argonaut shell by Mr. Cranch , had deposited eggs upon the lip of the shell ; they were united by pedicles , like those of the Sepia octopus , and differed from those of the Helix ianthina , and other testaceous Vermes living in water , in having no camerated nidus , and in having a very large yolk to supply nourishment to the young animal when hatched ; so that this animal , says Sir Everard Home , must be resolved into a species of Sepia ; an animal which has no external shell , and which only uses the Argonaut when it occasionally gets possession of one .
Some naturalists not acquainted with comparative anatomy have thought they saw the Argonauta shell partly formed in these ova .
The appearance they allude to is probably the unusually large yolk .
