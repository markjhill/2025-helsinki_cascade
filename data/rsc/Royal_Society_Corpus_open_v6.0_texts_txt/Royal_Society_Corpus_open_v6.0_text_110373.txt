" Some Experiments and Observations on the Combinations of Carbonic Acid and Ammonia .
" By John Davy , M.D. , F.R.S. The author was led to the investigations of which he gives an account in the present paper , by finding in the note-books of his brother , the late Sir H. Davy , some memoranda of experiments which he had madeon the salts of ammonia , and more especially on the carbonates .
The first part of the paper reiates to the direct combination of car ?
bonic acid and ammonia , by which a salt is formed possessing singularly alkaline properties .
The second is on the scsquicarbonate of ammonia ; a term which Mr. Richard Phillips has applied to that salt of ammonia which is commonly called the subcarbonate , and which is obtained by the mutual decomposition of carbonate of lime and sal ammoniae , by means of heat .
This the author concludes , from his experiments , to be composed of one proportion ammonia .
one and a half of carbonic acid , and one of water .
He then enters into a comparative review of the analyses of this salt by other chemists , and gives an account of the results of his experiments to determine its solubility at different temperatures .
He next proceeds to consider the bicarbonate of ammonia , which he finds to consist of one proportion of ammonia , two of carbonic acid , and two of water .
He concludes by an inquiry into the effects of heat on the solid sesquicarbonate and the carbonate of ammonia , in which he reviews the experiments and inferences which Sir H. Davy has recorded in his manuscript notes .
