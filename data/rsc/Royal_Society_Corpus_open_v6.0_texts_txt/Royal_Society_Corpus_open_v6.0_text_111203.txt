In the experiments related in this paper , it is shown that when the electrodes of a galvanometer are brought into contact , one with the mucous membrane of the intestine , and the other with the chyle flowing from the lacteal of the same part , an effect upon the needle occurs indicating the chyle to be positive .
The effects may be partly due to the changes which take place during secretion , the mesentery acting as a conducting body ; this supposition however will'not negative the conclusion thatthe effects may be attributed , in some measure at least , to the changes which occur during lacteal ab .
sorption .
