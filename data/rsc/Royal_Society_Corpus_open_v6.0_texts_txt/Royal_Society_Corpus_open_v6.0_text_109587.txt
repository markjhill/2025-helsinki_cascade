] The information we gather from this paper is , that the remarkable expansion of the skin of the neck , which constitutes a principal character in this species , is a voluntary action , distinct from that inflation which all serpents , when irritated , are more or less capable of : that it is owing to a particular set of ribs situated at the neck of the animal , and hence called cervical ribs .
These ribs are about twentyfive in number , and gradually lengthen from the upper end to the tenth or eleventh pair , and then successively shorten to the last .
They extend in lateral directions , having only a slight curvature ; and when depressed , lie upon the side of the spine , one on the other .
They are raised by four sets of muscles ; and another-large set of very long muscles has the power of bringing the skin forward , thus forming the appearance which has been called a hood .
Besides these muscles , there are three other sets , by which the hood is depressed , and the parts are restored to that state in which the neck of the animal does not appear disproportionally protuberant .
These descriptions are illustrated by accurate drawings ; but no conjecture is here given as to the probable uses of this singular mechanism , except that it does not appear to promote in any way the play of the lungs , but that the expansion it produces may perhaps facilitate a dilatation of the gullet , for the purpose of allowing the snake to swallow its prey more easily .
