" An Account of the fall of a Meteoric Stone in the Cold Bokkeveld , Cape of Good Hope .
" By Thomas Maclean , Esq. , F.R.S. , &amp; c , inaletter to Sir John F. W. Herschel , Bart. , V.P.R.S. , and communicated by him .
The appearance attending the fall of this aerolite , which happened at half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 13th of October , 1838 , was that of a meteor of a silvery hue , traversing the atmosphere , for a distance of about sixty miles , and then exploding with a loud noise , like that from artillery , which was heard over an area of more than seventy miles in diameter ; the air at the time being calm and sultry .
The fragments were widely dispersed ; and were at first so soft as to admit of being cut with a knife ; but they afterwards spontaneously hardened .
The entire mass of the aerolite is estimated at about five cubic feet .
