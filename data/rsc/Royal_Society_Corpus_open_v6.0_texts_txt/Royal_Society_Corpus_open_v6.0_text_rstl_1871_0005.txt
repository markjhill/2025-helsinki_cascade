j Results of Seven Years ' Observations of the Pip and Horizontal Force .
In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1863 , the President of the Royal Society enters into a discussion of a six years ' series of the Kew Magnetic Observations , with the view of ascertaining whether the sun 's position with reference to the earth really produces a sensible semiannual inequality in the terrestrial magnetic elements .
The probability of the existence of such a disturbing cause , founded on a comparison of the monthly determinations of the Dip and Horizontal Force taken at Hobarton and at Toronto , was made much more evident by Sir Edward Sabine 's discussion of the Kew observations ; and it was from a desire of bringing more data to bear upon this important question that the reduction of the seven years ' observations , just completed at this observatory , has been undertaken .
With this object in view , it was considered of great importance to adhere closely to the plan laid down by Sir Edward Sabine , and to present the results , for the sake of comparison , in three Tables .
The first contains the mean monthly determinations of the elements , with their deduced mean values and secular variation , the second presents a view of the semiannual inequality , and the third gives the residual errors and the consequent most probable errors of any single observation and of the deduced mean values of the elements .
Magnetic observations were first taken at Stonyhurst in 1858 , but the continuous , series of monthly determinations of the Dip , Declination , and Intensity were only commenced in March 1863 .
The same instruments , e. a dip-circle by Barrow and a Jones unifilar , have been used throughout the whole seven years .
These instruments were both tested at Kew before being sent to this observatory , and the dip-circle was again examined there last January with most satisfactory results .
The constants of the vibration-magnet were determined by Mr. Welse , and are given in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for February 1865 .
In calculating the value of the Horizontal Force , it has never been found necessary to apply any correction for the arc of vibration , which has always been small , nor for the Frodsham chronometer , whose rate has never exceeded 2s per day .
he yearly adopted values of P are the following:\#151 ; for 1863 -0-00217 for 1867 -0*00254 1864 \#151 ; 0-00219 1868 -0-00271 1865 -0-00254 1869 \#151 ; 0-00210 1866 -0-00275 L Each of these values is the mean of the monthly determinations obtained by observations of deflections at 1*0 and 1*3 feet .
For the dip three needles have been employed , Nos. 1 and 2 from 1863 to August 1868 , and Nos. 1 and 8 since the latter date .
A correction has been applied since August 1868 for the change of needle ; this correction =\#151 ; O ' 20 " for the mean value .
The observations have always been taken by the Director of the Observatory , viz. by the Rev. W. Sidgeeaves , from 1863 to September 1868 , and since that date by myself .
Unfortunately the station of observation has not been always the same , nor perfectly free from disturbing influences .
The first station was a stone pillar erected in 1858 in the botanical garden of the college .
In June 1864 the N.W. wall of the garden was replaced by an iron'railing , whose nearest distance from the magnetic pillar is 91 feet .
In January of the following year a three-quarter inch iron pipe was laid down on the S.E. side of the pillar , at a distance of 38 feet 9 inches ; and in September 1867 a second iron pipe , I4- inch in diameter , was placed parallel to the former at 2^ inches greater distance from the pillar .
At the beginning of 1868 a wooden hut , three of whose sides are in great part glass , was erected in a retired part of the garden , and so placed that the shade of overhanging trees might protect it from the sun in summer , whilst it remained fully exposed to the sun 's rays when at low altitudes .
No iron was in the vicinity at the time , but a 2-inch iron pipe was laid down in October 1869 at a distance of 51 feet 9 inches from the stone pier on which the observations are taken .
A series of observations of the Dip , Declination , and Horizontal Force have been made on the same days at the old and new stations for the purpose of determining the corrections to be applied for change of locality .
The corrections thus found for the first station are \#151 ; 0*0051 in British units for the Horizontal Force , and +3 ' 34 " for the Dip .
It is now impossible to determine absolutely what part of these corrections is due to the several masses of iron near the old pillar ; but since it seems probable that the two iron pipes would have produced at most but a very slight disturbance , the whole correction has been applied from the time of the placing of the iron railings , i. e. from July 1864 to March 1868 , both inclusively .
The following Tables contain the corrected values .

The value in January 1868 is evidently too small ; this arose from a sudden change in the time of vibration of the magnet .
The above Table gives for the epoch October 1st , 1866 , The mean Horizontal Force =3*6034 .
With a secular acceleration =0*0042 .
These quantities enable us directly to calculate the probable value of the force at any epoch , and we thus form the next Table .

We can now test the accuracy of our assumed values of the secular and semiannual variation , and of the observations themselves , by the formation of the following Table .

The Total Force .
This can be at once deduced from the mean values contained in Tables I. For Epoch July 1st , 1866 , H. F.=3'6028 , and Dip=69 ' 45 ' 43 " from April to Sept. For Epoch Jan. 1st , 1867 , H. F.=3*6041 , and Dip=69 ' 44 ' 59 " from Oct. to March Applying the correction for the secular variation to reduce both these to a common epoch , we have for Jan. 1st , 1867 , from April to September , T. F. = 3*6049xsec .
69 ' 44 ' 48"=10*4136 .
October to March , T. F.=3*6041 x sec. 69 ' 44 ' 59"=10*4128 .
which would make the intensity greater when the sun is further from the earth , the difference being very small , viz. 0*0008 .
This last result is opposed to that derived from the reductions of Sir Edward Sabine , but will have but little weight , both on account of the smallness of the amount , and still more from the uncertainty attached to the corrections applied for change of station .
The above mean value of the total force , 10*4136 , for January 1st , 1867 , compared with the observations in October 1858 , gives an average annual rate of increase=0*0034 , which agrees closely with the amount calculated by General Sabine { cf. Proceedings of the Koyal Society , February 1865 ) .
Whilst drawing up this paper I was not aware that Dr. Balfour Stewart was engaged in a similar reduction of a second six years ' series of the Kew observations , which has led to such a satisfactory confirmation of the results obtained by the discussion of the first six years ' observations at the same observatory .
When another six years have elapsed , we shall be able to determine to what extent the results obtained above are due to local influences .
