On leaving England for Ascension Island in May 1862 , Lieut. Rokeby was supplied by General Sabine with the following instruments for the purpose of making observations of magnetical variation and intensity , viz. A portable declinometer and unifilar for absolute observations of declination and horizontal intensity , a Barrow 's dip-circle ( No. 24 ) , a differential declinometer , and a differenitial bifilar .
The differential declinometer and the bifilar were erected at George Town , Ascension , in August 1862 , and bihorary observations commenced ; but in consequence of instability in the supports of the instruments , caused probably by the shifting of the volcaniic cinders which formed the ground at the observing-station , the observations made exhibit frequent discrepancies .
The whole of the bifilar observations , and all the differential declinometer observations prior to June 1864 , have therefore been omitted from the present discussion .
These observations were discontinued in June 1866 , when Lieut. Rokeby left the Island .
Observations of absolute horizontal force and dip were made on the Green Mountain , Ascension , once every motuth from July 1863 to March 1866 , two months in 1865 excepted .
Observations were not made with the portable declinometer .
Observations of Horizontal Force and Dip .
The horizontal , vertical , and total forces ( Table No. 1 ) are calculated to English measure ; one foot , one second of mean solar time , and one grain being assumed as the limits of space , of time , and of mass .
The vertical and totalforces are obtained from the absolute measures of the horizontal force and the dip .
The observations of dip ( Table No. 1 ) were made in every instance save one with the needle marked A 2 .
For the observations of deflection and vibration taken each month for absolute measure of horizontal force , the same magnet ( collimator 5 ) has always been employed .
The moment of inertia of the magnet , with its stirrup for different degrees of temperature , and the coefficients in the corrections required for the effects of temperature and of terrestrial magnetic induction on the magnetic moment of the magnet , were determined in 1858 at the Kew Observatory by the late Mr. Welsh .
That these corrections held good in 1862 was proved by the agreement of the horizontal force obtained at Kew with this instrument previous to its departure , with the value of the force determilned by the observatory unifilar .
The moment of inertia of the magnet with its stirrup is 5 3828 at 60 ?
Fahr. The induction-coefficient , =0-000252 .
The correction for error of graduation of the deflection-bar at 10 foot is 0 00000 foot , and at 1P3 foot 0-00003 foot .
The formula used for determining the temperature correction was q ( t0-350)+q ' ( t_350)2 , where to is the observed temperature , 35 ?
F. being the adopted standard temperature .
The values of q and q ' for the magnet used are respectively 0 0001 1035 and 0G000000581 .
The observed times of vibration have been corrected for rate of chronometer when it has exceeded five seconds per day .
A correction has also been applied for the effect of torsion on the suspending thread .
The initial and terminal semiares of vibration have always been less than 30 ' , consequently no correction was requisite on this account .
The time of one vibration is derived from the mean of twelve observations of the time of 100 vibrations .

In deducing from these observations the ratio and product of the magnetic moment m of the magnet , and the earth 's horizontal magnetic intensity X , the inductionand temperature-corrections have always been applied .

The value of the constant P was fouind to be -0 00291 , by the mean of ten determinations obtained each from six pairs of deflection-observations at distances 1P0 and 13 foot .
The mean of the values of m derived from deflection-observations at the distances 10 foot and 1P3 foot has been used in calculating the measure of horizontal force .
Observations made with the Diff'erential Declinomete2 .
Observations were made of the scale-reading of the differeiitial declinometer at 3 A.m. , and hourly from 6 A.M. to midnight , daily , from December 1863 to June 1865 , from which date to the conclusion of the series the 3 A.M. observations were discontinued .
The observations from the commencement until May 1864 were found on inspection to be valueless for the purposes of reduction , for the reason assigned in the introduction .
The two years ' records , June 1864 to 1866 , were treated according to the method employed by General Sabine in the reduction of declination-observations .
In the first place , hourly means were taken for each month .
All observations which vary from these means to a greater extent than 4'0 were then rejected , and new means taken of the unrejected observations .
The mean reading for each month was then computed ; finally , the hourly means were subtracted from the monthly means .
Table 2 shows these differences as derived from the meani of two years ' observations , excepting in the case of 15 hours , which is the result of one year only .
In the Table , the sign + represents the north pole of the magnet to the east of the mean position , and the sign that it was to the west of the mean .
At the bottom of the Table semiannual and annual means are given , and these means are exhibited in the form of curves in the diagram accompanying the paper .
Figure 1 shows the differences of the semiannual and annual means from the normal position , which is represented by the straight horizontal line .
In figure 3 the annual mean is represented as a straight liie , and the curves show the deviations of the semiannual means from it .
In both figures the curves between twelve and fifteen hours and fifteen and eighteen hours are interpolated .
Figures 2 and 4 are copied from General Sabine 's St. Helena Observations , vol. ii .
, and show the similarity between the movements of the magnet at Ascension and St. Helena .
