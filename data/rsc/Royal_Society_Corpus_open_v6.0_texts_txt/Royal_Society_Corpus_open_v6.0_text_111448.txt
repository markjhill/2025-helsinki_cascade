Iodide of mercurous methyl .
On the other hand , the action of concentrated sulphuric or hydrochloric acid furnishes hydride of methyl or marsh gas , with deposition of crystals of the corresponding chloride or sulphate .
C,2I Hg + -HCI= 23Hg2Cl + C213 , H. The salts of mercurous methyl , and the radical mercuric methyl , are both decomposed by the action of a dilute acid and clean zinc , into metallic mercury and gases .
Mercuric methyl furnishes with bichloride of tin a crystalline compound , which decomposes , on addition of water , into chloride of inercurous methyl and a soluble tin salt .
The same chloride also is produced by the action of terchloride of phosphorus .
Mercuric methyl is a ready solvent of caoutchouc , resins , and phosphorus .
It , however , has but little solvent action on sulphur .
Some interest attaches to the circumstance that iodide of mercurous methyl is easily produced by heating mercuric iodide with mercuric methyl .
Mercuric ethyl .
The author has also prepared the radical of mercuric ethyl .
From its proneness , however , to decomposition at the high temperature at which the reaction is effected , he has not been able to obtain more than sufficient to make a qualitative examination of the new body .
It boils at a temperature above that of waterj and burns with a more lurid flame than is exhibited by mercuric methyl .

e On Certain Formulae for Differentiation .
" By ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received November 26 , 1857 .
( Abstract .
) In seeking for a formula in the theory of multiple definite integrals , I was several years ago led to investigate the successive differential coefficients of ( / X+_ x / xV+)2 , and the results which I then obtained are given in my paper , " On certain formulae for differentiations , with applications to the evaluation of definite inte94 grals * .
" I subsequently sought for the successive differential coefficients of the more general expression { ( x + X ) ( x + , i ) }Ik( V/ x +Vx ?
4-+)2i , but the investigation was not finished .
My attention was recalled to the subject by two remarkable identities obtained in Prof. Donkin 's memoir , " On the equation of Laplace 's Functions , &amp;c. t , " by a comparison of his results with those of Prof. Boole , which identities I perceived to belong to the class of formulae above referred to : the first of the two identities is in fact readily deduced from a formula in my paper ; the demonstration of the second is much more difficult , and I have only succeeded in making it depend on the establishment of the equality of the coefficients of two expressions of the same form .
I have since resumed the unfinished investigation above referred to .
The several results which I have obtained are given in the present memoir .
I remark that , putting for shortness P=2x+X++ , Q= 4V(+X)(x+ , )u , R=( V/ +X--x+p)L2 , the subject to which the results all belong is the differentiation of the expression P " Q ' R ; the before-mentioned expression { ( x+X ) ( x)ik( V/ x -t Vx J+)2i is of this form , and the question in relation to it is to obtain the development of aX Pa Q13 Ry , where a=0 .
The question arising from the second of Prof. Donkin 's identities is to obtain the development of ( P- ' Q4 b)7P'PIQ y7 , where a=y-f3 .
As the demonstration of these identities is one of the objects of the present memoir , I have given in the first section their reduction to the form in which they are considered .
The second section treats of the development of the expression a Pa Q ' Ry where a=0 ; the third section of that of the expression { P- ' Q4 a)x ' Pa Q R/ where a=y- ; the fourth section contains the application of the formulae to the demonstration of the two identities and some other applications of the formule .
