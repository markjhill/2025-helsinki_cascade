" On the frequent occurrence of Indigo in Human Urine , and on its Chemical , Physiological and Pathological Relations .
" By ARTHUR HILL HASSALL , M.D. , Member of the Royal College of Physicians , Physician to the Royal Free Hospital , &amp;c. Communicated by Professor SHARPEY , Sec. R.S. Received June 10 , 1854 .
The present communication embraces some further observations and experiments on the occurrence of indigo in human urine .
From these it appears that the presence of that substance is even more common than the author was led to anticipate from his first inquiries , the results of which were communicated to the Society in June last .
The author furnishes additional proofs of the blue colouring matter in question being really indigo , by converting it into isatine and aniline ; for this purpose it was necessary to obtain the pigment in considerable quantity .
Contrasting its chemical and physiological relations with haematine and urine pigment , he shows that indigo is closely allied in its nature and origin to those substances , and he considers that when indigo is met with in urine in considerable amount , it forms a vehicle for the elimination of any excess of carbon contained in the system .
This view is borne out by the important fact , that the greater number of cases in which indigo has been observed to be developed in the urine in large amount have been cases of extensive tubercular disease of the lungs , and in which the decarbonizing functions of those organs are greatly impaired .
