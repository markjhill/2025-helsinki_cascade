On a Peculiar Source of Deterioration of the Magnetic Powers of Steel Bars .
" By William Sturgeon , Esq. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The author concludes , from various experiments on the changes in the magnetic force of steel magnets produced by subjecting them to blows with a wooden mallet , or other modes of creating tremors ; or vibrations among their particles , that the most apparently trifling mechanical agitation is sufficient to occasion a considerable diminution of magnetic power ; that this loss , when it has taken place from such a cause , is permanent ; and that in every case , after .
reaching a certain point , it attains its maximum , a fact which implies , in every magnet , the possession of a specific retentive force , of which it cannot be deprived by any further mechanical commotion of its parti-
