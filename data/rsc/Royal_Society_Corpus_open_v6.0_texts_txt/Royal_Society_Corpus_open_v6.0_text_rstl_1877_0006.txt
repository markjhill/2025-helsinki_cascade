] The element bromine and the compound iodine monochloride possess nearly the same molecular weight .
The colours of their vapours appear almost identical , and a rapid glance at the complicated absorption-spectra afforded by the two gases fails to detect any difference between them .
It becomes , therefore , a matter of importance to ascertain whether the molecules of the two bodies , when gaseous , vibrate identically or similarly .
We have accordingly undertaken a series of exact measurements of the absorption-spectra of these two gases , the results of which we have now the honour to communicate to the Royal Society .
The two spectra were compared simultaneously by means of one of Kirchhoff 's model spectroscopes , 4 flint-glass prisms of 60 ' and 45 ' and a magnifying-power of 40 being employed .
The position of the lines and of the well-defined edges of the bands in both spectra were read off by reflexion upon a fixed arbitrary scale .
the positions of 27 air-lines lying between the extremes of the absorption-spectra were then determined upon the same scale , both the scale and prisms remaining untouched during the different series of observations .
In order to determine the wave-lengths of each of the absorption-bands in the spectra of bromine and iodine monochloride , the wave-length of each of the 27 air-lines was ascertained by reference to the measurements of Thalen ; in three cases , marked H , in the accompanying Table the numbers given by Huggins have been used .

EOSCOE AND THOEPE ON THE ABSOEPTION-SPECTEA In order to reduce the micrometer-scale readings of the absorption-spectra to wavelengths , a graphical method was adopted .
In the first place , the wave-lengths of the 27 air-lines having been found as described , these numbers were taken as ordinates and plotted on curve-paper , the scale-readings of the air-lines being taken as abscissae .
The points thus obtained fell naturally into six groups or series , and a mean point for each group was then found by accurate measurement , and the curve drawn through the six mean points .
In order to obtain the wave-lengths of the well-defined edge of the different bands of the absorption-spectra , it was merely necessary to ascertain from the curve the value of the ordinate corresponding to each scale-reading as abscissa .
The positions of the six mean points , each corresponding to a group of air-lines needed for the construction of the curve , were ascertained by means of the arrangement seen in Plate 4 .
fig. 1 .
The wooden rod ( A A ) has a steel point ( C C ) fixed at one end , and a graduated paper scale at the other .
At the end carrying the steel point is a strip of wood ( T T P ) placed at right angles to the rod , which it serves to support , so that the axis ( C C ) of the steel point is vertical , whilst the scale ( S S ) lies in a horizontal position , the end P sliding on the table when the rod is rotated round the point C C as centre .
The curve-paper is now adjusted on the table , so that some one division on the scale describes a circle through one particular group of spots and also through two other groups , one on each side , which circle , if drawn , would pass not far from the mean points of the three groups .
In order now to find the exact position of the mean point of the middle group through which the curve is to pass , the distance from each point to the steel centre ( C C ) of the circle is first accurately read off on the divided scale .
A point is then chosen and plotted near the middle of the group , as a mean of the several distances , such that the sum of the shortest distances of the several points of any one group to the curve drawn through this mean point is zero .
This process is repeated for each of the four groups in the middle , the centre of curvature for an end group being taken to be the same as that for the second group from that end .
In one case an isolated point occurs , and this is taken as one group and the curve drawn through it .
The curve consists of arcs of circles which pass through the six mean points , with radii varying from 64|- inches in length at the upper end to 61^ inches at the lower end .
Absorption-Spectrum of Bromine .
This absorption-spectrum was first examined in 1833 by W. H. Miller , but no accurate map has hitherto been published .
The bromine employed in our experiments was a portion of the sample used by one of us in the determination of the rate of thermal expansion of this liquid .
It was obtained by distilling a large quantity of commercial bromine , after dehydration with oil of vitriol , and collecting separately the fraction boiling at about 60 ' , which amounted to about two thirds of the whole liquid operated upon .
The sample was found to he OF BROMINE AND OF IODINE MONOCHLOEIDE .
free from iodine .
In order to remove any chlorine which might be present , it was digested with powdered potassium bromide for several weeks , again distilled , and treated with phosphorus pentoxide .
The pure bromine boiled constantly between 59'*6 and 59''7 ( corrected ) .
Bar .
( corrected and reduced ) 765*2 millims. The spectrum was obtained by allowing the rays from a lime-light to pass , before falling on the slit of the spectroscope , through bromine vapour contained in a long and strong narrow glass tube heated by means of a flame .
The spectrum thus obtained is a channelled one , and consists of a large number of bands , 66 of which have been measured .
Each band , like those of iodine * , is made up of a close association of fine lines , the whole stretching from wave-length 6801*5 in the red to wave-length 5244*1 in the green .
Beyond these extremes the general absorption becomes too powerful to permit further bands to be seen .
Each of these bands has a well-defined edge towards the blue end , and shades off gradually towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum , as shown in the drawing .
The bands are by no means regularly dispersed throughout this length , but are more numerous , as well as more intense , in the yellow and green portions of the spectrum than in the red .
The bands in the green form the best defined portion of the bromine spectrum , and the bands 5483*8 and 5460*1 , although rather fainter than some others , are especially characteristic .
The spectrum of the vapour of bromine at the ordinary temperature and that obtained when the vapour is heated differ from each other , inasmuch as the lines in the green beyond 5433*2 and in the red beyond 6101*4 are invisible in the cold , though visible in the heated vapour .
A few lines , such as 5634*8 and 5580*6 , in the green appear in the spectrum of the heated vapour , but not in that of the cold vapour ; but , as a whole , the bands seen in the cold vapour are also seen in the heated vapour , and no change whatever in position is noticed .
The least refrangible bands beyond 6526*9 are ill-defined ; they appear directly upon heating , but fade quickly away as the vapour cools .
The letter f placed after the wave-length denotes that the line is faint ; means very faint ; and denotes that the line is dark and well-defined .

This compound was prepared by heating a mixture of iodine and finely powdered potassium chlorate .
After repeated distillation from potassium chlorate it boiled constantly between 99'*7 and 100'* 7 .
Corrected and reduced barometer 744'3 millims. The spectrum of iodine monochloride is likewise a channelled one , generally resembling that of bromine , but differing essentially from it as well in the position of the bands as in their distribution .
For the purpose of mapping its absorption-spectrum the chloride was placed in a cylindrical glass tube , 14 centims. in length , having flattened ends , the rays from the lime-light passing through the length of the tube , which was then heated with a lamp .
The spectra of the moderately heated and strongly heated vapour exhibit differences similar to those seen in the case of bromine .
Thus at the higher temperature a great OF BROMINE AND OF IODINE MONOCHLORIDE .
increase in the number of bands in the green is observed , none of the bands from 5679*5 to the end ( 5276*1 ) being visible at the lower temperature .
No change in the position of the bands or lines common to the vapour at both temperatures is , however , observed on heating or cooling , so that in other respects , and as regards by far the majority of the lines or bands , no alteration is produced by heat .

A careful comparison of the absorption-spectra of bromine and iodine monochloride shows that although a large number of bands are nearly coincident , the spectra , as a whole , are not identical either when the vapours are examined at low or at high temperatures , or when the length of the columns of absorbing gas is varied .
Out of the 66 lines mapped in each of the two spectra only two , viz. 6475*1 and 6372*6 , appear to be truly coincident .
The differences between the two spectra are seen , first , in the red portion , inasmuch as six bands are observed in the bromine beyond the last , 6475*1 , in the iodine monochloride ; and , secondly , in the green portions , where the chloride spectrum exhibits a larger number of closely set or double lines than are seen in the corresponding portions of the spectrum of bromine .
The curve and the map , on half the scale of Angstrom 's " spectre normal , " have been very carefully drawn by Mr. William Dodgson , to whom we beg to tender our thanks .
[ Note.\#151 ; Since the above paper was read , Professor Stokes has suggested to us that the wave-lengths might have been more easily determined by means of a curve in which the coordinates were the deviation , less a constant , and the squared reciprocals of the wave-length , less a constant , a curve which would come out almost a straight line .
We communicated this suggestion to Mr. A. M. Worthington , who has worked it out , and who endorses Prof. Stokes 's recommendation .
