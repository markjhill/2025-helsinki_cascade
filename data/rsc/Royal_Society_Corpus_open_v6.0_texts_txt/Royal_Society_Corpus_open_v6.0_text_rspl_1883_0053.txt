The following Papers were read : \#151 ; I. " On Line Spectra of Boron and Silicon .

In the course of an extended examination of all varieties of saline .solutions by means of the spark and a photographic camera , I have observed two spectra of much interest .
I detach my notes from the paper in which they are embodied in order to give them an earlier publication .
Boron.\#151 ; In order to ascertain whether sodium borate would yield any spectrum beyond that due to sodium , a strong solution of borax was first examined and subsequently a saturated solution of boracic acid .
The graphite electrode with which the solution was submitted to the action of the spark , was opposed to a pole of a tin-cadmium alloy , in order that the wave-lengths of any lines that might appear could be determined by reference to those of tin and cadmium .
It is a remarkable fact that when a saturated solution of borax is used , the sodium lines are not visible , while there appear three strong sharp lines , which as they are likewise yielded by boracic acid must be cpn-i sidered as characteristic of boron .

2496-2 Silicon.\#151 ; A strong solution of sodium silicate was in like manner submitted to the action of the spark .
There was only a feeble indication of the strongest sodium line ( \=3301 ) , but a strong 302 Hr .

[ June 2l spectrum was obtained consisting of a beautiful group of lines with three isolated rays .
These lines are attributed to silicon , because they are rendered equally well by sodium silicate , sodium fluosilicate , andj by hydrofluosilicic acid , the electrodes being either of gold or of carbon The strength of the lines is proportional to the strength of the hydrofluosilicic acid solution examined .
The fiducial lines of the tin-cadmium alloy and some of the air lines were employed as before in obtaining measurements from which the wave-lengths of the silicon lines were calculated by means of an interpolation curve .
Below are given the wave-lengths of the silicon lines , together with their scale numbers referring to their position on the prism spectrum .
The scale numbers are comparable with those given in a paper recently submitted to the Royal Society , and are also applicable to my photographs of spectra in the " Journal of the Chemical Society , " vol. 4 ] p. 90 .
They represent hundredths of an inch and fractions thereof , reckoned from a strong air line with wave-length 4628 9 , which is ] numbered 10 .

In Messrs. Living and Dewar 's map of the carbon spectrum ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 33 , p. 403 ) , I have observed a group of lines not seen in the spectrum of graphite obtained by me ( " Journal of the Chemical Society , " vol. 41 , p. 90 ) , which might be accounted for by a difference in strength of the spark employed .
This group , however , resembles in a striking manner the seven lines in the spectrum of silicon .
( See the map of the silicon spectrum .
) Their wave-lengths are the following\#151 ; 2541"0 , 2528"2 , 2523"6 , 2518-7 , 2515-8 , 2514"0 , 2506"3 .
It will be seen by comparison that these lines approximate so closely to those of silicon that the numbers are well 5-40 E-20 E-3100 5-80 5*60 5-40 I-2Q 5-3000 r-80 5-60 1-40 1-20 1-2900 5-80 5-60 p3500 5-80 1-60 1~40 E-20 5-3400 1-80 5-60 i 1 .

[ June 21 within the experimental errors of measurement of identical lines Professors Living and Dewar took the lines which they mapped from sparks passed " between poles of purified graphite in air , carbonic acid gas , hydrogen , and coal-gas .
The same lines have been observed in photographs of the spark between iron , and between aluminium poles in carbonic acid gas .
" " The graphite was purified by being stirred in fine powder into fused potash , and subsequent treatment with aqua regia , by prolonged ignition in a current of chlorine , and by treatment with hydrofluoric acid .
" " Notwithstanding the purification the photographs of the spark between these electrodes still showed very distinctly the lines of magnesium and iron .
" From these quotations it will be seen with what great care the preparations for these observations on the carbon spectrum were made .
If the poles employed had been those of graphite only , I should have had little hesitation in attributing the seven lines to the silicon spectrum , but they were replaced by iron and by aluminium .
Even the purest iron wire contains small traces of silicon , and aluminium of the usual commercial quality certainly contains a considerable quantity .
There is , therefore , a suspicion that the carbon spectrum was contaminated by silicon , for a series of seven consecutive lines so nearly coincident with those in the spectrum of another element of the same class would be very remarkable .

) The investigation to which this refers forms a continuation of some researches commenced about three years ago , but which the author was compelled by other engagements to lay aside .
The general theory of the functions employed was published in the " Transactions of the Royal Society " ( Part III , 1881 ) , under the title of " Toroidal Functions , " These and analogous functions are employed in the present communication .
The interest of investigations of the properties of small vortices \#166 ; depends on their connexion with the vortex atom theory of Sir W. Thomson , and it was this and the further connexion with a gravitation theory which induced me originally to undertake the investigation .
So far as I am aware , very little has been done towards a quantitative theory of vortices beyond the paper " On the Vibrations of a Vortex Ring " by Mr. J. J. Thomson , published in the " Transactions " of this
