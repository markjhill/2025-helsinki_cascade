" On the Measurement of Distances by the Telescope .
" By Edmund Bowman , Esq. , C.E. Communicated by S. Hunter Christie , Esq. , Sec. R.S. The method proposed by the author for determining distances by means of a telescope , consists in placing , at the spot of which the distance is required , a graduated staff , and observing the number of its divisions comprehended in the field of the telescope , or included between fixed points in a diaphragm placed in the focus of the eyeglass .
He finds that the number of these divisions , apparent in the field of view , are directly as the distance of the staff , plus a certain constant , which depends on the construction of the instrument .
The author investigates the value of this constant , and illustrates the practical applications of his method , which he thinks might be employed with great advantage in surveying , when , from irregularities of ground or difficulties of access , the direct measurement by the chain would be inconvenient or impossible .
