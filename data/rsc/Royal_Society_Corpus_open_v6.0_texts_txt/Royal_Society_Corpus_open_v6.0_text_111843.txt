" On the Representation of Polyhedra .
" By the Rev. THOMAS P. KIRKMAN , A.M. Communicated by ARTHUR CAYLEY , Esq. , F.R.S. Received August 6 , 1855 .
This paper constituted an addition to the paper by the same author read June 21 , 1855 .
The author observes that to every p-acral q-edron corresponds a p-edral q-acron , the summits and faces of either having the same order and rank as to the number of edges with the faces and summits of the other .
When p=q , the corresponding pair will sometimes be identical figures , as to the number , rank , and arrangement of faces and summits ; and at other times , as is always the case if p be not equal to q , the two figures will differ .
When they differ they may be called a sympolar pair , both being heteropolar ; when theyform one and the same figure it may be styled an autopolar polyhedron .
An elegant way of representing a sympolar pair is deduced from the two following theorems : A. The q summits of a q-acron are the angles of a closed polygon of q sides , all edges of the q-acron .
B. A closed polygon of p sides can be traced on the p faces of every p-edron , having a side in every face , and passing through no summit .
