A paper was read , entitled , " Description of a new Tide-Gauge , constructed by T. G. Bunt , and erected on the Eastern bank of the River Avon , in front of the Hotwell House , Bristol , in 1837 .
" Communicated by the Rev. Wiliiam Whewell , M.A. , F.R.S. The principal parts of the machine here described , are an eightday clock , which turns a vertical cylinder , revolving once in twentyfour hours ; a wheel , to which an alternate motion is communicated by a float rising and falling with the tide , and connected by a wire with the wheel which is kept constantly strained by a counterpoise ; and a small drum on the same axis with the wheel , which by a suspending wire communicates one 18th of the vertical motion of the float to a bar carrying a pencil which marks a curve on the cylinder , or on a sheet of paper wrapped round it , exhibiting the rise and fall of the tide at each moment of time .
The details of the mechanism , illustrated by drawings , occupy the whole of this paper .
