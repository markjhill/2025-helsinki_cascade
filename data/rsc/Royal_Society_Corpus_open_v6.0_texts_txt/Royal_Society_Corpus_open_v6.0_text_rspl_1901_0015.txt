The present observations form part of an extensive series of experiments by which I am engaged in verifying whether or no " blaze currents " * may be utilised as a sign and measure of vitality .
An inquiry of this scope necessitates superficial examination of many varieties of animal and vegetable matter , and the closer study of certain favourable test-cases .
I have selected as such a test-case , the " vitality " of seeds , and have chosen for my purpose beans ( Phaseoluswhich are anatomically convenient and .
practically easy to obtain of known age .
But before entering upon the results in this particular test-case , I think it advisable to preface those results by a brief indication of the principle involved in all such experiments .
The method of investigation is similar to that adopted in the case of the frog 's eyeball , * the complications of the principle and a tentative explanation of such complications is reserved for future discussion in a more comprehensive memoir .
By " blaze current " ( the term which I was led to adopt by the study of retinal effects ) I mean to denote the galvanometrical token of an explosive change locally excited in living matter .
An unequivocal blaze current electrically excited is in the same direction as the exciting current , i.e. , it cannot be a polarisation counter-current .
( An equivocal blaze current , in the contrary direction to the exciting current , i.e. , not at first sight distinguishable from a polarisation counter-effect , also exists , but is not taken into consideration in this communication .

Although the theoretical explanation of these currents is not now in question , it may here be remarked that the unequivocal or lioinodrome blaze current is probably of local post-anodic origin ( the previously anodic spot being now strongly electro-positive to the previously kathodic spot ) , while the equivocal or lietero-drome blaze current is probably of local post-kathodic origin ( the previously kathodic spot being now strongly electro-positive to the previously anodic spot ) .
80 Dr. A. D. Waller .
An Attempt The presence of an unequivocal or homoclrome blaze current is in my experience proof positive that the object under examination is alive .
Absence of the effect is strong presumptive evidence that the object is " dead , " or rather not-living .
It may be in that paradoxical state of immobility which we characterise as latent life , and which we may not characterise as the living state , inasmuch as no sign of life is manifested , nor as dead , inasmuch as the living state can be resumed .
An object in this dormant state exhibits no " blaze current " or other sign of life .
And although it has capacity of life , and cannot therefore be classed in the category of " dead " things , it is not actually living , and must therefore logically be classed in the more extensive category of not-living things .
Limiting ourselves to the unequivocal blaze current as the criterion between the living and not-living states , we may formulate the following practical rule for a summary interrogation of any given object:\#151 ; If the after-currents aroused by single induced currents of both are in the same direction , the object investigated is alive .
Practically , by reason of the fact that most objects of experiment are not physiologically homogeneous , this rule finds frequent application , inasmuch , as there is a favourable and an unfavourable direction of response , which occurs in the former direction , whether the excitation happen to be in the former or in the latter electrical organs , eye-hall , skin , injured tissues animal and vegetable ) .
In the case of objects that are physiologically homogeneous or nearly so , the after-currents to both directions of exciting current may be homodrome , i.e. , of the nature of unequivocal blaze currents .
In such case it generally happens that the two opposite reactions are more or less unequal , by reason of imperfect physiological homogeneity of the mass of matter under investigation .
It rarely happens that the physiological homogeneity is such that the two unequivocal blaze currents are quite equal and opposite .
So that the diagnosis of any suitable object as to its state of life or not-life rests upon the three following types of response :\#151 ; 1 .
Both after-currents aroused by single induction shocks ( or by condenser discharges ) of both directions are homodrome to the exciting currents .
From which it is to be inferred that the object is living .
2 .
Both after-currents are in the same direction .
The object is living .
3 .
Both after-currents are in the polarisation direction .
The object is not-living .

or -\#151 ; -\#151 ; the Vitality of Seeds by an Electrical Method , .
81 The three cases are indicated as above , and it should be stated that in addition to the test of direction , electromotive force ( which on my plan of investigation can always be approximately ascertained ) serves to make the diagnosis easy in the great majority of instances .
The electromotive value in the case of an ordinary blaze current greatly exceeds that of an ordinary polarisation-current the former on vigorous seeds may reach OT volt , while on the same seeds the polarisation-current similarly observed , was between 0-0005 and 0-001 volt ) .
It is only in the case of weak or moribund seeds that there is any room for uncertainty in the answer , by reason of a weak blaze current in conflict with the weak polarisation-current .
But the vitality of such seeds , although we may be unable to assert that it has fallen to the zero level , is insufficient for germination , and as tested in the incubator at 25 ' such seeds have to be registered as dead .
The principal points of the preceding statements may be illustrated by the following experiment , which I give as being typical ; the expressions " positive " and " negative " signify that the currents respectively pass upwards from B to A , or downwards from A to B , .
through the seed .
Typical Experiment.\#151 ; A freshly shelled out and unbruised bean set up laterally* between unpolarisable electrodes gives\#151 ; 1 .
Blaze current in the positive direction in response to an induc* I have given this typical experiment only to represent main facts without details concerning differences according to strength of excitation , interval between successive excitations , temporary abolition by excessive excitation , recovery of capceity for reponse after injury , \amp ; c. , \amp ; c. These and other points will be dealt with in a more detailed and comprehensive account of the phenomena .
It should , however , be remarked at this stage that the lateral position of a bean , so that an exciting current traverses both cotyledons normally , is chosen as being the least asymmetrical and by reason of the situation of the embryo less liable to involve physiological inequality than a longitudinal disposition .
The comparison of effects on the embryo proper and on the detached cotyledons shows that although all parts of the seed give the blaze effect , the latter is greater in the embryo than in the cotyledons at the outset of germination , and that in an abortive germination it disappears from the embryo sooner than from the cotyledons ; \#151 ; Cot .

The peeled-off testa gave no blaze whatever , and was evidently dead ; its polarisation counter-currents were relatively considerable .
For these and other reasons I prefer to test the isolated radicle rather than the entire seed .

83 surface B ( giving therefore current of injury of positive direction ) gives blaze currents in the negative direction in response to an induction shock in the positive direction ( = an equivocal blaze in the polarisation direction ) and to an induction shock in the negative direction ( = an unequivocal blaze in the homodrome direction ) .
If the bean is horizontally sliced at the upper surface A instead of at the lower surface B , the current of injury is negative and the blaze currents positive in response to both directions of excitation .
3 .
A boiled bean gives no blaze currents in either direction but only small polarisation counter-currents , in the positive direction after a negative current and in the negative direction after a positive current .
The next obvious point to be tested is the effect of anaesthetics upon the response .
The results depend upon strength of excitation employed , and duration of ansesthetisation .
paribus , the strong- effect of a strong stimulus is far more refractory to the action of an anaesthetic than the smaller effect of a weaker stimulus , and in the former case the suppression is apt to be incomplete , or when complete to be definitive .
To obtain temporary suppression it is necessary to choose a sufficient but not too strong exciting current , and to anaesthetise by ether rather than by chloroform .
In a preceding paragraph it has been mentioned that a fresh vigorous seed gives a large blaze current , whereas a stale or moribund seed gives little or no response .
The next step was obviously to compare similar seeds submitted to various enfeebling modifications , as well as different crops of similar seeds , the electrical tests being controlled by parallel germination tests .
The first and most readily effected comparison is that between the reactions of fresh seeds and of the same seeds killed by boiling .
The result of this comparison is unmistakable and invariable .
Fresh seeds , giving unequivocal blaze currents with an E.M.F. of O'Ol to 0-10 volt , give no blaze currents whatever after they have been boiled , but only polarisation counter-current with an E.M.F. of 0-0005 to 0-0020 volt .
The seeds upon which I have made this test have been leguminous seeds , such as shelled beans and peas boiled in water , and the kernels of stoned fruits such as cherries , plums , and peaches boiled in then-protected state.* # The reaction is abolished at a temperature considerably below that of boiling water ; e.g. , at a temperature of between 40 ' and 50 ' of a warm moist chamber .
Miss S. C. M. Sow'ton has carefully investigated this point and that relating to the effect of anaesthetics , by aid of photographic records , which are in fact indispensable in connection with these two points .
It is also abolished by congelation ( at \#151 ; 3 ' to \#151 ; 5 ' ) , which causes a sudden large electromotive effect at this point .
On recovery of normal temperature no blaze can be obtained , and on recongelation there is no electromotive effect at the critical temperature .
84 Dr. A. D. Waller .
An Attempt to Estimate My attention at this early stage of the inquiry has been chiefly directed to the deterioration of seeds with age and to the comparison inter se of sets of seeds of certificated years by means of the germination test and of the blaze test used quantitatively .
I selected beans as being of suitable bulk and readily obtainable , and I have to thank Messrs. Sutton for supplying me with many different samples of known dates .
After a considerable number of trials upon entire seeds variously orientated between the electrodes , soaked in water of various temperatures for various periods , .and upon the several isolated parts of seeds , I fixed upon the following procedure as conveniently yielding series of numerical results comparable se .
The " dry " beans are first soaked in water for twelve hours in an incubator adjusted at 25 ' C. , then laid upon moist flannel and replaced in the incubator for examination during the next day .
Each bean was then peeled and split , and the radicle was carefully broken off and placed between the clay pads of the electrodes ( fig. 1 ) so that the uninjured apex was in contact with the upper electrode A , and the fractured base with the lower electrode B. With this position we have a " positive " current of injury from B to A , and have to expect a " negative blaze " current from A to B in response to excitation .
In order that the response shall be " unequivocal , " the exciting current is taken of negative direction .
To ensure maximal effect a strong current is taken , viz. , a break induction shock at 10,000 units of Berne coil .
And inasmuch as a current of such strength repeated for a second time shortly after a first trial produces little or no effect , and even when repeated after a considerable interval a much smaller effect than at its first application , it is necessary to take for the purpose of numerical comparison exclusively the values obtained at first trials .
To this end it may be necessary to shunt the galvanometer to such an extent that the blaze effect to be expected from the first excitation shall give a deflection within the scale ; a second trial when the first trial has given a deflection off scale , is of no value whatever .
By adoption of uniform conditions on these lines , comparisons may profitably be made between different series of results .
But at this early stage of the inquiry , not knowing what conditions it might be advisable to select , I have been forced to vary them in tentative directions , by variation of strength of excitation* of length of soakage , and * To avoid exhaustion by strong currents , and to obtain a regularly repeated series of effects , I find that condenser discharges are more suitable than induction shocks .
The discharge of 1 microfarad charged by two Leelanche cells ( = about 40 ergs ) usually gives a convenient normal effect upon which to investigate the effects of temperature variations , and of anesthetic vapours .
I also find it preferable to use the radicle some hours after it has been broken off , by which time its current of injury has subsided , and blaze currents are obtainable in both directions .

of interval between soakage and examination .
These departures from strict uniformity , while affording necessary information , restrict legitimate comparisons to data within each particular table ; comparisons from table to table may not be safely made .

With regard to the germination tests , they have been carried out for the most part upon similar lots taken from the same parcels as those from which other seeds were taken to be electrically tested as described above .
This latter required each seed to be broken up and rendered unfit for germination .
I think that the parallel pair of tests made upon twin lots of different individual seeds is nearly as conclusive as if both tests had been made upon the same individual seeds\#151 ; vide , e.y. , Table I. Nevertheless , to meet the criticism that this proof is not conclusive , I have obtained three series of data in which the electrical and germination tests were carried out upon the same individual beans .
In all three series I previously determined the coefficient of each intact seed by the blaze test ; the germination test was subsequently carried out in one series at Kew under the supervision of Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer ( Table VII ) ; in a second series at Chelsea under the supervision of Professor Farmer ( Table VIII ) ; and in the third series by myself in my own laboratory ( Table IX ) .
But I find it far less satisfactory to 86 Dr. A. D. Waller .
An Attempt to Estimate make the electrical test upon an entire seed with unknown local bruises received during its fresh state or in course of preparation , than upon a previously protected portion of the seed with an obvious injured end , as in the case of the radicle freshly exposed by separation of the cotyledons , and nipped off at its base immediately* before an observation is made .
Moreover , in the former case the current-density is smaller , the blaze effects are relatively less considerable , and the polarisation counter-effects relatively more considerable .
And , finally , irregularities due to irregular distribution of waterf are more liable to occur in the comparatively large mass of an entire seed than in the comparatively small mass of its removed radicle .

The physiological character of the blaze reaction is proved ( 1 ) by the influence of raised temperature ; ( 2 ) by its general parallelism with germination tests ; ( 3 ) by the influence of lowered temperature ; ( 4 ) by the influence of anaesthetics ; ( 5 ) by the influence of strong electrical currents ; ( 6 ) by the absence of blaze and failure of germination in the case of water-logged seeds .
In every instance a bean giving no blaze , gave subsequently no sign of germination .
There has been throughout these first observations a general , but not faultless , correspondence , as regards magnitude , between the blaze reaction and the germinative activity .
The correspondence is such as to make good the principal fact that the blaze reaction is a sign of life , and that its magnitude is some measure of what we designate as " vitality .
" The defects of correspondence may have been due to irregularities in the results of the blaze test , or of the germination test , or of both tests .
As regards great differences of vitality , both tests are obviously and in every case concordant , both replying by an indubitable " yes " or " no " to the question whether there is blaze and germination .
As regards the lower degrees and the smaller differences of vitality , the chances of disagreement between the two tests are obviously greater .
As regards the electrical test , it is more difficult to take the measure upon the entire seed than upon its isolated radicle .
As regards the germination test , it is not always easy to ensure identical and optimum conditions .
Fresh and vigorous seeds manifest a large blaze response ( 0-0500 volt or more ) , and germinate strongly .
Older and less vigorous seeds mani92 On a New Manometer and the Law of the Pressure of Gases .
fest a smaller blaze ( O'OIOO volt or less ) , and a less active germination .
Still older seeds , incapable of germination under even the most favourable conditions , manifest still smaller blaze ( OOOIO volt or less ) , and finally none at all , or the small counter-effect due to polarisation ( 0-0005 volt more or less ) .

( Abstract .
) The new manometer , charged with mercury , is capable of measuring small pressures to an accuracy of 1/ 2000 mm. of mercury .
This may be compared with the ordinary manometer , read with the aid of a cathetometer , which is capable , according to Amagat , of an accuracy of 1/ 100 mm. at most .
With this instrument the behaviour of nitrogen , hydrogen , am
