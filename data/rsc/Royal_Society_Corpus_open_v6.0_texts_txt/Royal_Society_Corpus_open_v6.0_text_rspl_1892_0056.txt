Introductory .
The following is an account of an investigation into the relations between potential difference , spark-length , and pressure when discharge takes place between two parallel plates in air .
The investigation was undertaken at the suggestion of Professor J. J. Thomson , and has been carried out in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge .
Preliminary experiments were made in July and August , 1890 , in which a small Wimshurst machine was used , and the potential difference was measured by one of Lord Kelvin 's vertical electrostatic voltmeters .
For sparks of some length fairly consistent results were obtained , but in the case of short sparks accurate measurement of the potential difference was difficult .
Use was then made of a large number of small secondary cells , and , at the same time , more accurate measurements of the spark-length were made .
At first about 500 cells were used , so that steady potential differences , ranging up to about 1,000 volts , could be maintained , and sparking differences up to about 0T mm. were examined .
The results of these experiments showed very fair agreement with those of other observers ; they were sufficiently consistent among themselves to show that the cells could be relied on .
More cells were therefore set up , and all were carefully tested as to equality , rate of fall of charge , \amp ; c. Apparatus was then constructed by which discharge at different pressures could be examined .
Description of this apparatus , which is sketched in fig. 1 , and an account of the method and results of observations made with it in July and August , 1891 , are given in Part I below .
At first some difficulty was found in making the bell-jar and its connexions sufficiently air-tight , but when this was overcome an effect similar to that observed by De la Rue and Muller in discharge in exhausted tubes became apparent ; that is , it was found that , as the pressure diminished , the potential difference required to produce a spark across a given distance fell to a minimum value , and then began to increase rapidly .
To examine this effect more fully , o the observations were confined to pressures ranging from 20 to n 2 100 Mr. J. B.Peace .
Potential Difference required [ June 16 , 300 mm. of mercury , the water-pump which was used , and the stuffing-box through which the sparking distance was adjusted , not admitting of observations at lower pressures .
The results of these observations are tabulated below , and appear in the curves in figs. 2 , 3 , and 4 .
When these results were examined and compared , it was found that the curves connecting potential difference and pressure not only exhibited the minima above mentioned , but also crossed each other , showing that at low pressures the shorter spark required the greater potential difference .
As this seemed a point of some importance , it was decided to make a more direct investigation , and with this view apparatus was constructed and observations made in April , 1892 .
This apparatus is described , and the results obtained are recorded in Part II below .
The observations were confined to pressures ranging from 2 or 3 up to 50 mm. of mercury , and the results confirmed and extended those formerly obtained .
Part I. A sketch of the apparatus used is given in fig. 1 .
An inverted bell-jar , communicating with a water-pump , had its mouth ground and fitted with a brass cover , C. This cover carried the attachments of the discharge plates P , P , and the micrometer screw S. The screw had a pitch of inch , and its head was graduated in hundredths of a revolution .
A short steel rod , fixed to the sliding frame of the screw and working through a stuffing-box in the centre of the cover C , carried an insulating block , to which .the upper discharge plate could be readily attached .
The lower plate was fixed to an ebonite disc which was rigidly suspended from the cover C. The plates were of brass , highly polished , and were about 2S inches in diameter .
The lower plate was plane , the upper was slightly convex , having a radius of curvature of about 9 inches .
Short flexible wires passed from the plates to insulated terminals passing through the cover .
Prom these terminals leads passed to mercury cups , M , by which connexion could be made , on the one hand with the leads of the telephone T , and , on the other hand , with leads passing to the secondary cells and to the voltmeter .
The cells were arranged in groups of eighteen in series ; for charging , the groups were arranged in parallel ; for spark discharge they were arranged in series , while the leads passing to M could be connected to the terminals of any required number of cells .
In the discharge circuit there were also a simple make-and-break key and a very high resistance , the latter to prevent the setting up of an arc discharge between the plates .
This resistance was usually a black-lead line on a strip of ebonite .

To the Cells .
The path from the bell-jar to the pump passed through sulphuric acid , and was also connected to a mercury gauge , G. Air could be admitted to the jar through the stop-cock K , after passing through cotton wool and sulphuric acid .
The following was the usual course of a series of observations:\#151 ; While the cells were charging , which generally occupied about one half hour , the plates were polished and fixed in position , the cover fitted to the mouth of the bell-jar , and the pump put in action .
The screw reading for contact of the plates was taken , the upper plate being moved downwards till contact took place and completed the telephone circuit .
The plates were set at any required distance apart , the upper plate being , in all cases , moved downwards to its final position .
When the cells were charged they were allowed a few minutes to reach a steady state and were then joined up in series , and various groups of 500 tested by the electrostatic voltmeter ; in this , the smallest weight being used , one scale division read 50 volts , so that direct reading gave ten times the voltage of a single cell .
This measurement was repeated at intervals during each experiment , and only those observations were preserved in which the cells either remained practically constant , or fell in potential difference so slowly and uniformly that accurate allowance could be made .
The plates being now at a known distance and the air at a known pressure , regulated by the pump on the one hand and the stop-cock K on the other , the number of cells connected to the plates , always at first well under what was required to produce discharge , was gradually increased until the spark passed , and the potential difference .102 Mr. J. B. Peace .
Potential Difference required [ June 16 was taken as being proportional to the number of cells .
The observations were made for a series of pressures ranging from 20 to 300 mm. of mercury .
When the apparatus was first used , a fixed potential difference was given to the plates , and the pressure gradually lowered until a spark passed .
When , however , it was found that , in certain circumstances , , a diminution of pressure required an increase of potential difference this method was abandoned , and that described above was adopted .
Within the specified range of pressure a considerable number of observations were made in July and August , .1891 , for spark-lengths corresponding to 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 100 , 200 , and 400 divisions of the screw head .
The mean results of these observations are given in the following tables .
Each table represents the mean of at least three series of observations , taken at considerable intervals of time , and generally showing very close agreement with each other .
From the observed potential difference the electrostatic force has been deduced , that is , the potential difference ( in electrostatic units ) per centimetre of spark-length .
The electrostatic force is given in the third column of the following tables , the first column containing the air pressure in millimetres of mercury , and the second the potential difference in volts , while d is the spark-length , as measured above .
The tables are represented by the curves of figs. 2 and 3 , fig. 2 showing the connexion between potential difference and pressure for various constant spark-lengths , and fig. 3 showing the connexion between electrostatic force and pressure for the same spark-lengths .
From these are deduced the curves in fig. 4 , showing the relation between potential difference and spark-length for various constant pressures .

For this purpose new apparatus was fitted up , as described below .

Potential Difference required [ June 16 Part II .
The apparatus used is sketched in fig. 5 .
Two pairs of plates at different distances apart , hut with same air pressure , were arranged in parallel , so that an alternative path was offered5 to the discharge .
The two pairs of plates were enclosed in two small receivers .
The lower plate in each rested on an insulating stand ; the upper plate was supported and separated from the lower by small'thin discs of ebonite , mica , or glass .
The four plates used were plane , and the thickness of the separating discs , as measured by the screw calipers , is taken as the length of the spark .
The receivers rested on well-ground brass base plates , into each of which were sealed two narrow glass tubes , containing mercury , and having sealed platinum wires passing to the outside ; flexible wires passed from the discharge-plates and dipped into the mercury in the tubes .
One of these tubes served also , in each case , to give connexion with the pumps .
Two pumps were used , the water pump for rapid exhaustion to about oO or 40 mm. of mercury , the mercury pump for lower pressures .
Pressures of from 2 to 3 mm. of mercury were easily reached , and could be maintained for any length of time .

The platinum wires , in connexion with the plates , dipped into mercury cups in the paraffin blocks Ni and N2 ; from these leads passed to the block M , where either one pair of plates , or both , could be connected to the leads passing* to the cells .
The cells were used in the same manner as before ; the potential difference , however , instead of being reckoned as proportional to the number of cells applied , was measured directly by a cylinder quadrant electrometer .
This wras used in order to avoid a fresh examination into the uniformity of the cells .
1892 .
] to produce a Spark in Air at different .
109 The apparatus was set up , and the observations tabulated below were made in April , 1892 .
These observations were confined to pressures lowrer than 50 mm. In each case the two pairs of plates had air-gaps of very different length , so that each series of observations amounted to a determination of two separate potential difference and spark-length curves .
The sparks were separately examined , until pressures were reached at which the potential differences necessary for discharge became nearly equal , and then the two pairs of plates were simultaneously connected to the cells .
The crossing of the potential difference curves was thus directly verified , a slight lowering of the pressure transferring the discharge from the shorter to the longer air-gap .
The plates used in this experiment were , all four , plane and polished .
Two were of brass , one of copper , and one of zinc .
When the different plates were interchanged between the long spark-gap and the short , no difference was observed in the potential difference required for discharge at given difference and air-pressure .
That there might be no doubt as to whether the discharge was passing actually between the plates , or was taking a longer path from edge to edge , the edges of the plates were only very slightly rounded off .
At low pressures there was considerable tendency to a brush discharge from the edges , but this was considerably reduced by an extremely thin coating of shellac varnish .
The results given below are those of three single series of observations made on April 21 , 22 , and 23 , respectively .
All of these were repeated on the same or other days , and in all cases there was almost exact agreement .
For convenience of reference these series are called A , B , and C , the suffix 1 referring to the left-hand , and the suffix 2 to the right-hand , spark-gap .
As in the former case , the tables give corresponding pressure , potential difference in volts ( V ) , and electrostatic force in C.G.S. units ( F ) .
Curves , similar to those given in fig. 2 and 3 , representing potential difference and pressure , and electrostatic force and pressure , are also given in figs. 6 and 7 .

The essential point of this part of the investigation , however , was not the accurate determination of spark-length , but the direct comparison of discharge across two spark-gaps known to be of very different length .

[ June 16 , The appearance of the spark-discharge changed with the pressure in the usual manner .
At ordinary pressures the discharge was a bright white spark , gradually passing , as the pressure was lowered , into a purplish glow .
In the case of the flat and convex discs of Part I , the purple discharge , at first central and narrow , gradually spread out and at low pressures filled the space between the plates .
The appearance of the spark could not , however , be carefully examined , as the circuit was always broken as soon as discharge occurred in order to avoid damage to the surfaces of the plates .
When these were examined by breathing on them after a number of sparks had passed at low pressures , it was always found that the part of the surfaces most affected by the discharge was an annulus at some little distance from the centre .
With the flat plates used in Part TI , the discharge was generally diffused over the space between the plates .
Observations of spark discharge between plates in air at different pressures have been made by Warren de la Rue and H. Muller* and by Macfarlane.f Their results do not present the features to which attention has been called in the present paper , nor could they do so , as the curves for potential difference and pressure for the spark-lengths they examined would show no evidence of a minimum potential difference at the lowest pressures they considered .
In both cases the spark-length was about 0T3 inch , and the lowest pressure 20 mm. of mercury .
In conclusion , I have to express my thanks to Professor J. J. Thomson , to whom I have been indebted for advice and suggestions at every point of this investigation .
