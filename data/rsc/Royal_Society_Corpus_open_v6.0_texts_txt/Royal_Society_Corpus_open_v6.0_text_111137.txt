A paper was read , entitled " Observations upon Appendicularia and Doliolum .
" By Thomas H. Huxley , Esq. Communicated by E. Forbes , Esq. , F.R.S. Received Feb. 26 , 1851 .
This is a description of two Ascidian genera which possess very considerable interest : Doliolum , as forming a link between the Pyrosomata and Salpoe ; and Appendicularia , as representing in a permanent form the larval state of the Ascidians , long ago described by M. Milne-Edwards .
Appendicularia , which has been also imperfectly described under the names of Oikopleura and Venillaria , is in fact an ascidian provided with a long vibratile fin or tail , by the aid of which it swims freely about .
That it is an adult form is shown by the existence of a welldeveloped testis , but the author leaves undecided the nature of the female organs .
On the other hand it seems doubtful whether Doliolum is truly an independent form , or whether it is not rather a detached " zo6id " of the genus Auchenia .
A paper was also in part read , entitled " Researches into the Molecular Constitution of the Organic Bases .
" Part II .
