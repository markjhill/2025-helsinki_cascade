X. The Widening of Iron Lines and of Unknown Lines in relation to the Sun-spot Period .
It is now twenty-eight years since I discovered that the lines seen in sun-spots were subject to widening , * and that different lines were widened at different times .
It was not , however , till 1879 that I was enabled to commence daily routine work of such a nature that all observations were comparable inter se .
This desideratum was secured by limiting attention to the twelve lines most widened between P and D. In 1886f I gave an account of some of the early results obtained by this research .
I have recently commenced the complete discussion of the whole series of observations to the present year .
This discussion , involving 21,000 lines widened during the period in question , has necessitated three special researches : the first , dealing with the lines with which , contemporaneously , coincidences have been found in the laboratory ; the second , dealing with those the origin of which is so far unknown ; and the third , with the distribution of both sets of lines in spots in relation to the sun-spot period .
To make the work as definite as possible , I am , in the first instance , confining the inquiry concerning the known lines to lines of iron based upon the examination of the pure electrolytic iron referred to in a previous communication .
J The following statistics will show the relation of these iron lines to the Fraunhofer lines in the region P\#151 ; D over which the spot work extends .

This exception is necessitated by the fact that the spectrum of that metal contains practically as many lines as appear in the solar spectrum .

Some slight corrections will , doubtless , be ultimately required when some uncertainties connected with some of the earlier observations , made before Rowland 's maps were available , have been cleared up .
The highest points of the curves represent the maximum frequency of iron lines in one case and of unknown lines in the other .
The period embraced by the observations practically enables us to study what has taken place at two successive sun-spot minima and two maxima .
It will be seen that the phenomena which followed the minimum of 1879 have been exactly reproduced after the minimum of 1890 .
At the minima the iron lines are prominent among the most widened lines ; at the maxima we only find lines about which nothing is known .
Since the discussion indicates that the iron lines involved , which ultimately disappear , are almost invariably those seen most prominent in the spark , the view put forward in my paper of 1886 that the change observed is due to the dissociation of iron in the spots as a sun-spot maximum is approached , is corroborated , and , so far , I have heard of no other simple and sufficient explanation .
It will be noted that the maxima and minima of solar temperature thus revealed to us , if my hypothesis be confirmed , lag behind the spot maxima and minima .
This may explain the lag observed in Observations of Sun-spot Spectra .
