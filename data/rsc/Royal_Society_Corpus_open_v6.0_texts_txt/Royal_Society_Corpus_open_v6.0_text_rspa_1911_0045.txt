) In the course of an investigation of the refractivity of gaseous bromine conducted with a Jamin refractometer it was observed that , as the temperature changed , very slight variations of the density of the vapour could be quickly and accurately recorded .
This fact suggested that an optical method would be useful for measuring vapour pressures or densities at low pressures , especially in the case of substances which attack mercury .
The following observations on the vapour of bromine serve as an illustration of the possibilities of the method , and have brought to light an interesting phenomenon , which is described below .
A thin glass bulb , containing 1 or 2 c.c. of Kahlbaum 's pure bromine , was sealed to a tube communicating both with the pump and the refractometer tube .
The temperature of the bromine was reduced to \#151 ; 80 ' C. , at which its vapour pressure is negligible , and the bulb was completely evacuated , so as to remove all traces of hydrobramic acid which might have formed by the action of the bromine on the tap-greasa since the previous experiment .
The refractometer tube was separately evacuated , and the two were put in connection by opening a tap .
The cooling bath was then slowly brought up to atmospheric temperature by stages , while an observer counted the interference bands which crossed the field of view of the refractometer .
During each reading the temperature of the bulb was kept constant by stirring the hath .
As the melting-point was approached numerous readings were taken , the rise of 1 ' from \#151 ; 8 ' to \#151 ; 7 ' sometimes occupying 20 minutes .
A complete series of readings between \#151 ; 80 ' and 0 ' occupied about an hour .
At the moment of each reading the temperature of the refractometer tube was also read .
The light used was approximately monochromatic , and had the wave-length of the red Cd line , 6438 .
In this experiment what is actually observed is the temperature of the liquid bromine and the corresponding refractivity of the vapour in the refractometer tube , which is at the same pressure as the vapour in contact with the liquid , though at a different temperature .
The refractivity of bromine vapour for a known density had previously been determined by us , An Optical Method of Measuring Vapour Pressures .
307 and if we assume that the refractivity is proportional to the density , as Mascart 's work justifies us in doing , then the density of the vapour in the refractometer tube is known for various temperatures .
It may further be assumed that , at the low pressures at which measurements were taken , the pressure of the vapour in the tube is proportional to its density .
Hence , if we know one pressure and temperature absolutely , the whole curve of temperatures and pressures can be calculated from these observations .
liamsay and Young* found for bromine at its melting point a pressure of 44*5 mm. Assuming this value , the table below shows the vapour pressures derived from a typical set of readings which are well supported by other series .

The values of p , calculated from this equation , are shown in the third column .
The constants were derived from the values p \#151 ; 44*5 and 8*14 .
At \#151 ; 12c*74 C. , Bamsay and Young found p = 28*1 mm. The number calculated from the formula above is 28*3 .
At \#151 ; 17'*12 they founds = 18*9 against 19*9 calculated .
Thus the two sets of observations agree well .
Numerous observations were taken at and about the melting point , both with ascending and descending temperatures , and on several occasions , though not on all , an interesting fact was observed .
With steadily rising temperature of the bath the vapour pressure at the melting point increased * 'Chem .

above 44*5 mm. by 1 or 1-| mm. , and then , in the course of one or two minutes , fell back again .
After remaining almost constant for a few seconds it then began to jump several times and fall back again , and at last it mounted steadily and rapidly .
At each jump , which lasted one or two seconds , the pressure rose by 1 or 2 mm. A corresponding result was observed with falling temperature of the bath , the vapour pressure suddenly rising and then decreasing , but without jumping .
These phenomena may possibly be due to differences of temperature between neighbouring portions of the solid in the bulb , vapour being formed at one place and condensed in another .
But they are more probably explicable as the changes which might be expected to occur during the superheating of the solid and supercooling of the liquid .
The superheating of a solid is stated by Chwolson to have been observed by Barus in the case of naphthalin ; and Duhem gives instances of a similar phenomenon in connection with the passage of a solid from one crystalline form to another .
Whatever be the cause , the optical method seems to promise a valuable means of investigating the rapid and delicate changes of vapour pressure which must occur at the freezing point .
Jamin 's form of interferometer is , of course , not indispensable .
The simple design described by Lord Rayleigh , and used by Ramsay and Travers for the inert gases , would prove equally efficient .
