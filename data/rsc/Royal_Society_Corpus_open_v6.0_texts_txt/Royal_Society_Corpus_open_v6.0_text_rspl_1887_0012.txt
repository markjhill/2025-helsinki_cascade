The paper is illustrated by three plates , the first giving the sea-level distribution of pressure and the wind directions all over India , the second the distribution of pressure at a height of 10,000 feet , and the third the curves of temperature decrement on ascending , both as given by observation in Glaisher 's balloon ascents , and as computed on the hypothesis of adiabatic convection .

( Abstract .
) This is a continuation of the investigation in which the authors are engaged .
The measurements include the expansion of the liquid , the pressure of the vapour , and the compressibility of the substance in the gaseous state ; and from these are deduced the densities of the saturated vapour and the heats of vaporisation .
The total range of temperature is from \#151 ; 15 ' to +240 ' ; the range of pressure , from 11 mm. to 60,000 mm. The conclusions announced in their previous papers are supported by these measurements .
The apparent critical temperature is 240'0 ' , and the critical pressure about 59,700 mm. III .
" Further Discussion of the Sun-Spot Observations made at South Kensington .
" By J. Norman Lockyer , F.R.S. Received January 8 , 1887 .
In papers communicated to the Royal Society , and printed in the 'Proceedings ' ( vol. 31 , pp. 72 and 348 ; vol , 32 , p. 203 ; and vol. 33 , p. 154 ) the sun-spot observations made at South Kensington since 1879 have been to some extent discussed .
In the last paper communicated to the Society , in May , 1886 , I discussed the results obtained by the reduction of the observations of the most widened lines in the region F to for the whole number of observations ( 700 ) made from November , 1879 , to August , 1885 .
In the latter paper it was shown that as we pass from the minimum to the maximum period included in the years named , the lines of known terrestrial elements disappear , their places being taken by lines which do not appear in any maps or tables of spectral lines .
If was pointed out that such a result might be explained on the supposition that since the solar atmosphere is quietest and coolest at the 38 Mr. J. N. Lockjer .
On the [ Jan. 20 , minimum period , the vapours of terrestrial elements can exist then at the sun-spot level and give some of their characteristic absorption lines ; while at the more intensely heated and much disturbed maximum sun-spot period the vapours of terrestrial elements are dissociated , at the spot level , and give vapours which have no terrestrial equivalents .
Since last May the reduction of the observations of the most widened lines in the region bto D has been continued , and the results are given in the present communication .
They strikingly confirm those previously obtained .
The conclusions drawn in the previous paper are therefore much strengthened by the evidence obtained from this new region .
The observations referred to in the former paper were given in a series of tables ; corresponding tables are given in the present communication ; so that a clear comparison can be made .
Tables A and B show that for each of the elements taken\#151 ; iron and titanium\#151 ; the number of lines seen in the aggregate in each hundred observations decreases from the minimum to the maximum period .
Nickel was given in the previous paper , but in this region , b to D , Thalen only gives five lines due to nickel , and only one of these is found amongst the most widened lines , and that only once in the fifth hundred .
Table C gives the lines recorded as most widened , but not included as metallic lines by Angstrom or Thalen , and it will be noticed these are recorded as most numerous at the maximum period .
In the curves given in Fig. 1 , it is seen that there is the same rapid rise in the unknown lines to the third hundred , the same gradual rise from this to the sixth hundred , and then the commencement of the fall , just as in the previous paper for the other region of the spectrum under observation .
The carve due to iron exhibits an almost exact coincidence with the one previously published for the other region , with the difference that in this part of the spectrum the number of iron lines is not so great .
The titanium curve shows a sudden rise in the fifth hundred .
One line ( 5226 ) was amongst the most widened no less than twenty-two times , and it is a singular fact that this line was only recorded as most widened on one other occasion ( in the fourth hundred ) in the whole 700 observations .
Although at first sight this seems to be a result contrary to that obtained in the case of iron , it should be remarked that this line is one seen in the spectrum of the spark and may be considered to be due to high temperature , therefore its appearance in the maximum period was fully in accordance with the other facts adduced .
The reductions have been made and the tables prepared by Messrs. Mills , Spencer , and Taylor .
