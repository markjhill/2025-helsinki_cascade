" Researches on the Tides .
Eighth Series .
On the progress of the Diurnal Inequality-wave along the coasts of Europe/ * By the Rev. William Whewell , F.R.S. , &amp;c. In the seventh series of these researches , the author pointed out the laws which the diurnal inequality of the height of high water follows , and showed that those laws are modified so as to exhibit very remarkable differences at different places , and to occasion some difficulty in conceiving the mechanical propagation of the tide-wave .
He then suggested what appeared to be a possible solution of the difficulty 5 but as this suggestion was founded on facts from a few places only , he resolved to attempt to trace the progress of the wave which brings the diurnal inequality on some of the coasts , on which simultaneous observations were made at his request in June 1835 ; and the present memoir contains an account of the conclu ?
sions to which he has been led by this investigation .
The details which he gives of the observations made , with this view , at nineteen different stations , appear to establish the conclusion , that the differences of diurnal inequalities at different places are governed by local circumstances , and do not form a progressive series .
