]\gt ; With the vapours whose saturation vapour-pressure was less than atmospheric , a mixture of hydrogen and the vapour was used , the mixture being passed through a long spiral surrounded by ice , so that the vapour was saturated at C. Hydroohloric aoid and ammonia were each used at atmospheric pressure , as were also nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide .
In the case of ammonia , and to a lesser degree with hydrochloric acid , insulation diffioulties were met with , vulcanite proving quite useless even if the chamber was dried with air over .
The difficulty was , however , completely overcome by covering the vulcanite with paraffin wax , the insulation leak being praotically zero when this was used .
In order to obtain the ratio of the amounts of oorpuscular radiation liberated iu equal lengths of the gas in question and of air , by beams of equal intensity , the following method was used : icating the intensity of the beam by I , the ionisation per centimetre in any gas is , where A represents the corpuscular radiation liberated in the gas per centimetre by a beam of " " unit\ldquo ; intensity and is the oorpuscular factor for the gas .
The coefficient of absorption in the gas being per , I at any distance cm .
from the incident end of the chamber will be being the intensity of the inoident beam .
The ionisation in the chamber , after deducting the small ionisation due to corpusoular radiation from the ends , is thus ' .
