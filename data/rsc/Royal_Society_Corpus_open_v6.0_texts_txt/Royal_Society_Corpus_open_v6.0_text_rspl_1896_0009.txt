G. STOKES , eived April 14 , \mdash ; Read M$.y 7 , The molecular distribution of the metals in alloys of and of metals of platinum group has been described by me at some length , in a series of papers which have been published by the oyal Society .
* New interest in the subject has , however , arisen in connexion with the extraordinary development in various of the world especially in South Africa , of certaiu which are now employed 1'or extracting gold from its ores .
Their use has been attended the inbroduction into countr of a series of alloys of gold and the base metals which have hit rarely been met with in ical i. The base metals associated with the gold in these cases are nsually the ordinary ones lead zinc , but their presence in the gold has given rise to unexpected difficulties , as the distribution of the precious metal in the ingots which reach this country is so peculiar , that it is not possible to estimate the value of the by taking the pieces of metal required the assay , by any of the well-known methods now in use .
The grouping of the metal in these ingots presents mncb scientihc as well as industrial interest , and the following is a brief statement of the facts which have been observed .
A. An ingot of gold weighing kilograms wa assayed with a view to subjecting it to the ) operation of .
A piece of metal was , therefore , cut from the base of the ingot at the point marked , and the following are the esults of four assays made on this piece of metal:\mdash ; Gold 1 . . . . . . . .

The difference in the amount of gold bebween the two opposite ends of the ingot was , therefore , no less than parts in 1000 .

It became evident , therefore , that only method of detel.mining the quality othis ingot consisted in actually separating the gold and silver in mass , and effected by dissolving in nitroydrochloric acid , the silver being recovered as and reduc to tallic s , and the gold precipitated by iron chloride as pure gold .

Mr. E. Matthey .
In order to ascertain the effect exerted by these two metals\mdash ; lead and zinc\mdash ; in conjunction with gold , I prepared an alloy of 700 parts pure gold and 300 parts pure lead , and after mixing and casting into an open mould I cast the melted alloy into a spherical mould 2 in .
in diameter , made of cast iron .
Determinations made from different parts , after cutting the sphere into two halves , gave the results , the assays being made in tl'iplicate upon each portion of metal removed .
( The weight of this sphere was a little over 2 kilograms .
) resuIt shows a decidea tendene.y of the gold to iquate to the centre of the mass .
In the next experiment gold was alloyed with lead and zinc in the following oportions : Gold . . . . . . . .

the alloy was remelted and cast into the .
spherical mould before mentioned .
This alloy was extremely hard and very brittle .
Portions remowed from the different parts of the sphere , after cutting it across , gave the results:\mdash ; On the Liqnation of certain of There is evidence of -arrangement by liquation in this case which sends gold to the centre , but the result is complicated , as ravity appears also to send gold to the lower portion of the spherical mass .

10 was now further alloyed by the addition of 5 per cent. of pure copper and cast into a sphere which was very hard and brittle , and weighed about 2 kilograms .
The following are the results the points shown:\mdash ; Here again , appears to send gold to the lower porbion of sphere .
The arises , does the silver play ally parb in the tion of the baser metals , lead and zinc I therefore melted No. 3 with per cent. of silver , so that there were present:\mdash ; and cast into an open mould , and subsequently into the spherical mould .
The following the results obtained of fine gold at the poInts indicated : \mdash ; This sphere seems constant all over .
In order to see what the effect with pure gold alloyed with metallic zinc only , I cast an alloy of fine gold with 5 per cent. of zinc into a 8-in .
spherical mould .
The weight of the sphere was kilograms .
The results were as follows:\mdash ; A slight but decided tendency of liquation of gold towards the centre .
The same alloy , containing 95 per cent. of gold and 5 per cent. of zinc , was then alloyed with a further 5 per cent. of zinc and cast into the same sphere .
This weighed kilograms .
The results were as follows:\mdash ; Feeling a little about these results , the alloy of Sold with 10 per cent. of zinc , into the same mould .
The results were as This that there is still a tendency in this alloy per cent. of zinc to become enriched towards the celltre .
This 10 per cent. alloy was then alloyed with a of zinc and cast into the same spherical mould .
weight of this sphere was .
The results were : It is abundantly evident therefore , that zinc alone will account for the differences in the ingots of impure gold ; and the question arose , will the presence of a definite amount of silver in any way prevent the irregularity in composition To test this I alloyed the gold , which contained 15 per cent. of zinc so that it mi also contain per cent. of silver .
This was cast into the 3-in .
sphere and weighed kilograms , and assays made on pol.tions of metal cut from it gave the followin results :\mdash ; On the iquatio of Alloys of .

This experiment appears to confirm that on pp. 28 ( see of fig. 4 ) .
The foregoing experiments show that lead is far more effective as cause of liquation than zinc , and the question arises , do zinc and lead separate into distinct layers by avity when they are simultaneously presen } in mass of gold , as they are known to do when ( lead and are melted together and allo to solidify slowly .
If they do , are they respectively associated with metal Professor Roberts-Austen has given us a method investig n such a problem .

, The .
curve , No. I , is record of its solidification : \mdash ; Mr. E. Matthey .
From this it will be evident , from the horizontal position ( b ) ( of the No. I that the mass solidifies as a whole at 63 C. ; bnt there is a second break in the curve at a temperature of 40 C. ; and there is yet a third break at C. These latter points evidently are connected with the solidifying of lead and zinc , but it is probable that these metals are , in solidifying , associated with some gold .
The second cnrve , No. II , represents the ] of the same mass of gold with 10 per cent. of silver added .
It will be seen that bhe metal has still one main point , at 64 C. The lower point ( c ) of the former curve is entirely absent , but there is an indication of the lead point at .
The rssults clearly indicate that silver is a solvent common to zinc and lead , are not , as in the previous case ( Curve I ) free to separate from each other .
Such a mass should be fairly uniform in composition , and assays from different of it proved it to be so .
The latter curve ( II ) seems to chan ge its direction at , which is above the main point of the mass , and it remains to be seen whether this is of any significance .
The inspcction of the curves so obtained at once Ied me to infer that silver be a solvent for zinc and lead wheu these , present weighing rams , was now alloyed by the addition of lead to produce a similar metal to P. 13 see p. 25 ) , say:\mdash ; and this was cast into two spheres , a .
sphere and a 3-in .
sphere .
This alloy was so hard and ibtle that I was compelled to cut these spheres into two by them .
When so cut asunder it was evident that the uppor portions of both these spheres had a marked white ppearance , as compared with the lower portions , which the yellow colour of gold .
The 3-in .
sphere weighed .
Portions removed from these two spheres at the points dicated showed the following results:\mdash ; And those from the 2-in .
sphero , weighing kilogram \mdash ; Very marked ation takes place in both instances , the differ- nces at various points of the sphere being very remarkable and forcibly illustrating the difficulties to which reference is made at the commencement.of this paper .
As , however , it appears , that when a certain amount of silver is present , the irregularity in composition disappears , I alloyed this mixture of\mdash ; with more silver , so that ib contained 15 per cent. of silver ( nearly half the united amounts of zinc and lead present in the alloy ) .
This , cast into the .
spherical mould , showed the following results at the points indicsted .
In , the metal , when sawn in two , was homogeneous .
The weight of the sphere was kilograms .
Occurrence of the Element Gallium in tone .
3.5 There is still evidence of liquation of gold towards the centre , but compal.ison of fig. 12 with those which immediately precede it will how greatly the arrangement of the alloy has been modified by the presence of the additiona18 per cent. of silver .
The proporbion of silver in this alloy was proved by assay to be per cc- , nb. As there was still evidence of , the metal was cast with still more silver , making 20 per cent. of silver in all .
The alloy , when cast into a mould , proved to be almost unifort1l in composition , the diiference between bhc centre and the extreme portions being very slight .
Liquation had actically ceased , a fact which proves incontestably silver is the solvent for the base metals , zinc and lead , when they are alloyed ith gold .
Alloys of gold with base metals , notably with lead and zinc , now largely often met with in industr.y , have concentrated towards the centre and lowel portions , renders it impossible to ascertain their true value with even an approximation to accuracy .
( 2 ) When silver is also present these irregularities reatly modified .
method of " " cooling-curves\ldquo ; of the alloys shows that the frcezing points are very lJen s. is and when it is abseut from the alloy .
( 3 ) This fact naturally to the belief that if the base metal present does not exceed 30 per cent. , silver will dissolve it and form a uniform alloy with gold .
( 4 ) This conclusion is sustained by the experiments illustrated by fi , gs .
