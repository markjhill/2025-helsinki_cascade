) ( Abstract .
) Scandia is one of the rarest and least known of the recognised rare earths .
It was discovered in 1879 by Nilson , who separated it , together with ytterbia , from erbia extracted from euxenite and gadolinite .
Later in the same year Cleve extracted scandia from gadolinite , yttrotitanite , and keilhauite , and described the scandium sulphate , double sulphates , nitrate , oxalate , double oxalates , selenate , acetate , formate , oxide , and hydrate , and gave some of the chief reactions of the new body .
In the course of my 20 years ' work on the fractionation of the rare earths I have repeatedly tested my products by examining their photographed spectra , using the dominant lines of the various elements as tests for their presence .
Scandium has an extremely characteristic group of lines in its spectrum , situated between wave-lengths 3535B64 and 3651'983 , the strongest being at 3613'984 , midway between two strong iron lines .
By using a part of the spectrum in which this occupies the centre of the photograph it is easy to see if scandium is present .
Detecting the dominant line , the presence of scandium can be verified by reference to the other lines of the group .
Scandium I found in some of my fractions , but only in small quantities .
A few years ago I commenced an examination of all the obtainable rare earth minerals , in order to see if any of them showed more than a trace of scandium .
The minerals examined were :\#151 ; ^Eschynite .

On Scandium .
Of the minerals examined , scandium was detected in auerlite , cerite , keilliauite , mosandrite , orangite , orthite , pyrochlore , thorianite , thorite , and wiikite , but while other minerals contained less than 0*01 per cent , of scandium , wiikite was found to contain more than one hundred times that amount .
Wiikite is a black amorphous mineral of specific gravity 4*85 .
Its hardness is 6 .
It is infusible before the blowpipe .
It is imperfectly attacked by strong mineral acids , and breaks up easily when fused with potassium bisulphate .
Heated to full redness in a silica tube , it gives off helium , water , and a distinct amount of sulphuretted hydrogen , followed by a white sublimate .
The mineral begins to crack at a temperature a little below redness , and at the approach of redness gas is evolved with almost explosive violence , the mineral breaking up and flying about the tube .
A fragment so treated examined under the microscope shows the surface covered with glistening points .
With a high power these points are resolved into a mass of minute cubes , curiously regular in form and appearance .
Heating drives off 5*83 per cent , of its weight ; 5'82 of the loss is water and acid vapour , the difference , 0-01 per cent. , consisting chiefly of helium , with a little hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and a mere trace of neon .
Containing so many bodies , the exact separation of which one from the other is not known , it is at present impossible to give an accurate and complete analysis of wiikite .
The following is considered to be a fair approximation to its composition:\#151 ; Tantalic acid with some niobic acid ... ... ... ... .

5'83 Calcium , manganese , tin , sulphur , etc. , unestimated 1'97 100-00 After the crude earths , chiefly yttria , ytterbia , and scandia , have been separated from the mineral , they are " fractionated " by methods described in the paper .
Towards the end of the fractionation the chief impurity is On Scandium .
ytterbium .
Fortunately the very strong dominant line of the ytterbium spectrum , wave-length 3694'344 , occurs at a vacant part of the scandium spectrum , and near the characteristic group of scandium .
A sample of scandia is not taken as satisfactory if the least trace of this line is seen on an over-exposed spectrum of scandium , and if the actomic weight is higher than 44-1 .
The atomic weight of ytterbium being 173 , a very little of it as an impurity raises the atomic weight of scandium .
