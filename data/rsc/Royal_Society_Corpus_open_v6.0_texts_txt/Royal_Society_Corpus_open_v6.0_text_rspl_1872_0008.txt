40 Report of the Kew Committee .
Report of the Kew Committee for the Fifteen Months ending October 31 , 1872 .
The Kew Observatory was handed over to the President and Council of the Koyal Society by the General Committee of the British Association at the Edinburgh Meeting in 1871 .
Since that time the operations of the establishment have been conducted under the directions of the Committee nominated by the President and Council of the Boyal Society .
The most important modifications which have been made in the staff of the Observatory have been:\#151 ; first , the appointment of Mr. Samuel Jeffery as Superintendent , in the place of Dr. Balfour Stewart , F.B.S. , who had resigned his office previous to the severance of the connexion between the Observatory and the British Association ; and , secondly , the resignation of Mr. Kobert Beckley , who had been for nearly eighteen years Mechanician , such an official being no longer required .
His connexion with the Observatory is not , however , entirely at an end , for he has been appointed Consulting Mechanician with a retaining fee of Ten Pounds per annum .
Mr. Bobert H. Scott , F.B.S. , has consented , at the request of the Committee , to act as their Honorary Secretary .
Magnetic Worlc.\#151 ; Th.e series of automatic records of the several Magnetographs , viz. Declinometer , Horizontal Force , and Vertical 1 orce instruments , have been continued , and the independent absolute determinations have been , as usual , made monthly .
This latter duty has been , as heretofore , performed by Mr. G. M. Whipple , B.Sc. , first Assistant , who also takes charge of the General Magnetic Work , in which he has the assistance of Mr. Cullum .
The salaries of these two gentlemen , whose time is chiefly devoted to magnetic work , amounted during the period under consideration to \#163 ; 308 2s .
( 5cl .
, leaving a balance of about \#163 ; 300 out of the sum of \#163 ; 600 received from the Boyal Society to meet the general expenses ( \#163 ; 2084 12s .

\#163 ; 767 18s .
of this amount has been defrayed by the Meteorological Office and other sources , such as the \#163 ; 300 received for the payment of arrears from the Report of the Kew Committee .
41 British Association ( the greater part of which has been already expended ) , fees for verification of instruments , and payments for new instruments for foreign observatories , leaving a balance in hand of \lt ; \#163 ; 85 5s .

on the 31st of October .
The state of the Magnetic Reductions , as exhibited in the Report of the British Association for 1871 , remains unaltered , with the exception of the Tabulations of Declination , which have been extended to the end of the year 1871 .
The discussion of the results has been undertaken by the Chairman of the Committee , Sir E. Sabine , who has made arrangements for the constant attendance at Kew since November 1871 of two sergeants of the Royal Artillery who were formerly located in his office at Woolwich .
Accommodation has been provided for them at Kew by partitioning off a portion of the Transit Room .
Meteorological Work.\#151 ; The several self-recording instruments , registering respectively the Pressure , Temperature , Vapour-tension , Rainfall , and Wind , have been maintained in constant action under the superintendence of Mr. T. W. Baker , second Assistant , aided by Mr. Foster ; and the daily standard eye observations for control of the photographic records have been made regularly .
The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly to the Meteorological Office as in former years .
The Barograms and Thermograms are printed off in duplicate , and one copy is preserved at Kew .
As regards the Anemograms and Rain-records , the copy has been obtained by the method of tracing .
In addition to the regular work of Kew as a Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory , the duty of examining and checking the work of all the seven Self-recording Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological Office has been carried on in accordance with the method described in the Report of the British Association for 1869 .
This portion of the work has been performed by Messrs. Page and Rigby .
The only change as regards the Meteorological Instruments has been the repair of the shafts which connected the Anemograph on the Dome with the registering apparatus .
About the middle of June it was discovered that the old tubular shafts were split , and they were therefore replaced by new ones .
Photoheliograph.\#151 ; This instrument was regularly worked , as in former years , up to the end of February 1872 , at which epoch the period expired which was originally fixed by Mr. De La Rue for the continuance of the observations at the expense of the Royal Society Government-Grant Fund .
The observations were afterwards carried on up to the end of March , with the object of fully including ten years .
The measurements and reductions of the sun-pictures have been continued at the expense of Mr. De La Rue , and will be completed during the ensuing year .
A scale of equal parts , 15 feet in length , has , with the sanction of Her Majesty 's Office of Works , been erected temporarily on the Pagoda at 42 Report of the Kew Committee .
the Royal Gardens , Kew , likewise at the expense o\#163 ; Mr. De La Rue* .
This is being photographed by the Kew Photohehograph for he pn^ose of determining the optical distortion ( rf any ) of that instrument , in order to furnish the final corrections to the reductions of the sun-pictures ^Hehograph for Pulkowa has been placed in the Dome , and photo-oranhs have been taken of the scale in order to determine its optical haracter .
This instrument has since been removed ; but the stages and preparations for future instruments remain situ , and will be used for testing the other instruments to be employed for the observations of the transit of Venus .
... u Since March , when the sun-photograms were discontinued , eye observations of the sun , after the method of Hofrath Schwabe , have been made with a telescope of 2| inches aperture ( lent by Sir E. Sabine ) by Mr Poster in order that the observations for connecting sun-spots with magnetic phenomena might not drop through until photographic records are taken up on a permanent footing .
_ Electrometer.\#151 ; This instrument , designed by Sir W. Thomson , E.K.S. , was provided by the Meteorological Committee in 1869 , but has never been systematically in operation .
It was dismounted early in the year , in order to be removed to another position .
Previous to its re-erection some modifications are required ; and accordingly , on a recent visit to London of the maker , Mr. White , of Glasgow , that gentleman came down to Kew ( September 28 ) and removed a considerable portion of the apparatus in order to effect the necessary alterations at home .
_ Verifications.\#151 ; This department of the Observatory has been in full activity during the year .
The following Magnetic Instruments have been verified to obtain new constants:\#151 ; A TJnifilar for the North-American Boundary Commission .
A TJnifilar , a Dip-circle , andEox 's Instrument , for H.M.S. ' Challenger , the first two having been formerly used on board H.M.S. ' Nassau .

4 An Anemometer , of a similar construction to the instruments belonging 44 Report of the Kew Committee .
to the Meteorological Committee , but modified by Mr. Beckley , on the suggestion of Mr. De La Bue , so as to express the velocity by hourly traces , the pencil returning at the expiration of each hour to the zeroline , and also to admit of a range to the extent of 100 miles in the hour , has been tested and found to work satisfactorily .
Various other Anemometers of different constructions have been under experiment ; but from the limitation of the space forming the Observatory garden , by trees , \amp ; c. , it was not practicable to test thoroughly their respective merits .
Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the India Office ( 2| reams ) , the Meteorological Office ( 5 reams ) , and the Lisbon Observatory ( g ream ) .
Instruction in the use of Magnetical or Meteorological Instruments has been given to the following gentlemen :\#151 ; Prof. H. P. Blanford , Meteorological Beporter to the Government of Bengal , in Meteorological work .
The Bight Bev .
the Bishop of Bupert 's Land , in Meteorological work .
Charles Carpmael , Esq. , B.A. , Assistant to Mr. Kingston , Magnetic Observatory , Toronto , Canada , in both Magnetical and Meteorological work .
Three Officers of the North-American Boundary Commission , in Magnetical wrork .
Three Officers of H.M.S. \#163 ; Challenger , ' in Magnetical work .
Instruments and Apparatus.\#151 ; The several pieces of Apparatus \amp ; c. enumerated in the Inventory ( Appendix II .
of the Beport of the British Association , 1871 ) have been handed over to the Kew Committee , and are in their charge .
In the month of July instructions were received from the Foreign Office to deliver to Capt. Anderson , B.E. , an officer attached to the North-American Boundary Commission , the Magnetic Instruments used by the previous Commission , which had been deposited at Kew by the late Major B. W. Haig , B.A. Accordingly the following instruments were given up to Capt. Anderson:\#151 ; A portable Unifilar , a Dip-circle , and an Azimuth Compass .
The last-named instrument , although deposited by Major Haig , was not mentioned in the letter from the Foreign Office , and it was therefore issued to Capt. Anderson on loan .
The Dip-circle mentioned in the last Kew Beport of the British Association has been lent to His Excellency Major-General Lefroy , Governor of Bermuda .
A portable Dip-instrument , which had been lent to the Astronomer Boyal for a brief period , has been returned by him .
Buildings.\#151 ; Some slight alterations have been made in the main buildings in order to afford additional accommodation .
A small closet in the Testing-room has been converted into a Lavatory .
Report of the Kew An office has been provided for the two Sergeants , It .
A. , who attend at Kew , as already reported , by the subdivision of the old Transit Room about midway with a panel partition .
The expense of this alteration has been defrayed by Sir E. Sabine .
The roofs of the two outer Magnetic houses have been re-covered with felt , as it was found that they could not be kept perfectly wTater-tight by a coating of tar .
Early in the year , on the application of the Committee , H.M. 's Office of Woods and Forests sent workmen to clean and paint the interior of the Observatory , as far as the ground-floor .
This work has been finished , and the Office has undertaken to complete the basement story in the course of the next year .
Library.\#151 ; The Books enumerated in Appendix III .
to the Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for 1871 have been left at Kew .
A most valuable donation was received in July from the Committee of the Athenaeum Club , consisting of 77 volumes of books , chiefly Greenwich Observations .
From Sir E. Sabine a number of volumes of the 4to Magnetical and Meteorological Results from the Colonial Observatories have been received ; and also a very considerable amount of MS .
documents , including , among others , the original observations from which the printed results above mentioned have been derived .
A large number of valuable books have been deposited at Kew by Sir E. Sabine , who has intimated his intention to present them ultimately to the Observatory as a foundation of a Library .
