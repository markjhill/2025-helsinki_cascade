419 the oxide is still active , or it may be dried over calcium chloride or even exposed to a vacuum for some time , and it is still active , but if heated to 55 ' for seventeen hours then its activity is gone and a picture the reverse of the former one is obtained , that is , the oxide is now quite inactive , but the metal itself is very slightly active .
Oxides of zinc , cadmium , and magnesium , if wetted with peroxide of hydrogen \#166 ; solution , act in the same way and retain their activity with great pertinacity .
From the foregoing experiments it is then concluded that hydrogen peroxide is the agent which directly or indirectly causes the changes in the photographic plate .
This investigation has been carried on in the Davy-Faraday laboratory , and I would again tender my best thanks to the managers of the Royal Institution for allowing me to work there .
My thanks are also due to Mr. 0 .
