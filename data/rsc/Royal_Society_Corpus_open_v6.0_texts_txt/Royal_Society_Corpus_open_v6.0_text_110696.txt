" Researches on Electro-chemical equivalents , and on a supposed discrepancy between some of them and the atomic weight of the same bodies , as deduced from the theory of isomorphism .
" By Lieut.-Colonel P. York .
Communicated by Michael Faraday , Esq. , D.C.L. , F.R.S. , &amp;c. The author describes various experiments made with a view to determine the electro-chemical equivalents of sodium and potassium .
Three experiments gave , respectively , 22*3 , 22*9 , and 25 , as the equivalent of the former ; and two other experiments gave , respec ?
tively , 45 and 41*7 , as the equivalent of the latter of these substances .
He then inquires what would be the result of the electrolyzation of the aqueous solutions of soda and potash , on the hypo ?
thesis of these bodies being composed of two equivalents , or atoms , of metal , and one of oxygen .
To determine this question he employs a solution of dichloride of copper in muriatic acid , as being a substance composed of two atoms of metal and one of an electronegative element .
Its electrolysis gave as the equivalent of copper , 52*8 , 59*4 , and 61*6 , numbers approximating closely to 63*2 , or double the atomic weight of copper .
After a long train of investigation , he concludes that there is no reason deducible from the theory of isomorphism for doubting the correctness of the received atomic weights of silver , sodium , &amp; c , but that the difficulty , or anomaly , if it may be so called , should be considered as attaching itself to the di-compounds of copper ; and that Faraday 's proposi ?
tions on this subject remain unimpeached .
