" Experiments on the electric conditions of the Rocks and Metalliferous Veins ( Lodes ) of Longclose and Rose wall Hill Mines in Cornwall .
" By Wiliiam Jory Henwood , Esq. , F.R.S. , &amp; c , Se ?
cretary of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall .
The experiments , of which the results are given in this paper , were undertaken with the view of determining whether it was in consequence of the imperfections of the galvanometers , or other apparatus , employed , that Mr. R. W. Fox , and other experimenters , had been unable to detect the presence of electricity in the tin veins of Corn ?
wall .
The mode of experimenting was in principle the same as that pursued by Mr. Fox , namely , that of placing plates of metal in con ?
tact with the points to be examined , carrying wires from the one to the other , and interposing a galvanometer in the circuit .
The plates employed were of sheet-copper and sheet-zinc , and they were about six inches long , and three inches and a half wide .
The wires were of copper , one twentieth of an inch in diameter , and the same that had been used by Mr. Fox .
The tabular results of these experiments show that both the gra ?
nite and the tin vein at Rosewall Hill mine , and also the greenstone and the copper vein in that of Longclose , present unequivocal traces of electric currents , whether different parts of the same veins or various portions of the same rocks were examined .
It also appears , from these experiments , that the nature and posi ?
tions of the small metallic plates employed materially affect , not only the intensity , but in some cases also the directions of the currents ; and also that there is a considerable difference in the results when the same plates of metal are placed on different ingredients in the veins , even though these may be in immediate contact with each other .
