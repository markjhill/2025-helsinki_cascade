# The experiments described in this paper were undertaken in the hope of obtaining some light upon the vexed question of the condition in which a solid exists when dissolved in a liquid , and were directed more especially towards the investigation of the well-known remarkable phenomena exhibited by sodium sulphate .
402 Dr. W. A. Tilden .
Influence of Temperature [ June 18 Crystallised sodium sulphate melts at about 34 ' , and at this temperature the salt begins to show signs of dissociation by depositing the anhydrous compound .
According to Wiedemann , * indeed , indications of change are observable at a few degrees lower .
He finds by observation of the volume of the crystallised salt at different temperatures , that whereas slight expansion occurs from 17 ' to about 30 ' contraction then sets in , at first slowly , then , at 33 ' to 34 ' , very rapidly , till the salt melts .
The melted salt expands regularly in proportion as the temperature is raised to near 100 ' .
Wicolf has made experiments upon the expansion of solutions of the same salt , anti with similar results .
The solubility of sodium sulphate increases rapidly from ordinary temperatures up to 34 ' , when it attains a maximum .
Prom this point upwards the solubility again diminishes very rapidly to* between 40p and 50 ' , and then less rapidly , till at 100 ' to 160 ' it becomes nearly stationary .
At temperatures higher than 160 ' the solubility slowly increases again .
$ In 1874 it was observed by De CoppetS that heat is developed by contact of water with anhydrous sodium sulphate at temperatures considerably above 34 ' , at which point the ordinary hydrate is broken up .
This circumstance was attributed by Thomsen to the formation of a monohydrate , Na2S04.H20 , and he ascribed this composition to the crystals which are deposited on heating a concentrated solution of sodium sulphate , and which had always been believed to be anhydrous .
Thomsen 's assumption has , however , been shown to be groundless , || and therefore the fact noticed by De Cop pet remains without adequate explanation .
Below the temperature of 34 ' it seems probable that the sodium sulphate dissolved in water is in the state of hydrate , NajSC^lOHgO .
In what condition is it at temperatures higher than 34 ' ?
In other words , does the solution contain the usual hydrate or the anhydrous salt , or both ?
This is the question which I have endeavoured to attack by comparing the thermal changes attending the act of solution of the anhydrous salt in water at temperatures above this critical point with the corresponding change at temperatures below .
Some interesting results have been obtained , but they do not supply a final answer to this question .
My few earlier experiments , communicated in a short note to the British Association at Montreal , gave erroneous results , partly * * * S * " Pogg .

1885.1 on the Heat of Dissolution of Salts .
because I was then unaware of the existence of the allotropic modifications of anhydrous sulphate of sodium since discovered by Mr. Pickering ( loc.tit .
) , and partly from errors of experiments , which have sinco i been corrected .
The apparatus I have used consists of two parts , the calorimeter and the constant temperature bath .
The calorimeter is a brass drum I 9 cm .
high and 7 cm .
diameter , having a paddle which works in a i socket in the centre of the vessel , and the spindle of which passes ' through the lid .
At the top of the spindle is a reel , round which passes a silk cord , the ends of which are weighted and drawn over pulleys placed at a little distance on opposite sides .
By gently pulling the cord at either end the paddle is made to spin round .
Immediately above the blades of the paddle is a wide brass tube perforated with holes , and the bottom of which is immersed in the water , which is placed in the calorimeter .
In this tube is placed a thin glass bulb containing the weighed quantity of salt and sealed at the blowpipe .
Standing in the tube is a thin brass rod having a fork at the end to act as pulveriser , the top which projects through the lid of the calorimeter , being provided with a wooden handle .
The thermometer stands in a perforated tube on the opposite side of the calorimeter .
The cover of the calorimeter is provided with three holes , one for the stem of the thermometer , one in the centre for the paddle , and the third for the handle of the pulveriser .
The vessel is supported on three sharp boxwood points within a covered brass case silvered inside , the space between the calorimeter and the case being about 1 cm .
all round .
The bath employed for maintaining a constant temperature is practically identical with that described by Nicol , * but is provided with a well in the middle , into which fits closely the outer case of the calorimeter .
The temperature of the water or oil is remarkably constant , and when the temperature does not exceed 30 ' a thermometer in different parts of the bath does not vary by more than *05 ' .
To assist in maintaining this constancy the bath is covered closely , and is enveloped in thick felt .
Three thermometers were used\#151 ; A , from 8 ' to 26 ' C. , divided into twentieths ; B , from 25 ' to 50 ' , and 0 , from 42 ' to 76 ' , both divided into tenths Centigrade , and the temperature could easily be read to *005 ' and '01 ' respectively , or even half this .
The course of an experiment is as follows:\#151 ; The water having been introduced into the calorimeter , and the thermometer inserted into its tube , the whole is placed in an oven until the thermometer indicates a temperature about half a degree above that to which the bath has been previously heated .
The calorimeter is then put into the bath , the cover of the case is put on , and the thermometer read from time to time till the temperature is either quite stationary or is falling steadily at a rate which is recorded , and from which a correction can be intro-* " Phil. Mag. , " 1883 , 339 .
404 Dr. W. A. Tilden .
Influence of Temperature [ June 18 , duced into the observed result .
The glass bulb is then broken , and the paddle gently worked by one person whilst another reads the thermometer by the telescope .
In every case a definite interval ( usually one or two minutes ) is allowed to elapse before the final reading is taken , not only to allow time for solution , but for the alteration of temperature in the liquid to be imparted to the calori-meter .
In those cases in which the calorimeter had been in the bath for some time at a rather high temperature , and there was reason to fear that slight loss had occurred by evaporation , the whole was weighed after the experiment was concluded , and a correction introduced accordingly .
The amount thus lost never exceeded a gram or thereabouts , and as the thermal equivalent of the calorimeter and its contents amounted to 100 grams and upwards , the result is not appreciably affected .
In the accompanying tables the numbers contained in the column headed " Water equivalent of the calorimeter , " include the values of the calorimeter , the glass bulb , the thermometer , and the solution , the specific heat of which is taken generally from Thomsen 's numbers .
Three series of experiments were undertaken with sulphate of sodium , and the results are embodied in the three tables , A , B , and C. For A the salt had been heated to redness , not to fusion , about a fortnight before .
For B the salt had been heated to redness one day before .
For C the precipitated salt had been dried at 120 ' .
These varieties were taken on account of the differences in the heat of dissolution of sulphate of sodium which have been observed by Mr. Pickering ( loc. cit. ) .

2216 From these figures it appears that although the manner in which the salt has been prepared influences the result very notably , yet in each series , comparing together the effects of dissolving the same kind of anhydrous sodium sulphate , the heat of dissolution increases progressively with rise of temperature .
That this would he the case might be predicted by applying the principle originally indicated by Person , * and since discussed by Berthelotf and by Thomsen , J and embodied in the general equation Qt=Q*+U\#151 ; V , where QT and Q* are the quantities of heat evolved in the act of solution at the temperatures T ' and t ' , and U represents the sum of the capacities for heat of the salt and the water , and Y represents the capacity of the solution between the temperatures T ' and t ' .
The salt A must be regarded as being in the most stable condition of the three , and the following comparison of the numerical values of the thermal change observed and calculated , applies to the A series of experiments:\#151 ; U= ( 18n + C)(T\#151 ; f ) .

But the mean results show on the whole an increase in the heat of dissolution with rise of temperature .

409 Tn the solution of anhydrous carbonate and sulphate of sodium in water , evolution of heat occurs , and the amount of heat evolved increases with the temperature , but is not so great as would be inferred from the application of Person 's formula .
On the other hand , sulphate of potassium , the solution of which is attended by absorption of heat , gives a gradually diminishing absorption as the temperature is raised , but the observed absorption is greater at the higher temperature than the calculated amount .
That is to say , in all these cases , whether the act of solution is attended by rise or fall of temperature , there is a consumption of energy corresponding to an absorption of heat , which is not accounted for by the difference between the specific heats of the materials , and of the solution which results from their union .
From the connexion already established between fusibility and solubility , * and from a priori considerations , it seemed probable that the thermal change attending the solution of a solid must vary according as by raising the temperature the cohesion of the solid is diminished , or by lowering the temperature the cohesion is increased .
For if a salt dissolves in water with absorption of heat , this absorption will be less at higher temperatures when the cohesion of the solid has been reduced , and therefore the energy required for its liquefaction by the solvent also lessened .
On the other hand , if a salt dissolves with evolution of heat , the heat evolved must be greater at higher temperatures for the same reason .
Some very fusible salts were therefore taken in order to ascertain whether the difference between the observed and calculated heats of solution was notably greater or less than the difference observed in the case of the sodium carbonate and sulphate and potassium sulphates .

The observed and calculated numbers for potassium sulphate and nitrate and sodium nitrate are plotted out in the diagram below , where it is manifest that there is a difference between the two nitrates and the much less fusible and soluble sulphate .
For tracing up the abscissa for 45 ' , we see that the difference between the observed and calculated numbers for potassium sulphate amounts to upwards of 900 calories , whilst the corresponding difference in nitrate of sodium is only about 500 , and in nitrate of potassium about 700 .

I have made a few determinations of heat of solution of the crystallised sulphate and carbonate of sodium .
Whilst these salts dissolve at common temperatures , with great absorption of heat , the absorption at the melting point is very feeble , and at a few degrees higher is changed into evolution of heat .
This last-named effect is probably due to the fact that when heated beyond their melting point , 34 ' ( circa ) , these salts are partly deposited in a solid dehydrated state .

Winkehnann s experiments were directed towards the object of determining the specific heat of the solutions of these six salts .
One difficulty in the way of the general application of this method is the uncertainty attaching to the specific heats of the salts in the solid state , by reason of the variability of their properties according to the manner in which they have been prepared .

The process of dissolving a solid in a liquid must be considered as involving several distinct operations .
Person seems to have been the first to point out that the change of state from solid to liquid must * Thomsen 's figure at 18 ' is \#151 ; 18509 .

[ June 18 be distinguished from the intermixture of the liquefied solid with the water .
Both these acts must be attended by heat-absorption .
The dilution of watery solutions has been shown , especially by the researches of Thomsen , to be attended very generally by absorption of heat , notwithstanding that in most cases it is accompanied by contraction of volume , a process which must have an opposite effect .
In the solution of many anhydrous and even hydrated salts , we must believe , from the very energetic thermal change observed , that the salt enters into chemical union with a portion of the liquid .
The extent to which this combination occurs will be greatly influenced by the temperature at which the experiment is made , and at sufficiently elevated temperatures it must be believed to be entirely annulled whilst on the other hand , as the temperature is raised , chemical action , resulting in double decomposition between the water and constituents of the salt , becomes apparent .
This action , which is manifested in the case of the salts of the heavy metals by the production of insoluble oxides , hydroxides , or basic salts , cannot be supposed to be altogether without effect in the case of the salts of the alkali metals such as I have been examining , and I incline strongly to the belief that a part of the difference which I have pointed out between the observed heat of solution and the same calculated according to Person 's formula , is due to this decomposing action of the water .
It is manifest that no theory of solution can be accepted which does not take cognisance of all these facts .
In conclusion , I desire to acknowledge the intelligent assistance I have received in the conduct of these experiments from Mr. Harold P. White .

( Abstract .
) In the concluding sentence of the Bakerian Lecture which I had the honour to deliver before the Royal Society , May 31st , 1883,1 said that the new method of Radiant Matter Spectroscopy there described had not only given me spectrum indications of the presence of yttrium as an almost invariable , though very minute , constituent of a large number of minerals , but had likewise revealed signs of another spectrum-yielding element .
I stated that I had repeatedly seen indications of another very beautiful spectrum characterised by a strong red and a double orange band .
