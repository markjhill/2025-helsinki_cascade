] The construction of the instrument which forms the subject of this paper , is a material improvement on that of the horizontal floating collimator , of which an account was given by the author in the Philosophical Transactions for 1825 .
Its superiority is derived from its adaptation to the vertical instead of the horizontal position , by which the sources of error arising from the necessity of transferring the instrument to different sides of the observatory , and of taking the float out of the mercury and replacing it , at each observation , are wholly obviated .
The vertical floating collimator has the further advantage of being adapted for use , not only with a circle , but also with a telescope , either of the refracting or reflecting kind .
Such a telescope , furnished with a wire micrometer , and directed to the zenith , becomes a zenith telescope , free from all the objections to which the zenith sector , and the zenith telescope , with a plumb line , are liable .
The instrument itself is supported on a square mahogany stand , which slides on two parallel beams fixed at the upper part of the ob-
