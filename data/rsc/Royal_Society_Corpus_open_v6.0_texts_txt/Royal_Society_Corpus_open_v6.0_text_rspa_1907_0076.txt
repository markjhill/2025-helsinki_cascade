) The experimental investigations described had as their primary object the improvement of the Clark and cadmium cells as standards of electromotive force .
In the past many investigators have pointed out that the mercurous sulphate used as a depolariser may produce variations in the E.M.F. as great as 0'002 volt , and the first thing sought by us was a mode of manufacture of the sulphate which could be relied on to give a constant product .
We have prepared the salt in four ways : ( 1 ) Electrolytically ( the method is due to Carhart and Hulett , and Wolff ) ; ( 2 ) by chemical precipitation , mercurous nitrate being added to sulphuric acid ; ( 3 ) by the recrystallisation of purchased samples of mercurous sulphate from strong sulphuric acid ; and ( 4 ) by the action of fuming sulphuric acid on mercury .
The mean value of the cells set up with the electrolytic salt is 1'01828 volts ; * with the sulphate prepared by ( 2 ) the E.M.F. is 1'01830 volts ; ( 3 ) gives P01832 volts , and ( 4 ) gives P01831 volts .
We conclude that the mode of manufacture of the depolariser is immaterial , provided that certain conditions are observed , and our guiding principle in the manufacture of the salt and the preparation of the paste is to prevent hydrolysis by keeping the salt in contact with dilute sulphuric acid ( 1 to 6 ) or with saturated cadmium sulphate solution .
The effect of the size of the crystals of the depolariser , to the importance of which attention has been called by H. v. Steinwehr , was investigated by using crystals of various sizes and measuring the E.M.F. of the cells in which they were inserted .
Twenty samples of the salt were examined under the microscope , and in 12 cases microphotographs were taken , the magnification being 250 .
The uniformity in the size of the crystals is most marked in samples prepared by method ( 2 ) , and this is recommended as a standard method of preparation of the salt .
In general , the crystals varied in size from 5 to 30 microns , and we conclude that no large crystals of mercurous * The E.M.F. is given in terms of the ampere ( 10_1 C.G.S. , measured by the .Ayrton-Jones ampere balance ) and the international ohm .
On the Normal Weston Cadmium sulphate which are sufficiently soluble to act as an efficient depolariser can give an E.M.F. appreciably lower than that due to crystals from o to 30 microns long .
A very large proportion of the cells dealt with have not varied in E.M.F. by more than two parts in 100,000 since the first month of their preparation , and some of the cells are nearly three years old .
A few abnormal cells have fallen in E.M.F. by about 25 parts in 100,000 , but the depolariser in these is of a peculiar colour and suggests hydrolysis of the salt .
The recuperative power of the cadmium cell was tested by short-circuiting different cells for 1 minute , 5 minutes , 5 hours , and 5 days .
The recovery in each case was very rapid .
The lag of E.M.F. with temperature is very small , and the temperature coefficient for the range , 10 ' C. to 30 ' C. , is given by the following equation:\#151 ; Et E17 \#151 ; 3-45x 10-50-17)\#151 ; 0-066 x 10-5(\#163 ; -17)2 .
This is in very good agreement with the formula given by the Reichsanstalt .
