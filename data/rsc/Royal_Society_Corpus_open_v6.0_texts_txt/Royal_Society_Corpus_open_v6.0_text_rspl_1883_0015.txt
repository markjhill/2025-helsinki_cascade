76 On the Order of Reversibility of the Lithium Lines .
[ Mar. 8 , irregularity in the width of the lines , the effect resembles that of an outburst of hydrogen in the solar atmosphere .
The elements of the water are , as we must suppose , separated in the arc , but from the explosive character of the effect they are not uniformly distributed in the arc .
The arc being horizontal and the image of it projected on to the slit of the spectroscope , it was really a very small section of the arc which was under observation , and this renders the variation in the width of the lines the more remarkable .
Ill. " Note on the Order of Reversibility of the Lithium Lines .

Received March 1 , 1883 .
In our communications on the reversal of the lines of metallic vapours , we have several times noticed ( " Proc. Roy .
Soc. , " vol. 28 , pp. 357 , 369 , 473 ) the reversal of the lithium lines , and concluded that ; the blue line is more easily reversed than the orange line .
This , however , does not appear to be really the case .
When much lithium is introduced into the arc , a second blue line is developed close to but slightly more refrangible than the well-known blue line .
This second blue line produces with the other the appearance of a reversal , which deceived us until we became aware of the existence of the second line .
The blue line ( wave-length 4604 ) is really reversed without difficulty when sufficient lithium is present , but under these circumstances the orange line is also reversed .
The latter line is also the one which first ( of the two ) shows reversal , and also the one which is more persistently reversed .
Hence we place the lines in order of reversibility as follows : red , orange , blue , green , violet .
