Upon the lymphatics of muscle they find the peculiar serous cells first described by Ludwig and Schweigger Seidel , whose ews ey the full confirm , in opposition to those expressed by Banvier .
They deny the existence of stomata in the Mammalia , but admit it in the case of frogs ; and as the peritoneum of the latter is lined by crenated lymphatic eudothelium , they admit its connexion with the lymphatic system ; but , on ccount of the absence of the latter endothelium as well as stomata from the serous cavities of mammals , they deny any connexion between these and the lymphatics .
While describing the structure of basement , they discuss the facts adduced by Klein and Debove as bearmg on the question of orption , and their own on this question .
They hold that the surface of the diaphragm is exuding one , only an absorbent one when all the are reversed .
They describe the minute anatomy of the lymphatics of the intest no , and show that it is the glandular structures , and not the muscles of the wall , that regulate the mount of these vessels .
They also trace complete identity between these and the lymphatics of striated muscle .
In either case they figure the connective-tissue cavities as forming the radicles of the lymphatics , but hold these are not the only lymphatic afferents , nor that that is their only function .
To prove this , they discuss the nature of these cavities , as thsy have discovered them tendon and other gelatinous structures in different classes of animals to be of the same as in the cornea .
Unlike man , the small mammals have no special vascular or lympbatic vessels in the peritoneal tissue , being dependent on the muscles below for those structures .
The authors finish by entering upon a minute description of th technique employed by them , and offer a series of about 60 camera-lucida ings of preparations in their possession in ] lstratlon o er thei researches .

In the cases of 3 , , also of 487 , , we are unable to show why the Period itself is , in each case , divisible by the Prime .
But we show , with little labour , that the period arising from is itself divisible by 487 , and therefore that The number composed of 486 is divisible by 487 .
Now this number 552 Mr. W. Shanks on .
[ Feb. 15 , is made up of the two factors 243 and .
The latter divisible by487 .
The latter , moreover , admits of the factor 1000 . .
001 being thrown out , as 487 is not exactly contained in it .
We thns have the number , which may be shown to be divisible by , as follows:\mdash ; ; hence Therefore 486 .
Again , .
Hence , that is We may show that in another way , thus:\mdash ; , as before , the numbers 99 .
819 , and dividing the nines by 487 , we have remainder 232 .
Hence , after 232 , by dividing by 487 , the lotient is 232 times the first half .
Divide first half of quotient by 487 , and we have ltI0 .
Hence Remainder from is got from ; hcnce .
In other words , the quotient obtained from dividing the large number ( given above ) , consisting of 162 digits , by 487 is ] divisible by 487 .
It is observable that 486 is an aliquot part of , that is divisible by The Prime ; but , as is usual , .

We append the results of these divisions , as being curious , the last result being prime or otherwise .
