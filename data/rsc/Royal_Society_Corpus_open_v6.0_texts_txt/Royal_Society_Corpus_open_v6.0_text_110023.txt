] At the commencement of this paper Dr. Marcet , after adverting to the conclusions at which he arrived in some former researches communicated to this Society , notices the extraordinary assertions of Rouelle and of Proust respecting the existence of mercury in sea water .
By a very careful examination , however , of bay salt , he was unable to detect the smallest trace of that metal ; nor did he find it in a sample of Sel de Gabelle obtained from Calais for the purpose of examination .
Dr. Marcet next examined sea water , with a view of ascertaining whether any nitrates are present in it : with this view he added sulphiuric acid and gold leaf to the concentrated bittern , and boiled the mixture , but the metal was not in the least acted on ; when , however , the smallest quantity of nitre was added , the gold was instantly dissolved .
Hence the absence of nitric salts in sea water may be inferred .
In examining some of the same bittern for earthy and metallic salts , the author found that neither alkalies nor their carbonates throw down anything but magnesia , and that no muriate of lime appears in any case to be present .
Selenite and carbonate of lime were , however , found in the matters deposited during the first evaporation of the transparent and pure sea water .
When sea water is evaporated to dryness , and the residue submitted to distillation at a red heat , Dr. Marcet found that a portion of sal-ammoniac sublimed .
Lastly , he observes , that no sulphate of soda is discoverable in sea water , but that it affords , on evaporation along with other salts , certain rhombic crystals , which are triple sulphate of potash and magnesia .
