[ June 12 the fact that excitation of any one point elicited rarely more than one movement and only of one segment , e.g. , simple flexion of the elbow .
Consequently , any sequence of movement or march was conspicuously infrequent .
Finally , the character of each movement and its localisation was recorded .
After the cortex had been removed , we proceeded to stimulate the fibres of the internal capsule , and the results obtained confirmed those obtained from the bonnet monkey , and at the same time showed the relative position of the cprtical areas .
The internal capsule was exposed by removing half of one hemisphere by a horizontal section ; the outlines of the basal ganglia were then transferred to paper ruled with squares of 1 millimetre , and the resulting movement obtained by stimulating each of these squares contained in the internal capsule was recorded .
The movements obtained correspond generally with the results which we have in another paper presented to the Royal Society and read on December 12 , 1889 .

Ox Bile and Pancreatic Extract .
In a previous communication* we have pointed out that in the pig the presence of bile or bile salts hastens the digestion of starch by pancreatic extract , the amount of dextrine and of sugar being considerably and proportionately increased .
The same holds good for ox bile salts and extract of ox pancreas , so far at least as the increase in the amount of sugar is concerned , and for human bile and pancreatic extract ( pig 's ) .
Experiments were conducted in the same manner as those with pig 's secretions .
In one experiment four vessels , A , B , C , D , containing 100 c.c. distilled water in which 2 grams of starch had been boiled , were taken .
To B 2 per cent. , and to C 4 per cent. , of ox bile salts were added and dissolved .
Equal quantities of glycerine extract of pancreas were added to A , B , and C , * ' Roy .

161 and the four vessels kept at a temperature of 40 ' C. At the end of seven minutes there was a marked difference between A and B and C in their reaction to a solution of iodine : A gave a deep blue-purple , B and C a red-purple .
At the end of thirteen minutes C gave a faint red colour , B a red-purple , while A gave the same purple colour as after seven minutes .
No change occurred in D. The solutions were then boiled and the amount of sugar in A , B , and C estimated as dextrose by Fehling 's method j\#151 ; A contained 0526 per cent. , B 0 649 per cent. , and 0 0'675 per cent. The experiment was varied by using an active powdered pig 's pan-creatin , manufactured by Savory and Moore .
Four vessels were used , each containing 50 c.c. of distilled water in which 1 gram of starch had been boiled .
To B 1 per cent , and to C 2 per cent , of ox bile salts were added and dissolved .
To A , B , and 0 , pancreatin 0T5 gram was added ; D was reserved as a control .
The mixture was digested for seven minutes in a water-bath at 45 ' C. ; at the end of this time A struck a blue-purple colour with iodine , B a dirty red-purple , and C gave only a trace of red colour .
The amount of dextrose was estimated by Fehling 's method with the following result:\#151 ; A contained 03846 per cent. , B 071429 percent .
, and C 0'833 per cent. Ox bile salts and human bile have , therefore , the same property as pig 's bile and bile salts ; they augment the amylolytic action of the pancreatic amylopsin on starch .
Bile salts consist , of a mixture , in varying proportions , of the alkaline ( chiefly sodium ) salts of taurocholic and glycocholic acid .
In human bile , and that of most mammals , as well as in birds and amphibians , taurocholates are most abundant ; in the pig , glycocholates .
Experiments were therefore made separately with glycocholate and taurocholate of soda .
Taurocholate of Soda.\#151 ; The salt used was a commercial product and contained some bile pigment .
Four vessels , each containing 100 c.c. of distilled water in which 2 per cent , of starch had been boiled , were taken : to A 1 gram , to B 2 grams , to C 3 grams , and to B 4 grams of the taurocholate were added ; 0'8 gram pancreatin was then introduced into each , and the mixture digested at a temperature of 37 for a quarter of an hour .
Tested by the colour struck with solution of iodine , D had been more changed than C , 0 than B , and B than A. The amount of dextrose estimated by Fehling 's method was A 0'8G9 per cent. , B 1*0 per cent. , C 1'05 per cent. , and D 1T1 per cent. In another experiment the effect of 1 and of 3 per cent , of the tauroeholate were contrasted with each other and with the effect of pancreatin alone .
Digestion was continued for ten minutes at a temperature of 40\#151 ; 41 ' C. , and the mixture then boiled ; that containing no taurocholate contained 0'909 per cent , dextrose , that containing 1 per cent , of taurocholate contained Fill per cent , dextrose , Drs. S. Martin and D. Williams .
[ June 12 , and that to which 3 per cent , of taurocholate had been added con .
tained 1*2424 per cent , dextrose .
Glycocholic Acid.\#151 ; The addition of pure glycocholic acid in the proportion of 05 per cent , arrested digestion of starch by pancreatin ; probably because of the acidity of the mixture .
Glycocholate of Soda.\#151 ; A weighed quantity of pure glycocholic acid was dissolved in distilled water and neutralised with anhydrous carbonate of sodium .
Four vessels , each containing an equal quantity of distilled water in which 1 per cent , of starch had been boiled , were taken : to B 1 per cent , of glycocholic acid by weight neutralised with Na2C03 , and to C 2 .
per cent , of glycocholic acid neutralised by the same salt were added .
Equal quantities of pancreatin were added to A , B , and C ; D being reserved as a control .
The mixtures were digested for seven minutes at 37 ' to 38 ' C. The colour struck with with iodine solution by C was then red , by B purple-red , and by A purple .
Digestion was then stopped by boiling and the quantity of dextrose estimated by Fehling 's method r A contained 0'357 per cent. , B 0*476 per cent. , 0 0*588 per cent. Glycocoll , Leucin , and Tyrosin.\#151 ; Glyeoeholic acid is formed by the conjunction of glycocoll and cholalic acid , glycocoll itself being amido-acetic acid .
Leucin and tyrosin , the end-products of pancreatic digestion , are also amido-acids , leucin being amido-caproic acid , and tyrosin , oxyphenyl-amido-propionic acid .
Glycocoll was found to be without any effect upon the pancreatic digestion of starch .
Leucin appeared to interfere to some extent with pancreatic digestion of starch ; thus , in one experiment , in which 0*5 per cent , of pure leucin was added to a starch mixture and digested with pancreatin for twelve minutes , the amount of sugar estimated as dextrose was 0*526 per cent. , while the amount in a similar mixture digested for the same time without leucin was 0*645 per cent. Tyrosin also appeared to interfere slightly with pancreatic digestion of starch .
Thus , in one experiment three vessels were taken , each containing 100 c.c. of distilled water in which 1 gram of starch bad been boiled ; to flask B 0*05 gram of pure tyrosin and to flask C 01 gram tyrosin were added ; the three mixtures\#151 ; A , to which no tyrosin was added , B , and C\#151 ; were then digested for nine minutes with equal quantities of pancreatin .
At the end of five minutes the colour struck with iodine solution varied , A giving a reddish-purple , C and D a bluish-purple ; at the end of eight minutes the colour with A was almost pure red , with B and C still a bluish-purple .
The quantity of sugar estimated as dextrose by Fehling 's method was as follows:\#151 ; A 0*383 per cent. , B 0*345 per cent. , and 0 0*333 per cent. Owrbonate of Sodium.\#151 ; Carbonate of sodium , when present in the proportion of 0*25 per cent , and over , retards nancreatic digestion of 1890 .

163 starch .
By experiments conducted as those above detailed , we have found that this retardation occurs also in the presence of bile salts , although it is not so great as with the carbonate alone .
In one experiment four vessels were taken , each containing distilled water in which 2 per cent , starch had been boiled , and 1 per cent , bile salts subsequently added and dissolved , to B 0'25 percent .
Na2C03 , to C 0*5 per cent. Na2C03 , and to D 1 per cent. Na2C03 .
The mixtures were digested with equal quantities of pancreatin for nine minutes at 39 ' C. , boiled , and neutralised .
The amount of dextrose as estimated by Fehling 's method , was :\#151 ; In A 0*83 per cent. ; in B 0'55 per cent. ; in C 0492 per cent. ; in D 03773 per cent. Even in the presence of an excess of carbonate of sodium , however , the addition of bile salts does favour the progress of pancreatic digestion of starch , as shown by the following experiment .
Four vessels , each containing equal quantities of distilled water in which 2 per cent , of starch had been boiled , were taken ; to B and D 1 per cent , bile salts were added and dissolved , to C and D 05 per cent , carbonate of sodium was added and dissolved .
The mixtures were digested with equal quantities of pancreatin for 11 minutes at a temperature of 37 ' C. , and then boiled and neutralised .

Experiments were also made to test the influence of bile on pancreatic proteolytic digestion .
Bile Salts.\#151 ; The fluid to be digested was made by diluting egg-albumen with distilled water , agitating , neutralising with acetic acid , and straining the resultant mixture through muslin .
Measured quantities of this albuminous fluid were at the time of experiment coagulated by heat and one or two drops of acetic acid ; the digestion was conducted in the same vessel as coagulation was effected .
Experiment I.\#151 ; Three beakers , A , B , and 0 , each containing 120 c.c. of diluted egg-albumen , coagulated in the manner above described , were taken , and to each was added 1 per cent , of sodic carbonate ; to A 2 per cent , of bile salts of the pig was added and dissolved ; to A and B 1 gram of pig 's pancreatic extract rich in proteolytic ferment was added , and all three beakers placed in a warm chamber at 35 ' C. , and digested for three hours .
The albumen in A at the end of that time appeared to be much more digested than that in B ; that in C was unchanged .
The fluids were then rapidly boiled , to stop all 164 On the Influence of Bile on Pancreatic Digestion .
[ June 12 , ferment action .
A contained a deep yellow-coloured turbid fluid , with a slight flocculent white precipitate ; B a light yellow-coloured turbid fluid with copious white precipitate .
The three mixtures were then filtered through double , balanced filters , and the filter washed , first with boiling distilled water , then with boiling methylated spirit , and finally with absolute alcohol .
The filters were then dried at 120 ' C. and weighed .
A , the fluid which contained bile salts , yielded a residue weighing 0*150 gram .
B , the fluid which did not contain bile salts , yielded a residue weighing 0*536 gram .
0 , which was not digested , gave a residue weighing 1*256 grams .
Experiment II.\#151 ; In this a larger proportion of bile salts was used , and digestion was conducted at a higher temperature .
Equal quantities of egg-albumen diluted with distilled water were introduced into three beakers , A , B , and C , and coagulated by heat and a few drops of acetic acid ; 1 per cent , of sodium carbonate was added to each , and to A 3 per cent , of pig 's bile salts ; to A and B 1 per cent , of pancreatic extract rich in proteolytic ferment was added , and the mixture digested at about 40 ' C. for three hours ... The fluids were then boiled , and subsequently filtered , the precipitates being washed and dried as in Experiment I. The weights were as follows :\#151 ; A , the fluid which contained bile salts , yielded a residue weighing O'098 gram .
B , the fluid which did not contain bile salts , yielded a residue weighing 0*665 gram .
0 , the fluid which was not digested , yielded a residue weighing 1*062 grams .
Glycocholate of Soda.\#151 ; The effect of glycoholate of soda appeared to be less marked than that of the bile salts as a whole .
Thus , in experiments conducted in the same manner as those above described , a small portion of glycocholate of soda appeared to have the effect of slightly increasing the amount of albumen dissolved , while a somewhat larger proportion either had a slightly contrary effect or noneat all .
In one experiment equal quantities of albumen were taken , and glycocholic acid , * 0*5 per cent. , added to one vessel ( C ) , and 1*0 per cent , to another vessel ( D ) , while none was added , to a third vessel ( B ) , and the three fluids were then digested with pancreatin for two hours .
A fourth vessel was retained as control .
The fluids were filtered through balanced filter papers , and the filter washed with distilled water , boiling methylated spirit , and absolute alcohol# and dried at 110 ' C. The weights of the residues were as follows :\#151 ; * The acid was neutralised with Xa2C03 .
