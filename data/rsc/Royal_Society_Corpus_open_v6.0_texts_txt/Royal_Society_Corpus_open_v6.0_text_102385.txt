V. An Account of the Damage that happened in the Isle of Portland the Third of February , 1695/ 6 .
Communicated by the Honourable Sir Robert Southwell , F. R. S. THE Great Peer is quite demolished and filled up with Rubbish , and the Rocks that lay about 40 Yards off in the Sea at the Peer-head , are risen above Water ; so that there is no hopes of making good that Peer again .
And the ways leading to that Peer from the Quarry , are turned upside down , and sunk at several Places about Thirty Foot .
Also the Way leading to the North-Peer , called the little Peer , is under the same Circumstances , and the Peer cracked in several Places ; which Peer with some Charge may be repaired .
The Earth is slid into the Sea between the Two Peers , near 100 Yards , and is yet working off into the Sea , whereby the Island is damnisied several Thousand Pounds , besides the Number of Poor People that depended upon their daily Labour in the Quarry , the Work ceasing till Reparation be made , and continues yet dreadful to behold .
Which , as is conjectured , proceeded from a great Quantity of Rub~ , thrown over the Cliff , upon a Clayish Foundation , that the Violence of Rain made soft , and gave way , and not by Earthquake , as some Report .
