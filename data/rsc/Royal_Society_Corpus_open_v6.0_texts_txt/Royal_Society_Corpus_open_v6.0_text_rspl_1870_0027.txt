225 affects the coast stations ; and attributes this to the want of more complete knowledge of the contour of the surface , both above and below the sea-level , in these parts .
But his own method , in the case m\#151 ; 50 , remarkably reduces the effects of local attraction at stations on the arc of meridian and out at sea ( in Minicoy , an island 250 miles west of Cape Comorin or Punnse ) ; for the sensible negative quantity at Damargida and positive quantity at Kalianpur indicate a deficiency of matter below the first and an excess below the second , which exactly tally with the results independently brought out by relative deflections of the plumb-line as obtained by the survey : and the two large and most important effects , negative at Kaliana and positive at Minicoy , may be said to be almost annihilated by this method of correction .
This last case of an excess of gravity out at sea ( where the surrounding ocean has a deficiency of matter ) being explained by his method , he regards as a very strong argument in its favour .
And he finishes by saying that if his method is thus far successful in the particular supposition of the distribution below , whether in excess or defect , being uniform , which is most likely not strictly the case , there is every reason for concluding that pendulum-observations give support to the hypothesis regarding the Constitution of the Earth 's Crust , when viewed on a large scale , admitting of local peculiarities , like the deficiency of matter near Damargida and the excess near Kalianpur , and the similar deficiency near Moscow .

" Actinometrical Observations made at Dehra and Mussoorie in India , October and November 1869 , in a Letter to the President .
" By Lieut. J. H. N. Hennessey .
Communicated by the President .
Received September 7,1870 .
Mussoorie , July 22,1870 .
My dear Sir , \#151 ; In continuation of my last communication , dated April 25 , 1870 , I have now the pleasure to forward the actinometrical observations taken , during portions of October and November 1869 , with the instruments of the Royal Society , and in compliance with the suggestions which the Committee of the Society made for my benefit .
( 2 ) The two actinometers are of the kind invented by the Rev. G. C. Hodgkinson , and described by him in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , No. 89 , vol. xv .
Further description or allusion is therefore unnecessary , unless I add that the instrument is easily and accurately worked after but moderate practice , and that it is little liable to accident if rolled up in a padded sheet and packed within its own metal tube .
It , however , imposes sensible drawbacks , from the delays incurred in throwing off a suitable amount of fluid into the chamber ; and as this adjustment becomes deranged by any considerable alteration in the radiation , it is impossible to VOL. XIX .
T Lieut. Hennessey on Actinometrical [ Dec. 22 , continue a series of observations for any lengthened period ( as , say , two hours ) without introducing breaks of several minutes in its continuity .
( 3 ) The two instruments used have been lettered by the observers A and B. The glasses , too , have been suitably marked as suggested by Sir John Herschel in the 'Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.* Actino-meter B was used at Dehra by Mr. W. H. Cole , M.A. , whose observations in sun and shade number 405 in all .
The observations at Mussoorie were made by myself with actinometer A ; they are 315 in number .
And as respects the chronometers , barometers , and thermometers employed , I need hardly add that these instruments were of a superior order and well verified , or that they are in ordinary use at the head-quarters of Colonel Walker , R.E. , Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India .
( 4 ) And with every facility for reading the last-named instruments , I regret having omitted to arrange for a more frequent reading of the barometer , and that the wet- and drv-bulb thermometers were not recorded .
It , however , so happened that during the days of observation in October and November last the sky was beautifully clear , with the trifling exceptions noted in the records of observations ; and there is no reason to suppose that any sudden changes occurred in the hygrometric conditions of the atmosphere .
In future , however , when the actinometers can again be worked , more numerous readings of the barometer and thermometers will be dulyfrecorded .
( 5 ) The stations of observation were Mussoorie and Dehra .
The direct distance between them is about nine miles .
The former stands on one of the southernmost ranges of the Himalayas ; the latter is in the valley Dehra , or Dehra Dhoon .
The hypsometrical elements for these stations , given in the result-abstract and elsewhere , are taken from the records of the Trigonometrical Survey of India .
It appears from these values that Mussoorie station is above that at Dehra about 4700 feet .
( 6 ) The procedure agreed on between Mr. Cole and myself was to observe daily a simultaneous series at 1 lh 40m a.m. ( mean of all the observed times ) , another series at noon , and a third at 0h 20m p.m. , the reckoning being in apparent time .
The slight deviations from these times which appear*in the result-abstract are due to little accidental causes almost inseparable from simultaneous work .
After four days of these series , each observer was to determine the amount of heat stopped by the glass of his instrument employed .
In these experiments I was too busy otherwise to reciprocate Mr. Cole 's observations of November I. On the 3rd of November , however , we both observed the intended succession of groups ( nearly ) j so that several of these are made to discharge a double duty , and are introduced in the after-discussion of relative radiation .
On November 4 we each obtained a complete hourly series about the hours of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. These results terminated for the time the reciprocal series of observations Mussoorie-Dehra .
Subsequently , in April 1870 , when we were Observations in India .
1870 .
] both at Dehra , we carefully compared the two actinometers A and B together .
This was the only occasion during all our observations when light clouds occasionally passed over the sun .
But as the two instruments were set up within 3 or 4 feet of one another , and as we both used the same chronometer and read our scales at the same instant of time , there appears no reason why the results should not be accurate , relatively speaking .
( 7 ) The constants thus determined are as follows :\#151 ; Actinometer A Factor No. 1 , to convert readings with glass on into readings glass off .

H. N. H. at A)= II . .
( J. H.N. H. at B)-(W .
H. C. at A)=17 .
The accordance of these two average differences shows that no sensible " personal equation " appeared to exist between the observers .
( 8 ) The observations simultaneous at Mussoorie and Dehra were , in the first instance , separated into groups , and combined group by group for a result .
Subsequently groups were formed so as to include all the observations taken , subject to the following conditions :\#151 ; Seven ( or fewer ) sun-observations , with the intermediate observation in shade , were combined to produce one result .
Fight sun-observations , with the intermediate observations in shade , gave t 2 228 Lieut. Hennessey on Actinometrical [ Dec. 22 , groups of 5 and 4 sun-observations respectively ( those in shade are here understood ) , the fifth sun being common to both groups .
Nine ditto , ditto , gave 5 and 5 .
Ten ditto , ditto , gave 6 and 5 .
Eleven ditto , ditto , gave 5 , 4 , and 4 ; and so on .
( 9 ) The mean results by each group were next all corrected for excess of temperature above 32 ' Fahr. , the Table of expansion for alcohol by Kopp , given in Gmelin 's * Chemistry , ' being employed for this purpose .
After this step the results by A were entered in the result-abstract Table and the corresponding values , in terms of A glass found by means of factor No. 1 .
The results by B were further corrected in the record of observations by means of factor No. 3 .
Being now in terms of A glass on , they were introduced into the result-abstract Table , and there reduced to A glass off , by means of factor No. 1 .
( 10 ) Thus the result-abstract Table contains the values obtained by each actinometer expressed in terms of A glass on as well as glass off .
The latter values are those made use of in projecting the actinometric curves , and in the discussion of the observations .
The former values will be useful should the Royal Society see fit to send me a third actinometer whose constant for reduction to the Kew standard has been duly ascertained .
At present the required relation is wanting ; for though Professor Stokes was so exceedingly kind as to visit Kew with the object of getting the actinometers A and B verified , the necessary observations could not be made from want of time .
( 11 ) Turning , now , to the diagram of actinometric curves and to the result-abstract Table , it is readily seen that the solar radiation decreases from some time about apparent noon both towards sunrise and sunset .
This hour-angle change is least perceptible for some +1 hour ( or less ) from noon\#151 ; a condition which indicates that observations for relative or absolute intensity are most valuable when made during this interval .
Indeed even desultory observations might acquire importance by being restricted to these hours , the absence of cloud , mist , haze , or other abnormal interposition being always supposed .
( 12 ) But besides the hour-angle change , the intensity is liable to rises and falls brought about in only a few minutes of time .
Any observer who has used the instrument could venture to affirm that these fluctuations are not due to fallibility of observation .
Whether their magnitude varies with that of the intensity or otherwise may be a matter of interest to ascertain ; and to this end series of observations , continued for as long a period as the construction of the instruments will permit , appear desirable .
( 13 ) Again , there is a change of intensity from day to day , apparently not due to alteration in the sun 's declination , so that the average daily curve ( about noon ) is higher or lower without any visible reason .
It is interesting to notice that this daily change was common to Mussoorie and 1870 .

In other words , the radiation at the lower station increases more rapidly than at the upper ; and while at both stations the change is more rapid in the afternoon than in the forenoon , the relative change between forenoon and afternoon is greatest at the lower station .
